HOC HOC-BW 2.27 " In my opinion, the bank should take this ideal opportunity to claim free advertising. I'm sure they would be happy to pay a top marketing company a similar price for a really effective ad campaign and who could refuse to join a bank that is so generous? A tongue-in-cheek advertisement relating to the incident could increase their business greatly and I'm sure Mr Hickey, if allowed to keep the money, would be happy to give them a glowing reference!      We seem to be missing the point here. If the above story is complete, I suspect Mr Hickey is not keeping hold of the cash because he believes he is entitled to do so, but rather because he quite rightly feels aggrieved at being clapped in irons for honestly reporting the mistake in the first place. Surely the Spanish police only arrested him at the behest of the bank, why else would they care? Yes, he should give the cash back, but he should receive substantial compensation for wrongful arrest and detention. The debate should not be anything to do with the actual accounting error, but rather Mr Hickey's treatment.      Where money is concerned honesty is always best. When my bank made an error I told them straight away. Once I found a wallet stuffed with money, I took it to the police station and later an old gent called at my house and gave me a reward.      In my opinion, the fact that the bank had the audacity to put at the bottom of the transaction slip that it was not responsible for any errors makes the money his. That statement is to protect themselves. If the error had been in their favour and he had tried to get recompense he would have no chance. The bank should try to recover the money from the person who made the mistake.      Having had a bank pay someone elses wages into my account whilst an impoverished student, I can understand the blunder. However, the thought of keeping the money never crossed my mind! Mr. Hickey would have soon complained if the mistake was to his detriment!      It is undeniable that the money was put in the bank as the result of a request for an exchange transaction. Therefore there is a contract to supply Mr Hickey with the amount exchanged at whatever rate was agreed at the time of the transaction. If Mr hickey agreed to receive some money at a given rate then that is the only money the bank has a duty to supply him with. Having made the error and pointed it out to Mr Hickey the bank must then enter into a new arrangement with Mr hickey to cover the return of their money. Mr Hickey would of course be perfectly entitled to charge them any amount he deems reasonable for his entire costs and time spent sorting out their mess. I don't know what Mr Hickey's hourly rate is, lawyers can charge hundreds of pounds per hour, but his time spent under arrest and in court will only increase the charges to the bank.      If I make a MISTAKE in my budgets for the month and go overdrawn by accident, some might say by MISTAKE, the bank are very keen to jump on me and charge #25 just for a letter telling me this. Am I able to have them arrested? No. This bank has also made a ""MISTAKE."" They should learn their lesson by it (as should the entire banking industry) and live with the consequences. After all, we all have to.      I've had dealings with UK banks when they have made mistakes against me. Even when I've proved to them with receipts etc, they still refused to give me back money that was mine (which they had removed in error from my account). I had to take them to the ombudsmen before getting the money back. I say good on Mr Hickey for standing his ground. At the very least if it ends up going against him, they should compensate for his arrest since it was their fault in the first place. He should also keep any interest to (have you EVER tried obtaining lost interest from a bank after they have made a mistake).      I think that he should return the money as it doesn't belong to him. However, the bank concerned should also give him a good-will payment as its own terms stated that it wasn't responsible for any mistakes.      I have had a similar experience, but involving the smaller some of around #10,000. It occurred when transferring funds from my account in Switzerland to my private account in Spain. I asked the bank to transfer Pts 30,000 but they transferred SFr. 30,000. I discovered the mistake when going to make a withdrawal from the Swiss account and was told that I was SFr. 29,000 in deficit. The bank realised the mistake and asked me if I would please return the money, which of course I did, as should Mr Hickey.      Keep it!! They have said that they cannot be held responsible for errors made by the bank. I know someone who paid a bill to the bank on time, only to receive a letter the following week saying he had not paid and that the bank would charge him #25 for the error. He wrote a letter back, saying that if they check their records they will see that he has paid and that he charged them #25. The error was corrected and he did receive #25!      Of course the monies should be returned as it was transferred in error. Barclays once remitted over 400,000 into my account and were quick to take it back. They were right to do so however wonderful on the bank statement!      I recently received #1,300 into my bank account and having just started a new job presumed it was my first month's wages due at around the same time. I found it puzzling that I had not received a payslip however and found out that the money had in fact been paid in by another company. I have no idea who they are and why they paid me the money, I have contacted my bank to try and find out where the money has come from but after a 5 day wait while they went through their retrieval system, they tell me they can't reveal any details because of the Data Protection Act.      I am prepared to give the money back when asked but until then, it will stay in a savings account garnering interest. But I like the idea of Mr Hickey charging the bank an administrative charge - it seems the only way he can get something out of the whole fiasco.      Not only would I give money back that wasn't mine, I have. I got more cash out of a cash machine than I asked for or was on my receipt. The only thing to do was to call the bank to explain what happened, and have them deduct it from my account. The money was not mine, and I could not keep it. It doesn't matter what the amount, the principle is the same. Stealing is wrong. I do think that honesty should be rewarded, but not necessarily monetarily. A letter of gratitude is enough. In this world, trust is all we really have with each other in the end. Let's keep that trust, and the hope that comes with it, alive!      Bank error in your favour - so goes the monopoly chance card. Good luck to Mr Hickey. Has everyone seen the charges banks levy, like charging customers for using a competitor's cash machine. They can afford this loss.      Give it back? No Way. Only when ""I made a mistake"" becomes an acceptable excuse for being overdrawn, or not paying your credit card bill, should he give it back. Legally, if his receipt says the bank is not responsible for any errors, then tough. I feel for the person who made the mistake, but rules are rules, moral or not.      It should be remembered that an individual made a mistake, an administrative error. It happens. The money should be returned.      Having been the victim of a well-known bank's errors many times in the past, and having been charged for their mistakes, which took a long time to rectify, I'd say good luck, quickly transfer the money to another account, and enjoy it.      If the bank were to have deducted money from his account by mistake Mr Hickey would have demanded it back plus compensation. So he should repay the bank the money back less 1 percent.      A similar situation happened to me when I was in Germany. I was given 300 pounds worth of DM when I only handed in 150 pounds worth (not quite a quarter of a million). Once I realised my mistake I did bring the money back. However, it was touch and go, I was very tempted to spend it. But I think the right thing was to give it back.      He should return the money, of course. But he should also retain a percentage, say 10%, for the emotional stress involved in being arrested for someone else's mistake.      I think this man will eventually be forced to give up the cash, after all the laws are there to protect the banks. I would definitely return the cash to its rightful owner, but much like this guy is doing I'd make them jump through hoops first and then say pretty pleeeease.      Do the right thing - give the money back      This guy needs a lawyer as Spanish law may dictate what happens. A foreign country (Ireland) made the error and what recourse they might have in Spain is really the question.     I think the very fact that there is even a debate on the subject says a lot about morals in today's society. There is no debate - he came by the money in error, has seen a chance to profit at someone else's cost and is now using the media to try and engender support for his immoral stance. Incompetence and over-reaction do not justify dishonesty.      The only time I get to keep the money when the bank makes an error in my favour is when I play Monopoly. In real life it has never happened to me but if it did I am sure that I would have to pay it back. After all it isn't my money.      Whilst his arrest by the Spanish police appears to be over the top considering he didn't know about the situation then (or so he says), he is well aware now that the money is not his, and is only there as a result of an honest error. He should give back the money that isn't his to the bank, although he should be allowed to keep the interest on the money. He would not feel the same way if the error went the other way, would he?      Years ago my bank credited my account with #1,399 which I immediately realised was a bank error, caused by accidentally shifting a decimal point 2 places to the right. I pointed out the mistake three times to the bank: once by phone, once in person, and once in writing. Amazingly, the bank resolutely refused to admit it had made a mistake and after waiting six months for the bank staff to recognise their error and adjust my balance, I resolved the impasse by spending the money. Not surprisingly, the bank has long since closed down.      Mr. Hickey's situation is different. The bank and Mr. Hickey both know a genuine mistake has been made and the bank has asked Mr. Hickey to return its misdirected funds. The rule of the jungle does not apply and Mr. Hickey is likely to find himself in deep trouble if he spends the money. Given the sum of money involved, an elegant - albeit naughty - solution might be for Mr. Hickey to leave the bank's money untouched in a deposit account and enjoy spending the not inconsiderable interest!      I remember a case of many years ago where a man received #10,000 into his current account by mistake. Despite his knowing that it was not his money he immediately withdrew it and spent it. He was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty of stealing by finding. Quite right too in my opinion. The man was a thief.      Having been arrested, handcuffed and then released effectively on bail for somebody else's mistake, I would return to the bank not one penny until the bank started talking about compensation.      Having borne the brunt of banking errors to my detriment in the past, would I give it back? Not a chance! I hope that the Irish guy enjoys the sun and sand of Spain on his new-found windfall - I most certainly would!      Where has this man lost his conscience? Probably, no court can help in this situation, as legally, if confirmed by appropriate banking documents, he seems to be right to hold the money with him. This is only a question of morale, which is absent in this case.      Perhaps errors such as these will make banks be less heavy-handed with their own petty 'administrative' charges, and less prone to mistakes. God knows the number of times the two banks I'm with have made silly mistakes that have cost me time (and sometimes money). I think the gentleman in question is entitled to a percentage of the money. He should refer to it as administrative charges, and explain to the bank that it's just 'company policy'.      Businesses like to make the rules to which customers must adhere, but feel they only apply if the result is in their favour. If, as I believe Mr Hickey claims, the agreement says that the bank is not responsible for errors and they cannot be corrected at a later time, the bank should abide by their own terms of business.      Of course he should repay it - it isn't his, the bank has made it clear that the error occurred and keeping the money is tantamount to theft.     If he is correct that the bank transaction had a disclaimer saying that they were not responsible for errors then I think it sounds like the bank has no come back against him. After all those disclaimers are there to cover the banks when they make mistakes in their favour so it should stand for cases when the banks make mistakes in the customers favour.      Shame on Mr Hickey. Where does he think the money to pay for his greed would have to come from, and does he have any feeling for the poor bank employee who made an honest mistake?      Ludicrous man. So if I order a computer, for example, and it gets delivered to my next door neighbour by mistake, is he entitled to think it's his? Bank errors work both ways of course. Presumably the bank could accidentally transfer money out of his account by mistake if he doesn't cough up.      Rob, UK - actually under Britsh law if you order goods and they are delivered to the wrong person, that person is not legally required to return them.      We're all human, we make mistakes and bank personnel are no different. They should be less prone to error than most but it's almost impossible to have 100% perfection when handling large volumes of transactions in multiple currencies. This greedy man deserves to be forced to pay back every penny.      I presume that if his account had been debited by that amount then he would be happy to accept that mistake?      I sympathise with him but holding on to what you know isn't yours is dishonest. If the error had put the bank in possession of his money or goods he'd be the first to complain.      When I opened my old account they were supposed to give me a #50 sweetener. They accidentally gave me #100. I didn't complain and #50 extra was hardly going to ruin them. After a year or so another bank offered me a better deal so I switched. They promised me a #60 sweetner. I never got it. When I complained I was told that they had given customers who hadn't yet received their money till the end of last year to ask where it had got to and those that didn't ask by the deadline forfeited their right to it. Unfortunately, the bank 'forgot' to let me know about this so-called deadline. Perhaps it was some bizarre justice, making right the mistake from before and punishing me by an extra tenner for not pointing out the mistake the other bank had made. I say to Mr Hickey: keep that cash at your peril, because there's obviously a higher power out there and he's a banker!      A couple of years ago whilst making some changes to one of my Direct Debits my bank somehow managed to change the status of my account to the effect that I had died. They then informed everybody who I had dealings with via the bank of my demise. This even got as far as our postman who knocked on the door to express his commiserations with my wife. I even had letters from BT addressed to the executors of my estate. When I pointed out to the bank that I was still alive we all had a jolly good laugh about it and they apologised profusely.      However, when it came to sorting out the account not only did they refuse to inform all those parties that it had told I was dead but informed me that it was my responsibility to ensure that my account details were correct. The problem seemed to snowball from then on and I even had a letter from them implying that I had faked my own death in order not to repay my bank loan. It was only through the honesty of the bank employee who made the original error that I was able, eventually, to sort it all out. Would I give back the money? Probably, but I'd make them sweat for it. Oh, the honest bank employee, what happened to her? made redundant two months later.      I would be very tempted to tell him to keep the money but feel the right solution is for the bank to offer him compensation for their mistake and for all his inconvenience. Banks are rather a law unto themselves until they are the aggrieved party.       The assertion that Mr Hickey has made of ""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" is wholly unacceptable. If the error caused him to suffer genuine inconvenience or loss then of course he would be entitled to a claim for compensation but to knowingly benefit from a mistake like this is totally dishonest. No doubt he would complain if every bank refused his custom just in case they made a similar error! "
HOC HOC-CX 2.23 " I'm appalled at what I've read on this page. The vast majority seem to believe that Martin did nothing wrong - but he killed another person. Of course we all want to defend ourselves against burglars but that does not (and must not) give us the right to take another life.     It is so sad how easily the public are fooled. He had a loaded shotgun and deliberately killed the youth who so misguidedly entered his property. The Martins of this world will always get the public sympathy as the majority look at the shallow facts rather than the deep ones. Don't be fooled. Martin has got away with murder. The police clearly proved Martin laid in wait and gunned down the intruder in the back.      If someone breaks into your home and you are in mortal fear for your life, then of course you should be allowed to defend yourself. Even if the courts say otherwise, it would be best to defend yourself. Better 5 years in prison then 6 feet under the ground!      The Martin case delivers an interesting perspective on the British viewpoint of justice. Justice takes place in the courts and - in Martin's case - justice was done first time around. Public opinion has wrongly portrayed Martin as the victim. This is not the case. Martin took justice into his own hands and should serve the consequences. It is simply absurd for certain sectors of the community to advocate a society in which burglars 'get what they deserve' in a kind of rough justice dealt out by the 'people'. Judgements such as this, which seek to legitimise such behaviour, are fundamentally wrong for the safety and morality of our society.      This man should be released! I have been burgled at least 14 times, squatted in, had my house set on fire, been verbally abused and threatened. No funds are available to make my home more secure; there's no counselling; no insurance means we live in a shell. I am frightened every time I walk out the door, and have had a nervous breakdown. It is time our society gave these brats what they deserve.      I have slept on the sofa with an axe, they were coming in so often! I am not living in a council estate where there is an almost expected turnover of crime, but in a nice middle class area. No magistrate should put these people first. Make them pay back everything, and more! Believe it or not, I have worked with young people, and have loved every minute, but I now hate this attitude that is permeating our society where parents condone their offspring's misbehaviour. My kids grew up in dire circumstances, but I taught them right from wrong!      If people could see the inside of our home, they might feel the same. As it is, it has been three years since I let anyone in, I am so ashamed.      To repeatedly be the victim of burglary must be a terrible experience - but no one 'defends their property' with an unlicenced pump action shotgun and the inclination to use it. Shooting a child burglar in the back as he runs away is not defence but punishment. And is Tony Martin morally opposed to window locks and burglar alarms, I wonder?      Poor Mr Martin. What a pity he doesn't live here in the USA. On a self-defence training class I attended at the local Sheriff's department, I was told categorically to kill an intruder, INSIDE my house, after warning that I had a loaded gun ready and would use it to defend myself. No one knows how fearful Tony Martin was for his safety. Did he have to be beaten as well as robbed, before taking action? The police, in both countries, are for the most part unable and unwilling to control or catch criminals. Therefore, you have to be prepared to protect yourself and your property.      The young man who was killed was breaking the law the moment he entered Mr Martin's house. HE chose to break the law, Mr Martin was simply protecting himself and his property. What a pity the law is such an ass that it persists in defending those who perpetrate crimes, rather than the victims seeking to save themselves.      It still does not give him the right to shoot someone to kill. How about if the police were armed against burglars, and shot someone when trying to apprehend. Would this then be OK - by the sound of most of your letters, it would be. Shoe on the other foot please!      No matter which way you look at it, Tony Martin shot and killed someone, for which he should be punished. The only injustice in this case is the distorted scale of punishment in this country. What happened to ""an eye for an eye""?      As far as I am aware, the law states that it is illegal to kill. I have never read a clause that excludes burglars. It is the job of the police to find and arrest the felons and of the courts to convict. That is why we have laws, otherwise it's gung-ho all the way.      Tony Martin should be released now, and compensated for his time in prison. Many people have commented how sad it was that a young life was lost in this tragic case, but perhaps we should ask how much misery and suffering of innocent people has been averted by ending this criminal's career. Not to mention the saving to the taxpayer in his rehabilitation had he been caught. The intruders got what they deserved. Mr Martin's unjust imprisonment sends out the wrong signals to criminals - what happened to being ""Tough on crime, tough on the causes of crime""?      He should have served one year in prison for NOT killing both of them.      What if the boy that Martin killed had been 15 years old, or even younger? Would people then be so in favour of shooting anyone who enters a house uninvited?      Those two men broke into his house knowing that he was at home. Did they expect him to offer them a cup of tea and some cake when he found them? They were old enough to know that what they were doing was wrong and so old enough to pay the price. If Mr Martin was paranoid, well, looks like he had good reason to be. Two against one. In his position I would have done the same thing.      Murder is the right verdict. With premeditation. Although I agree with the use of reasonable force, that does not involve firearms or knifes. If he had a gun, it was probably with the intention of using it against intruders. If it is the case, it is indeed premeditation.      We, here in America, take a different point of view than does the British judiciary. If a person invades another's home for whatever purpose, then we accept that we have the right to defend ourselves and our property, even if that means killing the intruder. I accept this. Unfortunately I believe that Britons are confused about this issue, preferring to give the benefit of the doubt to the criminals even to the extent of providing a nurturing response to them.      The soaring rate of crime and the apparent lawless culture endemic in Britain today call for a different response to what may have been the norm twenty or even ten years ago. Britain needs to accept the criminal climate has changed, probably forever. Until Britain takes a much firmer attitude in its prosecution of crime - accepting it for what it is ie an attack against society - then I believe we will see more episodes like Mr Martin's.      I'm in complete agreement with many of the people on this page - it is vital that we should be able to defend ourselves and our property if the situation requires it. One thought on this case though - what would have happened if somebody had innocently called upon Mr Martin for directions, or to tried to use a phone? Would they have met the same fate as Fred Barras?      We have followed the Tony Martin case with growing interest and horror at the way Mr Martin has been treated. We are both teachers of many years experience and we think that the way things have gone in this case are a frightening illustration of the way law and order have broken down. Of course, we are aware that a young man lost his life. Nevertheless, Mr Martin was alone in a remote house and the police were not easily accessible. He had a right to defend his property and the burglars had no right to be there. They were breaking the law and intimidating an innocent homeowner.      We can never know what he felt when being burgled, but since those men should never have been there in the first place I feel that we have to give Martin the benefit of the doubt that it was not murder.      Presumably the law would have been more sympathetic if he had been robbed or killed. Has the world gone mad? Are we so politically correct that the innocent can't upset the guilty? Recently we have read that an elderly lady was made to remove barbed wire from her fencing in case a potential burglar hurt himself. We should be like the Americans who allow a homeowner to defend his or her own property. Bring back discipline and social order and allow Tony Martin to go free.      I have read here that the law is biased in favour of the criminal. Martin was convicted of murder, later reduced to manslaughter. This makes him, er, a criminal.      Criminals who break into your house should have no right whatsoever. This case just offers proof that criminals will be protected at the cost of the victim. Tony Martin should never have gone to jail. This is just absurd. Next we'll probably have health benefits for thieves.      Whatever the case with Mr Martin's sentencing, I'd bet that some young criminals are now just slightly less keen on breaking and entering than they used to be.      Today's verdict is a joke and just another case of the system bowing to people power rather than the true events. Tony Martin should not have his sentence reduced to manslaughter. If you wave a loaded gun at someone then you should accept the consequences if they are injured or killed. He had no right to play God and decide if another human being should live or die.      Being in the unfortunate position of having had my own house burgled just last night, I fully sympathise with those who act to defend their property. However any such action has to be measured, appropriate and reasonable - none of which apply to a pump action shotgun! The court of appeal obviously had good evidence presented to it today as to the psychiatric condition of Mr Martin and it is for this reason his sentence was reduced. It saddens me that so many of the comments here suggest that people are seeing it as an endorsement of illegal vigilante behaviour.      Burglars do more than steal your property, they steal your feeling of safety and security in your own home and cause fear long after the event. Tony Martin only did what the State is failing to do - protected himself by whatever means were available. He should be released now.      The law at present favours the criminal in cases of burglary. Numerous cases have been seen where burglars injured by the householder have successfully sued for damages. The law should be changed so that a person who is within the perimeter of someone's home should be subject to the same law as reasonable defence, as in assault cases. If someone has entered the building then the person has done so at their own risk and they must accept the consequences with no civil liability. Killing someone is not an option but, so long as a householder can demonstrate reasonable justification for any action taken, then the criminal law should not apply. Using a firearm in any instance is not justified and cannot be defended.      Let's face it, this whole situation was caused by two thieves who only took from society and caused distress, upset and grief. Mr Martin should be treated as a hero for protecting society from these people where our 'justice' system fails to protect us. Release Mr Martin immediately.      I'm absolutely incredulous reading the responses on this forum. Firstly the verdict has been changed to manslaughter because Tony Martin is considered to have a mental disorder, not because there has been any change on the idea of reasonable force. Secondly Tony Martin was not defending himself because he wasn't being attacked. If he was, he couldn't have shot the young lad in the back. Finally, I wasn't aware that it had become acceptable in our society to kill someone as punishment for a crime. He murdered that boy, the only reason that the verdict has been changed is because of his mental disorder. What does that make all the people on here who think he did the right thing?      I agree Tony Martin should be released from prison and taken to either Broadmoor or Ashworth hospital until he has been assessed and deemed not to be a danger to society and his personality disorder treated. He owned an illegal pump action shotgun and had gun ownership licenses revoked in the past. As one commentator has said already; what if it was a person asking for directions or wanted to use a phone because their car had broken down?     If you think that the justice system in this country is inadequate then do something about it. Don't just take the law into your own hands.      This man should never have been convicted in the first place. This country has lost all sense of right and wrong. We spend far too much time thinking about criminals' rights, totally forgetting the victims.      Half a victory for common sense. A half-hearted step in the right direction. Consider for a moment if the persons involved swapped places. The 16 year-old, under the influence of drugs and alcohol would certainly not have been convicted of murder. His older colleague in crime would not have been convicted of murder. Most likely neither would have been convicted of manslaughter, nor of causing him serious injury. There are enough precedents.      Before you can claim self-defence (unless you are a burglar) you have to make steps to escape. But in your own home, where can you go, where can you retreat? Do you abandon your home to any violent thugs? Is this the message the Courts wish to send out? Who are these pompous individuals who sit in judgement, whose only experience of violence and burglary is in the 'civilised atmosphere' of a courtroom safe from any violence, threat of violence or intimidation of any sort? Not only that, but the defendants are on their best behaviour. Tony Martin should be, and always should have been a free man.      You are all naming Martin as the 'victim' - but he was the one who took a human life! To suggest that the punishment for breaking and entering should be death is rather hysterical. I thought that the original verdict of murder was correct - after all the definition of manslaughter is killing without intent, and blasting a boy with a shotgun is hardly that.      I think the courts have done the right thing to lower the charge to manslaughter, but they should have released him on a time served basis. If you can't protect yourself / property then it is no use waiting on the police in a rural area. I have known of people who have been burgled and the police don't turn up until 24 hours after the event (in an urban area). I don't blame the police as they are under pressure from government targets, but if you can't protect yourself in your own home, where can you protect yourself. This country is full of don'ts, when will the government target socially unacceptable behaviour, so that we don't have to take drastic action to protect ourselves?      No justice has not been served. Tony Martin should never have been convicted. No longer is an Englishman's home his castle. The judge trying the original case said, ""this sends out a powerful message to would be burglars"". The judge was not telling the truth, it sends out a message that the State is not on the side of honest people. This case was a burglar's charter.      Wading through the comments of other correspondents, I think I only detected one dissenting voice against an overwhelming tide of outrage that this guy should have been charged, let alone locked up, in the first place. Mr Martin may be slightly mad, but that doesn't make him bad and he was only dangerous to know if you happened to be a burglar. The law is an ass, it needs to get some perspective, and it needs to listen to some popular sentiment. I'm not a hang 'em & flog 'em supporter but no-one can have the slightest sympathy with the fate of the two burglars. I have none.      This is a triumph for common sense. It was outrageous that Mr Martin was found guilty of murder. Fred Barras shouldn't have been in Mr Martin's house in the first place. Of course he didn't deserve to die but who can blame Mr Martin for protecting himself and his property. The law should protect victims of crime, not the perpetrators.      The burglar got exactly what he deserved. If he hadn't been illegally in the man's house then no harm would have come to him. Being unable to defend yours and your families lives in your own home should be made a crime. It's stupid and ancient laws like this that are partly the reason why I don't live in the UK anymore. At least in Texas I can rest assured that if I have a burglar in my home then I'll be able to use deadly force if necessary to protect my wife and I.      Tony Martin should never have been jailed in the first place. Here is a farmer, who lives out in the countryside and his property had been previously burgled. They should never have broken into his property in the first place!      The original conviction was the result of the cynicism by both the police and Criminal Prosecution Service. The police were aggrieved at being exposed as being, at best, ineffective and were determined to exact their revenge. The motto being - we know we can't do our job properly but heaven help those who try to help themselves. The CPS adopted the tried and tested technique of launching a prosecution against a soft target (a law-abiding man) employing a mixture of dubious evidence and character assassination. The motto here being - he might or might not have committed a crime but he is just the sort of nutcase who could commit one. The cynical attitude of this country's judiciary and police force are on the same level as the motivation of genuine criminals.      Anyone like Tony Martin who thinks that shooting dead burglars is reasonable force deserves to be locked up for much longer. If it was reasonable in the eyes of the law then we would have much harsher verdicts delivered upon convicted burglars. We don't even have the death penalty for murder. Why should the likes of Martin be able to administer their own conviction and punishment? I remember the case of a British tourist lost in Florida asking for directions who was shot dead by a homeowner because they suspected he could be a burglar. Do people want that sort of law and order? No, so lets leave to the police and the courts      The victim in this has been Tony Martin all along. If the lad hadn't been trespassing in the first place, he would still be alive. I do not believe it is wrong to defend your property in this way - especially if it keeps happening. In a gut reaction some people are likely to do things to an intruder that they would not normally do - fear does that to you. What happened to the other lad who was shot at? Was he charged with anything? Trespassing at least? I hope so.      I think manslaughter is the right verdict in this case. However I'm frankly appalled by the people who think that he should have got off scot-free. Even if shooting the intruder was justified as reasonable force, why did Mr Martin run away from the scene and go in to hiding? Why didn't he call the police (and send for an ambulance for the person he'd shot)? You have the right to use reasonable force. This doesn't give you a right to shoot first and ask questions later.      Justice has not been served. Tony Martin has done nothing wrong. It was dark, they were inside his house, there were two of them. They were intent on ill-doing. If they did not want shooting, they should not have been there. What about people who have heart attacks when confronted by intruders in such situations? This is one of the grossest miscarriages of justice ever. Who poses the biggest threat to society?      He should be released immediately and given a huge compensation for this miscarriage of justice! Criminals are getting away with far too much these days! Why is it our nation is taken to a bloody war in order to combat an attack against another country, but people here continually get treated like criminals, and the real criminals get away with stuff? I'm getting very very fed up with the way things are declining legally, morally and judicially.      People are killed regularly by burglars. Recently there was a case of a young woman who died of a heart attack upon returning home to a burgled home. I would like to know just how a man is supposed to defend himself against a greater number of fitter and younger attackers. A single blow to the head can be fatal! We should be allowed to defend ourselves without question in our own homes.      On the facts of the case as stated originally I agreed with the jury, however, it seems that yet again, lawyers and the legal system did a poor job, so the appeal is upheld. To answer the question about a shotgun licence, I understand Martin's had be revoked some time earlier after another incident.      I'd like to know what liberal Phil would do he found two thugs in his house. Ancient English law says that your home is your castle      Yes, justice has been served. Manslaughter is the correct verdict. It was ludicrous that Tony Martin was found guilty of murder, but let us not forget the following, as your correspondent Eric Deveraux obviously has. The judge at the original trial did not allow the jury to find Tony Martin guilty of manslaughter, only murder or to find him not guilty. Given the evidence which some of your correspondents admit they did not see and the later revelations that Tony Martin had convictions for illegal possession of firearms, the only option given to the jury was a verdict of guilty of murder. It is all too easy for the right-wingers among us to say that the burglars ""deserved"" it, but I do not want a situation where people discharging firearms willy-nilly. What precedent will this set in a society where crimes involving firearms are rocketing? Let Tony Martin out in a few months when he has truly learnt is lesson.      Why is the victim of a crime punished? I don't understand! Two people break into a remote house with the aim to steal everything valuable they can carry and our system supports them?      To an outside observer, this appears to be a case of the appeal court pandering to popular opinion. In essence, they seem to have retired the case, based on a different defence to that given in the trial, without the prosecution being allowed to fully counter the new defence.      As for Tony Martin, a man who arms himself and knowingly shoots an unarmed youth in the back deserves considerably more than 2 1/2 years in jail. At the time, the doomsayers predicted that the verdict would lead to complete lawlessness in the countryside. None of this has come to pass. The rule of law must be upheld and it no longer appears to that it has been in this case.      He should never been sent to prison. I am so grateful I wasn't on that jury being glared at by a load of henchmen. If that wasn't intimidation!!! Our juries should be located in police stations and the court case transmitted by video to them.      The pendulum has swung too far. Tony Martin should be released now. His 'crime' was to protect his property and was punished for it. Has the world gone mad? It is not the fault of the police but of the judicial system in this country. Break the Law and you are afforded the full protection of the Law, become a victim and the Law will victimise you further. It is time for Justice to prevail in this once green and pleasant land!      The question here is did this main behave in a 'reasonable' manner and use an appropriate level of force? The original jury didn't think so and the appeal judges seem to have agreed. His appeal rested on his original defence having been conducted wrongly, not on the his actions and how the jury interpreted them. Yes, if his defence had been handled correctly in the first place it might not have been a murder conviction but perhaps manslaughter, but it is clear that he still used an unreasonable degree of force and killed a 16 year-old boy. And no, I don't condone burglary either.      Tony Martin should never have been put in prison and is sadly a victim of political correctness gone wrong. It was recently reported in a newspaper that a 90 year-old pensioner was asked to remove barbed wire that surrounded her garden fence because it could cause an accident should anyone try to climb over. This woman was burgled 6 times in 18 months and after putting up the wire was no longer burgled. However the council demanded she remove the wire to protect the burglars from injury! Its about time people realised that someone's home is their castle and they have every right to protect themselves and their loved ones.      There is a difference between defending one's property, and shooting to kill. No matter what Tony Martin thought (and it is now clear that he has a personality disorder) the fact is that he shot and killed an unarmed 16 year old. Of course he should be in prison. It is probably correct that the verdict has been reduced to manslaughter, but there is no way Martin should go free until his new sentence is served. To say that he should have not been found guilty is to give a licence to kill - and a very dangerous precedent could have been set. And I have to agree with the comment from Chris - surely any sort of gun licence should be refused if the applicant has a paranoid personality disorder?      Why was someone with a ""personality disorder"" allowed to have a shotgun licence?      By all accounts, Mr. Martin waited in armed ambush night after night for the opportunity to shoot someone breaking into his house. He achieved his warped ambition and was justly convicted of murder. All the gung-ho rednecks who supported him must be gleeful today, because it now looks as if you can literally get away with murder. My views will be in a minority here, I suspect, as this vile judgement is applauded by miscellany of slavering ghouls.      The criminal records of each of the burglars shows that all three had violent tendencies. Facing a choice between being caught and making an escape, I have no doubt that they would have been prepared to inflict similar injuries on Mr Martin. If they hadn't gone out that night intent on getting their kicks from making another human being's life a misery, the tragic death would never have happened. If you live by the sword, you run the risk of dying by it.      Martin shot a man in the back with an unlicensed weapon, that is wrong. But how do we defend our homes in rural areas where our support from the police is non-existent?      So you only get five years for killing a sixteen year-old in cold blood with a shotgun. Where is the justice for the lad's family? I certainly don't think there is a place in our society for bigots with guns. They should throw away the key.      Faced with intruders with unknown but, fair to assume, malicious intent, I defy any of this man's judges in a similar situation to have done other than try their best to ensure that the intrusion was repulsed by whatever means were available. On that basis, what Martin did should not have been judged 'unreasonable'.      Tony Martin should be released now and given compensation for a miscarriage of justice. Anybody that breaks into another person's house deserves to be shot.      I suspect that the law on using force against intruders will not be any clearer than it was before. Such cases in the future are likely to lead to the use of 'plea bargaining' by the CPS. One point that has astounded me is that the court of appeal accepted that Mr Martin's case was not properly presented at his trial - something they have not entertained in the past, usually telling appellants they couldn't have two bites of the cherry because their defence team did a poor job. This is for me seems to be the major move forward from this decision.      I still think he should never have been convicted in the first place. The law on self-defence should be reviewed and allow those who might otherwise be beaten or killed the right to defend themselves. As far as I'm concerned, once someone attacks you or your property, they immediately forfeit all rights before the law. The more we fight back against attackers, burglars etc, the less likely those who would usually commit these crimes will be to carry them out. Martin did the right thing.      It's interesting that the court actually upheld the original jury's decision that Martin used unreasonable force to defend himself. The charge was reduced to reflect the fact that the personality disorder he suffers from meant he was legally 'insane' at the time of the shooting. The decision has no precedent value whatsoever on the point of what is reasonable force.      Tony Martin's life has been destroyed because two yobs decided to invade his property and he tried to defend himself. The message of the original verdict was that the householder should simply let the burglar get away with it. The message of today's verdict is that a householder can use force to resist a burglar but they will be seen as equals when criminality and punishment are assessed.      Tony Martin is an unfortunate individual who reacted in panic to yet another attack on his home. He did what most people would like to do but dare not because the criminal justice system in this country is now geared to protecting the burglar and the mugger and the yob. I believe that Tony Martin was perfectly within his rights to do what he did. The law need to be changed to protect householders against those who seek to invade their property. Tony Martin should be freed at once and pardoned.      In the USA he would have been in the right to start with. We cannot have laws to protect criminals.      I find it totally outrageous that a man confronted by two burglars (in his own home) is found guilty of taking whatever means at his disposal to protect himself, his family and his property. The guilty parties are the burglars themselves. If they wish to indulge in criminal acts, then they should accept the consequent risks, with NO limitation! In my view, Tony Martin should be released immediately and compensated (handsomely) by the government for the time he has already spent in jail.      I feel so strongly about this subject. Justice hasn't been served - Mr Martin should be acquitted. He found himself in an appalling situation. For what possible reasons was he confronted by these two individuals, IN his HOME, at the dead of night, other than to violate his property or worse himself? Yes, loss of life is a high price to pay, but how much absolute misery do burglars inflict upon the victims whose homes they violate?      I agree totally with protecting your property, especially with this case. This man lived in an isolated house in the countryside. What would have happened the 16 year-old had a gun? Possibly Tony Martin would be dead.      As the victim of two burglaries I would almost certainly shoot to protect hearth and home. Tony Martin should be released now.      He didn't do anything wrong. Why is he in prison anyway? It's the professional risk of a thief to be punished in one way or another. Let him go now!      Tony Martin should be released immediately - his only crime was to defend himself against burglars who, for all he knew, could have been armed themselves.      There's a fine line here between offering an open invitation to thieves since police can't or won't intervene to protect householders, and condoning acts of violence in the name of protecting property. What constitutes ""reasonable force"" in protecting your property should be clearly defined so nobody can be in any doubt of the consequences (a) of breaking and entering, and (b) of taking vengeance.      That said, the balance seems to have swung too far in favour of the criminal, and Tony Martin has been treated very harshly. In my view, he should be released on parole immediately.      He should never have served any time in jail. He was only defending his property and this should be the right of everyone in this country. The people who broke into Martins house had criminal records up to their necks. Personally I think they got what they deserved.      In the USA people shoot and kill countless of burglars and intruders. It's hard to say, but they shouldn't have burgled his property!!!      Not having access to the details, it's difficult to say whether the verdict is sound or not. In terms of the right to defence against criminals though, I think the judgment is a step in the right direction. I for one am sick of being forced by law to take whatever's coming to me. Like most people I am not a large man, and so I do not have the luxury of being able to administer ""reasonable force"" with my bare hands. It's about time this insane situation was reviewed, especially for women, who are currently totally unprotected by law. The situation is so bad that we are unable even to count on passers by for help, as even sufficiently powerful bystanders will generally not risk being judged to have used unreasonable force.      In broad terms I very much applaud the change of sentence and have always felt that the original verdict was unjust. My view is that if you go inside other people's dwelling houses (not just on their land), where they have a right to feel secure and may have family, you know it is wrong and should expect that from time to time the consequences could be unpleasant. The people in this case knew it was wrong and simply should not have been there.      Once you make a decision to violate someone else's property, you must expect to be caught and suffer the consequences. I feel we have gone too far down the road of giving the criminal the right to cry ""foul"". If you break the law, you give up any such rights. Tony Martin should never have been taken to court, and should be freed and pardoned now. It is high time we had a firm definition of how much force is ""reasonable"" to defend your property and your own life, and this case has done nothing to give us such a definition.      The fact is they were never going to let Martin free as the courts would lose too much face and the judges are not that brave. Tony Martin has lost his home and his life through no fault of his own. He did not ask for Barras and co. to come to his house. Martin would have been better off claiming to have been a member of the IRA.      No. He should never have been locked up to start with. Its easy to say in the light of day but if you get woken up in the dead of night, in an isolated location by people deliberately breaking into your property, and you are scared and full of fear then the intruders should not be surprised if they got shot at.      Without a doubt, justice has been served. A life sentence for defending one's own property was always absurd. It's about time that British justice started supporting the victim rather than the criminal and this to me seems like a step in the right direction.      Absolutely. Tony Martin lived on his own and in fear of burglars. Both of the burglars chose to break the law and suffered the consequences. It is very sad that a young life has been lost but those of us who live in the rural community understand Mr Martin's actions. Maybe some good will come of it and some people will think twice before breaking into someone's house.       It's at least a step in the right direction! "
HOC HOC-FJ 1.6 " I agree that banning all smacking is over-legislation. However, I do agree that no child should ever be smacked on the head or shaken, and so criminalising this would be a good idea. This sort of chastisement is most likely to cause physical damage, and anyone with common sense ought to be able to see that.      Making criminals of parents who smack is not they way forward. Heaven help the social work profession (to which I belong) and the police child protection teams if we have to treat all parents who smack as criminals. Smacking is not the best way to provide good discipline - but many normal parents (including me) have smacked their children at times. Not good but not criminal.      If smacking is banned it should also be acceptable for anyone who becomes a victim of out-of-control children to sue the government department who implement the ban.      I feel smacking can be very effective. Just the other day, a gentleman cut me off while I was driving. Well, I chased him down and as soon as he got out of his car, I put him over my knee and gave him a couple of good smacks on the bottom. That'll be the last time he cuts another driver off.      I think there is nothing wrong with smacking a child, as long as it is within limits. My dad used to smack me for justified reasons and I think it made me a better person.      Some parents can't tell the difference between smacking and beating, so I say ban all physical violence against children. What are we, a nation of child abusers?      Before I was a father I thought that smacking a child was necessary. Now I have a 7-year-old daughter and have found, over time, that smacking does not work. As far as she is concerned being sent to her room is far worse a punishment than being smacked. The time alone in her room makes her think about what she has done, something a smack would not get her to do.      The new law is a waste of time and money. How do you expect to enforce such a law. There are bigger issues in Scotland, and the world today that need our immediate attention. I have two boys below the age of three, and occasionally they get a smack on the wrist or legs. It seems the people making these latest proposals could do with some of the same.      There's a world of difference between beating a child and an occasional smack. I believe that smacking should only be used when reasoned argument has been tried and failed, but children are not always reasonable, and a short sharp shock is often the best way to bring a child out of a tantrum. I always felt that smacking was a much more effective punishment than, say depriving a child of a meal as some of my anti-smacking neighbours did. No amount of reasoning will teach a small child not to touch something that is hot, and a smack hurts less than a burn.      Political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front. Spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm, that did not mean beat them to a pulp, it means simply correction by the last means, all else having failed. Is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values, until caught and hauled to juvenile court, when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong? Who is kidding who?      Let's get a sense of perspective on this: the occasional smack is not violent, nor is it abuse, nor is it assault. It is an effective way of temporarily correcting a child's behaviour. It has no long-term effects at all. The reason you should be allowed to smack a child but not an adult is because a child is incapable of judging effectively for itself whether or not its behaviour is right or wrong. Yes, children have no 'political power' - quite right too! They don't have the capacity to exercise it intelligently.      Banning smacking is only a good idea if parents are taught alternative means of behaviour correction. Otherwise, parenting becomes even more difficult.      A child is, like the rest us, constantly learning the limits of tolerance. More so it is important when he/she has to live in a community of people. Just because one declares an act to be unacceptable does not necessarily impart a child with the capacity nor the inclination to realise it. So it is as a last and effective resort that corrective action (such as smacking or the promise of the use of it) which is instinctively understood even by a child, be delivered. Used in a controlled and directed manner, there's no reason why smacking should not be part of a parent's educational tool for his/her child's healthy and balanced upbringing.      As I understand it, smacking is not a ""violent act"", neither is it to be used when running out of patience. I think it is one effective way of disciplining children, especially when they cannot understand reason. I think smacking is effective not because it inflicts pain (surely no-one can advocate beating children), but because it is humbling and a strong signal that certain behaviour is unacceptable. When I was smacked as a child I felt ashamed, and I have nothing but love and respect for my parents now.      The hysteria concerning child abuse is still raging and moving to ridiculous levels. Whatever next? Will punishing a child by not letting them out during the evening be classed as unlawful imprisonment? Parents need the freedom to punish their children in a way they see fit. Some children don't respond to reasonable discussion and physical punishment is sometimes the only sensible option. We need to pass on a clear message to children that they need to conform to rules otherwise suffer the consequences. If we fail to do so then crime will naturally increase as a consequence.      The discipline of children by smacking - for hundreds of generations and thousands of years - has helped to create the ordered society we have today. Over the past 30-40 years in the West, we've seen a marked reduction in the physical discipline of children as a result of so-called 'expert' advice. This should be more than enough time to see if reducing/eliminating smacking leads to a less violent world. Is this what we see? - I think not.      Political correctness has taken over the asylum and put the lunatic fringe to the front. Spare the rod and spoil the child was the norm, that did not mean beat them to a pulp, it means simply correction by the last means, all else having failed. Is it any small wonder there are young children and teenagers today who have no sense of values, until caught and hauled to juvenile court, when they plead their age and say they did not know it was wrong? Who is kidding who?      I cannot see how this ban on smacking would be policed. If it serves only to create a yardstick by which courts make judgements, then the ""red tape"" argument banded about by the Scottish Conservatives is misplaced. Surely this will remove an element of the subjective nature from such decisions and give a fairer result.      Of course the ban is right, and should be in place for all children, not just the under threes. If society thinks that teaching a child that a violent act is the way to solve a problem, then society is crazy. Aside from this, the pain inflicted is sickening. Parents who physically strike or harm any child should be charged with child abuse.     I don't support violence against children, but a smacked bottom didn't do me any harm, and it didn't do my children any harm. It wasn't intended as a violent act, but as a firm signal that some lines must not be crossed. Children NEED lines to be drawn, and they can't always be drawn by discussion.     I am totally baffled as to how these ridiculous proposals actually get taken seriously. The idea that legislation like this will actually work is ludicrous. Once again the do-gooders manage to influence politicians. When will the politicians realise that standing up against nonsense like this will actually win votes. We, the general public, have finally had enough of politically correct twaddle      Anybody with young children knows that it is in a child's nature to push parents to establish what they can get away with and what they cannot. The occasional smack is not child abuse (a thoroughly repugnant accusation), it is a means of establishing these boundaries. I am not saying that everybody should smack their children - far from it - but undisciplined children eventually become somebody else's problem too - their school's - and these days, teachers are so limited in their powers to discipline pupils.      If a parent can be taken to court if they smack a child, can a child be taken to court if they kick, bite, hit or abuse their parents?      In response to Claire's comments; To say that there is so much violence in the world because of smacking is more than a little simplistic, and to say that smacking takes place because children ""have no political power"" is nothing short of absurd. Perhaps she could explain how a child who is prone to temper tantrums and will not listen to reason could be afforded a degree of political power? Does she seriously think that the misbehaving child who gets a smack will extract from this the sweeping principle that ""violence is a good way to solve problems"" and carry this principle into action on a grand scale in their own lives?      Future generations will be better off if they learn to manage the behaviour of their children without resorting to physically beating them. The love and comfort we bring to our children is seriously compromised when we start smacking.      It is quite understandable that people in charge of young children feel the overwhelming urge to clout a child who is trying their patience.      But if we accept the principle that this represents a failure not a solution, then in the end the whole of society would benefit from a growing generation who have been brought up in an atmosphere of non-violence.      The only person qualified to smack under 3 year-olds is the midwife.      Smacking a child is not a means to wilfully or maliciously inflicting harm on them. Most times it's the last course of action taken to making them know that what they are doing is wrong and it should be stop immediately.     For most parents in the UK, I'm sure that smacking is a necessary and vital part of bringing your child in the way they should grow. I was smacked, many times, and hold no animosity towards my parents.      A well-deserved smack followed by an explanation and a hug is still the best parental guidance in the world. The inability to differentiate between discipline and child abuse is typical of an out-of-touch bureaucracy.      This society says we have freedom, but it constantly tells us what do, how to bring our children up, what we wear, how we are to worship, how we are to dress and eat. They say smacking is against the human rights of a child, but I say smacking gives the child boundaries.      You cannot discipline a child with hugs and kisses, you have to use force once in a while. If children are not disciplined then we will bringing up children that will have no respect for themselves or any one else.      I know first-hand that child abuse is very real. A law that makes hitting punishable would send a strong message to parents to try other ways to discipline. I have two children and think perhaps government funded education of some sort would help parents combat any anger-management issues they may have and learn a better way to discipline.      Reading the responses of people here, it is no wonder that there is so much violence in the world. When people smack their children, they teach them that violence is a good way to solve problems.     The hypocrisy is also astonishing. If a person ""smacks"" a stranger, he can be arrested for assault. Yet, he is allowed to hit his child. Why? Because children have no political power. This is undoubtedly one of society's worse evils.      I have raised one child and am in the process of raising three more. I have, on occasion swatted all of them. Those times have been rare but appropriate. They are all great kids and I don't believe our relationships could be better. I am glad most of your readers have enough common sense to know the difference between discipline and abuse.      I personally believe there are many ways to punish a child that don't involve physical violence. Violence of any form has no place in a modern society.      Nobody is in favour of abusing children in any way - but a smack isn't abuse. Raising doubts about the legality of a wee smack is going to bring nightmarish problems. Children need protection and parents need support. This proposal, if it comes to law, will bring in far more problems then it solves, and we'll regret it. It's one of those over-simple ""it feels right so let's do it"" ideas.      For a long time here in Sweden smacking has been equal to assault. The kids who get smacked can call a help-line to talk about their problems.      Whenever I smacked my child it always came from any frustration I was then going through. I would regret it later, but always think of the maxim ""spare the rod and spoil the child"". Given our children's lax attitude to life today, would not some discipline help tomorrow's grown-up? "

The barman says, ""What's with the long face?""      Doctor, Doctor, I can't pronounce the letters F, T and H! Well, you can't say fairer than that then.      A professor of chemistry wanted to teach his 5th grade class a lesson about the evils of liquor, so he produced an experiment that involved a glass of water, a glass of whiskey, and two worms. ""Now, class. Observe closely the worms,"" said the professor putting a worm first into the water. The worm in the water writhed about, happy as a worm in water could be. The second worm, he put into the whiskey. It writhed painfully, and quickly sank to the bottom, dead as a doornail. ""Now, what lesson can we derive from this experiment?"" the professor asked. Johnny, who naturally sits at the back, raised his hand and wisely responded, ""Drink whiskey and you won't get worms!""      From the late, great Les Dawson - The mother-in-law said to me ""When you die, I'll dance on your grave"". I said, ""Good - I'm being buried at sea"".      Doctor, Doctor, I keep wanting to cover myself in gold paint. Don't worry it's only a gilt complex.      Two squid are having a row. ""I saw you again with that pretty young octopus!"" the female screams. ""No, dear, you've got it all wrong,"" protests the male. ""Our relationship's purely planktonic!""      Man walks into a pub. The barman says ""I bet you can't get those pieces of meat off the ceiling"". The man says, ""I'm not taking that bet"". ""Why not?"", says the barman. The man replies, ""Because the steaks are too high..."" Two neutrons walk into a bar and order a couple of pints of lager. The first neutron goes for his wallet and the barman says, ""It's OK, there's no charge....""      What did the Mexican fireman call his twin sons? HoseA and HoseB      Did you hear the one about the dyslexic devil-worshipper who sold his soul to Santa?      A man walks into a bar with a slab of tarmac under his arm. He chooses a table, carefully puts the tarmac on one of the chairs and walks up to the bar. ""I'll have a pint of lager"", he says to the barman before indicating to the tarmac ""And one for the road"".      Why do milk bottles have shiny silver tops? To let milkmen check their hair.      A strip of tarmac goes into the pub and orders a pint. After serving him, the barman asks if he wants to join his mate in the corner. Sitting in the corner is a strip of red tarmac. The strip of tarmac shakes his head violently - ""I'm not going near him"" it says, ""he's a cyclepath!""      Blind man holding a piece of crispbread: Who the hell wrote this?!      How many dull people does it take to change a lightbulb? On F    Scientists have finally succeeded in cloning the first human being. The clone is said to be so happy that he is beside himself.      I bought some HP sauce the other day. It's costing me 6p a month for the next 2 years      What do you call a chicken in a shell suit? An egg!     What do you call a Tellytubby who has been burgled? Tubby!     How many surrealists does it take to change a lightbulb? Banana!     Q. What makes a tongue depressed? A. A tongue Depresse F    What you call a man in a raincoat: Mac.

Q: What's red and looks like a bucket? A: A red bucket! Q: What's blue and looks like a bucket? A: A red bucket in disguise!     What do you call a deer with no eyes? No idea!     A sandwich walks into a bar and asks for a pint. Barman replies ""sorry we don't serve food.""      Two sheep in a field, one says ""oh, I feel really ill.""  Shhh, says the other, ""you'll get us all killed!""      Why did the chicken cross the playground? To get to the other slide!      An Englishman, an Irishman and a Scotsman walk into a bar. The barman says ""Is this some kind of joke?""      There are 3 kinds of people in the world. Those who can count and those who can't...      What do you call a man without a spade in his head? Douglas      A chicken and an egg lying in bed together smoking a cigarette. One says to the other: ""Well that solves that then"".      The world's funniest joke? Well, the German football team, I'd have thought.      What do you call an Italian with a rubber toe? Roberto!      A duck walks into a Pub and asks for a pint, the surprised landlord exclaims ""My God a talking duck!"" The duck replies ""Yeah, I'm working on the building site across the road. I'll be in every lunchtime for two weeks for a pint""     Fine says the Landlord, and says no more about it. The next day the circus comes to town, and the ringmaster drops into the pub for a pint. The landlord says, ""I've got just the thing for you mate! There's a talking duck that comes in here for a pint every lunchtime - If you like, when I see him I'll tell him that you are interested in him."" ""Oh definitely"" says the ringmaster, ""Tell him to get in touch as soon as possible!"" Without fail the Duck pops in that lunchtime for his pint. The landlord tells the duck about the ringmaster's interest in him. The duck asks ""A circus? That's a tent isn't it?"" ""Yes"" replies the Landlord. ""It's made of canvas isn't it, with big red stripes on?"" enquires the duck. ""Yes, that's right, you've got it!"" answers the landlord excitedly. ""But"" says the duck ""What the hell do they want with a plasterer?      A man walks into a bar. He says, ""Ouch!""      Did you hear about the magic car? It went down the road and turned into a garage      What do you call a fly with no wings? A walk...  From Tommy Cooper - They say one in every 5 people are Chinese, and there are 5 people in my family. It's not my Mum or Dad and it's not me. So it must be one of my brothers - Colin or Wan Ho Li. But I think it's Colin.      Two flies playing football in a saucer, one fly says to the other fly, ""We have to play better than this next week"" Why asks the other fly. ""Because we are playing in the cup!""      Two cannibals were eating a clown, one cannibal says to the other, does this taste funny to you!      The manager of an office wants to motivate his staff so he puts up a sign saying ""THINK"" above the basin in the staff restroom. Upon returning he finds a new sign above the dispenser saying ""THOAP""      Where does a baby monkey sleep? In the apricot.      What did the number 0 say to the number 8? Answer: 'I like your belt'!      My cat wasn't very well so I took it to the vets. The vet said, ""before I look at your cat it'll be #50."" ""No worries, just fix it"" I replied. He looked at the cat and said ""its dead."" ""It can't be - I want a second opinion."" So the vet goes to the waiting room and asks the owner of a black Labrador if he could borrow it. He then turns to the dog and says"" just check out whether the cat is dead."" The dog sniffed my cat, looked at the vet and said ""nope, its dead"" ""I still don't believe you - I want a third opinion."" So off he goes into the waiting room again and this time comes back with another cat. He says to the cat ""just check that this is dead."" Sure enough the cat sniffs around my cat, looks to the vet, shakes his head and says ""no its dead."" ""OK"" I say - I believe you here is the #50 - ""No, no says the vet, its #200 now."" ""What do you mean?"" ""Well there was a #50 initial consultation fee, then you had a lab report and then you had a cat scan!""      Why are elephants big, grey and wrinkly? Because if they were small, white and smooth they'd be a paracetamol!      Person 1: What's the name of the American city often referred to as the windy city? Person 2: Chicago? Person 1: Yes, very well thanks since I had it serviced!      Two fish in a tank, one says to the other ""How do you drive this thing?""      Two hydrogen atoms sitting at the bar. One is looking very unhappy and depressed. His mate says, ""What's up with you then?"" The sad atom answers, ""I've lost an electron"". His mate looks surprised and asks, ""Are you sure?"" With a sigh the answer comes back, ""Yes I'm positive!""      Two sheep in a field. One said to the other ""BA AAA BA AAAA BA AAA"". The other said: ""Blimey, I was going to say that"".      What do you call a man with a spade in his head? Doug! Absolutely brilliant!     Where is the Irish Sea? Between the Irish B and the Irish D!      A skeleton walks into a bar and says, ""A pint of lager please barman. Oh, and a mop""      Two neighbours are out walking their dogs. One guy - a German shepherd owner - says ""Let's go in that bar over there and have a drink."" The other - a Chihuahua owner - says ""They'll never let us in with the dogs."" The first replies ""Just follow my lead"" as he dons a pair of sunglasses. When the doorman stops him, he says ""But, this is my Seeing Eye dog"", and is allowed in. His friend quickly puts on his sunglasses and makes the same pitch to the doorman. The doorman says: ""I've never seen a Chihuahua seeing eye dog."" To which the guy responds, ""WHAT! They gave me a damn Chihuahua?!""      I haven't spoken to my wife in 18 months - I don't like to interrupt her.      Did you hear about the two blokes arrested for drinking battery acid and eating a firework?      One was charged and the other let off.      What's brown and sticky? A stick!      Did you hear about the guy that drowned in his muesli? A strong currant pulled him in!     I lent my friend $10,000 to pay for plastic surgery. I can't get my money back because I don't what he looks like.      International surgeon's conference. First a surgeon from UK takes the stand: ""we transplanted a lung to sick man. After 6 weeks he recovered and now he looks for a job"". Second, a French surgeon: ""we took a half of heart from one man and transplanted it to another patient. After 4 weeks both of them are OK and look for a job"". And then American surgeon speaks: ""we took a person without brain from Texas and put him in White House. After just 2 weeks half of our country looks for a job"".      A ghost walks into a pub and says, ""I'll have a vodka, please."" The bartender replies, ""I'm sorry, we don't serve spirits here.""      A young brunette goes into the doctor's office and tells him that her body hurts wherever she touches it. ""Impossible,"" says the doctor. ""Show me."" She takes her finger and pushes on her elbow and screams in agony. She then pushes on her knee and screams... pushes on her ankle and screams, and so it goes. No matter where she touches, her agony is apparent. After some thought, the doctor says ""You're not really a brunette, are you? You're really a blonde"". She sheepishly admits that indeed, she is a blonde. ""I thought so,"" he says. ""Your finger is broken.""      A gorilla walks into a pub, goes to up to the barman and say`s `beer`. nervously the barman serves the beer. After half a dozen pints, the barman goes to where the gorilla is standing and say`s, don`t see many of your type around`. The gorilla replies` I am not suprised at $5 a pint`.      Two Aerials meet on a roof - fall in love - get married. The ceremony was rubbish but the Reception was Brilliant.      Man goes to the doctor with a strawberry growing out of his head. Doc says: ""I'll give you some cream to put on it.""      Doc, I can't stop singing the green green grass of home. ""That sounds like Tom Jones syndrome. "" ""Is it common? "" ""It's not unusual.""      A man takes his Rottweiler to the vet. ""My dog's cross-eyed, is there anything you can do for him?"" ""Well,"" says the vet, ""let's have a look at him"" So he picks the dog up and examines his eyes, then checks his teeth. Finally, he says ""I'm going to have to put him down."" ""What? Because he's cross-eyed? "" ""No, because he's really heavy""      Have you seen the latest hairstyle? Young kids are having half their head shaved whilst leaving the other half untouched. It's called the ""power cut"".      One cow says to another: ""Have you heard about mad cow disease?"" The other cow thinks and replies: ""I am not worried - I am a parrot.""      A man is walking down the street with a cabbage attached to a piece of string. His mate bumps into him and says - why have you got a cabbage attached to a piece of string. He replies - It's not a cabbage, it's a cauli!      Easily the best joke in the world is... Why has Edward Woodwood got 4 D's in his name.... Because otherwise he would be called Ewar Woowar...      I thought Monty Python had already completed that research programme and the result was:    My dogs got no nose! How does he smell then? Terrible!      A wife complains, ""Our clock almost killed my mother today. It fell off the wall only seconds after she got up from the couch."" The husband mumbles, ""Damn clock always was slow.""      Did you hear about the dyslexic agnostic insomniac? He used to lie awake at night wondering if there was a dog.      A snail is making his way through the woods when he is mugged by two slugs. He goes to the woodland police station to report the crime and, still in some considerable distress, is interviewed by the duty sergeant (probably a squirrel). In an effort to restore order, the sergeant says ""Please calm down Mr Snail! It's important that you give us as much information as you can about your attackers so they can't do this sort of thing again. Now did you get a good look at their faces?"" The snail replies, ""I'm sorry, I didn't - it all happened so quickly!""      Q: Why is 6 afraid of 7? A: Because 7 8 9.      There were 2 eggs in a frying pan, one says to the other - ""Blimey, it's hot in here"" The other replies - ""Arrgggh! A talking egg""!      I went to the doctor and said, ""I think i'm a pig"" - ""How long have you felt like that?"" he replied...""About three weeeeek weeeek weeeeeks!"" "
HOC HOC-GC 1.83 " How about the drive from Houston to Dallas, or vice versa? 200 some odd miles, terrain as flat as a pancake and when you see either Dallas or Houston, both cities look like clones of each other, same strip malls, same skyline. Come to think of it, the same applies to most cities in the USA.      The most boring place on Earth? Where the most boring person on Earth happens to be.      One word: Ballymena      Middlewich in Cheshire is the most boring place ever. It has 2 bus stops and 2 shops and that's it.      Singapore most definitely. Its citizens need to be reminded to 'smile' from government campaigns.      Britain is the most boring place. Its high criminal activity and ugly personality of its mainstream ""Thatcherised"" population proves this.      I lived in Bonn for 6 years and thought it was quite a nice provincial town. Although it was the federal capital, the locals called it the federal village. I liked it. A US journalist, whilst stationed there about 20 years ago, described it as ""being half the size of Chicago's main cemetary and twice as dead"". I suppose your view is formed by previous experience.      A few contenders - Redruth in Cornwall - a place where the locals still point at aeroplanes, Hemel Hempstead - so dull it makes Milton Keynes look like Disney World. Hatfield is also mind-numbingly bland and must have employed some of the most unimaginative architects ever to sit at a drawing board.      The small seaside town of St Helens in Tasmania. The vacant stares of its citizens (especially at sunset when they gather on the street corners, like extras from Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. Don't miss booking a room in the principal motel, where the multi-coloured acrylic carpet runs not only across the floor, but also up the walls - no doubt to prevent injuries as guests throw themselves against them in existential despair.      Hull - It's sooo boring the highlight of the day is deciding which hand to use when covering one's nose to avoid the smell of an old fishing town.      Runcorn in the North West of England HAS to be, by far, hands down, the winner. High crime, high teenage pregnancies, one shopping complex, and one night club for 60 thousand+ people. Need I say more!      I'm surprised that a few people have named Singapore as being boring. I lived in Singapore for over five years and found it quite the opposite. It has an abundance of 24 hour night-clubs and live bands. The only thing, which I found boring apart from the political aspect of the country, were some of the expats, who refused to mix with the local people and experience the different cultures of S.E.A. I think that these expats might be the ones who are inclined to say Singapore is boring. There is life outside your condominiums and expat clubs, you just need to participate in the real world!      Whilst serving in Cyprus in the 70's we had servicemen and women sitting around complaining that there is nothing to do, but they were to lazy to get up and do something. People can be boring but not places, a place is only what you make of it unless you live on the Isle of Wight      Thank you everyone who has mentioned MK. It is without doubt the biggest hell-hole on earth. No character, no nightlife, no interesting people, no worthwhile architecture or history - need I go on. It should be bulldozed and forgotten about. Writing this is the most exciting thing that's happened to me this year!      If Phillips thinks Edmonton is boring, he should take a look around his home country, any place in Southeast England is by far more boring. Pubs seem to be the defining element of cultural attraction around here. Guess you have to drink yourself silly to enjoy the place.      If Singapore is as boring as some people think, why are there more than a million foreigners from all over the world working in this small country of only 3 million people? In contrast, Darwin attracts no foreigners because it is such a boring, boring place.      Nothing wrong with Singapore - plenty of fun to be had if you know where to look. Try Brunei or Kuwait if you're after real boredom!      I once drove round and round Bracknell, hyperventilating with rage because I couldn't find a street that was clearly marked on my map. When I finally thrust the map at a passer-by she nervously informed me that I was actually in Basingstoke! Surely nobody who has visited these places truly blame me: Malls, fast food outlets, ring-roads, distinguishing between them is like distinguishing between one fast-food outlet and another, they are identical in a hideous kind of way. Oh, and I've also worked in Slough, Barnsley and Luton. Can you blame me for emigrating?      As a Canadian with a European background, I can clearly understand the reasoning behind renaming Alberta's capital to 'Deadmonton'. Unfortunately, too many Canadians are obsessed with mass-market sports as opposed to the beauty of individual athleticism.      Being an ex-pat Brit I am lucky to live in one of the most scenic parts of the world - The Okanagan Valley (British Columbia). But my main office is based out of Edmonton and I could name many other worse places in Britain and Europe - leave Edmonton alone and worry about somewhere else!      I've been to Basingstoke, Bracknell, Luton, Bedford and Milton Keynes in the past few years (what does that say about my life?!). Having moved to Malaysia, I expected Kuala Lumpur to be a bit more cosmopolitan. Nope. Kuala Lumpur could be twinned with Milton Keynes. There are hardly any buildings here that are more than 10 years old (with more being built every day), an incomprehensible road network, and countless numbers of soulless shopping complexes. Come back Bedford et al - all is forgiven!      Born in a small town in England. I agree that they are very boring indeed. I am lucky to live in one of the most EXCITING places on earth - Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. There is so much to do here, whether indoors or outdoors that I don't have enough time in the day to do it all, so I am NEVER bored. If you are bored in your hometown, try turning off the TV and get involved in a hobby or sport!      I don't know where the most boring place on earth is but this Talking Point page isn't it. I have laughed so hard at these bored and desperate people's expense, I almost feel guilty. I might even start to sponsor them with train tickets to somewhere more exciting.      There are many boring places on earth (most of them English speaking). Here are some warning signs. Claims at ""world's biggest"", ""world's longest"", ""world's tallest"" (ask yourself why are they trying so hard). Boasts of a vibrant multicultural atmosphere (outside of Reykjavik, what city isn't multicultural now). Any place with a monorail or a revolving restaurant. Any mention of equally second rate ""sister cities"" (clearly they're desperate). Can you think of anyone truly interesting from that city (and do they still live there)? The one city that wins (or loses) in all of these categories is Toronto (any city that has a shoe museum as its second biggest attraction should really be avoided).      Bedworth, in Warwickshire, is possibly the only place that makes Nuneaton seem glamorous. The pubs are like something out of League of Gentlemen. This is the town that fashion forgot - stonewash skin-tight jeans, white socks and mullet haircuts are still common. Swindon comes a close second though.      Take it from me, the most boring place is any baseball stadium, a close second would be a computer room full of operators and a distant third, an English cricket ground especially as recent test results indicate.      Adelaide, South Australia is the ""hole"" of the earth.      Most people in Singapore have no real political or social opinions, and some even require the government's assistance in getting a date for a Saturday night, let alone just trying to meet someone. Everyone is too busy worrying (or scared) about what everyone else thinks about them, and neglect their own unique individuality and their expressions. Although it's great that crime is under control and the country is very pretty and litter-free, it just feels like the citizens are living within a sterile and clinical bubble-dome.      By far, Temple City, California is the most boring place on the planet . . . we probably have the largest concentration of bridal shops in the country. I believe last count was 19 within a 3 mile radius . . . It's a strange little place      The most boring place on earth is London W12 8QT.      Saitama Prefecture, the northern overspill of Tokyo, is acknowledged the most boring place in this ""the ugliest country in the world"". A municipality with a population of over a million was created there last year. They polled the inhabitants to suggest names for the city. The story goes the most popular suggestion was ""Dasai-tama"", which means ""Naff lump"".      I certainly second the idea of Basingstoke being one of the worst in the UK, but just try anywhere in Denmark, specifically Jutland. I've had more fun at the dentist!      I am forced by nature to agree with Robert Philip. Ever since the ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky left for L.A., Edmonton has truly been a one-show town - the West Edmonton Mall! Admittedly, it's some mall, but I think that says it all right there, doesn't it?      No contest - Harlow Town, Essex. Beggars belief.      Hale, Cheshire is without doubt the most boring place. Copious amounts of rich people concentrated in one small village serious destroys any community spirit. No one knows his or her neighbours.      March, Cambs. in the Fens, and unlike Luton is not easy to get out of.      I'm working in Basingstoke at the moment, wondering what I've done in a previous life to deserve it. You can spend a night at the Bowlplex with 17-year old boy racers, or, if you're really bored, there is a pub somewhere in town, with a big screen and everything! Someone get me out of here!      I remember Bernard Manning causing similar levels of laughter and offence with a series of comments about an English seaside town (Lytham St Annes). They included such gems as 'the only entertainment on a Saturday night is watching the traffic lights change' and 'they don't bury the dead, they prop them up in bus shelters to make the place seem more active'.      You have obviously never been to Gran Canaria! It is just a big pile of rock!      Chichester, Sussex -     Exclusive, snobbish and conservative. Result - no nightlife, no fun, no hope.      Bracknell. It is without doubt the most uninspiring place on earth.      Definately Jacksonville in Arizona, a one horse town, without a horse! In the UK, I agree with Matthew, Luton must come top - there is no reason for it too be there at all!      Only boring people get bored.      Offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. On board a drilling rig has to be the most boring and foggy place on the face of the earth. Boooooor-ring!      Swindon, where even the pigeons are on anti-depressants.      Hull, after the shops have shut there really is absolutely nothing to do (except leave!)      As the old joke goes: What have the Moon and Derby got in common? No atmosphere!     Judging by his comment, It has to be Gareth ""rasher"" Dart's house.      Crayford in Kent. A place so boring that the residents regard a traffic jam as something worth looking out of your window to watch.      I lived in Basingstoke for 3 years and I thought that was bad enough, until, I went to Milton Keynes for a weekend. Now that really is THE most boring place on Earth!      Dumbarton of Strathclyde is medically proven to be sufficiently dull as to actually induce coma. That is, when I'm not there to liven things up a bit.      My place of work: Long corridors, few pretty women, no one to flirt with, terrible view, grey skies outside, no laughter, terribly dressed colleagues, no tales to tell on our bosses and colleagues concerned basically about themselves and their PCs!      Nowhere is boring, just situations. Bored? Do something!      Bracknell. I'm still trying to scrape enough money together to achieve escape velocity.      Wait till you get married - you can't escape boredom wherever you are.      Grimsby: been there, done that, wouldn't be seen dead in the T-shirt...      It's easy to name millions of boring places. We should be naming boring places that have ""an obligation"" not to be boring because of their size, importance of their country and number of people who actually visit it. So Singapore has the obligation not to be boring - but according to David Thomas, it is. That's the kind of entries I would be looking for. In that case, try Calgary (south of Edmonton) when the stampede's not on... Phoenix, Arizona, is also pretty lifeless outdoors (too hot in summer) and there isn't anything for anyone to do except work or watch TV - which is also boring there.      There are no boring places. There are boring people.      I have never seen boredom etched on people's faces quite so distinctly as those listening to speeches in The House of Lords.      Norfolk is the dullest place on earth, with possibly the exception of Birmingham.      I would have to say that the dull and mediocre, medium sized town is a certain English forte. It is for these places that the phrase ""soulless"" was first coined.      Has anybody ever visited the capital of Europe, Brussels? Definitely for me this should get gold medal for the dull-a-thon.      Yeovil in Somerset is definitely the most boring place in England. At least Luton has a bit of ethnic diversity and a carnival once a year! Yeovil is just so dull.      Ambridge. You can compress everything that has happened during the week into an hour and it's still not interesting!      I like to think that every place has something interesting about it. Maybe you have to be local to get it, but there is some interest everywhere. Even Swindon, Milton Keynes and Barrow in Furness.      I once spent 2 weeks in Hemel Hempstead and wished I'd stuck forks in my eyes instead!      Web-sites that ask boring questions. As for Luton it's not that bad and we do have an athletics track, which I use weekly and international meets just up the road in Bedford      Singapore is ok. Australia is boring, big and empty      Without a doubt the most boring place in the world is Loughborough. The residents have to resort to homophobia, racism and downright rudeness to break the monotony.      Try Solihull, no atmosphere and a dumping ground for middle class executive-types.      My girlfriend's place.      I absolutely, categorically, unambiguously deny that it is Link?ping. We have no less than two cinemas, 6 pubs, and the bus service is very efficient. It's fun. I would much rather live here than Helsinki.      Don't bother stopping over in Folkestone on your way to France. Car parks close at 6pm - that says it all!      The Big Brother house.      Edmonton.      I used to live in Basingstoke. It has the well-known nickname of ""Boringjoke"", but what was NOT so well known: the local newsagents sold postcards of the biggest office buildings in the centre of town because there was literally nothing else However, this does beg the question of who on EARTH was buying them?!      Nowhere is boring as long as you have access to an international airport, a sense of adventure or a good set of friends.      The most boring place on earth is, without doubt, any cricket ground in England.      Barnet.      Try any small German city on a Sunday...      Robert Philip should visit Luton if he thinks Edmonton is boring. We have the oldest shopping centre in Europe (it was the first, and looks it), and a Vauxhall factory that is about to close. We don't have international athletics facilities. The one saving grace is that Luton is easy to get out of, with the airport, M1 and the excellent Thameslink trains leaving every few minutes.      Singapore is the most boring place on earth. No life, no individuality, no fun... BORING!!!      That area just outside the ozone layer. There really is no atmosphere at all.      Without doubt - Milton Keynes!!      My favourite boring place is Dubai, UAE. Friends rave about it. I've been there twice recently looking for excitement. The city sucks. Awful. Absolutely dreadful place. The new airport is the best thing about it. "
HOC HOC-GK 1.61 " If the people of Northern Ireland want peace then why do they vote for Ian Paisley, David Trimble (ex- Orange Lodge) and Gerry Adams. The day they stop voting for these people the day Northern Ireland will be at peace.      Why ask these questiions? Why not ask whether the Unionists and the British have done enough? If you read the text of the Agreement as voted on by the whole of Ireland and signed up to by all the main players (not the IRA incidentally) you will see that there is are requirements that the British and the Unionists have to satisfy. Then look at what the British and the Unionists have done - they are failing miserably and dragging their feet (deliberately?). They have not lived up to their part of the deal. On the other hand Sinn Fein have done everything that is required of them by the Agreement.      The WEAPONS should have been verifiably decommissioned 2 years ago, without condition. Unionists have been more than patient with mealymouth comments by the IRA and selected Government puppets. Lets see the IRA ""Walk the Talk"" NOW!!      Without the 'peace process', the 'improved' terrorists might go back to their killing ways of the bad old days. But that is precisely why the IRA and its political wing are still terrorists, not politicians - because they have weapons that they will use if they don't get what they want. Terrorism and democracy are mutually exclusive. Until the IRA has disarmed, they should not be allowed to masquerade as politicians.      Words - there are so many ways to argue the toss about what decommissioning means. If everyone is serious about peace, then they wouldn't be talking about the semantics of the issue. Time to give up talking about doing it and do it or just forget about it and go back to the killing. Trust is the basis for any dialogue about the future - none exists.      The IRA must seize the opportunity and the unionists must recognise the nationalists rights, but weapons are a stumbling block. The IRA must convince us that its weapons are not held in reserve, in case all else fails. Northern Ireland would benefit from investment and job opportunities and a steady growth in gdp could make NI a gold mine in technology and commerc G    The IRA and their Sinn Fein spokesmen are geniuses at hyping nothing into something. Yes, the Unionists are intransigent and clumsy, but that does not mean the Republicans are not devious and calculating. Lest we forget, Dick Spring said in 1993 that the IRA would have to decommission before Sinn Fein could even enter talks. Look at where we are now. They will not disarm, but not because of their principles - rather because their arms are still vital to their criminal rackets, training camps and punishment attacks. A leopard does not change its spots.      Robert, Englan G    The Good Friday agreement may have been set up to help all the political parties to come together and achieve peace, but what about us on the British mainland? Despite the agreement, we still live with the threat of terrorist bombs. What have we done to deserve our cities being bombed and our citizens killed in cold blood by a group of Irishmen who don't want peace? In my opinion, I believe that we should get rid of Northern Ireland ASAP. It is the U.K's biggest liability, both financially and politically. The people there shouldn't be allowed to fight on our time or our territory. Give Northern Ireland away and let them fight it out amongst themselves -just don't involve us because we have nothing to do with it!      How do we know that the IRA is going to put ALL of its arms 'beyond use' as we don't know where all of the IRA's arms caches are! We will never know if they are ALL 'beyond use'.      We all know that at some time the weapons in N. Ireland MUST be put beyond use. The remit of the de Chastelain commission is clearly to oversee this, and they alone should be left to do so. Unionist demands for actual decommissioning again make them appear like they are dragging their heels on the whole issue of power-sharing. It should be remembered that the IRA guns are silent, whilst there are constant attacks on Catholic families all over the province. Yet, if the Unioists are to be believed, the threat to peace comes solely from the IRA. Seems strange to those of us who are watching from overseas.      The IRA are trying to bring about peace, and have made significant and genuine moves in that direction. The Unionists - apart from Trimble who is a good man - are trying to destroy the peace process, but without appearing to do so. The British media almost always show a pro-Unionist bias, even though there are armed groups on both sides, and are guilty of presenting the public with a distorted picture of the situation. One of the reasons for this bias, apart from the obvious political ones, is that there is so much anti-IRA feeling in England, that almost all areas of the media are afraid of appearing to be anything other than utterly tough on the IRA.      Why can't we just give Northern Ireland the status of an independent state? Then they can sort it out amongst themselves.      This latest statement does not reassure me of the IRA's commitment to peace. Anyone living in NI knows who will be responsible for the violence if the present initiative fails, and it is not the Unionists! No doubt Loyalist paramilitaries will also be in it up to their necks but their support amongst the Unionist community is negligible. To those from the USA who have stated that Unionists won't share power; they have been doing so for the last 3 years. All the IRA are being asked to do is give up arms which they should never have had; just like the Loyalists. No decommissioning first has produced failed peace processes in Macedonia and Israel.      George M. Klaes has demonstrated typical US muddy thinking on Northern Ireland by saying that ceding the province to Ireland would be democratic. The majority of the people of the province wish to remain British. Self-rule is the only way forward with power shared by all parties, which is what the assembly is and has been doing. You cannot do that with an arsenal of weapons held at your opponents' heads.      In 2 years 4 months Sinn Fein/ IRA have not moved the peace process forward a single inch. They make press announcements with no substance or detail that they claim as breakthroughs. We have had enough of their weasel words. What is needed now is some statement of when decommissioning will start and what will be put beyond use. Without those details being provided and the promises adhered to there can be no hope for the peace process.      The IRA clearly demonstrate, with this latest move, what has been clear for some time, i.e. that they hold the initiative in the peace process and the Unionists and the UK Government are clinging onto their coat-tails. I hope that this initiative is properly meant. The IRA can string it out as much as they like if the people of Northern Ireland get to live in a peaceful society. This they deserve. They have suffered long enough for it.      Can I ask both sides a simple question? ""Who will have the courage to accept the other point of view?"" To the majority it seems that neither side wants true peace. Or will they all be simply remembered as the nearly men?      I am sick of reading in this forum people outside NI saying the IRA are doing a great thing. They are saying they will meet with the Commission and plan to disarm. Guess what folks - they have been saying this for several years. While 13-year old boys get their knees smashed by IRA gangsters in Belfast; While Brendan McKenna, who is not from Portadown continues to be ""offended""; while the UK government make concession after concession and the IRA do NOTHING, there can never be a settlement.      I am a nationalist, but I cannot deny that apart from stopping sectarian killings (but not ""punishment beatings"" and terrorising their own community), the IRA have ZERO interest in peace.      Fine words from the IRA but the peace process is about building confidence. If the IRA would show some real courage and destroy some weapons then the present logjam would shift.      One question I have been pondering for several years is, if the IRA really want to become politicians why do they need any weapons? If they are serious about trading bullets for ballots then why do the continually procrastinate about how, when and whether to give up their weapons?      The IRA are moving in the right direction on the arms issues. They will not however be dictated to by the Unionists and anyone that thinks they will is being naive. Setting deadlines for weapons decommissioning merely creates more uncertainty and confrontation. The important thing is that the weapons are not being used. If I am cynical I would say even if there was decommissioning the Unionists would find something else to delay full implementation of the agreement. The loyalist paramilitaries are in total breach of any ceasefires they supposedly agreed but this seems to be totally ignored by the Unionist politicians. Can you imagine the outcry if it was the IRA involved in breaches of their ceasefire. Also of all the prisoners released, it is two loyalists who are back in prison but not a word is said. This is the best chance for peace and there is no alternative so let's see all sides move the process forward nobody surely wants a return to how things were.      I'm sorry but the IRA statement is just the same set of words coming out of one of the Republican movement's other mouths. The only new thing here is the detail of how weapons are to be destroyed. There is still no indication of a time frame or what Sinn Fein/IRA expect to happen first. This is simply another PR stunt.      I find it hard to believe that some people want to return to the days of violence. The process has reached a critical point where each side is giving in inches, neither sure if they have given enough or too much. Now is the time to look at all the positive things that have happened in the last 5 years and resolve not to turn the clock back.      If the IRA were to build a bonfire and publicly burn every gun and ounce of explosive they possessed it would still not be enough for the Unionists who, at the end of the day, don't want to share power in Northern Ireland. We hear much from them about IRA decommissioning but they seem to avoid the fact that every sectarian attack in NI in the last months has been from Unionist paramilitaries.      Forget the IRA and the Unionists. What is important is that the people of Northern Ireland want peace. And eventually they will get it.      If the IRA want peace they will give up their weapons.      But with the future of the Northern Ireland peace process on a knife edge the Provisionals have not revealed when they intend to start shifting the guns. A statement disclosed that their representative had met with the General's international decommissioning commission eight times since March and more talks would be held. The proposal by the I.R.A is at least a step forward. The Unionists say that it falls way short of decommissioning but I prefer it that the I.R.A made a move, no matter how small, than no move at all. The way life works is that you start small and then work to larger things. That is what I think the I.R.A are doing.      I never really understood the need for the decommissioning of arms as a prerequisite for peace talks in Northern Ireland. What will happen if or when, after the hand-over and destruction of all IRA arms, the whole process fails? What assurances will the Nationalists have that, rightfully or wrongfully, without the security of threat that their arms bring, they will not be in a far worse position? Decommissioning of arms was never an issue in the Macedonia peace talks nor in the Israel/Palestinian situation.      The day that IRA members are courageous enough to come forward carrying just some of their weapons and destroy them in front of neutral witnesses in a public place then everyone will be able to say the IRA has made a breakthrough and is genuinely trying to help the peace process. Until that day I can only praise the patience, not of the Unionists, but of the very many outsiders who have continued to work for peace while they have watched this terrible process drag on over the last 30/40 years.      All we hear from Unionists is the demand for the IRA to hand over their weapons. But we never hear from them that Loyalists should do likewise. Does it mean that Loyalists have the Unionist Party's blessing to keep Catholics further under their boots? I believe the Loyalists will never give up their weapons. Not so long as a Catholic resides in N. Ireland.      Let's just wait for the IRA to hand over a gun first, then we can get excited that the peace effort is moving forward.      In the years since the Good Friday Agreement was signed there has been foot-dragging and attempts to subvert the Agreement by both sides. The time has come to fully and completely implement the Agreement. For the IRA, this must mean giving up their arms. For the Unionists, this must mean reform of the RUC and an end to the implicit threats to the Catholic community represented by the ""Marching Season"". If both sides really want peace they must also cease to be so thin-skinned and learn to consider things from the others point of view.      In Northern Ireland there will be no magic bullets, historical turning points, or miracles. The troubles are too deeply rooted. The important thing is that the sides keep talking to each other and slowly, carefully, and with determination work towards the best solution they can get. It will never be ideal, for neither side, but talking is much better than exploding bombs or sheeting people in the streets. This IRA decision is another small step forward, on a road that is bound to be very, very long.      A paramilitary organisation is going to give up its arsenal, it is now sending clear signals that its policy on a united Ireland has changed. This may have taken many years of bloodshed and wrong choices but none the less it proves that the IRA was not interested in being terrorists as they have been branded in the media for so long. Only a committed military structure would be able to negotiate in such a way as to see the future of peace. When a timetable has been set by the IRA and the decommissioning body, the ball will drop into the unionist side of the net and Mr Trimble etc. won't be able to lob it back, and he knows it!      Here we go again. How many times have we heard ""promises"" from IRA/Sinn Fein? The IRA will never, ever, decommission its weapons. Where are the details of this latest proposal? They haven't been released because no doubt the wording is so vague and meaningless as to mean virtually nothing. What a farce. Tony Blair and those in his Government responsible for this shambles should be ashamed of themselves. The IRA and Sinn Fein have played them for fools since day one - sadly it looks as if they were dead right.      Anybody with even a passing knowledge of the conflict will recognise this as a huge step forward. Those who do not recognise this, must surely have their real motives behind this process questioned. The ball has been passed to the Unionists. Let's see how they respond.      The IRA has done their part. It is now time for others to do theirs. The world is watching to see if unionists are just putting on an act or if they too wish peace.      Come on Trimble get back to the table, peace is worth taking another chance on. If it falls apart now ,what's the alternative, 30 more years of tit-for-tat another generation growing up bitter and twisted, no one wants that - this is the real deal      Viewing this whole drama from a distance, the only deal I observe is the U.K. government trading ""working for peace"" P.R. for appeasement of terrorists. You would think the government of the U.K. would remember the centuries' lessons on appeasement      There will never be a ""breakthrough"" where divisions are this deep. There is no deadline on peace - only an end to peace. The majority need to want a better future and to keep working towards it. That is all.      Stopping the violence and continuing the peace process is good, but Andrew, UK has it right. This will be settled the day after the Middle East Muslim/Jewish problem is settled.      Demanding the IRA decommission is absurd! Do you want peace or not? With two bullies defending them the Unionists can disarm; but, the Irish Catholics have only one defender; the IRA. If Britain wants peace, then the British Government should give up Britain's claim to the Northern counties of Ireland, and allow a United Nations peace keeping force from neutral nations to oversee the peaceful transition from British rule to Irish rule. Otherwise, the democratic claims of the Unionists and the British Government must be regarded as      Has the IRA done enough? Yes, more than enough. Since the IRA declared a ceasefire, it has been the Unionist who have continued the killing. Plain and simple. If you read the GFA it is obvious the Unionists ""changed the rules in the middle of the game"". It has been the IRA who have been in the forefront of concessions and the obstructive tactics of the Unionists that has encumbered the process. If it were not arms it would be the RUC and on and on they go. I understand the fears of the Unionists who do not want to see their ""heritage"" i.e. their position of privilege, ended. The same was true of the segregationists in the US. It has and continues to change for the better in the US as it will in Ireland. As to the eventual uniting of Ireland, it is only a matter of a decade when the population shift will allow for the then majority, now the slim minority, to be heard.      The US took great pleasure in the death of Timothy McVeigh. However, it is people like him who Mr Klaes likens to the defenders of Irish Catholics. As an Irish Catholic I take great exception to Mr Klaes's comments. The IRA has never been, nor will they ever be, the defenders of Irish Catholics. There only contribution has been to intimidate Catholics from this Country. Infact the IRA and all other paramilitaries can do a great service to both communities in this country by handing over all illegal weapons - NOW.      How can we possibly know if it is a breakthrough? We have as yet to see any details. It is ridiculous to expect the Unionist Parties to agree to the deal when the details are still so cloudy. Furthermore, one can reasonably expect that even if the IRA destroys some weapons, they will retain many in other dumps the location of which have never been disclosed. Yet again, the IRA and their political surrogates try to appear reasonable while continuing to threaten the peace and safety of Northern Ireland.      The IRA's continued cease-fire, despite the ongoing and absolute provocation of loyalist violence, has consistently spoken volumes as to their commitment to peace through politics. The decommissioning clamour remains a smokescreen perpetrated by those opposed to power sharing and equality. No amount of goodwill on the part of nationalists will satisfy the likes of Burnside, Donaldson etc. Mark my words. Any decommissioning attempts will be met by further manufactured excuses.      We have heard all this before, and not one single ounce of semtex has been destroyed. Let the IRA be judged by their actions or lack of actions rather than by their Sinn Fein mouthpieces' promises. The ball is still firmly in the Republicans' court. the Unionist community have gone as far or further than any other community in the modern world to appease the fascist aggression shown by Sinn Fein/ IRA. Where else in the world would you have terrorists like McGuinness and Adams in government? Had George Bush put Timothy McVeigh( Oklahoma bomber/ terrorist) in charge of America's education, he would have been condemned by all and sundry. We must wait and see, let the IRA prove they are going to decommission. Promises are not enough.      Peace has been available for the taking. Unionists need to realise that they are giving nothing away and gaining everything. If it's peace they're after, it's within reach.      There is no doubt that it is a historic break-through, as there is no precedent for 'verifiably' decommissioning arms as a central component of the IRA's declared peace plans. It is unfair, unwise and mean-spirited to belittle its import as any concession in this process, as precariously balanced as it is, is so precious and rare. Nor is it of any value to cast aspersions on the sincerity of the offer. The ball is absolutely in the IRA's court and they are playing it just fine. I believe in Gerry Adams and my respect for him grows more profound by the day. This latest consideration for the transparency of the peace process validates and solidifies the Good Friday Agreement.      Another meaningless statement by IRA/SF, as usual backed up by their friends in Fianna Fail. When will the good people of Northern Ireland be free from the threat posed by IRA/SF? It's not as if these thugs have been observing any sort of a ceasefire.      This could well be a fantastic breakthrough. It is certainly one Unionism must grasp. However, decommissioning or not, reform of the judiciary and police should be carried out as soon as possible. Why is Unionism opposed? If reform is necessary (which it surely is) then reform will is right. Does the IRA holding on to its arms make reform any less right? Of course not. The majority of peace seeking people in NI deserve a just and equal society. If such a society existed, terrorism would have less fertile ground from which to grow.      The lack of a time-scale is a serious issue, and David Trimble has used the phrase ""all weapons"", implying that some destroyed weapons will not be enough. It seems to be another case of the two tribes telling each other that ""your half of the boat is sinking"". A curse on both their houses.      The gesture by the IRA is contemptible. By dragging out decommissioning, they can still pretend to remain democratic. The peace process needs to be radically reviewed. All Unionist and UK parties have an interest in peace. No one should leave it to chance. People should remember that Northern Ireland is still British; it is not the place of the IRA/Sinn Fein to dictate to others. Peace in Northern Ireland is a unique chance. It is up to the IRA/Sinn Fein to give up their arms. And represent people peacefully, not through violence.      My initial thoughts are much like Leon's (Manchester)- float the six counties out to the middle of the Atlantic. But I have spent time with the unionist community, and I am a democrat; all shades of opinion should be involved in running NI as long as they have a democratic mandate to do so. Sinn Fein should make the final split with the IRA, and should join with all in NI, the Republic and the UK in destroying all the remaining terror groups, whether green or orange in hue. Let's get the FBI, CIA, and EU security forces in there too - most of the have been involved already. On a final note, for those Irish Americans who seriously believe that ROI wants NI, I'll say two phrases- ""Gateway 2000"" and ""Euro Zone Interest Rates"". It's the economy, stupid!      The IRA have made their move and thus have shown commitment to the process. What have the Loyalists contributed?      It would be wonderful to think that this was a historic breakthrough, but as many have pointed out decommissioning is meaningless. Last week's Ealing bomb was made from commercially available fertiliser and other weapons can be replaced overnight. If the IRA does seem to give way, splinter groups like the Real IRA will take over and there will be no incentive for Loyalists to disarm nor will it be safe for the British army to withdraw. Like the current crisis in the Middle East, the underlying situation can never be resolved in a way which meets the needs and aspirations of all concerned. Meanwhile, just one person can run a bombing campaign and ensure that Ireland remains unstable. This is, literally, a no-win situation.      In this case actions must speak louder than words. I will believe it when the first weapons are handed over and publicly destroyed, and not before. This must be an open process where everyone can see weapons destroyed, and not just be told they were!      Of course this is a hopeful sign. Any type of proposal to remove arms from the grasps of terrorist groups has got to be welcomed. What excites me about this particular move is that it is the IRA themselves who have made the proposal. However, it ought to be met with the utmost caution and any such process is likely to take a considerable amount of time and further negotiations will be inevitable. Let us hope that all the other terrorist groups in the land follow suit and start making proposals for removing their arms. After all, this is no one-sided war.      With this move the Republicans have put the ball in the Unionists' court with the world watching their next move. The Real IRA farmyard bomb illustrated how ridiculous the decommissioning issue was. Nevertheless, the Unionists have got their wish. If they do not now embrace the Agreement fully and continue to pick and choose which parts they wish to keep, the world and history will have to deduce that Unionists have no interest in democracy and equality; a suspicion long-held by most in the local and international communities.      I can't agree with George M.Kleas' view that the IRA are the defenders of Irish Catholics. Anyone with an interest in Northern Ireland will know that many Catholics have suffered terribly at the hands of the IRA, particularly those who have dared to take a stand against the paramilitaries. If nationalist politicians were to endorse the proposals for a new police service, young Catholics would be encouraged to join, thereby providing their communities with an alternative to IRA ""justice"".      To George M. Klaes - The majority of people in Northern Ireland want to remain British. Whether they should ever have been there in the first place is another matter. It is not a problem of colonialism, but one of settlement, just like the Israelis in Palestine or, indeed, the Europeans in America (which happened at about the same time). Nobody gets more frustrated with the Irish - both Catholics and Protestants - than the British themselves, but what you ask is as sensible as asking for America to be entirely returned to the Indians. When you can get all 270 million Americans to agree to that, you will be qualified to propose a solution for Northern Ireland. Until then, you are welcome to join the rest of us in scratching our heads.      As long as sectarian attacks continue, it won't matter which paramilitary organisations decommission or don't decommission. If the various groups in NI continue to truly hate one another, weapons will find their way into the hands of the individual haters who conduct the attacks. Something more fundamental has to change in NI. The decommissioning ""issue"" is a red herring. "
HOC HOC-HH 1.71 " Palestinians continue to violate the ceasefire. What hypocrisy! The ceasefire will not achieve anything. It was never intended to achieve anything except to bring about a temporary lull in the fighting. How can it work when one side continues to enlarge illegal settlements and destroy people's houses? We can't fool ourselves by pretending that the major issue here is something else other than the occupied land. Give the land back. Thereafter you might have a justifiable reason for labelling others terrorists if they don't reciprocate.      There is no mystery about what can be done to reduce tension. The Palestinian Authority must abandon its war against Israel and accept UN Security Council Resolution 242.      There was no cease-fire. Both sides knew it well. The Palestinians never took a step forward to implement the cease-fire and the Israelis couldn't take a risk of letting down their guard.      Saying there even was a cease-fire is like saying the hurricane is over when the winds drop from 150 to 140 miles an hour. There never will be a cease-fire until one or the other sides get what they want: total subjugation of the Palestinians, or total destruction of Israel. Get used to it. This ""fight"" will continue for many more years.      A major reason why there may be no resolution to the Mid-East conflict is America's continuing support for Israel even when it is very obvious that the Jewish nation seems bent on emasculating, possibly eliminating the Palestinians. When America wants peace in that region, all she has to do is to apply some strong arm tactics as was the case recently when American aid to Yugoslavia was tied to the extradition of Milosevic to the International Court at the Hague to face genocide trials.      To achieve peace you have to deal with reasonable and sane people. Day after day Arafat proves he is not one of them. The sooner he and his circle are removed from power the sooner real peace begins.      I would like to share this memory of my visit to Israel in 1991. At that point the only real accords that Israel had was with Egypt - after the Camp David agreement. With this in mind I asked an Israeli border guard how relations were in practice with Egypt at a point near Eilat. What he said has haunted me ever since. ""We are not at war, and we are not at peace with Egypt"". I think that speaks volumes about the attitude in Israel, and perhaps about the attitude of the peoples of the other states bordering Israel.      Why does Yasser Arafat need a ceasefire if terrorism is his preferred method of negotiation? The PA nurtures the culture of violence through its schools and media. Ceasefire has been nothing more than a PR campaign.      What cease-fire???      What ceasefire? Israel has been facing 15-20 bloody terrorist attacks per day. You can't have a ceasefire when one side wants peace while the other (Arafat) wants war!      There never was a ceasefire. Ever since the signing of the Oslo Accords in 1993 there have been 85 suicide bomb attacks in Israel. About 20 of them took place since last September. If this is what the Palestinians have to offer, Israel is better off without any agreements with a people who don't intend to keep them anyway.      Many of the attempts to portray Israel and the ceasefire as the victims of Palestinian intransigence are based on a misunderstanding of the Palestinian position. For thirteen years, the Palestinian leadership has explicitly accepted a two-state solution (though really Arafat has been proposing it since 1973). The Palestinian parliament, the PNC, accepted Security Council Resolution in November 1988 by 253 votes to 46. By contrast, no major Israeli party has ever accepted anything other than a continuation of the illegal occupation by violent means. Attempts to portray some sort of equality of blame are fundamentally misguided.      To quote from the BBC's very own website, ""Arabs all over the Middle East have said it, time and time again: as long as Israel occupies Arab land there will never be lasting peace."" The Arabs view the entire Middle East as being their land, and as long as Israel exists, it will be on their land. Surely the only way to restore peace would be to magically move Israel to another part of the world, which the Arabs do not feel is their land.      I think it's more appropriate to call this a War process rather than a Peace process.      How can there be peace when the occupation still continues? When Palestinians try to liberate their country the west call it act of terrorism. If Israel returns their land back there will be no reason for Palestinians to fight. Remember that according to the UN, Israel must return the Palestinian land. There is never in history that the occupation force leave because of negotiation (peace treaty), so struggle is the only means to gain your property back. That is simply the fact of life, no miracle will happen today.      Make everybody leave. Give it back to the camels, make it a tourist preserve park. Can anyone really think of anything better? Sirs, I think this mail may seem to make light of the situation. Not the case. It is my way of expressing the futility and exhausting nature of this problem.      We are witnessing the birth of a nation - these people want their homeland. If Israel really wants peace, it needs to swallow that bitter pill - implement all recognised UN resolutions and go back to the negotiation table. There can only be peace when both sides realise the value of life; a Palestinian life is worth no more or no less than that of an Israeli. "
HOC HOC-HZ 2.99 " McVeigh's demise was justified and what he expected. The problem was it took too long and permitted the media to dramatise his behaviour. Forget him, he was nothing and certainly not a martyr, just a rotten murderer.      There is a sickly morbidly romantic element to it all. I heard they even served snacks there. I question whether the victims really found healing or closure witnessing Timothy McVeigh's death. I believe they went in there to view it with the same curiosity as drivers do when they slow down to see a traffic accident.      The biggest problem with McVeigh's execution is that it wasn't made public. Making them public will make them a deterrent. As for all the other nations that think it is wrong, I think the US would be happy to ship all the murderers on death row to your country so your people can pay to take care of them the rest of their days.      A man like Timothy McVeigh doesn't deserve human rights - he gave that up the day he murdered 168 people. If his execution gives even small comfort to the families of his victims then it is the right thing to do - nobody else has the right to say that they shouldn't be allowed this small piece of justice.      Execution won't help the relatives move on, if anything McVeigh's defiance, belief in his actions and composure till the end will have a negative impact on the victims friends and families. Essentially his execution adds one more to the total body count. Bush's statement that capital punishment is the will of the of the democratic majority who voted his administrations in was amusing, seeing as the popular vote went to Gore, Bush got the Electoral vote.      Most of us in Oklahoma City will be relieved that McVeigh can no longer keep his own name in the media. Now, if only the media would let him die too.      In 1995 I watched as the bodies and maimed were pulled from the rubble of the building and was sickened. How could someone do such a horrible act? Many innocents were killed in a horrible way. Yet Timothy McVeigh was executed six years after his horrendous act. There is a very lengthy appeals process that he went through before he died. And when he died he peacefully went to sleep. There was no such peace for his victims. He was not sorry for what he had done and he would have done it again had he the opportunity. I shed no tears for Tim McVeigh.      I am appalled at the way that this ""public lynching"" has been handled in this country. I am English but live in this country and woke up Monday morning to see the live media circus detailing exactly what may have been happening in the room where he was to die. I believe no man or woman has the right to kill another and especially in this public and so called ""acceptable method"". He committed an appalling act and should have been locked up for the rest of his life where he may have thought and suffered for his crimes. The government and press of this country should be ashamed at the way this was handled.      Something about the whole McVeigh case smells very fishy. As another correspondent has pointed out - why were so few federal agents killed in the blast? Why did the FBI suppress evidence at his trial? How could one man accomplish such a deed by himself? Regardless of whether it is right for the state to kill in revenge for murder, McVeigh should have been kept alive at least long enough for the whole truth to be uncovered.      A jury convicted McVeigh of murdering 168 people and sentenced him to death. They did so based upon the evidence and testimony presented to them. However, approximately one week before his execution and nearly four years after his trial the FBI discloses it failed to turn over nearly 4000 investigative documents to McVeigh's defence lawyers. This is evidence that the jury never heard or saw. McVeigh gets a 30-day stay of execution so his defence team can make what they will of the documents and file any appeals. What could they do in only 30 days? Virtually nothing of course! McVeigh is executed. Did he commit the heinous crime? Yes, he admitted it. Did he deserve to die? Probably. Did he get a fair trial? Absolutely not! Was his execution rushed for political expediency and a mob mentality? No doubt about it.      I am not saying that McVeigh was innocent. I am only trying to say, that he had tried to highlight the method the U.S. government treated the ones who had had some kind of different points of view. Think John Lennon! Was he really assassinated by a mentally sick person? Was he? Or: simply the federal authorities did not like the way he had been thinking, concerning the actual politics of the States. Now again another man, who had disagreed with state violence, became just the victim of it.      Tim McVeigh must have believed very strongly in something to willingly give his life for it. I'm sure that's what many are thinking. All the execution has done is created sympathy for him and his ideals. Surely this cannot be a good thing for the American government.      For those considering some alternative to capital punishment (i.e. confinement), there is NO guarantee it would work. Sympathisers could hijack planes demanding McVeigh's release. The anti-capital punishment folks would be the first to plead for McVeigh's release to save hundreds on a jumbo jet. Where were Europeans during the massive deaths (ethnic cleansing) next door? Americans were aghast that Europeans would take no action to stop the mass killings. However, now we hear bleeding hearts sympathising with a mad bomber who not only killed 168 but also injured many more, impacting even more families. It's one thing to sit back and theorise, and yet another to do justice, set an example and assure the host of affected families McVeigh won't be released, EVER.      Try explaining McVeigh's execution to a six-year-old. That child will be implanted with the idea that it is OK to kill. Need I say anymore?      In the 70s there was also a fierce discussion in Germany about the death penalty for the RAF terrorists. But looking back from a current viewpoint, it was good not to change our basic law on this aspect. It could only have become worse. Mr McVeigh's death neither will save money nor avoid future victims for the US in the long term. There is too much discussion in the US about reacting on crimes instead of trying to avoid as much crimes as possible. I'm not always happy how our state is dealing with criminals. But if I'm looking at the result and the development in the last ten years, I must agree that the chosen politics have proved to be highly efficient.      Clive from England, wrote ""the millions of dollars that would have been spent keeping him in secure custody for the rest of his life is now available for something hopefully more constructive"". It actually costs more to execute someone in the USA than to keep them in prison for a lifetime. The high cost of execution is driven up by the lengthy appeals process.      Well done America. Leading the rest of the world in compassion and human rights, right back into the dark ages. I wonder if the death penalty would be ""just"" if it were not profitable. McVeigh called the victims of his crime ""collateral damage""; I wonder who taught him to say that? What you sow, you reap, the US should be thankful if they have dry seasons.      Timothy McVeigh was a model product of middle-class America's gung-ho paranoia. He was brought up facing society in simplistic and naive terms of good vs. evil, and was treated by that society in much the same way. These acts of reciprocal vengeance, along with the theories that nurture them, have no place in a country that aspires to be called civilised.      One must keep in mind the history of the US when looking at its use of the death penalty. As recently as 100 years ago, there was still much of the country that was unreachable by traditional courts and police, and justice was a few guys and a length of rope. This frontier mentality will not go away overnight and is a part of US psyche. The death penalty will eventually be eliminated as it has in most of the industrialised world, but because of the history of this country, it will take a while. People must also remember that because the US Supreme Court has ruled that the death penalty does not violate the Constitution the US government cannot outlaw it outside of federal jurisdictions. Each state would have to pass its own legislation or a constitutional amendment would have to be passed by Congress and then ratified by each state to abolish it throughout the country.      A murderer kills people. The state of Oklahoma will kill a murderer and call it justice. Can you see the sick resemblance? McVeigh was killed, but did it do any good? What did we get out of it except the satisfaction of an inhuman revenge?      To all the high-minded moralists wringing your hands over poor Timmy, go back and find the picture of that brave fireman cradling the broken body of that little girl. Tell her parents why the evil monster who killed their child should be allowed to spend his days in relative comfort. The only justice can be to have this monster removed from this world to meet his final judgement. I am glad to know that no longer even 1 penny of my taxes will go to keep McVeigh alive      Timothy McVeigh was a fool who seems to have suffered paranoia mixed with military training. A bad mix. But my point is not that. I worry about the hierarchy of value of life. Several times, before I gave up reading, I saw mention made of the fact that children were killed. Why are children seen as more valuable than women and women more valuable than men? As a male adult I am sad to find myself at the bottom of the human heap. Surely all life is of equal value.      I do not feel killing Tim has helped any of the victims and their families. As one of them said after the execution, they could only feel better the day they die. So really the death penalty does nothing to change or stop the pain of the victims. If Tim had been given life in prison I am sure that he would have been tormented more and probably he would have regretted his actions.      Maybe it is high time those people who are so opposed to the death penalty (and all other severe forms of punishment for crime) think a bit about the victims of crime. Instead of focusing so much attention on how the 'poor' murderer is suffering or on how the 'dear' bank robber or drug pusher is stressed they should think of those whose lives have been destroyed by such heartless people. Maybe if the victims of crime are made the focus of attention, then people would think twice before defending and saving criminals!!      It's really a simple equation. Dead criminals don't commit crimes. That's it      The execution of McVeigh has not really achieved anything, apart from about 30 minutes of self-satisfaction, to those whose lives had been destroyed by such a horrific act. In the long term nothing has been achieved and we have given McVeigh status and position in society, as well as in history. The fact that people were stood outside with banners saying, ""Thou shalt not kill & Live 168"" totally goes against what they are claiming to stand for, but that is very easy for me to say as I was not, nor am I a victim of such an evil person.      Should Tim McVeigh have done what he did? Absolutely not? Should he have been executed in response? I honestly don't know. The death penalty is an issue that my conscious wrestles with whenever the reality of it confronts me. Clearly this is the case with many of the people who have made comments on this page. I'll be humble, and say I don't know if it's right. But the fact that we undergo such soul searching gives me hope for the future of mankind.      It's funny how people in other countries speak out against the US death penalty statute. If you don't like it, stay in your own country! I don't think that there is any country in the world that is ""saintly"" and ""forgiving.""      If we take the position that punishment is about making a man face the consequences of his actions then death penalty is fundamentally flawed. Tim McVeigh died still believing his actions were justified. If he had been made to spend the rest of his days in jail he may have reached a point where he could apologies for his actions and for the misery he caused.      Personally, I don't believe in the death penalty. I think life and death should be determined by GOD. I do not support McVeigh's action in any shape or form. However, there are thousands and thousands of people in the United States who have committed murder. They are on the death row for years and years. The life of one human is just as valuable as the life of 168.      I am not opposed to the death penalty categorically, but I do think there are crimes that deserve capital punishment. While I do not agree with the selective and seemingly arbitrary way the death penalty is applied in the US, I do believe that Timothy McVeigh got what he deserve. Indeed, he wanted to die. In my opinion, his spirit was dead a long time before - a victim of his own hate. The government only finished the job by killing his body.      If we do not punish convicted rapists by raping them, why do we punish convicted killers by killing them?      Yes, Tim McVeigh is no more. Will it solve the agony faced by the relatives of those 168 killed in that bomb blast? If this is justice what should be the name given to those people who kill in thousands in the name of justice and democracy (including children, women and innocent civilians world over). Why aren't they called mass murderers. Why can't they think of the feelings of those people. I think there is no justification in this case when there is no justice at the top.      The death penalty isn't a deterrent. All it achieves is to save money by not having to lock up the murderer for a life sentence(s).      Surely Timothy McVeigh's legalised murder can do little else other than perpetuate man's inhumanity to man. It is to be hoped that the forces that shaped this man's actions and thoughts will not be overlooked in some people's new found zeal for martyrdom. The truth is that McVeigh was trained by a government to kill and to regard his victims as collateral damage.      Yes, something has changed, an unrepentant murderer is no longer a future threat to our children, and the millions of dollars that would have been spent keeping him in secure custody for the rest of his life is now available for something hopefully more constructive.      Capital punishment is wrong. And Mc VeighALs execution proves just that; If one considers that the strongest argument in favour of capital punishment is the element of deterrence, then it's easy to see how in cases like Mc Veigh's capital punishment is ineffective as a deterrent to others. The twisted perception of things that McVeigh had, which led him to the heinous crime he committed could not be deterred by any form of punishment that can be handed down by humans. His execution rather completed the cycle of events as he envisaged them, creating a legacy of evil and death that I sincerely hope no one else will follow.      Tim didn't deserve to die. There is no way a 7000lb fertiliser bomb can cause the devastation that happened in Oklahoma. Also, why were there only a handful of ATF agents in the building on the day it was blown up? Normally it would be full of agents. Did the government/FBI/ATF know about this planned attack? You can bet your bottom dollar they did.      Justice was served today. McVeigh killed 168 people, 19 of which were children. These people weren't given the choice to live or not. McVeigh made the choice for them. If there was ever a time for capital punishment, this was it. McVeigh received what he deserved, death. Today there was no vengeance, only justice.      All my life I've been told that killing is wrong, and I'm sure children in America are taught the same thing. Yet when they grow up, they might end in a position where they're killed by their own country - the country they helped shape and create. They did in fact pay for their own death. It's no secret that the USA has an extraordinary amount of crime, yet they show no interest in reviewing their own society. I live in a country (in a part of the world, for that sake), that condemns the death penalty to the end, and still we have one of the lowest crime-statistics in the Western world.      Having read the comment of one of the witnesses that McVeigh calmly died looking as though he would do it all again, the pointlessness of execution is rather obvious. The kind of mad logic that leads people to kill is not swayed by the threat of execution. So why bloody the hands of innocent voters by having their government murder someone in what is simply revenge?      How could people stand in Indiana today with banners reading, ""Thou shalt not kill and live""? What on earth did they think was going on inside the execution chamber?      We are supposed to be humane and caring, and to be honest, the death penalty should have no place in our society. On the other hand, sometimes someone will commit a crime so heinous that the ultimate response seems justified. It would be wrong for me to criticise those who have been touched by this crime when they call for the death penalty. Who is to say I would not feel the same way if I had been so affected. My concern is not for Tim McVeigh but for the victims of this outrage who deserve our heartfelt condolences. The heartache for them will continue long after McVeigh is forgotten by the rest of the world.      Yes, it was right to kill McVeigh. Just why did it take so long? Six years of hell for all parties to this crime. I pray that we will never see the likes of Tim McVeigh again.      The fact that there is a public debate about the rights and wrongs of the death penalty, and concern for Tim McVeigh's fate, demonstrates the yawning gulf between us and him. He murdered those people without a second thought and would do it again, if given the chance. Some people are fundamentally ""broken"" inside and cannot be rehabilitated or mended - he was one of them. I view his execution in the same way that I would view putting a rabid dog to sleep - regrettable but necessary. The death penalty may or may not deter others, but it certainly will deter Tim McVeigh.      I am sure in common with many people I can't make my mind up if I am in favor of the death penalty or not. My basic instinct is that I am against the death penalty but in the face of such an horrific crime committed by McVeigh I am swayed in favor of it in his case. However, what I find disgusting is some of the US media coverage of his execution. Some of the journalist hacks seem to have a macabre interest in the whole business. For example on one broadcast they gave details of how he was to be dressed for his execution. The news broadcasters sit in front of their cameras preening themselves and feigning concern over McVeigh's victims and ignoring the serious debate over the morality of state killing, under the guise of ""presenting the news.""      As the hour approached for the execution, I felt sick inside. What is the matter with us, as a civilised society? How can we say, ""It is against the law to take a life, so we are going to kill you""...? We are now in the 21st Century, and we should be more civilised and humane. I do not condone what Timothy McVeigh did, and my heart goes out the families. But we need Justice, not revenge. He should have had life imprisonment and hard labour, ....no-one deserves to die, and no-one has the right to take a life. As a human race, we should be ashamed.      I have no doubt in my mind that what was done had to be done. No one can just sit back and forgive a man who took away so many lives, including little children who had so much to give the world. This execution was the correct and only attitude that could be taken. I hope that other countries look at this and reinstate the death penalty for men without soul such as McVeigh.      I'm sure that some of those people who feel that executing McVeigh has saved them a few tax dollars, can rest assured that they now have a larger disposable income to continue to fund terrorism in Northern Ireland, while deploring its presence in their own country! As you cosseted Yanks are so fond of saying, ""wake up and smell the coffee""!      I fail to see how justice has been done here. There seems to be no viable argument for wilfully ending someone's life, murderer or not. Who benefits from Timothy McVeigh's death? Are the families of the Oklahoma victims any happier now that he has gone?      Today was a sad day indeed; sad in two respects. For many, it brought back the painful memories of that day in 1995 when 168 people lost their lives, needlessly, in one of the worst tragedies ever known. It was also a sad day for humanity. What sort of society makes a law against murder, whilst allowing the greatest premeditated form of killing, that of execution? In my opinion, people who support the death penalty are accomplices to murder, very sick-minded individuals. The issue I am discussing here is that of the death penalty. I completely condemn what Timothy McVeigh did, and my heart goes out to all those people who lost friends and relatives. But if we take one lesson from this whole episode, it will be that the taking away of someone's life is wrong; free will extends to living as well.      The crime that Timothy McVeigh masterminded was cold-blooded mass-murder on a huge scale. He is now taking full advantage of the opportunity to mastermind an equally cold-blooded and spectacular punishment for himself. This execution is likely to make him a martyr to all those who share his ideas, while leaving our society worse, not better, for having danced to his tune.      My greatest concern is that Mr McVeigh's execution will make him a martyr to the ultra-right. Put him in a cell and forget about him. Let him grow old alone in a cage. But don't give him the opportunity to inspire others to acts of terrorism. There is not one thing about this man that is worth risking the lives of others, including his punishment.      I am not clever enough to say whether he should die but perhaps the reason why he caused the deaths should be looked at more closely.      The death penalty is wrong. It makes no difference how many people Timothy McVeigh killed - they will all still be dead on Tuesday. Almost every civilised country has dispensed with the death penalty. And few developed countries have murder rates equal to that of the United States. My fellow Americans, this isn't working. Wake up and smell the human rights.      McVeigh deserved this end. A man who kills others forfeits his right to live. It was found out at the trial that he was annoyed at the action of the government in Waco and planted a bomb in the Federal Building. This was sheer madness to kill those who did not have anything to do with the Waco affair. If his feelings were so strong he should have given vent to them by killing these officials who were responsible for alleged killing in Waco.      It's easy to sit in judgement of the death penalty, and McVeigh's execution. The anti-lobby bunch fail to recognise the relatives as always. It's probably their one chance to truly move on after his death. Revenge is no substitute, but at least they can live their lives knowing justice has at last been done. Letting him live would be a great burden and daily reminder for all the victims' families. Just think long and hard about this!      I am a Christian and I believe that killing another man is not anyone's job. Only the faithless can think that they are doing the right thing to punish a murder by killing him. I feel there are a lot of other better option to punish this person. Let him work for a cause throughout the rest of his life. This killing of a murderer is a crime perpetuated by the state in a modern world of peace and compassion.      Eye for eye will make the whole nation blind.      Why is everyone in England so upset about the death penalty in the US, but not upset with it in other countries like Saudi Arabia and China?      In examining the fascination people in this country had with this guy's execution, I must say I choose not be a dog with a piece of meat. That is exactly how his execution was played out. When speaking with people who are for the death penalty they said that justice was being done....I am afraid it was not. All that resulted was very much like a pack of dogs with a piece of meat but the only people being punished were Mr. McVeigh's family. In spite of what he has done, killing him did not solved anything except bring the death toll to 169. "
HOC HOC-JQ 3.4 " Camelot should not break the rules and shame on Chris Smith suggesting that they should pay up! Anyway, haven't the Totts earned a considerable sum from the newspapers for making an act of stupidity into a news item? They are better off than they were, so what is the problem?      Bottom line - did they or did they not hand the ticket in before the deadline? No, therefore they lost, as you would in any other competition.      I think they should pay out the money to the last but one winner.      Hands up all those who had teachers who fell for the ""dog ate my homework"" excuse! Same difference - the responsibility is on the user to protect their piece of paper. The rule is clear - no ticket, no claim.      They should have read the regulations in the small print. Where is the small print? On the back of the lost ticket!      I can't believe that this is actually ""news"". The lottery rules state that unless the winning ticket is produced, no payment is made. End of story. Why should Camelot make an exception? The couple knew perfectly well the rules and conditions when they bought their ticket, why should they change just because they were stupid enough to lose it?      When a government minister says Camelot should pay up regardless of their carefully kept rules to avoid fraud, then we can see the row for what it really is - a cheap attempt to have us argue the toss on a totally irrelevant matter compared to the mess of foot-and-mouth. Biggs and Co are also providing a clever diversion - who needs spin doctors when you have the Sun?      The rules are quite clear. If you wish to claim a prize then do not lose your ticket. It is as simple as that!      I think Camelot are right in their decision. What proof do they have that the people won the prize without seeing the ticket? It's called ""hard cheese"", careless people. It would be unfair for them to have the money without proof, as many others won't have won anything at all either - they just have to keep trying like the rest of us and be more careful with their tickets. Anyone can say they won the money but lost a ticket - who's to know who is being honest?      I can't understand how anyone can buy a ticket in a lottery and then not look to see if they have won. It's tough luck, but follow the rules that you agreed to when you bought the ticket.      I believe I'm right in saying that to collect Premium Bond prizes over a certain value you have to produce the actual winning bond, even though Ernie will have a record of your name and address. Obviously if Camelot paid out in this instance then the rules for ALL competitions which require the production of ticket would have to be changed, wouldn't they?      Give them the money! If they have proved they bought the ticket then they deserve to get their prize. Nobody deserves to think they are going to be millionaires only to be told go away and try again.      This is not an attempt at fraud, Camelot are satisfied that the ticket was purchased and the claimants purchased it. To all who say 'rules is rules', you won't go through life without coming up against unbending officialdom. It's frustrating when it's a library book fine, when it's 3 million quid I think a little compassion and commonsense is needed. I think Camelot should advertise unclaimed prizes over #1000 at the outlets where the tickets were sold.      The 30 day rule is not very apparent and was little known until this case. Camelot ARE satisfied that the couple were genuine winners. Paying them out would not lead to a flood of claims as each claim has to be verified anyway. I think Camelot should pay out, OR should make sure the rules are published were everyone can see them. Why didn't Camelot tell the couple straight away about the 30 day rule, instead of making them wait 45 days?      The media must really be scraping the barrel for stories if losing a lottery ticket is considered so important.      Much as it pains me to say it, as I do not approve of Camelot, the company is quite correct in refusing to pay. Imagine the queue of 'lost ticket' claims every week from now on if Camelot were to concede this claim.      I forgot to buy a lottery ticket but would have picked the correct numbers. Surely Camelot should have compassion and pay me! A. they bought a ticket and didn't check the numbers. B. They lost the ticket. C. They failed to claim for the lost ticket within the 30 days. Sounds like they should be happy that they remembered where they lived when returning from the newsagent in the first place.      People would change their tune if it were their ticket. We are all human, we all make mistakes and lose things - Camelot should pay up. This is NOT their money to keep. I think the Government should make them pay up or withdraw their license to print money! If Camelot thought this was going to happen to them, I bet the couple would have the cheque in their bank before they could blink.      Rules are rules. It's a real pity for that particular couple but there is no point in having regulations if you do not stick by them.      While my sympathies do go to the claimants, I have to side with Camelot on this one. The rules of the lottery apply to everyone and a thing like the lottery would turn into a mockery if the rules could be bent or broken whenever someone feels hard-done-by. I would have a lot more sympathy if they had the ticket but fell outwith the normal claim window, but we are talking about a lost-ticket claim and people should feel damned lucky that they get 30 days at all - as one guy from the states said here, it maybe should be no ticket - no prize. I wonder if people can claim if they forgot to actually buy the ticket, even though they get the same numbers every week...      What a pair of pratts! No ticket, no proof, and therefore no prize. Anyone could claim they bought the winning ticket then lost it. Maybe this couple did always buy a ticket but forgot this time!! Hence the reason why they are kicking themselves now. That's the whole point - who knows! Bad luck to this couple but hardly a tragedy      I think it is sad the couple lost their tickets but the rules and regulations should be kept in this country. Anyone can say they lost their tickets when there is no claim of a winning ticket. I strongly feel in UK the rules and laws should be kept as it is. Rules are there to be obeyed and the British should obey them not break them. I think the couple are very selfish to ask Camelot to pay them. I don't think they are entitled to anything. Sorry!      We agree that Camelot must not pay the prize to this couple. Rules have to be kept. They were not responsible enough to take care of their ticket. They had the opportunity to claim within 30 days, and they didn't claim in this period. The argument of compassion is not relevant in this case. Beside, the other winners, don't have the same rights, and this ""stressed"" couple simply had bad luck. No ticket, no prize.      If Camelot are satisfied that the people have genuinely won then they should pay out on compassionate grounds. But the 30-day claim rule is a bad one. It should simply be no ticket, no pay out. That would get rid of any doubt and be fair. The other 114 ""winners"" who claimed this particular prize show the need for an unambiguous rule.      The comments made by Culture Secretary Chris Smith to give them the money were nothing less than cynical vote catching. The couple said on TV that the stress of this dispute was putting their marriage at risk. I think this sort of comment is a sad reflection on Britain in the 21st century when money and celebrity are all. They lost the ticket, tough luck. It is their own fault. Don't give them the money.      Of course in the small print it probably says they don't have to pay if they don' feel like it. Get Premium bonds instead - they always pay out no matter how late the claim!.      A 30-day claim period for winnings is very convenient for Camelot. It saves them a lot of work and so of course they don't want to bend the rules. Having spent 15 years in the gambling business I think 5 years should be the minimum, especially because, as most people don't expect to win, they are not too prompt when it comes to checking their ticket. I personally am bad at checking my tickets. (When I do get one on a rollover). It's the disappointment of looking and finding I've only got one number.      Give them a million then they have both scored.      There has to be a time when you accept your misfortune. They should accept reality and stop whinging.      Living in the US, I am amazed that the UK lottery would even consider paying out on a lost ticket. Not an option here. You either have the winning ticket or you don't.      So the money goes to worthy causes, to be honest I can't see how you can argue against that when it is entirely within the rules.      Bravo to Camelot for giving it to charity when for certain sections of the media perversely that seems to be the wrong decision. They've made a potentially unpopular choice but one that will benefit charities, Camelot should be applauded.      Camelot are being utterly mean and cruel. They talk about precedent, but personally I think they are doing more harm to their image with the mercenary treatment they are giving this couple now. How can you let ticket-holders get so close only to tell them that on some mundane legal technicality hidden in the fine print they just missed out on the dream of a lifetime? Camelot should have used their discretion. Rules should not preclude compassion or else we are living with Big Brother.      In Spain, if you play the lottery and you lose your ticket, you cannot claim for it and you won't get the prize money. Additionally, if someone finds your ticket, it becomes their ticket and not yours. We don't understand why it is such a great subject of discussion.      Graeme, England: You make a rather sweeping statement in saying everyone wants a non-profit lottery. The bottom line is who will offer the most money for good causes and the biggest prizes. If the company that does this also happens to make a profit then it is still in the best interests of the public. As for not having say in things that affect you, if you don't like it don't play it simple as that.      You miserable bunch of curmudgeons! I think that when an absolute one-off like this happens, I really don't see the harm in showing a little compassion and good will and paying out. You'd all change your tune, if it were you who had lost out!      Why should Camelot pay out this time around? I won #1.5m but forgot to claim within the allotted time of 30 days. You don't hear me complaining now, do you?      As they say: ""you lose... you lose!""      Camelot have had their share of controversy recently and this is yet another PR blunder. The error was not in their decision not to pay out, but in their decision to investigate the ticket at all. They should have simply said that the claim period for lost tickets had expired and left it at that. I really do feel for the unfortunate Totts, who were by inference led to believe that their claim might have been upheld.      Rules are for the blind obedience of fools and the guidance of wise men. I forget who once famously said that, but it doesn't matter; the point is, of course Camelot should pay out. The couple clearly won. What we are seeing is the completely business like side of a large organisation with absolutely no flexibility and no interpersonal responsibility. It would be nice to see a more human side to both Camelot and the general public.      Play by the rules - if Camelot refused to pay out on a ticket less than 180 days old then we would all be outraged - so why expect them to pay out on a ticket which is invalid? As for Mrs Tott's comment that this is the worst form of torture, I think a reality check is long overdue!      Why should Camelot pay up if the rules have not been observed? Paying sets a precedent and rewards stupidity. In any case, don't unclaimed prizes go to good causes? It isn't a case of Camelot keeping the #3 million for their coffers. At least the couple involved have been able to sell their stories to the tabloids for a bit of cash to soften the blow.      It is the player's responsibility to abide by the rules before agreeing to play the game. They should have simply claimed within the appropriate time limits. For #3 million I would have made very sure I did!      In order to claim a lottery prize, the only piece of evidence that is required is the lottery ticket. Is that too much to ask? Although, the situation regarding the Totts is really unfortunate, they lost their ticket and therefore should not be entitled to get a prize.      In any game there are rules. If you don't play by the rules, you cannot win the game. Anyway this couple's shameless exploitation of the media to try and win sympathy from the public has certainly backfired on me. Did anyone see the interview where the guy talked about ""having to keep a bottle of Jack Daniels by his bed to sleep"". I may have had some sympathy with a case presented differently.      I think they should move on and get off our TV screens! I'm a believer of fate and if it was destined to be yours, then it would have been yours. At the moment, they are being used by media to try to pull ratings. Try again this Saturday like everyone else.      Haven't we rather forgotten that the lottery is supposed to benefit good causes, and isn't just a get rich quick scheme? By sticking to the letter of the rules, the operator has guaranteed that the good causes benefit. If winning the lottery is so important, then take better care of the ticket.      I know that if it were me I would be utterly convinced that Camelot should pay. The trouble is that it isn't me and so I find myself thinking that the rules are clear and were set at the lottery's inception and therefore to be fair to all, they should be observed.      There's a lot of vindictive commentators on this one. They won, Camelot agrees that they won so it should pay - undermines the integrity of the lottery indeed. Yes they were daft to lose the ticket but for Camelot to keep them hanging on for seven weeks just to re-confirm that they weren't going to pay out is nothing short of torture. Still, I think it's very noble of everyone else who has commented so far to agree that if they were in the Tott's position they'd just shrug their shoulders and say 'Ah well, win some, lose some.'      Technically, the Totts have no right to a prize because they have no proof of winning. Rather than relying on 14 million to one longshots, they should use their entrepreneurial abilities and make the money through their own efforts.     As much as I think Camelot should have lost its license to run the lottery I must agree with them on this one. Stick to the rules - it's not like they're missing out on something they've worked hard for, get on with your lives!      As someone who thinks that the lottery is the best scheme yet devised to get the poor to pay for the recreation of the rich it seems to me that Camelot should pay up. In this game of chance it should be the chance of choosing the numbers that matters not the skill in keeping the ticket!      There are millions of people living on or very near to the breadline in Britain who buy and religiously check their lottery ticket for winners. This couple simply lost theirs, unfortunately such is life - no payout. Perhaps Camelot should donate the money to charity.      Legally, there is no obligation on Camelot to pay up. However, I think that in this particular case it is only just and equitable that they do. Yes, the winners should have kept the ticket or claimed early etc, but the fact that Camelot admits it knows they are the true winners should mean that they pay up. It will not open floodgates, as it would be in Camelot's discretion as to who they admit to be true winners in the future. I also think the winners should then donate most of the money to charity, but that's another story!      I wonder how many of the people who agree with Camelot not paying out would say the same thing if for some unfortunate turn of events they were in the same position. OK, rules are rules but why is it a 30 day rule when Camelot have admitted that they are sure the Totts are telling the truth? Camelot were quick enough to get the decision of the Lottery Commission to only deal with the Richard Branson lottery bid. Double standards?      These people claim the ""stress"" is straining their marriage. Has ""till death do us part"" really become cheapened to the point of ""till you lost the winning ticket""? If their marriage means so little to them let them part, let them miss out on the #3m and lose each other into the bargain.      I think it's unfair for a struggling company like Camelot to have to cough up that sort of dough, it's not like they've got money to waste is it? Mind you I bet Richard 'Man of the People' Branson would have paid up.      This has to be the ultimate ""Jobsworth"" attitude. It will make absolutely no difference to Camelot to pay up. It is not in dispute that these people bought the winning ticket so a simple gesture of good faith by the company would go a long, long way to repair their public image as greedy fat cats. The whole country wanted a non-profit People's Lottery not one that stuffed its own pockets, but as we don't have any say in things that directly affect us, this is the least that Camelot could do.      I can't understand why people buy lottery tickets and then forget to check them. Perhaps Camelot ought to stop advertising unclaimed prizes because there is a very good chance that 6 months down the line the ticket will be lost.      It doesn't come much easier. You pick 6 numbers, pay #1, get a ticket, check your numbers and if you have won you are a millionaire. People who cannot master this simple set of tasks do not deserve the money.      Tough Totty! I'm behind Camelot. The whole idea behind tickets is that they are evidence of contract. You lose your ticket, hard cheese. Camelot makes it quite clear that claims need to be made upon the surrendering of tickets within a specified period. The Totts were on TV bleating about how hard done by they are while the woman from Camelot was perfectly reasonable. As for Chris Smith saying Camelot should pay up - that's a cheap price of pre-election propaganda if ever I heard one.     Surely there is a point to having rules and deadlines? They don't just have them for fun!!      No - Camelot do not pay out. It's a very simple rule, buy the ticket, retain it and claim if you win. If you are stupid enough to lose it - tough!!! A softening of this rule would open flood gates of bogus claims and expose Camelot to further criticism, which in the light of their past performances they can do well without.      This case has shown that you must keep tickets in a safe place. If the Totts have lost their ticket - TOUGH! They should be more careful and not to lose things. Get into a routine and place the ticket in a safe place, by the phone, on top of the TV etc. I have won 1x#91 (4 numbers) and 4 or 5 #10 and I always collect my winnings on the Monday if it's a Saturday draw or Thursday if it's a Wednesday draw. The earlier people collect their winnings, the less of the chance they lose the ticket.      If you lose the ticket and don't claim the prize you miss out. Those are the rules which have to be upheld. If they were to relax the them, it would then be entirely reasonable for people who found old tickets (i.e. over the 180 day limit) to expect to be paid even though they had lost any entitlement. It is unfortunate for the couple concerned, but it's not as if they have lost anything - they never had the #3m in the first place. All they have lost is some dreams.      Rules are rules and should be kept by.      I won a tenner a couple of years back, but unfortunately lost the ticket, and was told that I couldn't claim my prize. This was the ruling then, and this must remain the ruling forever. What's good for one is good for everyone else, and if they do hand out the three million, then I also want my ten pound prize from two years ago, and I am sure there will be others demanding the same thing.      I don't feel that Camelot should have to pay up but at the same time they should not be allowed to pocket the money either. The fairest option would be to give the money to charity.      Two weeks ago a cheque appeared through my door. It was from the football pools. I have a standing entry with a direct debit. No paperwork to lose and I don't even have to check the numbers! "
HOC HOC-MK 1.75 " How can a man be so intelligent and yet so obviously stupid. Tony was spot on when he said, ""Peter needs his own Peter"".      There is no doubt that he should have resigned. There is more than lack of political judgement in bringing him back into the fold after his last sojourn in the wilderness.  If Mandelson had really done nothing wrong - then he would never have resigned, he had too much to lose. The bloke can only be described as ""dodgy"" - he has become Labour's equivalent of Geoffrey Archer.  Whatever Mandelson's precise role in the 'cash for passport' fiasco, the abiding observation must be that the man is a walking gaffe. He should never have been readmitted to the government after Mortgage-gate and I, for one, would be grateful never to hear of him again.  It doesn't look good on Blair either . Basically he has given him 2 chances and he has let down everyone including himself. He must not be allowed to be in govt again.  Mandelson is the most intelligent politician of his generation - this is a sad loss for the country.  This is a surprise, I didn't think he would resign. I don't see where he did anything wrong, but now that he has resigned, one wonders if he was asked to by Mr Blair.  Government should be open - saying that you 'forgot' about a conversation is just not good enough. Blair should have sacked him to show strength, as soon as he realised that Mandelson hadn't been 100 per cent truthful first time round.  Yes. What I wonder is how long he will be out this time. Twenty, thirty minutes?      Okay so this is the second time he has gone in just over two years; and for what? Being caught. Being caught at what? Not telling the truth. Which is something all politicians seem to do. So perhaps he was just not that good at one of the basic qualities for the job. However Tories take note - a couple of low-level acts by a Labour politician does not give you the right to start slinging mud. We the electorate still remember the odious stench of your corrupt ways, and there is no evidence to tell us that you have changed, and are now fit to govern. Best we all forget about this sad affair as quickly as possible and go back to what are the real issues concerning the governing of this country.      I do not think that Peter Mandelson should have resigned over this scandal. It is no secret that Mr. Mandelson is unpopular within his own party, but I think that Labour have run out a good minister and the lack of Mr. Mandelson's influence will be evident in the next election.      The Hinduja brothers are multi-millionaires. They provide and create jobs in Britain (not to mention give a way millions in charity to British institutions). This is a ""Win Win"" situation for Britain & the Hindujas. If the Hindujas take their fortune and leave Britain, the country would be a net looser without a doubt. For goodness sake - recognise a good thing when you see it!      No Mandelson should not have resigned. The facts should have been properly established before he was forced to consider his position. The Government/Labour Party is clearly desperate to control events between now and the General Election, and we can expect more of this sort of thing.      There is no doubt that he should have resigned. There is more than lack of political judgement in bringing him back into the fold after his last sojourn in the wilderness.      Okay so this is the second time he has gone in just over two years; and for what? Being caught. Being caught at what? Not telling the truth. Which is something all politicians seem to do. So perhaps he was just not that good at one of the basic qualities for the job. However Tories take note - a couple of low-level acts by a Labour politician does not give you the right to start slinging mud.

I do not think that Peter Mandelson should have resigned over this scandal. It is no secret that Mr. Mandelson is unpopular within his own party, but I think that Labour have run out a good minister and the lack of Mr. Mandelson's influence will be evident in the next election.      No, I don't think he should have resigned for what he did, but he was pushed out for the sake of his party in the run-up to the election. I believe there is more to be revealed about him, so by keeping out of the way, he will, at best, do minimal damage to Tony Blair and his party      Perhaps he did mislead, maybe through just forgetting rather than lying - can you remember who you phoned two years ago? But I am sad to see a talented minister go through the voracious and vicious implications and innuendoes from the press. It's a difficult job to be in government. I don't think he will make a comeback - but - never say never.      A politician lying, fancy that. In a country where honest politicians are labelled ""loony left"" and other such puerile trash by the depraved ""free press"", then the only kind of politician you're going to get is a dishonest one. If you want honest government you need a society that will allow one to exist. Keep buying tabloid newspapers and you'll get a tabloid society. You get what you deserve.      No, if we're talking about the passport ""scandal"". This comes across as a simple mistake on Mandelson's part, and seems more like a non-issue in any event. Yes, if you review his resignation speech. This man was fed up. Perhaps, if you look at Northern Ireland. Too many of the principal players felt he had steered the peace process onto a sandbar.      Again Mandelson has shown his love of the high life and his contempt for the electorate. Whether he did help in getting the passport application through is irrelevant, what is important is that he thinks he can explain it away as just a mere phone enquiry on how the application was going through. Does he really think this is the same as one of the public phoning the Home Office? No Mandelson has again used his position of power to forward his own position, status and interests.      Aren't we all being a little precious here? If I have #100,000 to invest in Australia, I can get citizenship within the year. If I donate one million pounds to the Tories/Labour I can get a seat in the House of Lords. A couple of grand and I can buy another human being! The bloke's real crime was that he forgot the saying ""be nice to people on the way up because you're likely to meet them again on the way down"".      No, he should not have resigned. I do not recall Margaret Thatcher even hinting at resignation when the Zola Budd passport was arranged. This country gets more hypocritical by the second.      I would just like to say that this is yet another part of what I would call jigsaw-puzzle politics. This man has been broken by the media, who are we to know what really went on behind the scenes! Strange that Mandelson has practically been booted out for the second time, the whole affair is pathetic!      He is one of those people you love and hate. Hate him because he seems so aloof but love him as he is the model of an efficient politician. It was the worst possible thing that could have happened to Tony Blair this side of the general election. With Mandelson now gone, Blair has lost a significant amount of balance in his government; Brown will feel all the more powerful now and Blair will no longer rely on Mandelson to counter Brown's personal vision. More importantly, the country will obviously face a monumental decision in the future over further integration in Europe. Mandelson would surely have been relied on by Blair to spearhead a campaign in favour of the single currency at some point. But, putting all this aside, yes, he had to go. He has paid the price for courting the rich and powerful once too often and he has misled his colleagues in government on two occasions. Blair will win the election (a donkey would next to the Tory party), but his government will probably lose the argument over Europe, and elsewhere, in its second term.      Mr. Mandelson was the constant target of vicious sectors of the media, and the target of a Tory smear campaign and witch hunt, to the point where not even his private life was his anymore. Criminals have more rights than this man who wasn't even given the basic right to have some privacy in his personal life. He was betrayed by those he helped rise to the top over a ridiculously unimportant affair that could easily have been verified before everyone engaged in hysteria and lynch mob behaviour. He didn't have much choice but to go. It was not the right thing to do, but it may have been the only thing left for him to do under the circumstances. The right thing to do was for Tony Blair and Alistair Campbell to grow spines and not succumb to political pressure, and for Mr. Campbell to make sure he knows what the facts are before opening his mouth in front of the press corps. May Mr. Mandelson rise from the ashes once again.      I was very disturbed by the news of Mandelson's resignation. I didn't know much of the background, and what I heard on news headlines made no sense to me. Apparently Peter Mandelson responded to a call from the Hinduja brothers about their application for UK passports by making a brief enquiry to a home office minister. When the media started trying to make a big issue of this, there was a bit of confusion about exactly who said what. Also, the brothers had donated money to a good cause - the ""Faith Zone"" - in the Millennium Dome. Is there any more to it than that? I listened to William Hague's speech and some of the newspaper headlines. No more explanations. Yet the tone of what they said would have been more suited to a scenario of endemic corruption, where huge amounts of money were regularly going into the personal pockets of politicians to thwart the law of the country. The next thing I heard was that, right in the middle of important talks in the Northern Ireland peace process, a whole range of important ministers were being reshuffled. This is truly scandalous. I did wonder if I was missing something important, so I searched for more explanation. I learned that Peter Mandelson played a key part in publicising apparent wrong-doing in the Conservative Party, and that he is gay. Is it all about revenge and homophobia?      It's amazing to me that socialists can forgive their corrupt and dishonest politicians merely because the perpetrators are considered to be ""intelligent"". We have had that problem with Clinton I see the same pathetic excuses made for Mandelson. Double standards seem to be par for the course with the Left (Orwell figured that out years ago in ""Animal Farm"").      Sleaze/corruptness, what's the big deal. It has been and will always be a part of politics whether it's cashbacks, cronyism, the unwillingness to admit mistakes, distortion of the truth and facts, and the denial of basic human rights to a many UK citizens. These politicians know the score, politics is just a job and in the normal world of living, try these tricks and you're sacked. It's right corrupt politicians should go, they should go forever and not be allowed in parliament again. We need more Martin Bells.      Yes he was right to go. The whole affair stinks of sleaze with this Government giving whomever gives it money whatever they want. If they were denied passports originally why suddenly grant them in record time.      Why have so many people got a problem with Peter? He brought a certain style to politics that, for once, actually made it exciting. I hope he will be back one day, because New Labour was his dream, his concept and his passion. The Government has lost a genius and they'll soon find out about it.      Keith Vaz and Peter Mandelson said that they have done nothing wrong and that such practises were common practice. Now that is the underlying problem that corruption has become so common that people don't think there is anything wrong with it anymore. Why did the Hindujas phone Mr. Mandelson in the first place?If they wanted to know about their passport application they should have phoned the person dealing with it at the passport office (like anyone else has to) and not government ministers they know from private dinners.      Mandelson should never have even dreamed of making any representations in this affair. No one should seek to gain any advantage, however slight, in such a matter as this. How would the little guy from India ever get Mandelson to do this for him? Never. That's partly what makes it so unfair. If Mr Vaz has done anything like this, he knows that he's done it and he should resign now. Hague behaved exceptionally badly in the Commons at PMQT this week; but he is right to follow this story with vigour.      It is good that Mandy resigned because the Tories would have used this to attack the Government. I am a fan of Mandy because of his intelligence and I think even though he has left, he will still remain a secret weapon behind the scenes. All I can truly say is that he is just unlucky. What is all the fuss about? I hope he comes back soon but in the meantime, good luck Mandy      I think it's the ""only"" choice Blair could have forced. He promised a no sleaze approach and that is what the majority of people wanted from the start of the Labour term      It's a good thing he's gone, given that he wasn't particularly effective at dealing with Sinn Fein/ IRA, but it's a pity he's left in these circumstances. This obsession with scoring political points through petty, so-called scandals is a disgrace, and in my view serves only to undermine democracy.      I am a Labour Party member and no fan of Mandelson. However the success of the eurosceptic press in ousting a conviction politician and a euro enthusiast by almost yellow journalism is unedifying. Mandelson had character, love him or loathe, him unlike half the Blairist faceless backbench MPs.      I must admit I'm no Mandy fan but compared to what half the previous Govenment's dodgy dealings were, I thought his ""misdemeanour"" somewhat insignificant and I do not think he should have resigned. If the media knew about every MP's ""extra curricular"" activities, I think Parliament would be left with only the tea lady and Mo Mowlam to run it.      Good riddance to him. His intelligence has long been overplayed - he's a political lightweight (remember a Mandy speech anyone?) and a heavyweight smear-master. How ironic and pleasing that his downfall should come from his own media-spun sword once again. Goodbye. Please spare us any more repeats.      In any type of misadventure it is always the judgement of the man at the helm that is questioned first. The same should apply in this instance. Give the only life jacket to Gordon Brown and let Tony Blair should go down with his own ship.      Mr Mandelson was right to resign. The affair is about probity in government, nothing else. He was found wanting and took the only course open to him, even if he was pushed, rather than taking a voluntary jump. If Mr Vaz was also involved in furthering the interests of people applying for British citizenship, and if he received benefit from his efforts, in any way, then he too must stand down, before the Prime Minister is forced to take action as a result of the inquiry. This grubby saga is destroying the faith of ordinary people in the honesty of government ministers.      I think he did the right thing. Senior politicians need to be seen to not to lie and the scandal would taint the whole Government if he stayed. I worry what effect the loss of an outspoken pro-euro MP will have on the single currency debate though.      Yes. But I look forward to his curtain call. Isn't it just this kind of thing that makes politics fun?      It seems suspicious that he felt the need to resign so quickly if he wasn't 'pulling strings' for Mr Hunduja. You can't help but wonder that there must have been more to this story than just an innocent enquiry.      The whole Labour Government should resign on grounds of incompetence!!      I think it's a shame Mandelson had to resign. He's one of the most cultured and intelligent people in the Labour party. The reason he always seems to get in trouble is that there are plenty of people in his party who, for some reason, seriously dislike him and are constantly trying to trip him up... successfully this time.      I notice that the Year of the Snake has just begun. And therefore, I suspect, he will be back in less than twenty minutes. Perhaps the PM will announce his return during PMQs today... I wonder what the voters in Hartlepool will make of all this at the next election.      I think it is very sad that such an able man should be brought down again by what is after all a very trivial issue. If his political career goes no further (which I hope is not the case), I am sure that he will be remembered for his role in saving the Northern Ireland Assembly more than for making a phone call for a friend.      Peter Mandelson strikes me as the UK's most intelligent and articulate politician. This passport matter is relatively minor and indeed, unsubstantiated. When will Britain's media grow up? You've lost an able and efficient minister over nothing!      I would surmise that Blair asked ""Mandy"" to tender his resignation with the promise that once the dust had settled after the General Election, he would bring him back into the Government, for a third time, as Foreign Secretary. Blair, for some strange reason, cannot function without ""Mandy"" by his side. This Government is so arrogant that it thinks itself above the voters of the country. The election in May will give them a short sharp shock but alas not enough to make them come to their senses.      Now Mandy has relinquished the interminable problems of Northern Ireland he can concentrate all his efforts behind the scenes on the New Labour election strategy - or was this the plan any way ?      This affair only seems to highlight just what an aggresive society we have created. Just put one toe close to the line and, somebody will instantly slice it off. But is this really a healthy way to live? Some of our current heroes are olympic champions. But just how many of them, just for example, slipped into a boat and rowed to gold for the good of the country? Very few I would have thought. They did it for themselves. I don't have a problem with this, I just want to make people's motivation clear. Now at the same time, we have a minister, who did something to bail out a multi party doomed dome. The motivation here, is at the least, on part with the olympic ahtlete, and quite possible much more. By the way, I wonder if we would be getting this upset if it was a couple of rich Texan oil tycoons. Best regards      Who cares? Just give us Mo back.      I, for one, couldn't care less if I tried. What a dull man. Politicians are little weasels who pander to every pathetic whim in order to cling to power. If they had their way we'd all live in a semi in Milton Keynes and recite EU safety regulations to our families before eating our genetically modified dinners. Remember Mr Brittas? That's politicians I reckon. Dull, dull, dull. Good riddance to him. When are the rest resigning?      I live in Hartlepool and I think he should have been fired!      The Hinduja brothers have been under a cloud in India for a long time; to be so closely associated with them is rather brave of Mr Mandelson.      I really fear for David Trimble and the peace process in Northern Ireland now. To those who would call for his resignation as a matter of principle: is it really worth risking peace in Northern Ireland for political capital? What is this ""principle"", if a passport application is deemed to be more important than human lives?      I actually had the pleasure of meeting the guy on a few occasions. I always found him extremely dedicated and honest (contrary to his media image). He's a nice bloke and it's obvious some ""colleague"" in the Cabinet had it in for him.      Good riddance to him. He did absolutely nothing for the peace process in Northern Ireland.      The only reason he resigned is because he would have been sacked otherwise. And the only reason for that, is the upcoming general election.      Mandelson has quite correctly resigned quickly and, as usual, has no-one to blame but himself. However, for James UK to make the comments he does is typical anti-Labour distortion. After all, when did any Tory ever resign that quickly?      This whole affair raises serious questions on Tony Blair's judgement. Why on earth did he re-appoint Mandleson to the cabinet after his first resignation?      Given the political closeness between Blair & Mandelson and their joint involvement with the Dome why is no-one asking the question - what does Blair know about the Dome sponsorship, the passport issue & when did he find out ? It is inconcievable to me that he knew nothing before last week. I have no brief for Mandleson but I have a sneaking suspicion that he was deliberately sacrificed to save the leader      Perhaps this is evidence that Tony Blair should accept George W. Bush's invitation to Washington in order to learn about how to run a government with integrity?      Peter Mandelson seems to perform whichever role he is given extremely well, and behaves with more dignity than many other MP's - and certainly more than most journalists. I will be extremely sorry to see him go and am alarmed by the return to witchhunt journalism, based on rumour and prejudice. This ultimately pulls us all down to gutter level.      I'm surprised Mandelson was allowed back after his first debacle.      The media had it in for him. Northern Ireland does not need this kind of instability and maybe Fleet Street should have thought of that. We all know politicians are liars but a little white lie is not worth jeopardising the peace process. But, the English media has never really had any concern for Northern Ireland or indeed anywhere outside of London.      Not at all. The facts of the matter show that there was no wrongdoing, but as usual the power of the press ruled the day. I applaud Mr Mandelson for making this decision when he did thus sparing the Labour Party from the sniping and backbiting of Tory hypocrites and their allies in the media during the run-up to a General Election. His dignified withdrawal to preserve party reputation is in stark contrast to the squalid behaviour of the legions of real villains in the Conservative ranks.      I really did not think what he had done was such a big deal. I do feel however that no third chance should be given. Tony Blair must now pull away from assisting him further. If I was Mo Mowlam I would have a huge smile on my face right now      With a General Election on the horizon one must assume Blair said, ""Mandy, you are the weakest link. Goodbye"".      Whilst I am glad to see the end of Mr Mandleson's political career (for the time being), I cannot help but wonder if he is being made a scapegoat for Labour's problems. After all, isn't it a coincidence that his (forced?) resignation comes less than six months before a General Election?      Just goes to prove that politicians of all parties are a breed together.      I think this is most unfortunate - if it had been any other Minister there would never have been so much of a fuss made. How is anyone supposed to fully remember every detail of a phone call they made years ago?      The issue (which most contributors appear to miss) is not passport applications, donor money or Mandelson's abilities, but did he mislead or lie concerning the telephone call? If the Parliament cannot trust a minister then he has to go, otherwise UK democracy could not function.      Considering Mr Mandelson's stance on morality and truth, I do not think he is capable of performing a role in government. I do not think he should be let in the back door as he was after his first resignation. Do we need a group of Martin Bell's to get rid of this sort of cronyism?      Yes he was right to go, but no doubt he'll be back. I think they had to act quickly on this one due to the forthcoming election. I wonder if he'd have gone so quickly if there wasn't an election round the corner. I think it's generally known as ""damage limitation"" or am I being a bit cynical here?      What we have read in the papers today and what happened at Number 10 this morning are undoubtedly two different things. What we do know is that, far from having a hold over Blair, this is yet another example of the Daily Mails and the Daily Telegraphs of this world interfering with governmental decisions. What worries me is what will happen in Northern Ireland now. The last thing the people there need is instability caused by a ministerial resignation. I hope the right-wing elements of the press are proud of themselves for what they have done.      How sad that such a talented man should be forced out again by his own foolishness. Perhaps Mr Mandelson's greatest weakness was his desire for high office and to really make his mark on history as a minister. In fact he was surely one of the best 'behind the scenes' politicians Britain has ever seen. His ministerial career should now surely be over, as even St Tony can't raise Lazarus a second time! But don't bet against him playing a massive part in Labour's election campaign.      Yes. If only he'd take the rest of this wretched Government with him      Yes he should. Is this a record, resigned twice from the same Government in less than three years?      No. This is completely unfair on those of us who were looking forward to watching Uncle Tony wriggle and smarm out of another embarrassment. How selfish of him.      Oh, for heaven's sake. Politics is so bland these days we don't even get proper sleaze!      The 'whiter than white' promise is haunting this government. Mandelson has been hoisted by his own petard; by trying to wriggle his way out from what began as a fragment of news, has grown, through his own fault, to be his undoing. I would imagine his resignation will help the government - it isn't popular and aroused cynicism and suspicion.      Hang on a minute...      Mandelson should not have resigned. He is portrayed as a Labour party hero. He should have been tougher and waited to be sacked. He simply had nothing to lose. Resigning shows weakness. Heroes should go out with more of a heroic bang!      A major donor to a government project whom YOU dealt with, rings you up and asks you how to go about getting a British passport. Instead of cutting him off rather impolitely, you offer to put him through to a colleague (ministerial) who can help. You have an accounted-for 2-minute conversation, and the matter leaves your office until this week.      Exactly where in that sequence did he behave improperly? I personally do not think he should be in the cabinet myself, but this is clearly not something to resign over. The resignation just makes him look guilty.      Any hint of corruption, of any sort, must be dealt with severely to preserve the integrity of British politics. Is this just another example of Labour Minister's willingness to comply with the wishes of wealthy businessmen?      This is as honourable a decision as it is an unlikely one. His decision not only places his whole career in peril again, but also leaves the Labour party little room to rebuff claims of corruption by the opposition. Surely he could have ridden out this storm, taken a sideways move in the new Cabinet, and wait for the reshuffle to bring him closer to Mr Blair once again.      I take it then that when the usual summer passport delays occur that politicians will ""innocently enquire"" on behalf of the General Public - do not think so. Glad he had the sense to resign better late than never but for how long?      Mandelson is obviously a man with much needed abilities. It is a shame that Northern Ireland is losing his talents at such a critical time for such a prissy reason.      Of course he was right to go. Once is unfortunate, twice is careless. He should have admitted his involvement straight away. His lies mean that few of the electorate will ever trust him again. He may be good as a spin-doctor and adviser, but as a politician, he is a liability. I always thought he was a poor choice as NI secretary. Bring back Mo Mowlam!      Of course he was right to go. What with Northern Ireland go nowhere and an election looming? He was never going to get the accolades his predecessor, Mo Mowlam, got. Masterminding and controlling the election for the party is what he does best. After the election, with a job well done, up will come another ministerial post for him. The position he now finds himself in is so good it he couldn't have planned it better. No, no, no, surely not?      I think it's clear that this time Mandelson will be out of government for good; but I hope that the point has been taken that when a scandal like this breaks, politicians who try to save themselves by misleading the public stand to lose far more than face. Mandelson's career has been built on spin; perhaps it's only fitting that he's been brought down by it.      Would Mr. Mandelson have referred this matter to Mr. O'Brien if it was an ordinary Indian citizen who had approached him for a British passport rather than a billionaire who was in the position to make a significant contribution to the ailing Dome? If Mr. Mandelson can say yes to this question then he is unfortunate.      No Mandelson should not have resigned. The facts should have been properly established before he was forced to consider his position. The Government/Labour Party is clearly desperate to control events between now and the General Election, and we can expect more of this sort of thing.      He has done the honourable thing. I don't think he was guilty of any misdemeanour, but at that level in politics you are accountable to the country. So close to the next election, the Labour party needs to get this out of the way quickly, before it sticks in people's minds. Another good Minister bites the dust. A pity Mr Srichand Hinduja did not come to his rescue.      Scandalson?      Perhaps we could have a whip-round to get Peter an Indian passport?      I agree with Howard Bowen, 'Mandy' will be back in the Government within a year. I wonder how many 'lives' he has left?      He shouldn't have resigned - he should have been sacked. Clearly it's a case of someone who cannot be trusted and acts in an incorrect manner. He should leave the post of Northern Ireland secretary and let someone else handle it better than he ever could.      This is hilarious, he's resigned twice now and I'm praying Hague asks Blair when he will return during PM's questions this afternoon.      I wouldn't be as cynical as Mr. Bowen. It will be at least twenty-four hours before he returns.      While I don't believe he has done anything particularly wrong, the whole manner in which these new facts ""came to light"" portrays him as a man with profoundly poor judgement. Labour needs to focus on the issues that will get them re-elected and Mr. Mandelson has frequently been the source of Labour boat-rocking. His resignation will hopefully bring about more stability to the Cabinet as it prepares for the crucial election.      Peter Mandelson's position in the cabinet was untenable through the fault of no-one other than himself. No doubt Tony Blair will continue to defend Mandelson, however it should be plain for the electorate to now see what an appalling bunch of individuals make up the supposed 'team' that run this country. The ballot boxes in the next election should surely reflect the disgraceful way the Labour Party has conducted itself over the last few months.      It seems that Mr Mandelson has misled the House of Commons and therefore the country for a second time, this in itself is wrong, so of course he should go. He has let himself and his party down. "
JOC JOC-12A-05N 0.4 "I guess the number of gay people in Japan is much smaller than in America, so the gay marriage issue may not be so familiar to Japanese. However this might be one of the most biggest issue for people all over the world because this is related to the human rights. I believe it's freedom for all people to love somebody, but in reality most of the countries ban gay marriage. And I wonder why such many people in America are against the gay marriage. In my opinion, their rights should be defended.  I think that I agree with legalizing gay marriage. This is because there is individual freedom. Moreover, it is said that many gays have a lot of stress in their mind because they aren't accepted. So government should legalize gay marriage to relief their stress. If government legalize it, government should permit them to get tax benefits and adopt children. There are some reasons to support my opinion. Firstly, when they get a job, if they tell companies that they are gays themselves, some of companies may not employ them. Secondly, they need to get mental treatment. Furthermore, they cannot give birth to a baby so government has to consider adopting children. But, in view of politics, I think that Obama made a big decision. This is because Christianity ban gay marriage. Especially Catholic stick closely to Catholicism. In other words, Obama's remark is the same thing as throw away vote of Catholic. These days, there is the trend of accepting gay marriage. But I'm curious to see how it will turn out.  This is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. In Japan, it's the unrealistic problem yet. I suppose that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc.  By the way, media says Mr. Obama's approval of such marriage is one of election campaigns. I'm interested in eligible voters' movement especially young people.  I think that gay marriage is individual free. There is no reason for opposing, if they are fortunate. Why is it prohibition in the United States? I think that the reason is that children decrease in number. The gay couple should not have a child. Because a child needs a mother absolutely. And the child who grew up at the special home has a high possibility of running to wrongdoing. So I think the conclusion of this problem is very difficult.  For my part, at present, I can't agree to the same-sex marriage. It is said some people are afraid of being loved by gay people, and also said the birthrate in the country may decline. Both of them I 'm afraid too. On the contrary, however, these view may have some misconceptions. And history tells us that there were many gay people in ancient Greece and the Warring States period of Japan, which indicates the gay rights is not necessarily the problem specific to today. Moreover, the Japanese TV programs show that there are many gay people who is proud of themselves. The more Japanese people know them, the more they may be tolerate to the gay. In conclusion, now i'm against gay marriage, but in the future, I'll change my thoughts if I have more information about gay people.  I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. Gay people loves partners of the same sex as heterosexual people love opposite sex, so no one or no law cannot prohibit these emotions. Is the birth rate of higher priority than human rights? I don't think so. In addition to institutional manage, government should enhance the understanding of gay people to solve problems springing from prejudice against gay people such as difficulty in adopting children.  I experienced empathy with Obama's opinion. As there are so many people in the world, there are various ways of expressing love. So I think it is important to understand diverse love, and not to have a prejudice against gay couples.  When I live in Japan , I think that ""same-sex  marriage"" don't become the talk. In America, Mr Obama regards getting many votes for same-sex  couples as the way to win in a sense. Meanwhile Mr Romney is against gay marriage. It is true that increasing rights for gay citizens is very important but I think that in the USA the religion has something to do with all things as such life. So we will have to see how things develop.  This problem was hard to believe for me. In Japan, the number of same-sex  couples is extremely small and the problem is not a big problem compared with foreign countries, Perhaps because religion is involved, such as. I agree that same-sex  couples should be able to marry. If people fell in love a same-sex  by chance, I think it can not be helped, and I think it is good if they get along in life. The number of same-sex  couples in Japan is increasing recent years. I think the problem should be more considered by society as a whole in Japan I think it is individual freedom. Although I'm against to this. I expect that permitting same-sex marriage will cause a lot of social problems.  I think that same-sex couples are able to marry because they love with each other. We can not say anything for that. If they can not marry even they love with each other, I think that it is not fair. There is no rule, like males have to like females or females have to like males.  I think same sex marriage should be legal. Same sex couple just love each other so I don't want them to give up to get marry because of the gender. But I think same sex couple should not have the right to adopt children unless the children understand about it.  As most people here say, I agree with legalizing gay marriage. Whether you love same-sex or opposite sex depends on you. It is wrong that nation prohibits guy marriage. However as ID12053 points out , whether same-sex couple should be allowed to adopt children or not is big and complicated question. Same-sex couple should be allowed right same as opposite-sex couple but considering children, children should be brought up by mother and father.  As most of my classmates say, I agree with I think that gay marriage should be acceptable legally and socially. Humans have the right to love person without regard to sex. None of my friends have confessed that he/she is gay. But if I get friends who are gay, I will be ready to accept them. And gay couple should be given the rights that general couples ordinarily possess. I disagree with ID12055's opinion a little. As they say, I consider that deliberating children's future and feelings is very important and necessary. We must not shun these. However, if some of children show their own opinion obviously, we can consider that gay couples adopt him/her. We should not respect only our guesses too much.  I'm agree to gay marriage like others do. I do think it's their freedom to have marriage with same-sex  and have a family. However, at the same time, I'm disagree with the idea of same-sex  couple to adopt children. I don't think it's something wrong to fall in love with same gender, but to child, it could be differ. Also, when children got old without knowing father/mother figure, they tend to abuse their children. So, I think it's not suitable to let same-sex  couple to adopt children.  I believe that same-sex couple should be equal with others. As ID12044 say, I think the religious is the matter for them. Christian don't allow the same-sex marriage, and that is why same-sex couples are difficult to marriage. I know the religious is important for them, however, it is strange that human don't have same equal right. We are all equal before the low. I strongly support same-sex couple.  When I read this news I was surprised. Although many gay people all over the world, I think that it has been certified in the United States and it have an appreciable effect. There are many gay people in Japan. I think that they will want to certified.  The same sex couple should have some rights such as living together, getting married, and etc. But there is one thing should not be accepted, it is adopting children. Because, I think it is harsh for the children to know and accept the relationship of their parents.  I think the marriage of gay couples should be legal as others said. They have their rights to live happily with person who they love. Well, but I don't think it will be. Especially in Japan, there are many people who have stereotypes to gay couples and this will not vanish in a short period of time. Although there are ones who think like I think, I suppose it's impossible to make allowance for gay couples to marry because it will be possible that those who married with same-sex partners will be persecuted by others.  I think same-sex  couples should be able to marry. If they love each other, why not marry? Everyone will have your love. Then, of course you'll want to marry your partner. Why must not same-sex  couples marry? Though only they cannot have a child, it's important to marry. If they want a child, they can adopt. A lot of social problems are occurred if same-sex  couples can marry. However more people will be happy.  In Japan, there are not many people who are gay. So I have never thought about gay marriage carefully. But after reading this article, I think priority should be given to the both two people's feelings. Therefore, I agree with gay marriage. However, after marriage, they may be seen strange by other people. A lot remains to be done for gays to live under normal conditions.  I agree with Obama's suggestion. This is because it is freedom of choice, which we all enjoy. We must respect the will of individual. I strongly believe we should treat same-sex couples as ordinary different-sex couples. In Japan gay people are not as familiar as in the US So I suppose lots of Japanese, including me, are surprised at this news article.  I think we should not have a prejudice against same-sex couples. Because every people have the right to pursue their happiness. It has nothing to do with which sex they love. So I agree with Obama. I hope that more people become to think any people, even he is different from us, are equal and have the rights .  Gay marriage should be recognized in Japan. There is no problem about it, but a constitution must be revised. The government should discuss immediately. I want all people to do a better life.  I guess this problem will come to Japan someday. Then, I think gay marriage should not be legal. There has been some gays in Japan. And, they play in television. But, there are people who criticize gays, too. If gay marriage is admitted in legal, the government has to discuss and amend the law. And, it takes much time to do this. But, I think the government has many problems to solve immediately. So, I think people should not discuss this now in Japan.  This had been the big problem in America from many years ago. I have many friends in NY, and also there are many gay friends. Compared to Japanese, my gay friends don't try to hide their special characteristics. I think this is the good points in American culture. America is composed by many immigrations. Everyone accepted this situation and many kinds of people lived together. This is why gay friends can live without some feelings of shame rather than Japanese. I agree with President Obama about gay marriage. Thanks to this rule, many gay people can love each other like us and this help them except other gay people in all over the world.  In my opinion, same-sex  couples should be able to get married. Of course, I know there are various religions in the United States and some people think it is a bad thing. I think it is difficult that ALL citizens agree with guy marriage. There are lots of opinions in the country. But I think ""the government"" should not ban the marriage. If it ban the marriage because they are same-sex , does the government disturb the citizen's freedom of the marriage?If they love with each other and want to wed, the government can't ban the marriage.  I think it should be followed to get married for same-sex couple. The first reason, I believe that there is really big love between them. So, I can understand their thought and want them to be happy. The second reason, orphans will get less because the same-sex couples can't make child by themselves. Of course, there are many things not to be followed traditionally, but to make everyone happy, we should change the rules or customs.  I agree with Obama. Surely, same sex couples are rare. However, they are not definitely wrong. It is freedom whom they love. Guy marriage isn't different from ordinary marriage. Also it is important for us to admit various sense of value. So I think guy marriage should be legal.  I certainly agree with what Obama has proclaimed. We humans have a right to love who we want to love and no one has the right to violate that kind of right. But Obama should also think about current situation of America. In America, still many people have the prejudice against same-sex   love because of their religion or morality or any other reasons. So what I wanted to say is that we have to take into consideration of such kinds of ideas that people have in order to protect same-sex   couples. What is best is that maybe gradually modify the thoughts of people who have a bias against same-sex   marriage, not just ignoring the ideas of people who have bias against same-sex   couples, and finally create a situation that same-sex   marriage is a normal thing in the society.  I'm in favor of gay marriage. The most important thing in democracy is to respect personal thoughts. Besides marriage is one of the most important event in our life. Therefore, gay marriage should be admitted.  Though I know little about tax system, I agree with same sex marriage. Because they can't give up loving the same sex person. That isn't changeable. But I disagree with them to adopt children. For one thing, as they are both men the children won't be treated healthfully. Second, children can't choose whether they should be adopted them or not.  When I read this article, I was very surprised, and thought this is very good news. In many countries and areas, same sex couple are not recognized by the public. Obama did so courageous decision. I wish this Obama's new method succeed. And, I think that Japan also have to recognized gay's marriage right.  I think gay marriage should be admitted. Because they love each other as usual couple. If this thinking of love was not admitted, it would be violation of human right. But, It is difficult to admit gay couple.  I argue that the institution of marriage has traditionally been defined as between a man and a women. If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. The gay community has created its own vibrant culture. By reducing the gap of opportunities and experiences between gay and heterosexual people, the unique culture may crease to exist.  Barack Obama said that same-sex  couples should be able to get married. But still it is a very difficult problem. In my opinion, same-sex  couples should not be able to married. Many people have a bias against gay couples and cannot accept their idea now. I don't agree with gay marriage as yet.  As Barack Obama said, I think same-sex couple marriage should be allowed in other countries too. It is something to do with the human rights and everyone should be free. There is no way that they can stop them getting together.  As to gay marriage, I agree to it. It's because people should have the right to choose partner who would make ones life more precious, I think. But, I can only feel that the president, announcing like this, thinks too much about gaining supports from those back gay marriage for following election. As a result, it's not clear to me if he really has strong creed to pay attention to same sex couples. Of course, I admit that by showing his favor to the couples, more or less, people has something positive to them, so it couldn't necessarily be said too much selfish.  As many people said, i think this is individual problem. and what President Obama said is very courageous. I think same-sex marriage should be allow. Because i think marriage only relates to two people who wants to marry, and if it doesn't bring trouble to anyone i think this wedding should be allow. but if same-sex marriage cause any problem, we should ban as soon as possible.  I think same-sex  couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex  couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex  couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex  couples should have the right to get married.  I think same-sex  couples' marriages should be admitted. It is natural that you hope to stay with someone who you love. But, today, same-sex  marriages are not common, it is difficult way for same-sex  couples. I think Barack Obama's statement is very important one. I want other countries follow his examples and take actions for same-sex  couples.  I agree with homosexual marriages. I think prohibiting gay marriages runs counter to human rights. We investigate gay people's human rights with respect to marriage. In my opinion, happiness possessing rights, equality rights and privacy rights are violated in this scenario. The entitlement of happiness possessing rights is already guaranteed by first amendment in Virginia Bill of Rights. It is stipulated in 13rd amendment of constitution of Japan too. Freedoms without distinction of any kind of status are guaranteed by Universal Declaration of Human Rights. The constitutions of most countries guarantee this right too. And in 2003, Texas Supreme Court judged that the prohibition of homosexual activity is against the right of privacy. Actually, many countries like Portugal, Belgium, The Netherlands, Spain, Sweden, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, Canada, Argentina permit same sex couple marriage. In fact the Netherlands have law of anti-discrimination. According to this law, gays have the same rights as heterosexual couples. These are reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage This is reason why I agree with same sex couple marriage I agree with Obama's opinion. The right to marry must be given to every people equally, and it enables us to live with someone. If someone loves others of the same sex, no one can criticize them and keep them from being happy. It is free to love whoever.  I think that no one bother the right to say persons they love, "" I love you. "" This is a human right, of course, whether male or female. Nothing is crueler than that this right is denied. It is natural that they would like to marry and live with their lovers. So, I support Obama's opinion at this point. Why are there a right to forbid their love? I disagree with Obama's opinion. Gay must be prohibited strictly. There is only one reason to think so. Gay is not correct in ethics. A living thing in the earth have to leave offspring.  I agree with Obama's opinion. I argue that everyone is given some liberties, a thought, a property, and even marriage. There is a person who argues that if gay marriage is accepted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture. But there are many orphans in the world. So, I think they are able to be adopted by same-sex couples.  It would have been quite difficult for gay and lesbian couples in the current society as many people do not even try to understand the ways they choose their partners for life. In my opinion, however, same-sex  marriage should be allowed because I think that no one has a right to force someone to love or marry only opposite-sex person. I guess that same-sex  marriage is criticized especially by Christians who regard it as it is against God, but other than that, it does not cause any problems.  As she said, it is important to understand other people's love so we could not judge whether homosexual is right or wrong.  I agree with this. I think same sex marriage should be admitted but they should not have rights to have adopting children.  I don't think same sex marriage will cause many social problem.  I strongly agree with her opinion because I also believe everyone must be has the same right either men or women. It would be discrimination if people distinguish between male and female. I convince that there is no matter to marry when they love each other. I have the acquaintance who is gay, however, it is nothing different from us. I think people should be more open for same-sex marriage.  I agree with this idea. I think that Gay marriage should be permitted. But if this marriage are permitted, various problem will be caused.  I think that gay and lesbian couples have rights to marry. To marry is existing for lovers. There is no fatal gap between usual couple and gay couple. I hate people who discriminate gays and lesbians. There are a lot of people. So I think that each persons have their own right to be happy. Obama did great job.  I disagree with this comment. First, it's not concerned whether anti-gay people exist or not. There is no bad effect on such people. It may be difficult for them to immediately accept gay people, but it's more difficult for gay people to give up to love their partner only because of law regulation. What I really couldn't agree with in this comment was that it take much time to discuss and amend the law about same sex marriage and this problem should not be discussed now because the government has many other problems to deal with. We cannot say like that because this is ONE BIG PROBLEM to solve. Any problems should be tackled as soon as possible because we cannot run away from problems.  I agree with legalizing gay marriage. We should not have a prejudice against homosexual person. I think that Whether or not to marry is individual freedom. Gay marriage will increase in the future.  I agree homosexuality because lave affair depends on will of the individual. However I disagree Mr. Obama's this decision. He use the problem of sexually to win the election. Gay suffer from the criticism of society long years and they fight to win theirs rights. I think Mr. Obama's decision makes fool of their suffering.  I agree to same sex marriage. Because, I think this is freedom of individuals. So I think government should be permit same sex marriage.  I don't agree with Obama. It's true that many form of love exist and I don't condemn itself, but Gay is ethically problematic. They can't leave offspring, so government shouldn't admit officially. That's the reason why I disagree with same sex couple marriage.  I agree with the idea. In the past, transsexualism was not admitted socially, so it was thought to be really strange thing to marry the same sex person. But as the science, especially medicine, developed, it has been scientifically admitted that there are people who cannot love different sex people. So, I think the marriage of gay person should be admitted.  I agree with legalizing same-sex marriage. Gay or lesbian people naturally have human rights. But in America, there may be many problems to solve. If most of those could be solved, the policy must be adopted at once.  I support Obama's decision and I'm sure it should be admirable! To begin with, it's strange that the government can obstruct individuals' marriage. We have right to get married with our lovers even he/she is the same sex of us. We should think about this problem again with this as a start.  I disagree with his/her comment. Everyone thinks if there two fathers and no mother in a family, children would confuse. I think, of course, children would confuse in Japan, and children even in America which is a melting pot of many races and a liberty country would confuse, too. However, that thought is wrong. Believing in a mother and a father in a family is not imaginable; conservative and outdated. These times, there is no impossibility in the world, I think. Therefore, of course, I agree with a same sex marriage and adopting a child between father and father. This is why I disagree with his comment.  It is sure that there are some people who are afraid of gay people, but I think many similar problems are there between men and women, so this cannot be the reason of banning same-sex  marriage. Besides, he admits that many gay people are proud of themselves. Can't this also be the reason of agreeing same-sex  marriage? So I disagree with this opinion.  The good point of this opinion is that the contributor admits that same-sex marriage problems are not so familiar to Japanese, and he mentions about the problems of human rights. This insistence is very clear and agreeable, so I choose this one.  Of course, There still be lot of other problems Obama must face and address, especially the current economic condition and the unemployment rate this country has.  That is because in Japan, Gay marriage may be regarded as ethically problematic, but in some countries, I think, it is no problem. I believe what people value depends on each person.  I think homosexuality should be permit.  I think if the gay marriage is forbidden, the marriage becomes only way of making legality children. I think living with his loving person is the happiest in his life, so maybe I love woman, but probably I love men. When that, I want to live with him if it isn't legality somebody says.  I disagree with the opinion that gay couples' marriage should be admitted if they want to do, but I against adopting children. Because their children have no mother and that will cause many problems such as bullying at school, mental unrest etc. This is because its thought is a kind of prejudice for gays. This is the first step to improve the surroundings of gays. If there are regulations for gays, it will leave room for prejudice. we should build equal society for all human beings.  It is said that it's the unrealistic problem. I think that it is because gay people are much smaller in Japan than US. Certainly, the number of gay people in Japan is smaller than US. But proportion is probably about the same, I think. And gay people in Japan are likely to hide their identity (loving same-sex  people). So it's just that we don't know about it, but they are everywhere. They are living, frightened whether their secret is out. We should turn our eyes to minority more. And I think it is the very biased view that same-sex  couple's adopting children will be bullying because they have no mother or father. This is discrimination against single mother or father's children, isn't it? I think same-sex  couple who loves their children heartily can overcome such things easily.  I think same-sex marriage should be admitted. The right of individual is most important. We must not restrain the rights in that the problem will happen .  I favor gay marriage. It is one of the human rights.  I agree this comment in that it mentions ""this is the first time to think of gay marriage for me. "" In fact, we seldom consider getting marry with same-sex partner as myself. However, world' getting more and more global, we should see things globally not only internal.  I disagree same-sex marriage. It's true that individual is free, but It makes social unstable. Gay is ethically bad cause they can't have offspring.  I think same-sex   couples should be able to wed. Some people regard homosexuality as strange and sinful. But, people have the right to love irrespective of sex, age and nationality. So I think no one can criticize them. But I can't agree with the idea that same-sex   couples should have the right to adapt children. Certainly, if they have a child, they can enjoy true family life. However, many problem may happen to their children. For , children may be teased because some people still scorn same-sex   couples. And I think mother's love is necessary for their growth. Anyway, I think same-sex   couples should have the right to get married. I agree with this opinion. I think same-sex   couples should be able to get married, but shouldn't be able to have children, Because if a same-sex   couple has a child, there is a strong possibility that their child receive bad treatment.  I certainly agree with this idea, but it takes a long time to have consensus of its citizens. It is especially true to country like USA because this country is religiously strong rooted nation. But USA is the also the country that is acceptable to new concepts and they have been improving their country by themselves, so I believe that they can gradually have the right answer for this matter and I hope the government will help the minority to some extent.  All his words are what I would like to say. I would like to the society be freer for people who love the same sex because they have the right they can do so. It's a fine human right. The government should help them use the right. I think the suggestion in this comment is good to realize my ideal world. This is the reason I strongly agree with this comment.  I disagree with this comment because this comment opposes gay marriage. At this point, my opinion doesn't accord this comment.  I disagree with him because he violates gay people's human rights. He suggests gay people marriage should be banned for the birthrate. I argue this opinion is utilitarianism thinking. According to this logic, Majority people can violate minority people's human rights because of utility of entire society. This logic made a lot of problem in history. World war 2 is vivid example. And this kind of logic will violates minority's human rights.  I disagree with this opinion. Because I think that individual rights should be respected. In Japan, I felt that a fixed idea's strong that man and woman should marry. It is very important for us to respected the minority opinion.  I agree with Obama's opinion. However same sex marry is not accepted in Japan, same sex marry is proper. It is because they have right to get married with a lover.  He said ""the birthrate in the country may decline"" but if government ban the same-sex marriage, the problem can't solve. Moreover, this news is about America and the country which is declining birth rate is Japan. This opinion is not logically I think.  Her comment is correct. But there is no example about social problem. So this is bad as comment.  I agree gay marriage is individual free.  If they can't leave offspring, it should be depended on themselves whether they marry or not. The government should not say about citizens' opinion.  I've reminded of gays who play in television in Japan. At first, I feel them disgusting but, repeating seeing their video, I realize that they were criticizing gays either. At that time I was very impressed, and I really agree with the comment above.  Though I understand homosexual's position, however I think homosexual love is not to be yield. Before human came out to earth, there were no homosexual love but heterosexual love. In addition, having a homosexual love-life makes themselves make easy to get a disease. Moreover it makes birth rates to decrease. Therefore, It will be the big problem in the near future.  This kind of argument is clearly anachronistic, and the evidence which support his opinion is too illogical. I can't believe those who have old-fashioned opinion like this.  He don't explain why he thinks gay marriage is bad ethically, and I disagree with the idea that all living things must leave offspring. Is he living to leave offspring? I don't think so. All of us have the right to pursue our happiness!! I can't agree with the opinion that leaving offspring is the most important of loving someone.  I disagree with this comment. Because I think marriage is personal liberty. Though this comment points out 'If gay marriage is admitted, it will accelerate the assimilation of gays into mainstream heterosexual culture', I think it is not. Same-sex couples can adopt orphans and pay various taxes.  I don't think so. We can't deny their love and I want him to explain what is the ethical problem, what is your ethic. There are so many kinds of people and thoughts so we should think calmly.  I am in Obama side. I think gay or lesbian should be together if they love each other. Nothing can stop the feeling that you love someone. I also don't care that gay or lesbian got marriage.  I disagree with a part of her comment. She said that it will not happen that the marriage of gay couples should be admitted in the future. I disagree with this part. If the people get to understand more about the same sex couples and marriage, marrying of them is going to be natural thing. Most important thing is people need to understand them. I think it is possible.  I agree to same sex marriage as long as they do not take charge of children in anyway such as adopting etc. This is because I do not think same sex marriage is a natural thing and it could lead to bullying. If people want to make same sex marriages they should make their children involved in their self-satisfaction.  I just can't find what is wrong about same sex people having a marriages. If they love each other why can't they marry? If it comes to a problem of whether they can have adopted child , it is difficult. But I think there are some ways that same sex couple can have a child just like we talked during class. I thought it is funny that hotels is Disney Resorts Japan announced that they will permit gay marriage at their hotel, right after the day Obama announced that he supports gay marriage. Though they say it was just a coincidence.  This person has a same thoughts as mine and I liked the phrase ""It is free to love whoever. "" I hadn't known a gay marriage is prohibited in America, so I was really surprised when I read this article for the first time. I agree with Obama's opinions because the number of people who love same sexual people is more and more increasing recently. This problem is not familiar to us Japanese, but we have to think seriously about this because this is a matter of human right. It is very difficult to conclude this problem, but I wish gay people could express their love freely someday.  I agree with President Obama's idea that same-sex couples should be able to wed. We can't have right to deprive them of their happiness. Banning gay marriage leads to discrimination, which will violate human rights. It's sacrosanct in nature. We, our society, should admit diversity of values. As the Japanese proverb ""so many men, so many minds"" show, I believe there is no officially decided way to love others.  It's very difficult problem to solve in Japan, but I think same-sex  couples should be able to get married, or we should establish a alternative system like a marriage. For example, a same-sex  couple held a wedding ceremony at Tokyo Disney Resort. It's symbolic event. Marriage between people of the same gender or civil union win public recognition gradually. So we should have interest in this problem and protect their legitimate rights.  The idea that they're admitted to be equivalent to marriage and they can receive a certificate was approved at Shibuya last month. We can think about sexual minority's rights better to hear this news. But there're still many people thinking badly against them. So I think that we should solve this problem gradually, not radically.  I agree with you.  Gay marriage should be accept in Japan. There is no problem about it, but maybe not easy to ching some low. Because there is few people who against same-sex couple.  I think the activities of President Obama should be evaluated. Some people support same-sex marriage, some people oppose gay it. So, opposition to same-sex marriage is it that there is no way. However, if anyone does not act just because there is a dissenting opinion, the situation does not change anything. I think attitude to tackle actively the issue of same-sex marriage of President Obama is marvelous.  I totally agree with your opinion. In the current Japan, understanding of same-sex  couples have been gradually spread, I feel. The same-sex  couples will be able to get married, but there will be a variety of disorders, such as legislation and institutional reform. However, I think that same-sex  couples will be able in the future to be sure to get married.  Marrying same sex people may be strange. I don't understand this feeling, but I can accept it willingly, because there are many people all over the world.  Reading this article in this timing is kind of interesting because same-sex marriage has been finally legalized in the United States recently. I do not understand why there are opposing people though after reading this article and comment of a former governor. I think the law will just give people more choices or options and so I do not think other people cannot take their rights away.  I think this problem is very difficult. Now, not all people accept this, same-sex couple marriage. So even if the government allows this, those who are around them may speak ill of them or avoid them as so on. So, many people should know more about them.  In those days, the bill that the same-sex marriage is allowed in all the continent was passed in America. I think that this is very important thing for the world view of gay or lesbian. But, I also worry that people's view for them is more severe.  I think same sex marriage should be legal. And I should admit this issue. Same sex to give up get marry because it was illegal. But I think this idea is so bud. Couple is couple. I should be allied with love person. I think that it is include in a right of the freedom to recognize this.  I agree with you. These days, I hear the news about same sax marriage on TV or newspaper so often. I hope all the people live together even if they are same sex couple or not. "
JOC JOC-12A-06N 1.83 "When I heard this news first time, I thought I had heard similar news. I felt this is one of problem with death penalty. Death Penalty should be punishment toward crime, but criminal use this act to suicide. I think it's ridiculous, and felt same as Governor, but at the same time, It's not good idea to state that suspect should kill himself from where Governor stand.  Having read this story, I thought the suspect was very stupid, but the Osaka governor is saying too much that the suspect should've killed himself. Instead, I wanted him to mention the after care system of the prisoner was not prepared properly at least.  He wanted to die because he has no job and home, however, I heard he would got a job from his friend in Osaka. That is why he went to Osaka. He stayed one night at his friend's house, and he disappeared next morning. He committed crime to be killed himself, however, there is no reason to die because he would had a job later. Moreover, he didn't make any effort to alive positively. I hate the person like him, because there are many people who want to alive more such as patients, poor people and so on. He should try to live strongly. I expert that he shouldn't be killed because his request is DEATH. To punish him, he should stay alive at prison forever, and I believe this is the biggest punishment for him.  At first, I got angry when i heard this news. It was so reckless and selfish of the suspect to kill others in the intension of being sentenced to death. But now thinking again, other than a individual problem, there seems to be other factors such as economic recession or high suicide rate. And I guess the lack of rehabilitation in prison and economic recession are much to do with this case. As he said, he wanted to die for the reason that he had no home and no job prospects. If the economy is better, the situation may be better. And he committed a serious crime only after ten weeks he was released from prison. It seems that the prison was not able to rehabilitate him fully. In conclusion, this affair result from both a individual problem and a social problem. Anyway, we must not admit such behavior and make effort to prevent it.  We cannot say anybody should die even if he/she want to die, but in this case, I cannot help thinking that Isohi should have died before involving unrelated two people. Homicide is much more worse than suicide. It must not be condoned that the futures of innocent people are destroyed by others' selfishness. If the life situation of Isohi's was true, public welfare should be strengthened as well for people like him. According to an article which read later, however, he might not intend to die by using death penalty system. So the words that he chose his victims at random and that he wanted to kill anyone so he would be sentenced to death might be a big lie. Anyway, he is a murder. He should take proper punishment.  It is anger to have felt, when I heard this news for the first time. I feel anger in the surrounding human being who was not able to help two human beings as this Isohi. It got to know that investigated this news by oneself and some witnesses were taking a picture of video. When this was heard , I felt it deplorable. I think it required to help each other all together more at the time of an emergency. And this suspect, s action is it being unusual and not allowed. Therefore the right severe punishment is required.  After I read news, I was unable to repress my indignation. I concern with the families and friends of two victims. They lost precious one in an instant. I cannot even imagine their feeling. They should hope death penalty for the suspect, Kyozo Isohi. I guess that if the companions of my student union or someone I love are killed by strangers, I will desire to take revenge. This way to think is very natural for all human beings. However, we should not take these feelings too much. When the punishment is determined, we must take an objective view. And I am against ID12063. Suicide is a kind of homicide. In other words, Suicide is equal to homicide. Of course, I do not forgive Isohi's crime. In order to not force those who suffer extreme poverty to kill themselves or want to die, the social security system should be prepared. Recently I heard that some people abuse this system. Needless to say, they quit their evildoing. I expect that the government revise the system or law immediately.  When I heard this news for the first time, I thought that a murder case happened again. I understood that it was indiscreet thought not to believe it in an unusual case. Then I considered that a man who believes that a case of murder is not unusual was unusual: strange!! Therefore I felt myself scary. However, I cannot understand what he thought, and I think that he should have killed himself, same as Ichiro Matsui. Broadcasting this news to the whole world, I don't want other countries to think that Japanese are dangerous.  When I heard this news, I was shocked. And, I was so angry. The murder had to kill oneself. I against the death penalty. When I was in primary school, the same murder case broke at Osaka. The man kills children in hope of the death penalty. We have to abolish death penalty to prevent such a terrible case.  I remember street indiscriminate murder a few years ago in Akihabara when I heard this news for the first time. But I think this case's particular point is that the suspect somehow wanted to die and chose not to kill himself but to stab someone to be sentenced to death. If there were no system of capital punishment in Japan, such case could not take place. So I suggest that Japan abolish this penalty and adopt stricter life sentence. I think unlimited life in prison is more painful and hard than the death penalty personally.  After watching and reading this news, I thought that if he had wanted to die, he should have died by himself, not involving the other people. It is no excuse of killing the other people that he would like to die. I understand that we can not say you should die if you want to die, but I can say you can not take someone's life in any situation. It might be difficult for him to think about the lives of the persons who were killed, but I wanted him to think about that because they had a family, friends. . . They had their lives.  I felt how fiendish the suspect was, when I read this article. He might have a lot of distress, but there was no reason why he could kill other people. We must not take others' lives whatever emotion we have. Maybe Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui would represent the feelings of victims and their families.  I felt the same way as the Osaka governor say. Thinking of the victim's feeling, it is beyond description. I think that the reason of this case happened is that because Japan's punishment are not heavy enough. We need to take the victim's feeling .  After reading this news, I thought that it is an only problem about his humanities. It is not nation's problem. He should not kill people and he should live himself. Suicide rate and death penalty didn't cause this tragedy. He presumed nation(Japan) . I think I said terrible and unholy opinion, but still he should live himself and shouldn't kill others.  The suspect said that he was frustrated at having no home and no job. I think if he had them, he didn't commit such a crime. Needless to say, the most fact of this crime is his stupid thinking. But it is also one of fact that support for him (he has criminal record) was lacking. This is social problem, and we have to consider ""support for a person with a criminal record"".  After reading this news, I thought we should rethink about our death penalty system. This case happened because Japan have death penalty to person who kill other people. and as Kyozo said he was frustrated at having no home and no job after he was released from prison, so we also should think about how to do with the criminal after he/she is release. Therefore, I think this case represents a problem in society and we need to think about carefully more to make better future life.  After I read this news, I thought there were big problem in Japanese criminal system. I suspect that Japanese criminal system is used badly by criminal. In addition to this case , similar cases occurred in Japan. For instance the people who want to live without working do criminal act for food and shelter in jail. They intentionally do criminal act to get food and shelter in jail. They want to be sent to jail!! I think that Japan criminal system should be rethought deeply from this news It was unbelievable that the suspect killed in a knife attack at random to want to die. I want him not to roll up many people only for his circumstances. In addition, it is problem to have one of the world's highest suicide rates.  When I read this news, I felt the suspect was very selfish. I think Japan shouldn't abolish the death penalty. The most important purpose of prisons is to do the rehabilitation of offenders. But, there are some prisoners who don't want to return to society like this time. Prisons are managed by tax. It is ridiculous that tax are used such people. So, I think Japan continue the death penalty.  I think this accident reflects Japanese social problems. Now in Japan, poverty and suicide become serious. We have to try to solve these problems. Then this accident presents us about the death penalty, too. Now that Japan is a minority in that it still has system of death penalty despite it's developed country. I think we abolish the death penalty. Because we are a human, and human can make a mistake. So we shouldn't decide other people's life.  This news made me feel angry. Surely, his life was under difficult condition. However, there was no reason why he was allowed to kill others. His reason is absurd. And this affair includes problems of not only his individual but also Japan's society, that is to say the business climate and death penalty. These problem should be thought out in near future. In this view, this news gave us something important.  I became really sad at time when I knew this news. This is because two totally innocent people have died. The criminal seemed to want to die, but I roll up an innocent person and am absolutely wrong. I want to have a criminal compensate for a crime reflectively well. I want to warn a slasher from now on recently because slashers increase. An innocent person must be never sacrificed anymore.  I think this murder reflects the present situation in Japanese. For example, many of Japanese people lose their work and can't find their stable jobs and they lose their hope for living. If the current situation such as the economy, doesn't improve, such a sad news as this will not decrease.  This incident became a huge problem in Japan because the suspect killed 2 innocent people in order to kill himself. After he released from the prison, he didn't have money, house and family. This was caused by bad Japanese economic situation. Many people lost their jobs and families and they lost their ways of life. Japanese government should think about its economy in order to save our lives. I hope that this accident gave us a good opportunity to think about our lives and economy.  We have to think this news from many perspectives. First, a point of view of the victims and their families, relatives or friends. Considering from the victims side, we cannot imagine how much sad and disconsolate they felt. The two important and innocent life was lost without a notice. The suspect, Kyozo Isohi, has ruined the life of not only those who have killed but also of the people closely related them. He made light of life. He should have deeply engraved on how important one's life is and there is nothing that can exchange with life. Second, the viewpoint of the people close to the suspect. He should have took into consideration of his family as well. What kind of feeling does his family have after they were informed of this matter? There is no phrase that can substitute for expressing their feeling. Third, the perspective of the suspect himself. Why did he have to take other people's lives? Why he wanted to die? Weren't there any way to stop this sad incident from happening from the beginning? He should have the retribution for what he have done, but is that enough? We cannot think this matter as an irrelevant matter to our life. We can say that this is only one of the result of the problems we have in our society. If we consider this matter as unrelated to our life and just hate the murder and sympathize with the victim, this kind of tragic incident will surely happen again. The next may be your family or yourself. No one knows. So what I wanted to say is that there is no doubt that what Kyozo Isohi had made an irreparable mistake by depriving two people's lives and he should retribute to his deeds, but it is important to think this matter as a social problem and take some action to improve our society and decrease these kinds of tragic.  I felt that the suspect, Kyozo Isohi was very selfish when I read this sentence. Since he did not have hopes to live anymore, he killed two men at random. The families of the victims will keep to envy him. If he wanted to suicide in fact, I think that he should not kill pedestrians, but kill himself. After all, I do not agree with death penalty. Because it is necessary for you to atone for your sin. I think that Isohi will need to apologize to the families of the victims for killing, atone for his sin.  I was really shocked to hear the news. As Japan is thought to be one of the safest country in the world, that kind of accident should not be occurred. Also, I think the suspect is really selfish and what he had done cannot be justified. No one has a right to kill some one except for the execution, I believe.  I was really shocked to hear the news.  Though Japan is thought to be the safest country in the world, a terrible trouble is likely to happen. I think no one has a right to kill for the sake of oneself.  I was really shocked to hear the news. Though Japan is thought to be the safest country in the world, a terrible trouble is likely to happen. I think no one has a right to kill for the sake of oneself.  After I read this article, I think about the death penalty again. Should Japan continue to have the death penalty?This problem have been controversial for a long time in Japan. Even if the man kill other people, does the country have rights to decide whether the man should live or not?Some people say that the death penalty make the numbers of the crime less because people are afraid of the penalty. But I think this affect of the penalty is questionable after we know the story like this article. We should think about the meaning of the penalty again.  I can't understand his thought that he killed the persons in hope of death penalty, but I think we don't have to give him death penalty . . . . because he would like to die. So, it is not punishment for him. If he died, he wouldn't sad. It would make him be happy. However, there are many complex feeling of families and friends of the victims . . . so, which would be better , this is very difficult judgment.  When I read this article, I thought that Japan should reconsider a capital punishment once again. The capital punishment is a thing intended to prevent a crime, but a crime does not seem to decrease to me because there is a capital punishment. There is the risk to bring the opposite effect like this case. I think that not carrying the death penalty but the criminal assumes one's crime and lives .  I think the suspect is very selfish. He killed two innocent people so that he wanted to be sentenced to death. I was scared to hear this news, because the news made me to think it is unpredicted when I was killed by a stranger, walking along the street. However, According to the news, he was set free from prison in Niigata two weeks ago. we have to take into account the fact that after released from prison, the criminal did not have home and job prospect, so he wanted to live no more. I doubt the support system for prisoners after they are released from prison properly works.  As this article said, this case is related to height of committing suicide rate in Japan and death penalty. First of all, the proportion of committing suicide in Japan is very high. According to the graph which we saw in the class, the suicide rate in Japan is 20% and Japan is lying in third place. Also most of developed countries abolished death penalty, but Japan is carrying out execution. This peculiar circumstance will give rise to the case. Of course, I think that it is cruel case and I feel sorry that two people are killed by Kyozo Isohi suspect. But more important thing is that there may be people who have the same idea as Kyozo Isohi, who want to commit suicide but cannot do that by himself so wish to face the death penalty by killing someone indiscriminately. We will have to think about declining the number of such people.  There are mainly two problems about this matter. First, this case brought the point at issue of the death penalty system to light. That is, the death penalty can be seen as aiding and abetting a suicide legitimately. Personally, I think the death penalty should not be banned. But we cannot ignore this problem. So I think capital punishment needs to be reconsidered. Second, we can see the problem about a repeat offense. I think this is not personal, but social issue . I think all the criminals must be rehabilitated appropriately. Education and full support are necessary for them . Sometimes we regard criminals as dangerous and despise them. But another tragedy may happen if we alienate them from society.  This article made me sad. Why the victim was killed?Nothing. These days a case of murder like this is more increasing than before. A generation ago, reason for murder is resentment or malice. This is changing.  I can't understand this murder's feelings. What is that he killed innocent two peoples because he wanted to be executed? Then why did not he kill himself? Certainly, he was frustrated by having no jobs and house. This is the very problem of current society. But I can't forgive him. However he was pained, nothing allow him to kill someone, not to mention of innocent people.  After I heard this news, I was getting scary . Because he killed innocent people nothing related with him. He was frustrating by having no job and no place to live. I guess there are some people in this world have same problem so he should have tried something or ask somebody to help.  I'm strongly agree with this comment because I do feel that it's very selfish to murder someone only to get Death Penalty because he can't do it by himself. In the first place, Death Penalty is designed to prevent such a crime. Also, he mentioned that this is not only personal problem, but social problem as well. Suspect wanted to die because he had no job and home. Even though he would had job through his friend later, if society had offer him a home and job after he was released from prison, maybe he would have not done such a thing. "" After I read this story, I thought that the suspect was a very selfish person. Just because he wanted to be killed, he killed two person that had nothing to do with him and this can not be forgiven. He wanted to die but he couldn't kill himself. He wasn't brave enough to kill himself so he asked for a help to die. I understand his feeling but it is not a thing that could be overlooked.  I felt very sad when I first read that two innocent people were killed and then it made me angry as I understood the reason of the crime. It was unbelievable that the suspect murdered the victims just because he wanted to die. I usually do not understand or agree with committing a suicide, but for this case, I strongly think that he should have done so rather than killing someone he does not even know. Also, it is important that he should not be given a death penalty which he wished but life sentence instead.  I had a same feeling with him and was surprised with his comment.  I disagree because he thinks of suicide different from homicide. These are same essentially. It does not matter whether object to kill is others or oneself.  I was shocked when I heard this crazy news. I think that Japan is a safe country. But Japan is not a safe country any more. I can not imagine there is a person who want to be sentenced to die. This is a last thought which human have. Japan should be more good place for everyone.  This news is very terrible, because the suspect killed two people to be sentenced to death. We can say that capital punishment caused this accident. I think it is necessary for the people who are released from the prison to offer the opportunities to rehabilitate. Japan has to reconsider capital punishment.  It is too selfish to kill people just because he would like to face the death penalty. I can understand a governor's anger well. It will be one method to abolish the death penalty if it does not become a criminal deterrent. Since we are the students of the faculty of law, we have to consider capital punishment carefully.  what an awful news! This is my first thought when I read this article. I don't understand why this suspect killed other people to ""die"". Maybe he was too weak to kill himself, but I can't forgive him so easily. I feel so sorry for the victims, and the families of them. . . . Wish these kind of affairs never happen again. To make it possible, we have to check whether death penalty is really appropriate or not.  I disagree with the death penalty in three ways. Firstly, in history, there are many examples when the death penalty was abused politically. Governments can use the death penalty to announce their political will. Especially, governments execute those people who oppose the power of the government. In this case, freedom of people will decrease, and there will be an inflexible atmosphere, causing people to follow the rules of the government. Powerful governments can govern people in this way. It is more obvious if the government is a dictatorial government. They allow executions to eliminate an opposing party. For example, Iran executed a lot of people after 2009 by their ''show trials' because they wanted to repress their power after the blowing up of 2009. Secondly, death penalty is not effective at all. According to Roger Hood, The Death Penalty: A World-wide Perspective, Oxford, Clarendon Press, third edition, 2002, p. 214, Recent crime figures from abolitionist countries fail to 'show that abolition has harmful effects. In Canada, for example, the homicide rate per 100, 000 population fell from a peak of 3.09 in 1975, the year before the abolition of the death penalty for murder, to 2.41 in 1980, and since then it has declined even further. In 2003, 27 years after abolition, the homicide rate was 1.73 per 100, 000 population, 44 per cent lower than in 1975, which was the lowest rate in three decades. Although this increased to 2.0 in 2005, it remains over one-third lower than when the death penalty was abolished. Thirdly, the goal of punishment should be to correct convicts and help them return to society. It is stipulated in the international Covenants on Civil and Political Rights (1966) which states the basic guarantee of human rights in international society. Execution of death penalty is banned with this idea and the execution of the death penalty takes away the chance for convicts to regret their crime and apologize to victim. These are the reasons as to why I disagree with death penalty.  I don't understand his thought that he killed other person in hope of death penalty. the form of punishment should be reconsidered. Moreover, this news makes us think about death penalty. Is killing really suitable for penalty? After I was read this article, I felt intense anger. Furthermore, I was heard that he had killed indiscriminately, I was so beside myself with anger. He absolutely should be the death penalty. I don't want such a case happening again.  In my opinion, there should be death penalty because one should get what he/she deserves. On the other hand, we may have to think that there are some people who regards the punishment only as a means of suicide to escape from the reality. In that case, it's hard to say that the penalty works essentially. However, even if there would be alternative capital penalty, some people will also commit crimes in hope of getting the penalty to escape from hopeless ordinary lives. So, there aren't necessity to abolish death penalty. Bearing responsibility for what oneself does is quite important.  When I heard this news, I feel so sad and angry. Everyone must not kill people and take their lives. We have to think about the importance and value lives. Nothing can take the place of life. I have doubts about police why they released the suspect from prison. I think they should see through his mind and get a thorough going over his release. I wish crimes like this news will not happen.  When I heard this news, I was very sad. Because the crime was took place in Osaka. And I think about the Death Penalty. I think the death penalty is abolished. The reason why I think so is people who exploit for themselves increase. So I think the death penalty should be abolished.  This is very sad news. It must not be accepted that a man who wants to be sentenced to death kills many innocent and irrelevant people. He must be sentenced to death although he has wanted to be.  When I first heard this news, it reminded me of the tragedy in Akihabara and I was really terrified. I can't believe why he did such a fierce murder. And then, I thought it is not a problem caused by a death-penalty, but just a personal problem. He said he had nowhere to live, no way to work, but it's because of his behavior. It's nothing but pretext! I think it is too selfish. If I think I want to die, I kill myself alone. The people whom he killed didn't do bad things, there no reasons they should die. If I was their relative, I want to kill the man who killed my important person for his selfish person. Japan thinks death penalty makes people not to commit crimes, but there are people who hope death penalty like this case, it is not good to continue this rule I think.  The suspect killed people in hope of the death penalty, so this case shows that the death penalty do not necessarily works as prevention against crime. The death penalty have many problem, so it should be abolished. Considering cases like this, its function as deterrent is questionable, and if the case were a false charge, there would be no mending. By the way, I wonder why no one tried to save the victims. The article says that the victims were stabbed again and again, so this means that other people at the scene of crime stood still seeing the tragedy while the crime was committed.  I agree with the above comment. I didn't think about a tax. Obviously, our tax is spent by a lot of prisoners. Therefore, if there are getting fewer prisoners in Japan, it could use it better for our country. This is not the only reason not to abolish a death penalty, but this is the one of the big reasons not to abolish it. In addition, I agree with ""The most important purpose of prisoners is to do the rehabilitation of offenders"". For example, if a man committed a little crime, punishing it too severely would be not a correct punishment. As the Japanese law also said that some criminals must serve a prison because of protecting the nation and rebirth of them. Therefore, prisoners are believed in rebirth in a sense. However, this case is too cruel, so I should punish him a death penalty. This is why I agree with his comment.  I think a murder is terrible.  I have heard that your killing yourself is murder. Your life and my life are equal and both of them shouldn't disappear. In this case, of course I can't say if you think die, you should die alone. But if he die himself, only one life disappear. However he killed two people to his death penalty. It's very wrong. There are no lives here, but two lives disappeared to kill oneself. I want him to pay with his life without his death.  It was unbelievable that the suspect killed in a knife attack at random to want to die. I want him not to roll up many people only for his circumstances. In addition, it is problem to have one of the world's highest suicide rates.  I disagree this comment. Because I think the suspect struggled for living. It is easy to say he did not struggled for living. That he killed innocent people is not allowable. But his thought to death is not natural. needless to say, he is guilty. But he have some pitiable aspect. So I cannot agree such as violent comment.  I sympathized with his view about victim feeling, feeling of suspect, thinking that this case is social problem. Especially about thinking that this case is social problem, I think that we should more deeply consider reducing such a case.  This murder killed two innocent people, wanting to be death punished. Then I thought he should kill himself, as the governor said. But from social position of this governor, he should not have said such thing. So I agree with this comment.  I agree with the death penalty. If the death penalty abolish, I guess second offense rate will raise. But, in actual, there is a man who kills people in hope of the death penalty like this news. I think this causes are his personality and the society. So, we have to think measures. And, I hope the realization of the society where people who are innocent don't kill.  I disagree to this comment. Because even if the person wants to die, the person can't kills himself. I think the suspect should realize valuables of the person's life. So I think he should not kill himself.  The reason why I choose this comment is because I think we should reconsider about the death penalty.  I agree with this opinion, because I think Japanese criminal system should be rethought and the death penalty should be abolished.  I think assailant is self-centered. I can't forgive him.  I think the news is very scary. I favor the death penalty.  I'm against this comment because even if there weren't death penalty, so far as there are capital punishment or even the fact that there are punishment, there won't be any expectation of no crimes. It's because criminals commit crimes according to the same logic. It is more important to improve social welfare than abolish death penalty. Then, social ills will gradually removed, @@@think.  I thought that topic is similar to Akihabara's murder case. But I didn't recall it at first, so this comment say what I wanted to say. And the content is good. death penalty is not extreme one. For those who wanna die, penalty's effect is very little. More strict one must be adopt to suspect.  I agree with his opinion. I also think that this man who killed two people are very selfish. Just selfish. What he had done can not be justified. What he did was so bad.  I also think that there is no reason why the suspect kills two people. He is very self-centered, and it is no longer the problem if he is so or not. It is unbelievable. I wanted him to reconsider before the accident.  I disagree with him. I think that a crime does not seem to decrease to me because there is a capital punishment.  I was sad for hearing this news. However, the country has also responsibility. The country have to help a criminal who are released.  I agree this opinion. Of course death penalty is the big problem for us, but the man must not kill the people. My strongly agreeing point of her opinion is that she thinks about victims and their families. They aren't related him and his situation. I think we should not forget victims hearts.  I agreed with at the beginning of this comment, but I disagreed with at the end. She said that in order to improve Japanese economy, Japanese government should make a new policy of social welfare and encourage young people to work harder. However, I think young people have many pressure and they anxiety about their future and work. Thus, my idea is that Japan should put off maximum age that can work. There are many merits for example, old people know how to work and they know what kind of work they are required by company. So, they can work faster and easier than young people. Japanese companies should use old people effectively and try to make a good economy.  I heard this news, I don't believe it. The suspect is crazy. I think he should be kill himself.  I agree this comment because she said we should think about the meaning of death penalty again. In Japan, many people agree with the penalty. But, I have some doubts about this system, too. I think death penalty is not suitable for atone one's sin. I think that Japanese have to think about death penalty more seriously.  I disagree this comment because he think Japan shouldn't abolish the death penalty. I oppose death penalty. Prisons are surely managed by tax. But, is it most important thing of this problem? I don't think so. I think most important thing is maintain human lights. Even if they are murders, they are human.  I disagree to this comment. It's because she doesn't consider the families of victim's feelings. Whether the suspect wanted to death or not, the punishment should be determined by fare judgment and the feelings of victim's families.  The most unfair and terrible death will be the death that killed for no reason. For example, a condemned will not concerned with dying. Since they knows why they are killed. However, reasonless assault for pedestrian will have a terrible stress though they had alive.  Although he shows his sympathy with the victim's family who may have desire to take revenge, he have an objective opinion about death penalty and social system in Japan. Above all, I strongly agree with his opinion about suicide.  I also think the suspect is fiendish, and we don't have the right to kill anyone whatever reason we have. We can't understand grief of victims and their families completely, but I can understand that we shouldn't forget how terrible this news was.  I agree this opinion. This person insist on not having to murder a person even if has anything. I think that, no matter what happens, the innocent person must not murder me either. The criminal should think about the feeling of the family of the victims.  I disagree this opinion. This person objects for a criminal being death penalty. I think that the criminal murdered two innocent people and the criminal should be death penalty.  Nobody who is living knows how painful he or she die. When I imagine the scene of an execution, I cannot know the condemned criminal's feeling. More Japanese disagree with abolishing death penalty. That is, I think that more the bereaved also do not want to do that. I argue that the heaviest punishment should be decided by not the general but their opinion.  I agree with this comment. Because I think a recession and cold society caused this sad trouble. The root of the problem lies in not only personal issue but also social problem. And social security system is to blame too. The prison is seemed not to play a part.  These days I hear many times about crime in Japan. I don't know certainly but I think that thing closely relate to early days education. The people who was educated well in elementary school, junior high school and especially in their home, maybe they will not be such a awful person.  I can't understand why the suspect had to kill people. I strongly agree with Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui. The suspect of murder was frustrated at having no home and no job prospects, and that he didn't want to live anymore. It really week reason to kill people. I felt anger about it because, suspect could work if he had a energy to killing people.  I cannot believe the victim that he did such a thing. I cannot understand why some people want to involve other people in their own death such as stopping the train and so. If he/she wants to die, they should without involving other people. I do not think he even has the rights to be sentences to death.  I could agree with We need to take the victim's feeling and Japan's punishment are not heavy enough. I think it is ok that suspect killed by prison in this case.  I disagree with Osaka governor is saying too much that suspect should've killed himself. Because, I think Osaka governor is right to saying that.  The person who posted the comment above could not think why the incident is happened deeply. He or she should rethink about the situation of the incident. And he never should say that ""the murder had to kill oneself. "" It is horrible comment. This is why I disagree with this.  This person had exactly the same opinion. Everybody thought it was the only individual problem, and blamed on what the suspect in the news did. But, the comment above pointed out that there are some other factors related the incidence in this society. What we paid attention were the same, so I agreed with this comment.  I just can't understand how the victim could do such thing. How could he have a courage to kill someone when he doesn't have a courage to kill him self. Some people say that death penalty should be abolished to eliminate this kind of murder but I think it is not that simple. Because I think by having death penalty, we can avoid bereaved family do such thing as revenge.  I don't think that abolishing death penalty would solve all the problem just like I wrote in my comments. It is not that simple.  When I heard this news, I was so sad! But I think it's wrong to connect this murder case with the argument that the death penalty should be abolished. I think there are problems about the system of the prison of Japan. It is only several weeks later that he took their lives after he is discharged from prison. I think the prison of Japan don't have the system which let the criminals reflect on their past behavior deeply.  The problem is very serious. Elderly people want to find a new job now. But they cannot. So, we should give them a chance of re-employment. Concretely, our government must help them to get it. Therefore, the problem of economy will recover.  I agree with you. I think so, too.  I'm opposed to your opinion. I think there are more people who do not perform the murder for fear of the death penalty than people who carry out the murder in order to wish the death penalty. So, if the death penalty were abolished, more murders would happen than now.  Your opinion very is interesting for me. Certainly Kyozo Isohi has to apologize to the families of the victims and be compensated for his sins. I think also that he should do so. However, I wonder families of the victims of this incident think that want Kyozo Isohi to make amends for sins and apologize to them. If my children are killed, I want to put the criminal that killed them to death. Criminal of such violent crime should be the death penalty, or, he or she should atone for sin over a lifetime, it is very difficult for me to determine which is more correct.  The argument of whether the death penalty should be continued or not has been spotlighted for long time. Some people who are against death penalty claiming that it is too cruel to kill anybody. However, in my opinion, keep living in the jail until you die is much more cruel comparing to just end your life. There will be no motivation to live if you are decided to live until you die in the jail. Spending your life in the jail forever is much more cruel than just kill yourself in my opinion. "
JOC JOC-12A-06O 2.15 "Although this murderer committed a terrible crime, I think we should reconsider about the system of social security such as social welfare benefits. The suspect said he was hopeless because he had no job prospects and home. If Japan's government can provide these to the social disadvantaged, I think the case like this will decrease.  First of all, I thought the death penalty is it impossible to inhibit crimes by thinking this murder case. In this case, the suspect wanted to be put to death. So I felt we should be continuing to discuss the rights and wrongs about the death penalty. Second, However, I had a question about a remark by Osaka Gov Ichiro Matsui the suspect should have killed himself if he really wanted to die. His remark was honest opinion, but even if he had felt this, he is top of Osaka so anyway, I want him to make efforts not to produce a man like this suspect again. For that, we should think welfare that gets rid of social injustice as much as possible, too.  When I read this article, I was very sad. Because in this tragedy, victims were chosen at random. The suspect said that he wanted to dead. He was just out of prison. But he couldn't spend decent life. So he committed this crime. I think that not only the suspect but also society should be held responsible for this tragedy. He committed the crime. But we can think that society (prison-aftercare-system)made him commit this crime. So we should change prisoner-aftercare-system.  I think that this is a very terrible case. I can not understand why he thought to kill a human. However, I can understand the feeling that he was disappointed at because there are not a house and work. In current Japan, it is difficult to get work without a house and to get a house without work. In addition, the evaluation for the person of source is very severe. I think that if we do not correct this system, this case is not solved fundamentally.  To kill myself is very bad attention. Because a lot of people die in spite of they want to die. to kill myself is rude for them They should live for them! There is no life that may be died! Although this case is terrifying, I think that the current society system has a problem. The problem is that people who was released from prison have difficulty getting job again. We have to solve it. We have to start lesson in prisons to get job again so that prisoners make it easy after released from prison.  Reading the article, I really feel sad and angry, because innocent civilians were killed by extremely mean and cruel man. When I was in high school, I often took part in volunteer work to support homeless people in Nishinari District, where is the greatest slum in Japan. During the activity, many of them told me that they had no money, no family and no hope to live. Some even said that he would rather die than live with intolerable and ceaseless agony. In this case, the suspect had the same thought and his sense of hopelessness drove him to the terrible crime. Of course, just because he want to die, it doesn't mean that his murder is justified. He should be to blame for his mad slaughter and he should be executed. (In this point of view, I'm for the death penalty, because some criminals should be punished by death for their brutal crimes, like the suspect) However, before discussing his cold blooded mental, we should focus on what made him a condemned criminal. Perhaps the answer is the society. In order to prevent this terrible tragedy from happening again, I think that all we must do is support poor people.  It is terrible case. Criminal said he wanted to die and he cause crime to received a death sentence. I can't understand his action, if he wanted to die, he should kill himself not put other man any trouble. For example, stab himself, have sleeping pills a lot, hanging, etc. . . I play for the soul of victim and I wish not to cause these case never.  This is really terrible case. I'll never understand the suspect who killed two innocent people with selfish motive. Even if the suspect is executed, the bereaved will lifted because it is just his desire. It's difficult problem that the death penalty, a deterrent to crime is grasped just like the way of suicide.  I got very sad and angry to read this article. Though i sympathize with him because it is hard to have no home and no job, I never accept his cruel action. There is no reason for the two victims to be killed. He should have killed himself.  I'm not for your opinion. Actually. it is difficult to get work without a house and to get a house without work, but I think it has nothing to do with the case. No matter what happens, all the people must not kill others. In my opinion, one of factors which he committed a crime is that he didn't have close friends. He was sure to be lonely. It is true that correcting current evaluation system is important, but I think we should make strong a connection with each region.  Why would you kill somebody that is innocent? This is so embarrassing. If he wants to die, just go kill himself as it is said in this article. No one is allowed to kill random people in the street! And why the hell did the police released such a dangerous person, I cannot understand them.  Well, it is natural for people from the prison not to have work and home sometimes. In this case, he also deserves it. That's not the only reason he was disappointed because it was difficult to get work.  I remembered the news well because I was very surprised at the statement of arrested man that he chose his victims at random. I could not believe my ears when I heard the news. Much crime occur all over Japan. Especially in Tokyo, I feel many killings related to human relations. Some of the case are at random. Now, I live in Tokyo alone because my hometown is Sendai. When I started living by myself, my parents were worried about my getting caught up in a crime. I often hear such a news, so I will continue to watch out a crime and guard me by myself from now on.  I can not understand that such murder who killed people indiscriminately commit killing. When I read this article, I was sad. This news happened four years ago. But I remember this case. And I thought ""There was a thing like that. "" But at heart, that case happened four years ago, I did not remember in detail. What is more when I heard this news, I was not a university student and did not belong to faculty of law. Before I study human rights , for example constitution, I agree with the death penalty. But now, I am a university student and besides belong to faculty of law. I study jurisprudence that includes human rights. I disagree with the death penalty. Because trial is sometimes wrong. The judge, too, are people. If an accused who is innocent in fact is sentenced to the death penalty, it is a false accusation. And a person who is innocent is punished by nation. And often said that killers claim life, so they are paid for their own lives. Then why people who wound people shall be punishable to a fine or imprisonment ? If the death penalty adopt punitive justice, for example an eye for an eye a tooth for a tooth , people who wound people not punished but wounded. For these reasons, I disagree with the death penalty.  I don't agree with your opinion. I will state my opinion the following. I will insist two points. One point. People who don't have work may be hard to get a house. And vice verse, people who don't have a house may be hard to get work. Certainly such people are disappointed at every things. While it may be true that they should not do indiscriminate murder. And I think that people who killed other people do not their best. He said that he wanted to commit suicide. Because he give up hope. Just because do not kill innocent people indiscriminately. Two point. I think that nation should put up policy to save such people. And the nation should save such people, too. At first, I will tell you that nation should do. Nation should set up institutions for people who have difficulty in seeing off normal life and set draft budget to use for social policy. What is more , to get money to set up institutions and spend money for social policy, the nation should pay tax. I am studying now constitution, it says principle of equality. So people who spend normal life understand the present circumstance and then pay tax. From the words above, I don't agree with the opinion. "
JOC JOC-12B-01N 1.34 "All Japanese should not abdicate writing in their language. Because the language is a kind of the cultures. We need to inherit this culture. For that, we have to keep the opportunities to write characters in longhand. For example, exchanging letters with friends frequently is one of the ways to maintain the faculty.  Many Japanese is said to lose their Kanji skills in the article. I think so too. I sometimes cannot recollect Kanji which I want to write. However, I think that it is no need to make children write Kanji hardly. This is because there are dictionary.  I agree with this article when I read it. Recently, many technical machines were invented by many companies such as computer and smartphone. When we write e-mail, we don't need to think how to write kanji. This causes this huge problems in Japan. If we write kanji by hands, there are many good points. For example, if we don't know how to write kanji, we can search it and also remember it at the same time. Then we can learn many other new kanji characters. We should solve this problem by learning how important kanji is.  I think Kanji is one of the most important culture. We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently. So, we should increase the opportunity to write kanji.  I don't think Japanese people is getting indifference to kanji. I often hear that the number of people who try kanji skill test are on the increase. As far as I know, many people still has motivations to improve their kanji skill. I agree , however, that Japanese people have fewer opportunity to write kanji than before. We use computers to produce documents or use emails instead of postcards. Serious thing is that the lack of opportunity to write kanji can lead to the decline of whole ability to use Japanese. It's because writing kanji is not only learning the letter itself but also learning Japanese vocabulary. The most serious thing is that children will not be able to acquire kanji sufficiently. Now elementary school is the only place where students are taught how to write kanji and practice it through taking notes. If the computers are introduced into all the classes, it deprive children of the opportunity to learn kanji. For children, writing kanji on notebooks may be the best way to learn kanji.  I don't know Chinese grammars well, but we can explain any words by using 'kana', so I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. Now in Japan, if you can write difficult words by kanji, you will be praised and thought smart. But reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing moment by moment, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again.  I don't think the problem with which this article says that we Japanese are confronted is serious . I agree that the Kanji is one of the Japanese culture and we need to find a way to make future children to understand how to use them. but I disagree with the comment. First, none of us have almost forgotten the 'kanji' which we have to write by hand at least in everyday life. Secondly not only 'kanji' but 'hiragana' or 'katakana' can we use. If we forget some 'kanji' words, we can express what we want to easily by them. Third even if we forgot some words, 'modern communications technology' could help us. Therefore I don't think that we have been in trouble with writing some 'kanji' in everyday life and that the problem is severe . It may be important to learn 'kanji' in the childhood and succeed this tradition, but we don't have to deplore that we lose ability to write 'kanji'.  I agree with general ideas of Japanese that afraid of declining Kanji skills, especially future generations. In fact, smartphone is trend and it accelerates the problem, I think. However, Japanese should be able to write Kanji by hand correctly. Though Kanji is from China, I believe it is one of Japanese important cultures. It's natural to protect own culture.  I agree with ID12054's and ID12028's idea. We Japanese should continue writing Kanji by hand as our traditional culture. In addition I have another reason for this. These days some people that we need not write Kanji by hand because of computers and smartphones. However I think that we need write Kanji by hand to grow intelligence since we are children.  Since we have many convenient technology like tablet , smart phone , laptop. Those things give us less opportunity to write Kanji. I go university so I sometimes write Kanji when I need to write down during classes. But My parents said they mostly use computers during their works. it depends occupations but i guess we Japanese have few opportunity to write Kanji. If we lose ability to write Kanji we might lose cultural identity .  When I read this article, I think it's true like other people have said. I also think we have fewer opportunity to write Kanji. Some people who have commented said we have ""Kana"" as well, and we could use that to write. However, I think ""Kana"" is designed to support use of ""Kanji"". I think using ""Kana"" mainly shouldn't happen. I think we need some plan to have more opportunity to write ""Kanji"".  As we are exposed to smartphones and computers in our everyday lives, we have less opportunity to write Kanji. Naturally we start forgetting how to write Kanji. Some say that's a serious problem, but for me, it's not a big deal. Although we do not write Kanji compared to the past, we can't avoid seeing and reading Kanji in everywhere. We feel our ability to read them is not decreasing and that's why this article said that Japanese are losing ability to ""write"" Kanji , not ""read"" Kanji. Of course sentences written in only Hiragana or Katakana are extremely difficult to read, but in this modern society, we mostly use smartphones and computers when we contact people except for talking. We send e-mail, use twitter or line, create a Word document for meeting and so on. We can read Kanji, so we can choose correct one from character conversion. In conclusion, we can contact people smoothly even if we cannot write Kanji.  I think that this problem is very serious. Because Japanese people have used kanji for a long time. This tradition should protect. But, by using kanji conversion function of phone, usually young people have not written in kanji. More over I think that even old people have not done. It is very important for us not to depend on phone.  The article makes me to consider whether we still need to write Kanji by hand or not. Even though 66.5% of people have fear against forgetting to write Kanji, they do not try to stop using electric equipment which write it quickly and correctly instead of you. But I don't want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they show it in the most simple way. Kanji is the most smart and interesting character in the world. Because they recognize Kanji's importance and convenience, so many people have fear to forget about it. Also, it is sad to forget the character which we have learned from young. It is no need to stop using electric equipment, but required to try to write Kanji by hand as much as possible, in everyday life.  Today, many people use PC or smartphones, thanks to them it is not need to write Kanji correctly. These are great helps when we write a paper or send e-mails. I also sometimes feel I'm losing ability. But Kanji is Japanese important culture and we have to keep up this tradition. So we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji with hand.  It is deplorable that some Japanese people lose their ability to write kanji because of the spread of PC or cell phones. I occasionally write kanji characters making strokes in the wrong order. I've heard that people tend to be more tenacious if there is a reward for the effort. So I think providing opportunity to test people's ability to write kanji such as the Kanji Aptitude Test is effective in making people interested in writing kanji.  I agree that the Kanji is one of the Japanese culture but I disagree with ID12038's idea because i think if we can read it and understand the meaning perfectly there is no point for writing kanji i guess. therefore i think we do not need to solve this problem as soon as possible but we need to find a way to make future children to understand how to use them.  I don't dislike kanji characters unlike this survey because they look cool and smart, I think. This news overstates the problem that we may lose Japanese kanji abilities. It is because we have few possibilities that we will decline and lose kanji in our daily life because kanji characters have taken root among Japanese for huge ages.  The society changes rapidly now. It's natural that many people input a letter with a computer. But, writing a kanji by hand is needed. We should write a letter by hand since we were child. I want to regard more Japanese culture as important.  I really agree with ID12055's idea. I think that I have been losing my skills to write kanji because of smartphones and PC. However, kanji is Japanese culture, so we should not reduce the ability to write kanji.  I think this news is natural. I always use a cellphone. And, I send emails. Then, I use many kanji. But, there are a few kanji that I cannot write. I have heard such news. Many Japanese can read difficult kanji. But, they cannot write. I am such a person, too. Recently, people reduce an opportunity of writing a character by hand because of an advance of science. It is not bad because I think although we do not write kanji, we can communicate.  More and more Japanese people is losing their ability to write Kanji. I also often can't write correct Kanji by hand. This is serious problem. There are many words which have same reading but different meanings in Japanese. Kanji helps us understand the meaning of the word. So we should face this problem as possible as soon.  When I read this article, I wasn't so surprised. Because, I am feeling my kanji skill is failing recently. After I entered university, I often use computer to make documents. And, I sent e-mail everyday. As a result, I don't write kanji by hand much. I can read so many kanji, but I can't write difficult kanji , for example, ""utsu"". I am afraid of decreasing my kanji skill. And, I think this problem is so seriously for Japan. Kanji is precious culture. We have to make an effort keeping own kanji writing skill. I'm going to try to write kanji by my own hand everyday.  I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem, especially to Japanese children. Nowadays, elementary school students are natural to have modern communication technology and this is the core reason why they are losing such an ability. When the adults were young, they did not given those devices so they are somewhat forced to write kanji, which means they are given opportunity to write kanji. But children today can get away from writing kanji and so they are lacking the opportunity to write kanji. In other words, adults today have the basic ability to write kanji because they have learned once and it is easier to recall again once they have built the foundation of writing kanji, but children today are lacking the foundation from the beginning and it can be too late to gain the ability after they get older. Also, some will say that you can learn kanji from modern communication technology and there are hiragana or katakana to communicate with each other, but it is unlikely to assume that the proper way of using kanji and tradition of using proper Japanese can be preserved through the device. ( Not to mention the difficulty of communicating only using hiragana and katakana when the context is complicated. ) However, it is true that we cannot stop this trend of using modern items so what we have to do is to place more emphasis on education of writing kanji in the elementary school. The problem of lacking the ability to write is not only unique problem to Japan. We can say the same thing to children in USA or Britain as well. Because many of the students use short cut messages when emailing to frieds, many of the students are forgetting the proper spelling of words. Anyway, as I have said before, we cannot stop this trend of using modern technology but we can concentrate more on writing skills at school, and maybe schools need to teach their students about risks of using modern technology as well.  We have to think seriously that problem. Writing kanji is one of Japanese culture, so losing skills of writing kanji means losing a part of our culture. I think children should practice writing kanji more, and I agree with the opinion that we must consider how children should be taught to use computers, the agency said. From the view of communication skill, children don't have to use computers so much. Communicate with others by using letter namely by writing kanji by hand may help children to establish good human relations.  It is a grave problem for Japanese people to forget writing enough numbers of kanji. If Japanese people can't use kanji , they will make it difficult to live by Japanese language. Thanks to kanji, we can read Japanese sentences more clearly. But I also think Japanese students should not cut down the time to learn the skill of computers because of this ""kanji"" problem. The abilities to use computers are essential for the students to live in the future in this world. How to balance between calligraphy lesson and computer learning is the problem for us to think about.  I think that Japanese people are losing the ability to write kanji certainly. But i also think that it is not very important thing. At present, we use e-mail. But in early time, when people are at another place, if they would like to communicate with each other, the way of communicating is only writing a letter. So Japanese people are accustomed to writing kanji. However, when we use e-mail to communicate with other people and type kanji by cell phone, cell phone in itself can transform letter into kanji. So even if people know just vague kanji's figure, they can type the kanji because they remember it's figure. In this article, it is very important problem in the society. But I don't think so. This is because who can have the skill of writing all kanji? Who also can remember the order of writing kanji? It is said that this order is important. But maybe, most of people don't know it just like kanji learning at the elementary school. And also when people transform letter into kanji by cell phone, they have to know the kanji's meaning. If they know the meaning, it isn't matter in the society because they can understand this sentence. I think that the problem in the society is that they cannot understand the kanji in itself. The root of the cause is Japanese education system. So we have to make effort to solve the problem not blaming e-mail.  I think kanji is one of the most important Japanese culture. Therefore, losing Japanese's ability to write kanji is serious problem. I like Japanese language because of its warmth, which is due to kanji. But I also feel I am losing ability of writing it. Nowadays, Japanese students study both computer skills and writing kanji. But I think kanji writing is treated lightly. Leaving as it is will bring about break down of Japanese traditional culture. We must rethink how important kanji is for our culture.  In my case, I heartily felt that I forget kanji now when I am in Japan more than when I study in abroad. I used to write on note when I practice Japanese words. However, after I started living in Japan, I realized that memorize kanji is not that important to live in Japan. Of course kanji is vital when student take term examination however, when I communicate, or writing reports, iPhone and computer assist me to change hiragana to kanji automatically. For this reason, I firmly assert that teaching child with computers is not appropriate. I think children have to learn their languages with their own hands. It is inevitable to write a report with a computer when they grow up so, at least they have to be accustomed to write kanji when they are young.  There are some people who say that forgetting kanji is not really a big problem but I totally disagree this idea. It's true that writing skills of kanji is not necessary in our normal everyday lives. . . . since we use iPhones and computers to have contact with each other. However, thinking about that we were all born in Japan and how important it is to protect our culture, I can't help saying that lost of our writing kanji skills is such a disappointing thing. I believe we should be able to write kanji as long as it is our old, and wonderful culture.  Actually, I think the issue is not so big a problem. I guess we cannot go against the current of the times which is trying to deal all the things by using computers. In that way, we cannot help losing the ability to write the kanji. Of course I feel a bit sad 'cause we're gonna lose a part of Japanese traditional culture. But think about the past! Could we preserve all the traditional culture? Never. So maybe we need to compromise with the matter, and let us get a better life by using lots of convenient tools.  I am poor at writing Kanji. Because I don't have a lot of times when I write Kanji. I use a smart phone and a personal computer. So I don't have to write Kanji. But I think that we should be good at writing Kanji. Because Kanji is a system made by ancient. Kanji is also beautiful and cool. And writing Kanji beautiful is a skill needed by Japanese society. I can't write words correctly and beautifully. So I respect people who can write words correctly and beautifully. In elementary school, teachers should teach more about Kanji. By the way, I want to get pre-1 grade of kanji skill.  Since I deeply love Kanji personally, and this is one of the important culture of Japan, this was very sad news for me. However, with transliteration function of computers or cellphones, we can make sentences with correct Kanjis. So, ultimately, what we need to have is ability of reading Kanji, not of writing kanji. Therefore, I think this will be less and less important issue as the technology replaces with handwriting.  I think the order of kanji strokes are something very important when writing by hand. The balance and the appearance of the kanji differs when we don't use the proper order. On the other hand when we write kanji in proper order the kanji looks beautiful. Japanese people are often particular about this appearance. Also, Kanji is ancient and very important Japanese culture. We should be proud of kanji and we also should respect and protect our culture. . I myself am not against the use of mails and new technology but I do not want to lose important Japanese culture so I will try hard not to forget easily.  I think Kanji is one of the precious Japanese culture so it is a shock to hear that some people are saying that not being to write Kanji is not a big problem. Kanji makes you read easier and from the Kanji been used, people understand what the writer is trying to say. Kanji is a politeness for the reader and it is very important.  I think 'losing  kanji' is a natural thing. Language reflects society. Many linguists argue that languages change if society changes. There was a lot of changing in languages until now. We can find examples of language alternation easily in history. And also, a famous Korean writer mentioned that language is a creature in his book. I think this is a good sentence to explain the character of the language that changes by circumstance. And because of the internet and technology, alternation in language is more obvious in these days. For example, there is a dictionary for new words because lots of new words generated every day. I think 'losing  kanji' is kind of this alteration. According to this logic, I argue 'losing  kanji' is a natural thing. Kanji is uncomfortable when it comes to using a keyboard. Katakana is used instead of kanji often on the internet. Even though these kinds of alterations occur frequently, I don't think only technology made kanji dissolve. There are two alterations in Japanese kanji due to technology. One is a losing kanji and the other is the restoration of complicated kanji. For example, @@@@ was usually written as @@@@ in early days because @@ is too complicated. But even though it is difficult to remember, people can write easily with a keyboard. Because of this, I argue that technology is not harmful for learning kanji.  I think forgetting Kanji is caused by increasing of using electronic things such as mobile phone, iPad and PC. One of my friend is using iPad to copy what teacher write on board. Now, young people don't communicate by hand writing. They mostly use mobile phone and internet therefore, they don't need to remember how to write Kanji. It will be big problem in future i guess.  The development of our technology is most likely the reason why young people are losing their ability to write Kanji in recent years. As Gento said above, we, young people do not take note by hand writing. My friends around me bring their laptops to school and type what is on the board, and they sometimes take a picture of it with a camera of smartphones. To solve the problem, I think reading books would be efficient way.  Many latest Japanese have lost the capability to write a Kanji. I may not understand a Kanji frequently, either. However, now, it is bad. It is because a Kanji is what has been transmitted from ancient times and it should hand down to future generations. People should become the society which uses a Chinese character more.  It is said that Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji' due to emails. I think so too. When I write kanji, I can't remember some kanji. Then I feel the adverse effect of email.  This is bad thing. Because ""kanji"" is one of the important Japanese culture. But we cannot stop this trend because of development of modern technology. In this situation I think it's important to practice ""kanji"" hard in early stage of our lives.  I think writing Kanji is important. The technology has developed dramatically, so we could predict that the opportunity for writing will decrease. Although, to study the order to write it or to memorize it , writing Kanji are necessary. Furthermore, there is a culture of calligraphy in Japan. To protect this, writing is essential.  I agree that we Japanese should seriously grapple with this problem. But, at the same time, children(who are not yet mastered sufficient Japanese) should not be deprived the chances of learning computers. From my experience, as an example, I had been learned how to use computers from 1st grade at elementary school. This, such as information gathering on the Internet, had often made my studying better. And also, owing to limit the time of using computers, I have been fine in using kanji. So, it's important to have a lot of chances to using kanji. The problem is many adults (or workers) depend too much on emails. They should not have enough time to writing kanji as students. It may be good for them to review their degree of dependence on emails.  I think that Japanese people's Kanji skill has fallen. Due to digitization progresses, the opportunity to write by our hand is decreasing. However, I think that the capability to use the Chinese character itself does not change even if the capability to write a Chinese character falls. When we change hiragana to kanji with a personal computer, we ourselves have to decide which to use. I think that ability has not fallen, as people consider.  I think that it is very big problem for future generations that Japanese losing ability to write ""kanji"". Now, due to smartphone like iPhone spread, the ability to write character correctly. I think this is very important problem and should be solved immediately. If this situation will continue, in the near future, it has a big influence for the next generations.  It's regrettable problem. Because of PC and smartphone, the chance of writing kanji is going down. I think Japan needs to reform educational system and make people obligate to get ""kanken"".  I think it is natural for Japanese people to loose skill of writing kanji because people daily don't have to write kanji by developing electronic device. Also I believe kanji is very important culture for Japanese. So, I think Japanese people should protect ability to write kanji.  I am starting to forget how to write kanji in the right way and I think it comes from using computer as a studying tool. It is common thing to use computer to write report even in junior high school now. By using computer there would be less time for us to think about which one is the right kanji or how was the right way to right kanji. I think it is good thing to use computer to write something because it is more efficient. But I think Japanese people should be careful to have enough time to learn kanji. Sometimes I feel shame when I sow students studying abroad in Japan, writes difficult kanji which some of us don't know.  I was not very surprised to know that Japanese people are losing their ability to write kanji because I have experienced not to be able to remember some characters since I got used to use computers. Even though I understand that I should write by hand as much as possible in order to maintain my kanji skill, I cannot actually do it because it is much easier and more convenient to type on computers. If all the people feel the same way and continue to avoid handwriting, what author is concerned about might come true. However, I would like to insist here that our kanji culture and Japanese pride are a lot stronger than that. Thus, I do not think that we have to take this as a serious problem for the future children and believe that they will still be able to write kanji and cherish the culture 'by blood. ' I don't know whether Japanese writing skills is losing, like that this news story says. However, these days there are too a lot of digital tools, for example smartphones and computers. So, it is right that the chance of writing documents with pens is less and less. In fact, I type on my smartphone every day. Writing kanji is important Japanese culture, so if our writing skill is losing, I think it is a big problem. However, I don't feel my writing skill is losing. I think that it is more important to make sentences to protect Japanese culture even if we use digital tools. Of cause, kanji is an old good culture. We don't have to forget them. I should use them in making documents, but it is not necessary to say for us.  Japanese are losing ability to write kanji because the development of the computer has changed the whole life-style of us. Personally, I think this phenomenon reflects the times, and we cannot go against the times. So certain amount of loss is inevitable. But culturally, this damage is too serious. So we must rethink how to use computers and realize again the importance of Japanese traditional kanji.  Some people say that Japanese language is ""the most beautiful language in the world"". Although Kanji has its roots in China, Japanese people has arranged them to be unique and beautiful form. So I think it's too deplorable that Kanji, a sort of Japanese ""identity"", may disappear from our culture.  I doubt that emails influence writing ability. If there are not emails, we write a letter? We wouldn't write a letter, and we would use telephone. In other words, emails don't effect writing ability.  Characters are one of the most important cultural aspects which make what we are. So we should worry more about the loss of writing skills of kanji because it could be a ""identity crisis"". We have a responsibility to save the culture which still remains, and pass down it to posterity.  Japanese should write kanji more. I have to learn to read and write more. Japanese identity is lost. We need to reaffirm the goodness of our culture. It's not an easy thing, we do not have to work.  I don't think we Japanese have to use kanji. kanji makes Japanese so difficult for foreign people, and less and less people become Japanese-phobia. It's true that it's bad young Japanese don't write kanji, but it's not necessarily bad phenomenon.  I heard about that news. Less we write Kanji, less we can use Kanji. However, it's an inevitable situation. Because we have abandoned things which we didn't need to use.  I disagree with ID12012. As we have less opportunity to write kanji, our ability to write kanji sharply declines. I read a book that says some high school students 50 years ago knows about 30000 words while college student today have only 15000~20000 words in average. We can guess from this book that the number of kanji in common use decreases as we are less likely to use kanji. Our ability to write kanji in common use is getting limited. Moreover, kanji has important role of conveying the concept. It cannot dispense with hiragana and katakana. We should inherit this traditional character.  I think so too this article. The custom of writing a character has decreased. So, at the school, you should prepare many opportunities to write a character.  I agree this comment because I feel my waiting Kanji skill is losing. I sometimes can't recall Kanji I would like to write. And I think the mainly reason is the existence of PC and smartphone, like this comment say. We don't need to write with hands. However Kanji is an important culture which expresses identity of Japanese, so we should have more chances to use Kanji with pen. This comment says almost the same may thought.  The recent Japanese does not write a character. We can easily contact a partner if We send an email by carrying in the present age. In other words We did almost none of writing a character, and sending a letter. I became very sad that I knew this news. I cannot write a kanji in being ashamed that I write a character every day and want to live a life.  I think his idea is very shallow. The problem we have to focus on this issue is that young generations have been more exposed to convenient tools and they are more unlikely to remember how to write kanjis. On the first level, he thinks about traditions as not so important but we have to bear in mind that tradition makes us special. What I mean here is that individuality includes traditional cultures as well and without them, you will be trifling person. On the second level, without the ability to wright kanji, it makes our life more difficult to live. It is okay when you just text messaging to your friends because you don't need to use difficult kanjis. But what happens when you enter into the society? At then, you will realize that without the ability to write kanjis, you will confront with difficulties. Once you have made basics of kanji, it is more easier to recall them again, but when using new technologies from the young age, no base will be built and it will affect to your future in a negative way. So we should take this problem more seriously.  This article says now many Japanese skills decrease rapidly. I have same idea. I think we Japanese should use kanji more and more. Certainly the number of kanji are increasing and English is regarded as important. So some one says Japanese is not very important. But kanji is the part of Japanese culture. We must not forget studying Japanese.  I think kanji is one of several wonderful culture of Japan. We must continue to protect this precious culture. I can read ""utu"", but I can't write it. It is important to use kanji from daily.  I feel his opinion is something like utilitarian way. A language, which symbolize a culture is really important to what we are. It's never the matter of utility. So I disagree with this comment.  I agree with this article. I sometimes forget a kanji which I want to write in longhand. I think that it caused by the spread of telephones and PCs. I believe that Japanese must inherit kanji. We should be careful of an opportunity to write characters in longhand. For example, Nenga-jo (a New Year's card) gave us it. Japanese send it for friends, relatives or acquaintances for greeting the New Year. However, the number of Japanese who send it on the New Year's Day is decreasing. I think that we should maintain the custom forever.  I don't think Japanese people might lose cultural identity even if we lose ability to write kanji. You can choose which kanji should be used if you cannot write kanji by hand.  I think we lose. the opportunity to write kanji by ourselves. So I think we should not only increase the opportunity but also create the situation that have to write the kanji.  I strongly agree with this comment, because it's idea is novel one for me in that it says that languages should change according to the ages. Although we often take things which surround us for granted, but this comment makes a good guess that happens in present changing, or the usage of kanji is changing now. I was impressed with this point.  I agree with this opinion. Because, I think kanji is important culture and writing kanji is more polite to the reader, too.  As technology develops, it decreases the opportunities for us to handwrite and I think that this has led Japanese people to start to forget how to write their own language. Some might say that this could lead to losing cultural identity but I still do not think that this is a serious problem. It will become a serious problem when we forget to talk and read Japanese.  I did not think it was a big deal either. We still see kanji in our everyday lives and we can read it, speak it and listen to it so we have not lost something that stops us from communicating.  I do not think the culture will disappear because of using the computer. Also, I suppose the opportunity of writing kanji will not increase because the IT is developing rapidly. It is inevitable. The person who commented like this do not think the thing practically I guess.  The article makes me to consider whether we still need to write Kanji by hand or not. Even though 66.5% of people have fear against forgetting to write Kanji, they do not try to stop using electric equipment which write it quickly and correctly instead of you. But I don't want to lose the opportunity to write Kanji by hand. Each Kanji has meaning and they show it in the simplest way. Kanji is the most smart and interesting character in the world. Because they recognize Kanji's importance and convenience, so many people have fear to forget about it. Also, it is sad to forget the character which we have learned from young. It is no need to stop using electric equipment, but required to try to write Kanji by hand as much as possible, in everyday life.  I think it sad that Japanese are losing one of their traditions. But the situation changes. In Japan each people used to learn reading, writing and calculating in their local community. Now the educational system has been changed into the Occidental way, and computers have developed. It also seems we should not stick to the handwriting culture. I think we should separate the handwriting and typewriting, and handwriting should be passed down as cultural one.  I agree with this opinion. today, young Japanese usually use their sell phones or PCs to send a massage, but do not write a letter or a post card, so they cannot remember Kanjis, and they do not write Kanjis using their hands. I also use Kanjis on my sell phone using my brain not so much, so I cannot memorize new kanjis. Todays young children should write letters or post cards more, and should not use their sell phones so much.  I think the Japanese losing ability to write kanji due to emails is severe problem. There are two reasons. Firstly as Japanese forget kanji, kanji - Japanese traditional culture - is gradually declining in power. Good tradition must be preserved. Secondly the ability of Japanese will be worsen.  I think writing kanji characters correctly is an evidence of being a well-educated adult. So, this trend must be taken seriously. Of course, it is true that computers or mobile phone are essential for communication these days. But words are transformed predictively and automatically by these tools. All we have to do is type in their alphabet. If people rely on this function too much, they will stop writing kanji with their own hand and thinking of how to write them. The young, especially university students, should write their paper without using computers once in a while.  I think that the Japanese culture of writing kanji has to be maintained and we should teach it to our children and grandchild not to pass away it. Nowadays, one of the educational policies promoted by Japanese government is that the introduction of positive English lessons makes Japanese children good English speakers. Certainly, it is so important to study and master English since children are little in the world having become globalization. But I think it is not so good that the longer time they spend studying English, the shorter time they spend writing and reading kanji. That is because using kanji is able to express various emotions. I hope to continue the culture in the future.  I agree with this article's opinion that Japanese afraid of declining Kanji skills. However, I think they still have motivation to write Kanji because many people try to learn it and have its skill tests (Kanken). So if they have more opportunities to write kanji, they become more interested in kanji, and ease their anxiety. I think it is important to teach the pleasure that write kanji to children. We should continue to maintain the place where children can learn kanji from now on.  Kanji is Japanese traditional culture. I started to learn Kanji when I was elementary school student and now I sometimes study it for Kanji Kentei. However when I study Kanji, I feel that I cannot write Kanji compared with the past. In Japanese, a cellular phone is commonplace. Therefore people don't write letter and use the e-mail service. When we use the cellular phone, we don't write Kanji, so we cannot write Kanji. However Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we have to protect this culture. I think the one of sentences using a kanji is easy to understand meaning of the sentences. Furthermore, Kanji is used every place in Japan, so we are inconvenience if we can't use kanji. Therefore we must study Kanji.  I agree with you. I think Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should protect it. Increasing the opportunity to write Kanji is nice idea. We have to use Kanji more positive. It isn't better to depend on a PC and smart phone. We should write Kanji with own hands. If we use Kanji, we can understand the meaning of the word easily. I think that Kanji is wonderful. I decide to study Kanji more.  I agree with you. I think we don't need to think how to write kanji, too. Because we use e-mail and so on, the time when we write sentence with pen decrease. Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we should be able to write and read many kanji.  I think so too. Kanji is one of the most important culture. We use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us recently. So we have to give Kanji's good point to other country This problem applies to me. I don't usually write kanji. I often use my cell-phone. Kanji is our important tradition. We must pass our next generation Kanji.  Now we use smartphone everyday, everywhere. When we explore some Japanese words, they are quickly changed to Kanji. It prevents us learn Kanji carefully.  There are a few thing which I think when I see this article. I don't know Chinese grammars, but we can explain words by using 'kana'. So, I don't think that Japanese people are forgetting 'kanji' is bad. However, Reading or writing kanji is good for only at school or private time, using computers well is more important in the company well. The needs of society is changing now, and someday, the needs of 'kanji' may come again.  Kanji is the most important culture. Recently we use computer or cellphone every day and it is necessary for us. We should use Kanji more and more. "
JOC JOC-12B-01O 1.11 "I am poor at English, so I cannot convey my thoughts to you. At first, that is absolutely true that children who are in Japan cannot write KANJI at all. Thanks to Internets are spreading to the new generation, young people use Internet everyday. As a result, people cannot write KANJI, but I write KANJI properly. This is because I cannot use computer. KANJI is one of the most important Japanese culture of many cultures. I think that we should save this culture forever.  Sad to say, not only children but many Japanese cannot write KANJI nowadays. Actually, I often forget KANJI, either. To be precise, I usually can read it, but cannot write. I guess many people are the same as me. One of the reason may be that we depend too much on technologies such as a computer or an iPhone. Of course, they are useful, so I think it is good thing to use them. However, I want to advise people not to use them too much because it might be the cause of losing your writing ability. To pass on from generation to generation as precious tokens of culture, I think we shouldn't be lazy to write KANJI.  Recently, new friend's name reminds me of not face but the icon of ""twitter"" or ""LINE"". Communication on the Internet deprived not only our kanji skills but also opportunities to meet friend. A lot of people say that we should maintain our tradition. They don't welcome these changes. I agree that we should cherish our tradition, but at the same time I am all excited at the future which has many new cultures.  These days, many people in Japan do not have much opportunity to write characters, because of e-mails. Consequently, people who can read characters, but not write them are increasing. This problem is very serious for us, because Kanji is one of the Japanese culture and tradition. We have to guard our culture and tradition. Therefore, I think that school in Japan should add to class of Kanji. As a result, all people in Japan can not only read Kanji but also write it.  In an information-oriented society, we are demanded to use modern communications technology. As a result, we forget how to write Kanji. I think it cannot be avoided. When we write something by hand in Kanji that we forgot, we can consult a dictionary. However, concerned that future generations, I want them to learn Kanji correctly, and then, to use computers or mobile phones.  Nowadays, we often use computers to write essays or an iPhone to communicate with our friends. We don't have much opportunities to write Kanji by hand. As a result, many people forget Kanji and they cannot write it sometimes. But Kanji is one of the most important Japanese culture, so we need to keep them for the future generation. So I think it is better to give more opportunities to write by hand to young people.  Today, we always use computer tools in everyday life to write anything, that is, have less occasion to write letters by hand. Therefore, it is extremely natural for us to decline kanji skills. Actually I am often perplexed at the slip of memory of writing kanji. Although I can read a lot of kanji, I cannot take it out smoothly from my head. In my view, kanji is one of the most particular and traditional culture in the world. So we have to protect and survey it to the new generations while Japanese should build up their foreign language skills to adapt the globalization of current world. In order to do that, I strongly insist the exhaustive increase of writing opportunities because it is the most efficient way to memorize each character.  These days, we have few opportunities to write Kanji by hand thanks to the communication on the Internet . We can use Kanji easily to press conversion key. Actually, I often forget how to use Kanji. I think this problem is serious because that means the decline of Japanese culture. I think we should get many opportunities to write Kanji at the office and school. I hope young people write Kanji easily and teach foreigners Japanese culture.  It is true that Japanese are losing ability to write kanji because of e-mails. On the other hand, developed communication tools like cellphone and computer are useful. E-mails have many advantages. We can convey our messages quickly and easily. As a result, we don't have as many opportunities to write kanji by hand as before. But I don't think we can lose ability to write kanji because it has been tradition of Japan to write Japanese. It is necessary to teach to children how to use computer properly, but giving a lot of opportunities to write characters to them is also important. We can keep up both e-mails and ability to write kanji.  Kanji is very difficult to memorize. Especially ""utu"" is the one of the most difficult ""Kanji"" as this report write. Now I will introduce how to write it. ""Linker drink American three cups of coffee. "" Please try this ! I think it is most important to write many times. Because people always forget if they write one time. I suggest that children should study with Tensei Jingo"" The way of this study is easy. To write it as the same of the paper. This will give them good skill !!!!!!!!!!! In my opinion, the writing skill is no longer essential because we can do almost everything with computer, cellphone, and something like that on study and business, and which has caused the problem. It means that the writing skill isn't needed any more. Therefore, I suppose that the decreasing is not a problem to survive in present day. However, it's a problem to Japanese culture, because kanji is one of the most important Japanese cultures, and I want to preserve this Japanese identity. Therefore, I think that Japanese people's writing kanji skill should be kept in an ample level for succeeding Japanese culture.  We now frequently use computers or smartphone or tablet to communicate with friends. We don't have opportunities to write Kanji by hand so much. Kanji is important Japanese culture, so we have to keep them.  I agree that recently there are a lot of Japanese whose ability of using Kanji has been decreasing. It is true that the opportunities of writing Kanji are dropping due to the rapid progress of IT technology. When we write reports, letters and so on, all we have to do is to type words into our computers. In fact, declining in opportunities to write Kanji on paper make me difficult to come up with so many kinds of Kanji in daily life. However, using IT, there may be some good aspects to improve the ability of using Kanji. If we see the Kanji we cannot read, electronic dictionary tells us how the Kanji read. If we don't know the correct way of using some words of Kanji, via computer we may understand the way. In next generation, we must look for the best way to increase the ability of Kanji with using IT technology.  Unfortunately it is true that Japanese are losing an ability of writing Kanji. I think that an electronic technology is source of problem. For example, PC and mobile phone is. Actually, Not only children but also adults become not able to write Kanji very well. It is crucial to expand electronic technologies. However, it makes Japanese ability of writing Kanji get weak. We begin not to write Nengajo in the first month, January. In stead of Nengajo, we send an e-mail to our friends. In other words, we lose an opportunity to write Kanji. Using PC to take a note in the class is increasing. Therefore our ability of writing Kanji will get weak from now. I think a solution of this problem is keeping Japanese traditions, Nengajo. The custom of writing a letter is a first step to solve this problem.  I sympathized with this opinion. When I was a high school student, I used my phone in stead of my dictionary to check how to write Kanji which I can't write correctly like @@, @@. I realized my ability to write Kanji when I started to write Kanji positively for my entrance exam and wrote a great deal of Kanji everyday, so I can write Kanji like others now. However, I regretted having used my phone to check how to write Kanji, because the older we are the worse we remember, so it was difficult for me to remember a lot of Kanji. I think parents should teach how to write Kanji by their children's body before teaching how to use computers.  According to this article, there's a serious problem that the number of Japanese losing ability to write 'kanji' is increasing. I think this trend is not very good because ability to write 'kanji' is necessary to communicate with each other. It is true that we can now easily communicate with many people by using Internet. However, 'kanji' has tradition between Japan and China , so I think we shouldn't lose the ability. To solve the problem, we have to try something we can do. For example, education system should be changed , and we can make better environment for children to learn 'kanji' . For me , studying for 'kanji kentei' was very good to learn 'kanji', so I think more children should try such test. There are various solution , but I think the most important thing is our feelings to try to maintain 'kanji'.  Today, we use computers and cellphones to do many things, such as sending e-mails, writing reports. There are few opportunities to write Kanji with your hands. So, a lot of Japanese people are losing ability to write Kanji. This is a serious problem. This problem is not just a problem in Japan. I found that it also occurs in China on the Web. If this problem is getting worse, no one will be able to write Kanji in the world. What should we do to avoid that situation? It is probably important to have more education program of Kanji. However, I believe nothing is more important to have a sense of crisis about this problem and make positive efforts to write Kanji with your hands.  I regard Japanese Kanji problem as questionable. Actually I think my skill of writing kanji is declining, too. Now is the age of information. In Japan, the saturation level of phone and smart phone is more than 100 percent in 2011. Not only children but also adult are being separated from writing kanji in hand. It's important to raise the level of the skill of computer, but we should not forget writing Japanese languages IN HAND. I think when we write letter the best of way to understand partner is the letter by analog .  I think that the Japanese people have to save KANJI as one of the Japanese cultures. It is true that we do not need to write KANJI when we use E-mail and cellphones in order to communicate with people. However, there are some features in the Japanese language we cannot find when we use electronic devices. First, we can guess our friends' feelings. The strength of a brushstroke in a letter tells us writer's feelings to some extent. Second, if we write KANJI regularly and know a lot of KANJI, we can guess the pronunciations of KANJI we don't know.  I think that the ability of writing kanji is declining. Today, we can use cell phone and computer. We can communicate with our family or friend by them not writing letters. So we have many words which we can read and understand but cannot write. I often experience that situation. However, we still have to write kanji, and kanji won't become disused. Kanji help us understand the sentence. Without kanji, our life would be inconvenient. Thus we should be given the opportunity to write kanji correctly. Young and old of both sexes should have the chance to learn kanji and our society must give the chance regularly.  It is true that more and more people are becoming unable to write kanji correctly due to the modern communication technology. However, it is wrong that we attribute this problem completely to the technology. So, those who have something to do with the education have to be eager in making much more opportunities for students to write kanji, I think.  I've known the problem that the number of Japanese people who are unable to write KANJI correctly is increasing. Now, It's the time to think about the problem seriously. I think KANJI is one of the most important Japanese culture. Moreover, KANJI is the part of our lives as we can't live without it. I strongly insist that more opportunities must be reserved in school days. For example, introducing the classes of KANJI in junior high schools. Why can we say ""I'm Japanese. "" without KANJI skills?We have to be aware of being Japanese.  We use a smart phone many times in our life these days. So we cannot write Kanji more than ten years ago. However it is important for Japanese to write Kanji correctly because it is culture we must acquire. Therefore we have to get more opportunity to write Kanji , such as writing a letter.  Need to write a letter with the development of the information society has been lost. But, a letter is important culture. We have to protect the culture. We need effort to do so.  When we get in touch with friends, we use an e-mail instead of a letter. In the old days, writing a letter by handwriting was a main means to communicate. Recently, however, because of developments of technology, using an e-mail is more useful than writing a letter, so we lose opportunities to write""kanji"" and ability to write it. ""Kanji"" is a Japanese culture, so it is a serious problem that we Japanese do not know how to write it. I think it should provide a class of ""kanji"" at school. This will lead to improve ability of ""kanji"".  They say that As we grow up we became to forget how to write a Chinese character. The electronic device spread , so we lose An opportunity to write a Chinese character . but i like write ""kanji"" and i love my name which uses ""kanji"" so, we should use more ""kanji"" and study it!!!! I'm very surprised at how many Japanese people feel difficult to write ""kanji. "" ""Kanji"", of course it is famous, is really traditional and the center if our Japanese daily living. So we don't lose our ability to write ""kanji"" in order to protect Japanese spirit.  I, myself, have the experience of forgetting a particular kanji. I believe it's unavoidable to forget them in this high-tech society with cell phones and other electronic devices, but Kanji is extremely useful and I believe it's one of the Japanese cultural identities so I hope generation under us will be educated well with kanji as we did.  I think it's not so big problem. Although our ability to write ""kanji"" is actually losing and it is bad tendency, we don't have to write many kanji in first hand in our daily life. Today, we can do many things such as writing a letter, making a report and so on with computers. It is true sometimes we can't remember difficult ""kanji"" for a moment, however, it doesn't mean we can't use them. As long as we use ""kanji"" correctly, we don't have to worry about this.  It wasn't until i read this article that i realized what a dangerous situation this is, that is, many young people in Japan apt to forget kanji due to the development of technology . I think it is a pity that the valuable culture of Japan is disappearing. To solve this problem, the Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology should take drastic measure. But i believe it'll be quite a long time before the notion of protecting our precious culture pervades our daily life.  It is true that nowadays the more people are using the Internet , the less people are writing Kanji. However we have to pay attention to the fact that Kanji is estimated as an art overseas. We should remember the value of Kanji and feel sense of closeness to it. That's why I think the government have to take steps to this problem.  I'm very interested in ID14050's' view point. It is true that foreigners, especially Europeans and Americans, recognize Kanji as an art, so such people use it wrong. For example , some people think there is no difference between @@ and @@. So, we must realize the fact that Kanji is not only the character, but also the art.  I think this problem is so serious. And we have to deal with this problem soon, because our culture is lost. The measure to deal with this problem is to take writing Kanji into education or to focus in Kanji-kenntei. We must protect and develop our culture.  Computers made our lives more comfortable . However , we may lose our culture because of them . Kanji is our , Japanese , important culture . So we have to keep them and we must not lose it .  I think Japanese people should be able to write Kanji by hand any better. In recent years, modern communications technology, such as smartphone, became general. In order to that, more and more Japanese people afraid of declining Kanji skills, as this article said. However, Kanji is one of the important Japanese culture, I think. Kanji has been used for more than a thousand years. So we must protect this important culture.  I am surprised at this phenomenon, but I think we do not have to be able to write difficult characters kanji. Until 10 years ago, we needed to make a formal document by hand writing. But now, we make it by typing on a computer, without hand writing. Thus, we have to know only basic kanji which we learn in an elementary school.  I think we should face this problem seriously. In Japan, there are some characters, for example kanji, kana and katakana, but kanji has meaning respectively unlike the others. My favorite kanji is ""@@"" that means ""good"", so I think kanji should be treated more respectfully than the others. Furthermore, in the world, many people know kanji as Japanese culture. By writing kanji and tasting its meaning, we must protect this culture.  I think ""Kanji"" is the feature and the culture of Japan. Recently many people have computers and smart phones. These devices can translate from ""hiragana"" into ""Kanji"" automatically. so, our writing skill of ""Kanji"" is declining. However, we should reform this state for our next generation. I think the most important thing is writing ""kanji"" on paper and repeating this action. Japanese people must write ""Kanji"" everywhere. This is a cool point of Japanese.  I think that it is not bad thing for Japanese to lose ability to write 'kanji'. It is because modern times result in this trend and it will be more and more unnecessary for Japanese to write 'kanji'. Instead of losing this ability thanks to computer and smartphones Japanese know much more 'kanji' than those used to. Therefore, I don't think problem as serious.  Now that computers developed as essential tool for our life. If we input a letter, the computer shows the kanji immediately. This function is very convenient. So you may think that it is not necessary to learn kanji. However, kanji is Japanese culture. And the decline of the language of the country means the decline of the nation itself. Therefore I catch this problem as a serious problem and think that it is necessary to be improved.  I also think this problem is very serious. I studied ""kanji"" when I was elementary school student. But thereafter I studied ""kanji"" myself for the exam. I think this is main cause of Japanese students becoming weak in ""kanji"". Now I want to propose teachers should let students take the exams. For example, there is ""kanji kentei"". Many students have 3 grade of ""kanji kentei"", but few students have grade above 3. At least, students should get the associate 2 grade or regularly take the exam of 3 grade, I think.  I think this problem is so serious that we can't ignore it. I think the measures not to use an E-mail is unreasonableness for Japanese people in the modern age. So we should increase opportunities to regularly write a kanji. With current children are not interested in a kanji, they will not be interested in Japanese culture.  Recently I often used the computer. So I neglected that I learned a technique to write the kanji that was one of the Japanese culture . I intend to set foot in the world of kanji again in reference to your suggestion! Certainly, when we want to send messages, we write a message not on a letter but on a e-mail. Texting makes us forget to write ""KANJI"". We don't have to think the characters because words we text in ""HIRAGANA"" translate into ""KANJI"" automatically. In this way, we become not to use the brain, so we must not stop thinking and writing "" KANJI"".  Japanese traditional is based on letters, so this changes may certainly surprise many people used to live. Technology will be developed much more than now, and the style sending messages and opportunities to meet friends will be changed. But, I also I agree with this idea. When I read this article, I noticed that the opportunities of writing 'kanji' by hand decreased as same as you thought. For example, I takes two lectures on law using not notebooks but tablet. In past days, I wrote notebooks by hand using 'kanji'. We have to keep 'kanji' because it is not only important culture but also great characters that we can understand the meaning when you see only one character.  Now most of us use smartphone. When we explore some Japanese words, they are quickly changed to KANJI. This system prevents us from learning KANJI carefully.  I think we should pay more attention to this problem. Today, the Internet and computer are progressing really fast. We really on computers. This is not the source of the decrease of our writing ability. Tools change and develop as time passes. And our work style change at the same time. The important thing is that we shouldn't stop reading books and newspapers. If we forget characters, we lose many things; culture, tradition and history. The problem of writing ability doesn't finish itself and influence our life heavily.  I agree with your comments. Japanese kanji is difficult. Nobody know how many kanji we have. I think the Japanese are clever because we handle the kanji. The culture should be protected.  When I read this article, I think that this invention is very exciting and helpful. It helps many people who cannot drive because of physical disabilities to go far place. However, at the same time, I think that we need a preparation of laws. For example, we need to clarify who would be responsible for, if a car which is automatically driven broke something or got involved in any troubles.  I am surprised at this phenomenon, but I think we do not have to be able to write difficult kanji. Until 10 years ago, we needed to make a formal document by hand writing without computer. But now, we make it by typing on a computer, without hand writing. Thus, we have to know only basic kanji which we learn in an elementary school. "
JOC JOC-12B-04N 0.29 "I think that EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. It is too early. It is the truth that EU was established for keeping out any wars and this purpose has been fulfilled for 60 years. However we must not forget that EU also holds some countries which suffer for the financial crisis. In fact, we can see a lot of demonstrators in these countries. EU should strive to solve this issue before being awarded the Prize, or peace in EU will not be kept for a long time.  I think the award is just joke because EU caused depressions from Greece and it leads the world to bad world. I think America and Japan also keep the peace. I agree eurosceptics.  I disagree with the Nobel peace prize's winner of this year. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be admitted to be peaceful by people all over the world. But this case, people even in the EU criticizes about the prize, such as eurosceptics. Moreover the word of ""peace"" ought to have the only one meaning, so I believe these wide way of thinking about recipient is wrong.  I think Nobel Prize should be sent to individuals rather than organization. Sometimes many people contribute to common feat together and it's hard to decide who is the best and deserved. As a result, an organization not an individual is awarded. But this decision may not do good to both those who were involved in the feat and the idea of Nobel Prize itself. Firstly, individuals' achievements were hidden by too broad and vague achievement of an organization. For instance, EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace is made up of many individuals' achievements such as breaking the dictatorship. Even if EU awards the Nobel Prize, they cannot attract people's attention. Their feats may not be revealed to people in the world. On the contrary, If a individual awards the Nobel Prize, at least one of their achievements is in the spotlight. Secondary, some organizations utilize Nobel Prize as a propaganda to boost their confidence. Policy of a country is one of the most polarizing issues and many people may not agree to the award. In reality, some praise the EU's contribution to Europe and the world peace while other criticize it even in the member of the EU. And in such a situation, the organizations are only self-satisfied with the award. So I believe Nobel Prize should go to only individuals.  Like other people said, I think EU is not appropriate for Nobel Peace Prize. They were given the prize because they had no war for 60 years, but I think there are other countries where they don't have war for longer than 60 years. Also, like some people mentioned, EU is the one who lead Economic Crisis. There were lot of demos toward government. I'm not so sure that leading Economic Crisis and Demos are ""Peace. "" Also, some people said that Prize should be given to independent, but I think organization also have right to earn the Prize.  I don't think EU deserves Nobel Peace Prize. Though it's admirable that EU had no war for 60 years, we should not say that only such a thing is required for Peace. Because of the recent world wide depression, many people and countries are suffering from financial problem. European countries are some of the most struggling countries in the world. Due to this problem, it's easily assumable that people are loosing their jobs. How can we call that such countries peaceful? I agree with ID12063's comment. I do not think that EU deserves the prize. The prize was given because European countries had no war for 60 years, but I think it is strange because we must not cause a war any more. Therefore, it does not matter whether 60 years have passed. We do not care about that how many years we live without war. We just need to think about not causing a war again.  I don't think that EU deserves to win the Nobel Peace Prize because 60 years of peace in Europe is not special. WWII damaged Europe seriously. Therefore EU didn't have plenty of energy left over for starting new war.  As other people had said, I don't think EU suits to Nobel Peace Prize. Keeping out war is a thing that must be done everywhere around the world and it is not a special thing. There are still many problems are happening in Europe countries and they have to correspond to these problems.  I think this is not worthy to recognize. I agree the Nobel Peace Prize only go to individuals. This recognition look like a performance of politics. And, I think the Nobel Peace Prize should only go to individuals because the Nobel Peace Prize go to a person who contributes to the peace of the world. If the frame of government receive the prize, this means criticizing the others. And, this will connect a thought which winner is always right.  Shameful talk, I didn't know that EU have won the Nobel Peace Prize. I think the Nobel Peace Prize should not only go to individuals but also to organization and so on, because Peace can be protected by everyone. So it's difficult to won the Nobel Peace Prize, but I want to do something for world peace.  Some critics say the reason why EU got the award of the 2012 Nobel Peace Prize is that it will encourage European countries to tackle with the difficulties they are facing now, such as economic crisis. There's no denying that it is a good thing to encourage individuals or organizations to strive hard, but is there any justification for the Nobel Peace Prize to do so? I don't think so. Nobel Peace Prize should be separate from the political or economical matter happening in the country or in the world. They should focus only on whether the deed of the actor is appropriate for being commended. Using this argument, I also disagree with when President Barack Obama was awarded the Peace Prize in the matter of contribution to the peace of Afghanistan. He hasn't really done anything to the peace of Afghanistan ( some say he made Afghanistan more dangerous place) and at this time the prize was awarded just as an encouragement as well. So what I would like to say is that I certainly agree with the fact that some EU countries have contributed to settle down some of the conflicts they had, it was just an outcome of the history, and there's no justification and it is unfair for EU to achieve the prize because while individual or NGO activists routinely make sacrifices and take huge risks to do make the peaceful world, EU are paid to do so.  I am not an European, but Japanese, therefore I do not understand what affairs EU is now confronted with, and what it has really brought Europe. I have so poor knowledge that I am not able to express my opinion about this issue. I have to learn more about it. Anyway I do not care whether Nobel Peace Prize should go to such institutions as EU, or individuals. As Mario Monti says, the prize, I hope, will encourage EU to overcome the current economic difficulties.  I like EU, so I was happy when I was heard the news EU got the Nobel Peace Prize. In fact, I can understand some critics against this incident, but you can't deny the role of EU for peace in Europe. The cooperation between many countries, as EU has done, is very important for achieving the international peace, I think. What EU did is precious the ""history"". We have to learn them, both good things and bad things.  In the first place, the Nobel Prize is awarded to the best of contributor in the each field. In other words, this prize is awarded to the person. Nobel  thought that this prize should be awarded regardless of countries and nations. But is this winning prize against Nobel's will? So I think that the Nobel Prize is awarded to the person not to the organization. Furthermore, I have some doubts about this winning the prize. One of the doubts is the reason why EU is awarded the Nobel Prize. The reason why the EU is awarded is that, as the article written, the EU in recognition of 60 years without war and for encouraging EU governments and people to press forward, ""overcoming the current economic difficulties. "" But it is strange. Firstly, most of democratic countries haven't made wars since WWII. EU side will talk about the relationship between France and Germany especially. But there were tense situation between countries such as Japan and China. Both countries also haven't gone to war. Secondly, winning the prize is strange for only overcoming the economic crisis. First of all, economy is not related to the Piece. And also there were a lot of countries which are facing the crisis. This award is against Nobel's will that should not support a part of countries. For these reasons I disagree with this award.  I don't think that EU deserved Nobel Peace Prize. The reason of that is, no matter what people say, the present economic depressions. And I think EU's idea of integration is great, of course, but I don't think just the idea have worth of the prize. Not only that, this reception would let the value of the prize down and make me think that it is a desperate election. Sometimes, there were the years of no recipient of the prize. Causing these problems, I think not electing was better than electing forcibly.  I agree that the EU was given the nobel prize. It is because there are still some wars all over the world, these days the number of the wars have been reducing, though. Many classmates disagree with this news, but I do not think so. Anything that keep a peace should be praised. I believe that the peace of the whole world is the most important thing that every people should hope. In short, the nobel  organization should give the nobel peace prize to a lot of plans, organizations, and association.  I disagree with the nobel peace prize of this year. Surely it is wonderful to keep being without war for 60 years. However it is a part of the EU. The EU also have bad aspects, for example economic crisis. Moreover the nobel prize should be given to only individuals, because prizing organizations is difficult and can cause many critics.  I do not disagree with the fact that EU has awarded the Nobel peace prize of 2012. Some says it is not appropriate to give such a prize to the organization, but why? I think there is no doubt that the EU has contributed to keep the peace of the European continent. Think about the past! There had been wars in every generations! But, now? no more war. Is there any doubt that it has not contributed to achieve such a great thing? I agree with the nobel peace prize for EU. I think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize. EU accomplish its purpose properly. I expect that this prize will make a sense of unity stronger, and function to improve the economic crises.  I think this collision is being come by the absence of standard of prizing Nobel Peace Prize. Actually, it is hard to establish a standard of Peace Prize. Because Peace can be thought as both comprehensive and microscopic. However, in my personal opinion, I think the Nobel Peace Prize have to be prized by a standard based on microscopic viewpoint. Nobody would be awarded if presenting the Peace Prize based on comprehensive since there are no people who had not made a fault in their lives. Therefore, EU deserved to prize the Nobel Peace Prize.  I think Nobel Peace Prize is given the man who proposed and caught out the idea which has a possibility to make everyone happy. Its aim isn't for everyone, the importance is to make many people happy, and need not any sacrifices. Now, EU can't resolve the problem of poverty, the society which can make a part of people happy is not really happy I think.  I do not think the EU deserves the nobel prize as many students complaining above. They said that the EU was kept without war for 60 years. This should be appreciated, but they caused terrible problem at the same time. The depression we are struggling with now is actually caused from one of the countries of the EU. To receive the prize, they should have solved the problem and been perfect.  I can't understand why EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think that EU contributed peace of world. On the contrary, EU confused the world economy by financial crisis. But, I agree organization are awarded Nobel Prize. Because, I think many kind of method for peace have to be evaluated.  I think it is unconvinced that EU was awarded Nobel Peace Prize. I don't think EU didn't contribute peace of world entirely, but it is abstract and i don't understand how EU contribute.  I think it is important to cooperate with other people to tackle some problems. But once the group became powerful, people in it apt to think their own profit. I don't think that is just. We should be careful not being so.  No war for 60 years in Europe is valuable. But I don't know this is worth awarding as a Nobel Peace Prize. That because I can't understand the criterion of awarding . I think some people are worth awarding it, but others which I didn't think they had done enough services award it. So I think the value of the Nobel Peace Prize is getting less.  As many eurosceptics said, this nobel peace prize for EU may exaggerate it's achievements. If the prize winner was an individual, we could see a consistent policy or so. But a big organization as EU, people can't be sure which to focus on it's accomplishments. The Nobel  committee should show more concrete reason for people assent for it.  many people disagrees about eu winning the nobel peace prize, but i think they should deserve one. as ID12048 said, no war for 60 years in eu is valuable thing so other countries should follow eu's example.  No war for 60 years is good. But, I felt strange that EU got a Nobel peace prize because, EU is not only a country that without war for 60 years. It not fair.  I think EU should not win the nobel peace prize because they are not ready enough. I think that the nobel peace prize should be given to the person who has completed it work which had made a good effect for world peace. These days, I think standard of the nobel prize is blurring. As I said, it should be given to the person who has completed the work. Not ti the person who has only started, like president Obama and Grameen Bank. I feel it is sad that the nobel prize is becoming something that doesn't mean anything.  I think EU don't deserve Nobel Peace Prize . It is not appropriate reason that EU recognition of 60 years with out war.  Like most students have written in their comments, I do not think it is appropriate for the EU to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Unfortunately, there is a fact that the economic crisis which the world is still suffering from was caused by one of the EU country. Also, I am not persuaded by the idea that they received the prize in recognition of 60 years without war. It is not quite fair for other countries which have kept their peace for more than 60 years and have caused any problems like the world depression.  I think the award of EU is not strange. I would like to show two the reason. First, there have been no war theses 60 years in EU, it is worth to being praised. I studied the world history in high school, so I can understand the difficulty to keep piece there. The history of Europe is the history of wars. So, when I think the fact, This situation without wars for 60 years is wonderful. Secondly, this prize implies to expect EU to fight this danger situation of EU. Now, EU has big financial problem with Greece. I think this Nobel Prize means that cheering EU to get over it.  I do not think it amusing that EU wins a Nobel Peace Prize . Because, EU is no-war for 60 years. Moreover, by having won the nobel peace prize, it is thought that the consciousness of the peace of EU will become strong from now on. Therefore, this award is good.  I think the award of EU is natural. the fact that there have been no war in 60 years is so admirable. Were it not for EU, big war among countries would've fired, I guess. so it's worth to be praised.  Once European countries had made war. But EU aimed stabilization of economy and developed a sense of camaraderie, and as a result, no war is going on in Europe. This is great thing, I think. Thinking of Asian countries' confrontation - such as China, North Korea, and Japan-EU's grappling is meaningful. However, not existence of war was brought not only by positive actions for peace but also by the natural course.  Congratulations EU! I think it is good thing that EU got nobel prize. Though EU have tremendous problems, EU have great meaning for future. Europe is mature place. So Europe must take point. Europe is in depression because of financial difficulties of Greece and Portugal. I think EU can great job.  I am for the eurosceptics. I think that EU took an important role in postwar confusion. But it should not be praised now. EU now has many problems such as economic difficulties, and it doesn't seem to have brought a peace to the world. So the award isn't deserved. Possibly the prize will encourage european people to press forward and solve the current problems. But it has nothing to do with the world peace too much. Important thing is what EU did, not what EU will do. Many people misunderstand the meaning of Nobel Peace prize.  In recent years, Nobel Peace Prize tends to be awarded as a hope to the winner's success of its future (for example, Obama was awarded shortly after he was inaugurated as President). Maybe it's the same thing this time. So I think it is not something to get angry.  I agree with ID12054 comment. I think EU doesn't deserve Nobel Peace Prize. Because 60 years without war is a good point but, some countries in the EU have continued economic recession. There are a lot of unemployed. EU does not deserve the prize in economic . Too early to get a prize.  I disagree to the EU won the Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, the EU's recognition of 60 years without war is really good, I think. But they forget the Cold War. After WW2, they struggled for their profits and many countries are suffered from WW2 and the Cold War. So, I think the EU should not won the Nobel Peaze Prize.  I think it is inappropriately that EU win Nobel Prize. Certainly no war has happened since 60 years ago, there is many problem now, so there is possibility the safety of EU become worse. Nobel Prize shouldn't be given EU, should be given individual who tried for EU peace.  I think the EU does not deserve the Nobel peace prize. It is true that countries in the EU strive to unify Europe to create a peaceful civil society and work together as a political experiment to become an example for settling peace in their countries; however, this cannot be a reason for Nobel peace prize. There are two reasons for this idea. Firstly, Alfred Nobel's will specified that the prize should be given to ""the person who shall have done the most or the best work for fraternity between nations, the abolition or reduction of standing armies and for the holding and promotion of peace congresses. "" But it is hard to say EU has promoted peace in other countries. Fundamentally, EU is an organization for the welfare of the people who are members of EU countries. It is true that European countries are at peace because of EU. But even though unification decreased war in Europe and made peace in the European area, EU eventually turned into a hegemony. For example, EU disregarded the demands of help from Burmese pro-democracy activists many times. They requested help from the EU because dictatorship in Burma was worsening and international society did not see the gravity of the situation even though a lot of Burmese citizens were killed or sent to prison. But EU also disregarded that problem. Also, EU is responsible for destroying the Bamyan Buddha. In 2003, the Taliban destroyed the Bamyan Buddha, with the intention of appealing to international society to accept their political will and wish to negotiate with EU and UN to approve Taliban as pre-government of Afghanistan. Of course, Taliban cannot become the government of Afghanistan, and because EU and UN did not talk with them, they finally destroyed Bamyan Buddha which is precious human cultural asset. The EU and UN had to negotiate with them even though the Taliban was not recognized as the official government because they already ruled most of Afghanistan and the EU and UN needed to create a solution to protect the people of Afghanistan and the Bamyan Buddha. Secondly, the idea that EU contributed to the decline of war is wrong. According to Stockholm International Peace Research Institute, in 1990 to 2004, only 4 wars occurred between countries. Aside from country-to-country war, almost every other war was civil war. The decline of war is due to the flow of international politics, not because of the EU.  When I first heard that the EU have earned a nobel peace prize, I was really surprised. The reason is that the EU has played an important role during the war and also did good job to end it. However, now, the EU is having a lot of problems in economies, relationships, and so on. It is true that countries in the EU tried to unify and made some effort to do good politics. However when we think about whether EU has promoted ""Peace"" to the other countries, I can't help saying no to this question. The nobel peace prize should be given to the one who strived to promote peace all other the world. In this meaning, I don't think that the EU is appropriate for the prize to be given.  Since I had thought that Nobel Prize is to be given to individuals, so this news surprised me, but I think EU deserves that Prize. This is because It is true that there have been no war in Europe for over a half-century, and Nobel Peace Prize have been given to non-individuals several times.  I think the EU should not be awarded the Nobel Prize. EU scale is too large. EU does not bring economic development. Gap in Europe is larger. When the EU was able to redress the economic disparity, I admit their Nobel Prize.  Certainly the European Union is trying to change Europe and the world in a peaceful way, the way to understand this isn't only one, the news showed. EU hasn't achieved the real peace yet because each country doesn't turn them face toward the same direction.  I agree with the award because EU prevent a big war between countries in Europe. However, if one country has economic crisis, a lot of country will be influenced. This is a defect about Eu. As many people know, Greece has had economic crisis and country around Greece were damaged too.  We can imagine but we don't or will never know how the world without EU would go on and what would happen there. So I cannot know what eurosceptics say. They should recognize the value of the presence and contribution toward peace of EU.  I think Nobel peace prize in the wonderful award in the world. Also EU has a right to get this award because they control European countries peacefully. This is not easy thing to do. Still now, many wars are happening around the world and many people died because of wars which make no sense. From this news, I hope people should notice about how wonderful peace is and try to make world better than now.  It is pleasing that EU received Nobel  peace prize. However, EU has a lot of problems which have to be solved immediately. For example, it is financial crisis. Once it occur in any country in EU, it spread all over EU countries. We have to think of the both advantages and disadvantages.  First of all, the Nobel Peace Prize must not be given as a joke. I believe that before giving the prize, many people think carefully and judge that it is suitable for EU. Certainly America and Japan keep the peace, but the case of EU, there are many countries. It is not just the matter between two countries. I think this prize is suitable for EU.  I strongly disagree with ID12017 from ""EU Nobel Peace Prize earns praise and ridicule"" I think it's wrong that EU had received Nobel prize because it's something natural try not to have a war between countries. I think Nobel Peace Prize should be given to individuals who did great effort to not only to prevent the war, but something more.  I disagree with EU Nobel peace this time. It is true that Peace and stability may have visited the economically rich Europeans but religion of immigrants, ethnic minorities and people of the less income are sending languish in various parts of Europe. For example, Europe considers itself the cradle of human rights and democracy, has called for protection of human rights to other countries but if you wear a covering Burka called European Muslims will be fined penalties. Construction of a mosque with a minaret not allowed in countries such as Switzerland. Economic relations are controlled by the European Union is to disadvantage poor countries and developing countries of the world. In other words, economic affluence and stability of 50 years of European is obtained to snatch away the wealth of the people of Asia, Africa and Latin America. It shows the awarded EU's also the reality of the current human society is ignored.  i think the reason of EU got the Nobel Peace prize is not appropriate.  He think it is okay that Nobel Peace Prize is given non-individuals several times. I think so too, but EU is not appropriate ""several times"". EU has many problems, so I can't overlook them.  This comment says this Nobel Peace Prize is Joke. Certainly, he could thought at first it is strange to award EU which has a seriously financial problem now. However, I believe this Nobel Prize has an important mean that they want EU to deal with the terrible situation, expecting the future. I wrote detailed it the box ""Lesson review"". This comment don't understand it. So, I strongly disagree with.  The word 'Peace' have to be thought as pluralistic. In other words, peace can be a real peace to some people, but not to other people. For example, one country could think that they had kept the peace by fighting against to other country. However, citizens, or countries which gave and received damage can think that it's not a peace but just a unhappiness.  I agree in EU awarding a prize of the Nobel Prize. This is because EU continued keeping European peace and prosperity for 60 years. I think that the new war does not happen in Europe, and the peace is keeping. Therefore this news is a very happy thing.  I also think keeping the peace for 60 years is worth receiving the prize, but individual should be respect, i think. so i strongly disagreed with this comment.  I agree with this opinion because Nobel Prize is for the people who distribute the peace of the world, not peace specific area indeed. As I commented before, it is difficult to treat EU distributed peaceful of Europe area. Europe area could stay peaceful in past decades because tendency of world politics going toward decrease of wars, not because effort of EU countries resulted. Also, same as written in this comment, there is a people who criticize EU Nobel Prize as EU point out as a reason why the economic crisis occurred recently accelerated.  As I wrote the comment in this article, I strongly believe that individuals have to be won the Nobel Prize not company or organization.  I can't agree with Europe receiving Nobel Peace Prize. Certainly, 60 years without wars is very important thing. But there are many countries without wars more than 60 years. And regarding economic, Europe has crimes as much as wars. Europe leads world to bad situation. Europe must have responsible about that.  In addition to praise the recipient's activity, the aim of Nobel Prize is to promote the act of recipient . I think this Nobel Peace Prize is thought a little differently from other Nobel Prize. This Prize for EU means that many people wants EU to unite more strongly. EU was founded after reflection of two World War and Cold War. Although more tighter connection was expected, it is hard to say this dream has come true. EU has lots of problems to solute, for example, European economic crisis. Each country has different opinions and some participating nation doubt about EU itself. In this situation, this award is thought to be a message from the world that cheer EU up.  The prize praised, at the same time critics attacked it as a misplaced. I think that this critics reaction was right action. I can't agree with EU Nobel Peace Prize. After all, I didn't understand the meaning and the contents of this prize.  Originally, my opinion to this article is different from his, however, his opinion is so logical and after reading his comment, I became in favor of it.  I strongly disagree with this idea because EU hasn't promoted ""Peace"". This is the most important reason to be given a Nobel Peace Prize and EU hasn't done it. Don't have any reason to be deserved to given a prize I agree with the award of 2012 Nobel Peace Prize to the EU in recognition of 60 years without war. Surely, because of the recent world depression, many people and countries in Europe were suffered from financial problem. Especially, Spain and Greece are the most struggling countries in the world and still suffered from the problem. But, I think that the award gave the EU a new responsibility to create more united, more just and stronger peace. For that, the cooperation of the EU is more and more essential. I hope that the European Union keep unifying for peace forever.  I think that the EU deserves to win the Nobel Prize. It is very difficult to cooperate with other countries about economic, security, diplomacy and the judiciary and try to do that. Surely their aim has not achieved yet. But, I think that the attempt which you never have seen deserve the award.  I think what is related to politics such as EU and the prime minister should not be awarded. In Japan, Prime Minister Eisaku Sato was awarded, but a secret understanding problem became appeared later. I don't think that any politician contribute the world peace without political intention. That's why I give a thought to what is concerned with politics should not be awarded the Nobel Peace Prize.  Because she think about this news same as my opinion. And she suggested ""wide way of thinking"", I think this opinion is very wonderful, and I think that I want to be a person able to have the way of thinking like her.  I disagree with this comment because it focuses on a point alone. To be sure, Greece and EU influenced the world's economic for negative, however, this alone can't explain it's unsuitability for the prise. Those awarded the Nobel  Prizes  have had faults many or few. The same thing can be said to this case. Of course EU has effects that can't be praised , on the contrary, they surely contribute to peace for its members. We should see things inclusively.  I don't agree eurosceptics' opinions. The EU hasn't done anything yet, but I think the prize can put pressure on the EU's future efforts. To overcome today's aspect, the prize was necessary.  I think it is good for EU to receive the Nobel Prize. The Prize makes EU think that they should cooperate with each other stronger. This effect is good for the World Peace.  I disagree with this opinion. I think EU isn't entitled to Nobel Peace Prize and there are no wars in Japan, too. I think there are many people who are more entitled this prize in the world.  This news is very nice. But, I can't understand EU contributes to world peace. Certainly, it is very important there has been no wars in EU for 60 years. Nowadays, there are very few wars of between countries in the world.  Everyone probably thought the same thing but I also think that the EU are worthy of the nobel prize as theres nothing special to it. They should not be any war in the first place.  In my opinion, EU Nobel Peace Prize is valuable to prosper countries and enhance connection between EU nations. Reward is happy to everyone. I hope cloth countries cooperate with each other and raise more able for award. "
JOC JOC-12B-05N 1.28 "I strongly object to the sentence of six Italian seismologists. It's true they failed to predict the large earthquake and some of people acted on the false information that they gave. However, a-six year prison and $17.7 million fine are too excessive. It's impossible for today's scientific technology to forecast natural disaster completely, especially earthquake or eruption. Usually, scientific techniques are testified so many times in order to ensure the safety and improve the accuracy. But large earthquake and eruption rarely occur and that means there a fewer chance to testify the techniques. So it's too severe punishing the scientists just because they failed to predict the earthquake. Furthermore, heavy penalties for false prediction can give bad effect on development of science. If some judges take a similar line, scientists are allowed to speak only collect things. Then scientists become likely to refrain from predicting unknowns for fear of being punished. Also young people avoid entering such area of science and consequently the number of researchers will decrease. So, severe penalties for false prediction can be blow to the growth of branches of science exploring unknowns. I hope the seismologists will turn out to be innocent and the scientific freedom will be ensured.  I think that the sentencing of six Italian seismologists should not be permitted. There are two reasons. First, scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. The evidence of it is ""freedom of expression"". All the people must have ""human rights"" that we have gained and possessed historically. Second, science has a possibility of developing our life. If some scientists who make a mistake by chance are punished, it must weaken their strong desires to study. That means our life quality will go down. So I think people who receive the the result of scientific research should be more carefully.  It is improper that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Earthquakes are natural phenomenon, so it is difficult to predict it. The other seismologists fare that predicting earthquakes. We should protect ourselves without the other people's help. Anyway, when a earthquake occurs, we must act quickly.  According to this article, six seismologists were sentenced six years in jail and ordered to pay more than nine million euros ($11.7 million). This is too strict for them I think. Science are changing and developing every each day. All scientists have rights to study and research new technology and this is scientific freedom. Not only the case of science but also other subjects, this right of freedom is existed. Italia should rethinks about this problem and also possibility of scientific field.  This news shocked me very much. The prediction of an earthquake, when to happen and how strong it will be, is not absolute. Therefore the scientists should not be blame for it. As Michael Halpern emphasizes, scientists need to, or have to announce what they know without feeling fear of being charged if their knowledge is not right. I think, in general when a disaster happens, people are apt to make it clear who is responsible for it, and accuse them of it. As a case in point, in Japan, when 3.11 earthquakes occurred, the public and media criticized Tokyo-Electric Power Company and governments, as if they had caused all the disaster including the earthquake.  I think that it is not good to pronounce scientists to prison sentences. Because it is natural for them to explore unknowns. If they are targeted by the verdict, they will search for many things which we do not know. I regard this situations as depriving the right to speak freely and independently. Provided this conditions are going to continue, I think that big epoch-making results will appear for a long time, so this time's ridiculous judgment should reconsider at once.  I think six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. Because it considers a man-made disaster. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information.  I think these scientists should be discharged. No matter how better the technology improve, human beings can't manipulate nature. Therefore, though scientists expect disasters, it is nonsense that the government put the blame on them. Not only that, this will cause depressions of science. I hope that the judgment will be overturned and they will keep on their studies.  I was very surprised at this news. It is impossible for humans to predict a earthquake correctly. So six scientists have no responsible. Such a thing won't cause good correspond. Italian should face this thing seriously. .  It is ridiculous to sentence scientists due to a misprediction of natural phenomena. They have a responsibility to evacuate people from a danger area even when they predict little chances of danger. Scientists will blamed by people even if they do not evacuate people since people will be disappointed with scientist's decision. This collision makes scientists to be in a dilemma. However, citizen's security is the most important thing to be protected. Therefore, scientists could not be blamed.  I strongly believe that to sentence the seismologists in jail and to fine them are too heavy punishment. It is true that the seismologists are to be blamed for their statements because they are the one of the only ones who can scientifically analyze or make a caution about the earthquake ( People are less likely to have knowledge about future earthquake). However, sentencing them in jail and fining them cannot be justified in terms of the right of freedom of expression. Everyone has the right to speak freely in public ( I don't include hate speech in this case) and without the right to speak freely and independently, the both sides, scientists and moderate people or people in public, would turn into chaos. In scientists case, for example, any new innovation such as more precise prediction of earthquake or weather forecasting or research into new drugs etc will be pushed off, which means that we cannot make any invention. In public case, for example, without having opportunity to gain new information about natural disaster, even it is difficult to predict or not, people will lack in information, and in extreme case, democracy which is assuring the freedom of expression will be infringed and will collapse. So considering from these arguments, I strongly oppose to the court.  Probably, Italy is going to secure the academic freedom. Most of countries, especially developed countries, secure academic freedom. Academic freedom is that any scholars, specialists can express and publish their research freely. Of course, there is asymmetry of information for science between scientist and ordinary people. But just because they have a lot of scientific knowledge it doesn't follow that they are prosecuted even if they publish the wrong opinion. They have great influence on their society. But their opinions are ""one opinion"". They also have a mistake. This is because they are not omniscient and omnipotent. As long as Italy protects academic freedom, scholars and specialists don't have to be sentenced. Secondly, the seismologists were sentenced by published that the earthquake does not happen. However, the announcement was published as the government's view. Why do the only seismologists have to take liability of the announcement? If they were prosecuted by the announcement, the government also should take responsibility of publishing the wrong opinion. The government just replaced the miss with the seismologists. So the government should apologize to the citizen for this case.  In my perspective, I disagree that scientists who misjudge the risk of an earthquake will be sentenced. It is because if scientists do not have the right to speak what they research freely and independently, they cannot share what they examine in addition to becoming meaningless of the research. Then that will prevent and decrease the progress of science. Besides, no one can predict when an earthquake would happen in the future, as the article said. In short, the scientists may be not guilty. In addition, Italy should concern how to recover the damage and treat the victims rather than the punishment of the scientists. It is because the most important thing for a democracy country is the nation. Besides, the scientists are probably innocent. However, Italy said that the scientists should be sentenced. I wonder what is ""little risk of damage"" that is in this news though. Obviously, this quake is very big; not little risk of damage. But if 50 people died of a quake, is that a big risk or little risk? And who decides whether a quake is little risk or not? The borderline between little or not is pretty vague; different people. So, scientists should not be sentenced.  It is impossible for me to understand the Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in jail for underestimating the risk of a 2009 earthquake. It is natural that scientist's expectation often prove wrong. I think that is Science.  Like other people said, I also disagree with 6 year sentence and $11.7 million fine to Italian scientist and government official. Our technology is not developed enough to completely predict what would happen in future, especially if that is environmental disaster. The government should always be ready for such disaster, and it's not right to sentence these six people. I wonder if these scientists predict there will be big disaster in near future, could government be prepared for that. For example, in Japan, scientist warned that there will be big earthquake. However, Japanese government didn't prepare for such disaster and caused lot of problem after 3.11.  It will not be possible that science can predict perfectly every natural disaster. It's just some opinions what scientists say, and it's depend on each person what they believe. I had thought like that. However, through the conversation in the last class, I came to think that we have no choice but to believe what the professionals say if we have no idea about specialist things. And professionals must know that we need their knowledge. Although the punishment of this time may be too hard for them, they have to have responsibility about their statements.  I think that it is impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs, even the seismologists because earthquake is a natural disaster. If people can predict when the natural disaster happens, a great number of people would survive when the huge earthquake happened on 11th of March 2011. It is impossible for them to estimate, so I think it is ridiculous that the seismologists were sentenced to six years in jail. I want them to be released from jail.  I do not agree with the verdict that Italian court did. It was a fact that the prediction scientists showed caused great damage. However scientists are very week against the power. The freedom of description is must been protected strictly. So I disagree against the punishment for scientists.  It is the world-shaking event I think. We can't understand technical matters, so we should believe the statement of specialist stuff. But after the matter like this, we don't know to do for our safety and will do wrong treatment. I think specialist stuff should have responsibility about their statement and their technical fields. And investigations should keep the peace and safety of the people.  I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens. I am consent at this opinion. Nobody understands a natural disaster. I think that an earthquake cannot be predicted similarly. It should be thrown into prison although there is some responsibility.  I was very surprised to hear this news story. Of course, the scientists were scapegoats to take the responsibility. If they were sent to jail for some years, Japanese scientists should be imprisoned for over ten years or forever. No one can predict when the earthquake happens.  I can't support this verdict. I think that this six Italian scientists must be found innocent and acquitted. They only announced their own research and earthquake reduction. They haven't done anything wrong.  I think it is not adequate that six Italian seismologists have been punished. Because it is difficult to predict earthquake damage. But I want seismologists to make an effort to analyze earthquake damage.  To predict the change of nature , such as earthquake is extremely difficult. So it is not apt to blame scientists. Earthquake is difficult to predict, so we should beware and prepare for it. Furthermore , we could say that it is important to do an accurate judgment which was not done at the 3.11.  I think the punishments are too harsh. It is impossible to expect a natural phenomenon perfectly, and it is the seismologist itself that is primarily disappointed rather than ours. Probably those who believe the scholar's idea in the back also decrease in number, I consider that it means they receive punishment enough.  Firstly, it's obvious that scientists are never prophets. If scientists were punished when they couldn't predict perfectly what happens in the future, who on earth want to be a scientist. Then, I'd like to see whether there were irrational purpose of Italian government, or, in fact, they hadn't prepared much for a big disaster so they turned their responsibility to those scientists. It's just possible that lots of people may hit upon this idea. If so, Italian government may lose their trust. I strongly think that governments should always be neutral and have some degree of cleanness for their nation.  I agree with ID12055 and ID12063's opinion. Nobody foresee the future perfectly. Needless to say, all researchers are human. Also human cannot avoid making mistakes. This judgment will restrain Italian researchers from research fully and the research of Italy will fall behind. This judgment should be reconsidered as soon as possible. However, researchers need to realize their responsibility. The general public tends to rely on them at the time of emergency. For safety of nation, they must not act irresponsibly.  i was very surprised when i read this news.  And i still cannot believe why did they have to go to jail and need to pay nine million euro. As it said on this news, i think it is scientist's job to tell what they know to other people who do not know.  I don't think the Italian six scientists have to be punished. Scientists always explore and foresee many things what may happen. It is natural works for scientists, I think. Also in Japan, after the 3.11, I have heard many forecasts about earthquakes. I think the scientists' forecasts make people prepare for the worst, and the preparations make people be safe.  There is no need of a scientist if people know whats going to happen in the future. Scientists job is to guess what could happen and they are not a prophet. This punishment is too strict and it is a shame for the scientists.  It is totally ridiculous that the six scientists were punished for underestimating the risk of an earthquake. No one can ever predict what happens especially when it is a natural disaster. If those six could estimate exactly how strong an earthquake is or what time, no one would have died in an earthquake. I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict.  I think this punishment was too strictly. If they kept doing this kind of thing, there wouldn't be any scientist or scholar who would try to alarm the earthquakes to us. As long as we live in the country where earthquake happens we should be prepared and the help of scientists would help us a lot.  I think this punishment is not illegal because the scientists tried to estimated and alarmed. They have no crimes. when earthquake occurred, we must prepare, be careful and protect ourselves.  I think that this judgment is amusing. Because, it is since a natural disaster is not what people can predict. Not a scientist but a public policy thinks that it is bad.  I think this punishment is wrong. We can not predict when perfectly natural phenomena such as earthquakes and typhoons will happen even if the technology developed . The scientist's punishment is illegal and it is not their responsibility. The punishment is too strict and should be reconsidered.  I strongly agree with the part that ""I do understand that the people who lost their families in the incident can't help blaming the scientists, but the judgment of Italy is too strict. "" Judgment should consider victims' feelings, but scientists were not the criminals in this incident, I think. It can't be acceptable if trial thought they are the criminals so that they should be punished. Some may say that whether intentionally or not, they are criminals if they commit crimes. But I believe that people should also have had to consider that the scientist might make mistake. In that sense, I understand the victims' feeling, but it's foolish that only scientist should be blamed.  I disagree to the sentencing of six Italian seismologists because I think that the judge may bother publication of scientist. If their announces was wrong, they would be sentenced. It give scientists a lot of risk. So, they may not refrain from their new discovery or research. I think it will have a bad influence on the freedom of science study, advance in our life and human happiness.  It is unbelievable news. Where a natural disaster is concerned, we cannot estimate completely what will occur. Surely no one should speak about matters of great importance hastily and thoughtlessly. But scientists need to be able to keep researching and share what they know. If they lose the right, the scientific development will stop. So I think they should not have been punished for their right to research and our future.  I feel it's very regrettable of the decision. It may give ""chilling effects"" to other scientists. People should realize that there is a limit even to science, and should judge all the research results by their own risk.  After this judgment, many people point out freedom of expression has been damaged. Surely, this situation could be a problem of freedom of expression, which is the right that everyone should be able to say what they want, without fear of persecution. But I think pointing out focusing on only freedom of expression in this situation is out of focus. I think this situation is more of a problem of objectivity in science rather than freedom of expression. Because modern science is getting more complicated and unpredictable, the question if science is value-neutral  or not has become a central point of controversy. I think science is value-neutral . Also, the point of this situation is that the Italian scientists got convicted because of communication, not science. If the scientists explained the results more minutely, people would have been able to understand the situation and prepare for the danger to the best of their ability. But the only thing the scientists said when they explained their results was that everything was 'safe'. This is the reason why people are angry. They did not explain the risks and possibilities in detail even though they knew there is no such thing as being 100 percent sure of results as a scientist. Resultingly, they did not perform their duties as scientists. Taking this incident as an example, society should change the method in which scientific decisions are communicated. As I mentioned above, science is value-neutral . Therefore, there should be lot of verification and discussion when applying scientific results which can make a huge practical influence on society. Also, civil society should verify if scientists announced the results truthfully and correctly without any political pressure. Professor Sheila Jasanoff from Harvard University who researched about scientists in law and politics said it is reasonable to investigate scientists' original results after they have been interpreted by people. For example, in 1989 scientists announced that BSE will never infect humans; therefore, many people believed their results and ate the infected beef. However, because many people died of BSE in 1990, people in England investigated the results that were announced in the same year. As a result, civil society and government of England revealed the scientists were wrong and republished the report in 2000.  Generally people knows predictions on earthquake is impossible. Therefore, thr\ere must be few people trusted the prediction, be little damage for society. In addition, I think these scientists didn't have ill will. There is no reason to consider them as guilty.  I agree to Michael Halpern's term, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" Because, we can know various problems and solutions by the action of scientists.  Michael Halpern said, ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know - without the fear of being criminally responsible should their predictions not come true. "" I think this is true, and this is the ideal type of the scientists. They should be brave enough to tell their predictions to save people. However this is only an ideal and it's clear that not everybody can be like this. . . . . or maybe no one can be. Who would like to take a risk to say wrong things in public? To solve this problem, I recommend to make a environment that one can easily say their thoughts aloud.  I strongly oppose to the sentence. It is natural that companies which neglect to confirm security of their products are punished for the accidents which caused by their product, but earthquake is natural disaster, so there's no one who responsible for it. Seismologists should be appreciated when they predicted earthquakes, but they should not be punished or blamed when they couldn't predict earthquakes.  I think these researchers very poor. It is difficult to predict natural phenomena. I think this decision is wrong.  I was shocked to hear the news. Science doesn't have absolute perfection. No one doesn't fail. Scientists shouldn't be criticized and we shouldn't depend on only science.  Six scientists are innocent because nobody knows the power of nature. If officials make an error about measures of natural accident and some people killed in the accident, the officials may be guilty. In Japan, we had a hot discussion about this problem 3.11. I think a nuclear plant accident on 3.11 is a man-made disaster because the government could not show off a correct information.  I think this punishment is surprising and I don't agree on it. It's impossible to predict when the earthquake occurs precisely. If that decision were correct, reporters of the weather forecast must quit there jobs.  When I read the news, I was really surprised and shocked. It was sad to hear that lots of people were died 'cause of the earthquake, believing the words of the scientists that the place was free from the fear of the earthquake. But, think again. Can u believe the words of them 100 percent? Let us recall the casualty which happened in Japan on 11th Mar. 2011. Most of us believed that the nuclear plant was safe even if the earthquake happened. But actually. . . it was not. So, even the scientists or experts cannot completely expect what's gonna happen. I do not wanna say that we should not believe in them 'cause of such thing. I just feel we cannot say their words are not 100 percent correct. However, it is obvious that we are relying on science nowadays. If we restrict the freedom of the speech of the scientists, we cannot make use of them. So such thing should not be happened although they cannot predict all the thing.  I could not believe this news when I first watched it on TV. This decision is as incoherence as ""fen shu keng ru""(this means ""burning books on the Chinese classics and burying Confucian scholars alive""), which the first emperor of China did. I didn't think such a crazy sentence was passed in the present, scientific time.  I agree with the comment. Michael Halpern of the US -based Union of Concerned Scientists said that ""Scientists need to be able to share what they know - and admit what they do not know-without the fear of being held criminally responsible should their predictions not hold up"" in this article. I think too. Scientific freedom is the most important of this problem. I think scientists have a right to research freely.  It is impossible to predict when and where earthquake occur perfectly. We know that after the big earthquake hit Tohoku and Kanto area in Japan in 3.11. Therefore, it is strange to press all responsibility against scientists who could not predict the earthquake completely.  We have no means of predicting natural phenomena completely. If people were able to make an accurate of natural phenomena, we would not be sustained any damage caused by catastrophes. The Italian scientists should have admitted their underestimating and offered a comment on it modestly. After all, no matter how detailed they know about nature, there are no methods to predict disasters. If scientists are afraid of being censured about wrong predictions, the number of seismologists may be on the decline.  I don't think the scientists don't have responsibility at all. It was the matter about our lives so I don't want them to say such thing without responsibility. They should say with ""may"" and explain their study hasn't finish, because we are ignorant enough to believe the saying of officials.  Almost the same to mine. And I do think we should protect ourselves on our own.  I think the verdict is unreasonable because it is next to impossible to predict when an earthquake would take place. So we cannot blame scientists, but we can hope them to predict more correctly.  I think we should think and act by ourselves. In this society, we cannot completely rely on someone or something.  I guess predicting earthquake is very difficult because it is natural disaster. Even if the technology developed conveniently, i think we never know about natural disaster. it is ridiculous sentencing seismologists for underestimating the risk of the earthquake.  I think no one can predict when the earthquake happens therefore, the scientist don't need to take the responsibility.  I think that the scientists are completely innocence, too. A court in Italy should withdraw this decision.  Freedom of science must be assured by governments. But this is thing that we must criticize. And the science of earthquake and other disaster may save a lot of lives. When I read this news, I remind the day of 311. I think tremendous numbers of people could save their lives. Government must restrict the freedom of science, This news is out of problem. And I hope such thing must not happen in the future.  When I knew this news, I thought that I was very sorry for scientists. It is impossible to completely predict the natural phenomenon. Therefore I think that it is mean to file a suit against it even if a prediction came off. It is responsible to the people who completely believed the prediction. Such a thing never wants you to get up.  I agree with this comment because I think freedom for the scientists to say their research should be protected from another power. You could not deny that that sentence become the precedent for disturbing the freedom.  I strongly agree with ID12063's comment. It is difficult to predict when the natural disaster will occur, even the scientists. I think I would believe what the scientists say because I do not have the perfect knowledge about the earthquake. I understand that sometimes the natural disaster do not occur even though they said it will occur. However I do not think that they should be put in jail.  I can't believe the decision oh the court. scientists didn't commit a crime. Now, the technique of science is developing. But scientists are not god. So it is impossible that at any time, to predict when and where the earthquake happens, how much damages the earthquake causes. Because earthquakes are natural disaster and acts of God. So I think scientists were not responsible.  This article is about predict of earthquake so our Japanese inevitably remember the 3.11 earthquake. Recently, some scientists presented the predict of the quake in Nankai Trough. If the real earthquake is more severe than the prediction of scientists , can we condemn them? The scientists have duties to investigate the tragedy and alarm the people. This responsible is hard and should be carefully taken by them. But they are obliged to make the predict excessive if they are criticized by the failure of underestimating. If so, they can't publish what they think. Academic progress can be done by many failures. In seismology, this theory is applied, too.  I completely agree with her. I also think we should not stop their researching and development of scientific technique. And so their human rights should be protected. Certainly, sometimes even they make mistakes. But I think there is a lot of truth in what they say. They are superior to other people in a field of science. So we cannot but trust them when an emergency arise.  This article made sad. And, I can't understand why the six Italian scientists and a government official were sentenced to six years in and ordered to pay more than nine million euros in damages. They arrive at an prediction by using daily observation and research. They have been trying hard. I think it is cruel that we let them all responsibility.  I disagree with the judgment and feel pity for the seismologists. So that a natural disaster is called an ""act of God"", it is very hard for human to predict an earthquake correctly. We can make an effort not to suffer as slight damage from a disaster as possible. However, once it happened, there is nothing you can do for it. You cannot stop it. Therefore, I think that the seismologists do not have to be responsible for the earthquake.  Many people say that these punishment is too hard and I think so, too. The failures scientists made is not good thing but it is unreasonable to put them into jails. The act which scientists have to do is trying to make more correct predict for the next earthquake.  This is very surprising news for me. It is impossible for any excellent scientists to predict an earthquake perfectly. Scientists don't have to be jailed because they have the right to speak freely and independently.  Being able to predict an earthquake should only be a reference so I find it harsh that the semiologist were blamed for not predicting an earthquake correctly. As it says in the article, this will lead to restricting scientists from expressing freely.  As I commented on the blog, Scientists should be given the freedom for developing the field.  It was shocking that scientists became guilty because of filing prediction of earthquake. Human cannot control nature, and it is not their responsible. I think it is right to against to the verdict.

JOC JOC-13B-06N 0.43 "What Taro Yamaoto did is said to break taboo and I think so, too. I think the position of emperor is quite neutrality. They are neither ordinary people nor politicians. I learned emperor is a symbol of Japan. However, Emperor Akihito may have known the current situation even if not said by Yamamoto. Because he seems always to concern people in Tohoku. Mr. Yamamoto should not have done such thing or he needed not do such thing.  I agree with this article. We think about the risk of another tsunami or typhoon. Otherwise Japan will be dead nation.  I think that Taro Yamamoto should resign from the Diet, too. Political utilization of emperor is a prohibited action. This is the rule. I don't understand why he cannot the letter to the emperor, but I understand ""the lawmaker"" should keep the rule.  I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand the feeling that he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. However, what he did was overly rash. Many people should felt he did not has good sense and didn't know his place on account of his poor deed. If he is a honest Diet member, it is natural that he knows well the way of the Emperor for the Japanese citizen. What he did can not only shake a neutral viewpoint of the Emperor, but also put forward doubts about character of Japanese politicians. He should consider a little more before act and, aware of the influence of his action as the Diet member. I think such a case does not happen any more.  Environmental pollution problems caused by nuclear weapons and war is serious in the world. Japanese released radioactivity, which is 300 times the atomic bomb, into the atmosphere and ocean. Japanese have to recognize the importance of this issue.  I agree with your opinion. I think that Taro Yamamoto should consider the risk which political utilization of emperor. Because Japan separate politics and an emperor by reflect on the war.  I think that Japanese government should abolish all nuclear plants. However, they should not be abolished immediately because of influence of our life. Therefore the government must take the surest safety measures until all nuclear plants are abolished.  Taro Yamamoto should have acted more discreetly because it would have involved the emperor in politics. However, I kind of understand what he wanted to do because he might tried to change the situation. Honestly, I also have little hope for the Japanese Government because it's been a long time since Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster happened but it hasn't seem to have end of the trouble. After I read the article mentioned above, my thought had a little change because it said that the US and Japan would play a role in the cleanup operation. This news gave me more hope. I expect the operation will work well.  I think that the action of the emperor Akihito was really great. Because, he handed a letter to a chamberlain immediately and left no comment. I think emperor Akihito understand the role of an emperor in Japan. If the emperor expresses an specific political attitude, it violates the constitutions of Japan. And critics should accuse of him in public, not in the Internet. I also think Taro Yamamoto should have find other ways to express his opinion.  I think that essentially cause of this disaster is existence of nuclear plant. A lot of people had wanted abolishment of nuclear plant, but the government did not abolish it. Then this disaster occurred, so I think this disaster could be protect in advance. From the above I wrote, I think nuclear plant should be abolished earlier.  I agree with this article. I really think that nuclear energy is not good for the earth. Originally, there is no nuclear energy. But in fact, there is a lot of nuclear energy in Japan. So I think that we should treat this carefully and decrease this little by little. But I also think this plan is low productive because it doesn't solve this serious problem.  I agree with this article. I understand the nuclear energy is not good for the our health or the earth. But in this 21s century, a lot of nuclear power are used. I think that it is necessary for us to be carefully when we use this power.  I really wish that this problem will be solved as soon as possible, and want the government not to cause the same thing again though it's useless to complain about what had already happened. Now The US help us Japan solve it, it'll great if we help one another in the world and have actual good relationship with them in the future. So after Japan's solving the problem, our role will come. There are countless people in need all around the world. On the other hand, I think it's the very time to put all the Japanese potential together! I hope that Japan will become one regardless of who are scientists, politicians or diplomats to solve it.  We notice that there is always a catch in a good deal in this accident. We have believed safety myth of nuclear power. However, we must be careful with the fault of this power. Japan has big energy problem, so we should consider the future of energy immediately.  A disaster can easily cause next disaster. We know the danger of the earthquake. Moreover that earthquake caused a much disaster. We Japanese feared that disaster. We never want to occur the same But his action is wrong and lacks common sense. In democracy we should do political action by right way.  I agree with your opinion. Japanese government abolish all nuclear plants is very difficult as long as I think. I think they should abolish nuclear plants in stages. So, we should continue to think about whole concept of nuclear plants, too.  Recently many people say ""Japanese government have to remove nuclear power plant. "" Certainly, it is true, but I think maybe they are little bit irresponsibility. Because, when government built power plant, people want to make it, and Fukushima people had to move another place, since then, we used huge electricity, but after accident, people say ""we don't need nuclear power plant!"" I think it is too selfish. I think we don't have just to take objection to nuclear power plant, we have to think about how we support Fukushima people.  I agree. I think Japanese government have to abolish. But first of all government have to help Fukushima people.  I insist that breaking taboo itself is a bad thing. I don't think people suffering evacuation life want Mr. Yamamoto to complain about their plight by such a childish way. He should have persuade other members of the Diet and strive to pass a bill that helps victims as a member of the House of Councilors. However, thinking his difficult situation, this standard way could never have succeeded. It is because he doesn't belong to any party, and LDP, the ruling party, has so strong power that they never listen to the opinions of the minority parties or members. I guess that Mr. Yamamoto realized how small his power to change policies was, and handed a letter thoughtlessly. I hope he will keep making steady efforts to abolish nuclear power plants.  I agree with this article. In Japan, the disaster often happens, for example, earthquake in Tokyo. We don't know the time when next big disaster will happen. We people in Japan must really consider the risk of second disaster. The best way is to remove nuclear plant without dangerous accidents. However, this problem is so difficult to solve that people in world have to consider new solution.  I don't think this news is such a big problem. Nothing would happen due to Yamamoto's action because we all know Japanese emperor is unable to speak out anything to politics. It is ordained clearly in Japan Constitution. So why do people make a bother about this? I cannot understand. Naturally it is a fact that Yamamoto did a not admirable action but that had almost no impact on actual politics.  I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.  I think Taro Yamamoto was so ignorance and the emperor Akihito's action symbolize the role of emperor in this country. Taro Yamamoto could find other ways to express his opinion, so I can't understand his action at all.  I agree with you. Taro Yamamoto lacks a sense of responsibility as a member of the Diet, a lawmaker.  I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world.  I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world. We should pay attention to the handling.  I think Japanese government should remove away all nuclear plant in Japan. This is because if a huge earthquake or Tsunami like 3.11 came again, Japan are not be able to revival again. I know there are a lot of reasons to government cannot remove away, but Japan should think more seriously about nations.  I wonder when the situation in Fukushima will be recovered. There are too many problems there. Not only the direct damage of the earthquake and tsunami but also the accident of the nuclear power plants, and the problem of cleaning the radioactive materials are really serious. The actor of the operation , TEPCO has problems in itself too. Hiding the information, its optimistic but not practical point of view, the speed of the action is too dull, and so on. As long as the actor remains dull and fool the situation won't be improved.  I disagree with you because nuclear plant is necessary for our country. Indeed it's very dangerous when disaster happens, but it also supports Japan's economy strongly. So in my opinion, Japan should stop old and dangerous ones and make more durable plants as soon as possible.  I was angry with TEPCO when I read The article. Of course I don't expect TEPCO and its employees, so I'm OK if they get too much salary. But I want them to realize they can rob a lot of life and our health. So, I never want them such a trouble again.  It's not ""agree"". I wanted to write ""angry"".  After I read this article, I thought Taro Yamamoto should have acted more carefully as a law maker. I can understand the feeling that he wanted to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. But he should not have done that.  This action greatly affect the future of Japan. So , the best attention should be paid to complete this goal.  I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.  This is very glad news for people all over the world. Fukushima nuclear plants have many risks now. For example, typhoon, rain, tsunami, other earthquake and so on. We need many measures for safeness. We must not consider about money. I think that safeness is most important.  My cousins lived in Fukushima at that time happened 2011 earthquake and tsunami. their house is located very near the nuclear power plants so they were forced to leave their house. And they cann't come back here. They think we can never come back and live in our house. I don't want to happen such as tragedy forever. So this news is very happy for me.  I agree with your opinion. I think many people say their thoughts, making the thing which happens now and then basis of their idea. I really think it is too selfish. We should think more about the support for Fukushima people.  when Fukushima earthquake happened, a lot of radiation flowed in the sea, and it continue leaking even now. However, 3 years passed, people forget about nuclear plants. We should more consider about our country's environment.  I agree with this comment because I also think the emperor is quite neutral. Even though I could understand Yamamoto's thought, it was a thoughtless act. According to the media, we can know how the emperor is considerate of Tohoku people. Moreover, there is the rule that the emperor shouldn't be involved in the government. If he break the rule, it will caused a lot of criticism from the world. So, I thought the action of the emperor Akihito was really great.  I disagree with you because we depended on nuclear before the accident in Fukushima.  I disagree with your opinion. Emperor Akihito is top of Japan so we must have the respect due to his superiors. However, Yamamoto's action is a breach of etiquette. Therefore, it is natural that Mr. Yamamoto is blamed.  Mr. Yamamoto broke the taboo. It is worst, I think. And I had suspect about him. But some people forgot Fukushima's things. So we should remember about them. I think so.  I agree with you. the location around Fukushima Daiichi is far from the place we live, but it's problem in Japan. And it influence Japan badly. So the government have to do their best to solve it.  Mr. Yamamoto's action is not proper as a member of assembly. In Japan, emperor should not have a contact with lawmaker, because it is decided by constitution.  I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear plant. he is a Diet member, he should consider about what other Diet member critic him and make him disadvantage. In my case , I follow the twitter of him. I support him in anti nuclear power, but I can't support his thoughtless behavior.  I don't think so. Taro Yamamoto says good thing. Of course all action of his isn't good, but he does almost good actions. I think only Tepco is bad.  We Japanese can never ignore the problems about nuclear plants. This is really challenging and risky, but no one but us can, and must solve the problem. Leaving them as they are is no longer a solution. I will support the idea to run the risk to make a change.  This is the very difficult problem. For sure Nuclear plants is too much dangerous. We can't say disaster like this time's case never happen. But IN this 21th century, nuclear power is vital.  The tsunami which attacked us brought us the misfortune. Although I was in Ibaraki at that time, I thought the end of the world. We were not able to return to Tokyo during three days. Tsunami came also to Ibaraki. Electricity, water service, and gas stopped, and we suffered troubles very much. And there was a radioactivity problem. I do not want to see that panic. I want a country to direct power towards this problem.  What Mr. Yamamoto did is inappropriate as a member of assembly. I think he broke the taboo because he wanted to change the situation, but I think he should know better than to do such action.  Taro Yamamoto's action might make him hero, but all conditions, like time, place, occasion made him a villain. First, the contents written to the letter is not worth to handing to the Emperor. In short, FEARS about nuclear is weak. Shozo Tanaka handed the letter to the then Emperor about how the people ""actually"" suffering the pollution. I think Taro Yamamoto is nothing but the fool man.  I disagree with you. Because we have no chance to say many opinion. The action was an expression about complain to the statesman. So I think the action is one of an expression . "
JOC JOC-13B-10N 0.79 "I'm impressed to read this news article. How surprising a person who had been in prison for as many as 27 years changed the country! Now I believe that important thing is not to give up anytime if something terrible happen, and not to look at the past but the present for the future to find what we really should do. Even if we stumble and lose our hearts, Nelson will encourage us not to give up by memory of his great achievement.  I admire Nelson Mandela's courage against authoritarian government. Thanks to him, the political system of South Africa changed. I think democracy is necessary to get rid of discrimination. So, now I want many african young people to try to bring democracy and freedom to the non democratic country. I know it is very difficult, but I think it is the people that changes the political system of a country and found a nation where there is no discrimination. Also other democratic nations should help achieve this. For example Japan can use its ODA to teach the way to change the administration systems or help countries do development of laws.  I didn't know Nelson Mandela well, so I read other article about him and I knew that he lived to be 95 years of age. I think it's enough. His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  I was surprised to hear that. ""When Mandela was finally released 27 years later, his biggest concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together. ""This is very positive thinking. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission (TRC). He is great.  Honestly, I didn't know Nelson Mandela and understand the greatness of him. However, I feel the importance of the will. In spite of the imprisonment for 27 years, his will didn't change. Therefore, his will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system. He taught us the greatness of indomitability.  I think Mandela can be said to be the person had South America been reborn. We will never let race discrimination like apartheid again. And we should strive for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. This word was introduced by Mandela. Recently, the news that a sign language interpreter had used inappropriate sign language at the Mandela's memorial service is focus much on, but we don't forget mourning for the late Mandela.  Many people might mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. I was also one of the such people because I had respected him for his brave action. During the time of discrimination, he had never given up opposing to it in spite of severe situation. Moreover, after he released, his biggest concern was making sure that the country remained together instead of revenge for his mistreatment, and he held public hearings, TRC. When I learned about this, I even more admired him for his indomitable spirit and tolerance.  I was very shocked because I respected him very much. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength. However, South Africa is one of the most differential countries in the world even though Mandela governed this country. I worry about the future of the country.  I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However, I also heard this news and became somewhat sad. A movie called Invictas became the cause for me to get to know Mandela. I would also like to become a great human being who can hand down a name to future generations like him.  I was so sad to hear this news. I learned about his achievement in the world history. He fought for racial equality in Republican Of South Africa. Now, in Republican Of South Africa, black and white are living together. His achievement is so great.  I was very surprised to read this article. He was a brave man. He protested against racial discrimination and make The South Africa equal country. Maybe he had many difficulties, however he overcome all of these. We lost great person.  i'm so sorry to hear this news. I do not know this achievement in detail. But everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. There is still this kind of discrimination now. So it is the time to remember his achievements.  I totally agree with you. We should respect him and eliminate racial discrimination.  I was shocked. The world lost shine. I think he was the greatest person ever. And I think he was loved many people especially reporter, because every article tell us only his greatness. There're no abuse in the article. Mandela R. I. P.  I told him thanks. He is a just and tolerant symbol in the world. He had appealed black persons' rights! And they could get rights. If I were him, I must seek revenge on white persons for something until now. But he didn't it. He had not had prejudice. So we should know his policy more. And I want to be a tolerant person as he. I pray that his soul may rest in peace.  I think him to be the one of the great man. Usually, even if we had a purpose like him, it is rare that we act as he did , and I think that there are some situations that can not improve, if there is not a person like him. I think he left big hope and achievement.  I do not know Mandela at all, but I know that he was a great man for the world. If I have a chance to know him, I learn about acts that he did.  I agree with your idea. The great thing of Mandela is that he had not had prejudice about white person. We should be a tolerant as he. I felt tempted to tell him thanks, too.  I think Mandela left a big achievement. As a South Africa's first black president, his action had great meaning. At the same time, other countries watch his movement carefully, so he took heavy responsibility. I think he had influence on all over the world, because he acted positively even after having been sent to prison. He became a good model for other countries where there are many black people.  I was very shocked to hear the news and mourned over his death. Many people must have been moved by his activities that trying to help those who had been horribly discriminated against. I believe that he contributed to make South African and African people be proud of themselves and gave them power to protest against apartheid policies. Now the great leader has gone. We must take over his will, and strive to get rid of segregation until all the people on the earth can live peacefully.  I agree with you. I learned that what truly makes people happy isn't revenge but pure spirit and effort for people or country from Mandela and Gandhi.  I know his name and achievement by studying world history , but I don't know what he exactly did. After reading this news , I researched his achievement and this effect deeply. I think Nelson Mandela is the best politician of all the times.  I think so. Mandela was the best person. As you said, South Africa has the gap between poor and rich. I think the current government have to face and deal that problem. If they ignore the issue, Mandela will be sad.  I thinks that South Africa lost the great person. He still has a big influence on the world. He was behind bars for 27 years, however he did not give it up. It point is that we should respect most. People like him what was to live a long life. I'm afraid it.  I was so surprised to read this article because I respected him. When I watched a legal drama, the hero said that the real devil is huge consensus. White used to control the world. So nobody can act for the solution of race discrimination, but he fought against race discrimination. Race discrimination is tempered as a result.  I felt so sad because I really respect him. I think that he is one of the greatest people in the world. He has achieved great things, for example, TRC. He is a person who has a strong sense of justice and he fought with ruling party in the cause of justice. Justice which depends on circumstances is not a justice, in my opinion. In that point, he could really take action for the justice. I admired him for his spirit and tolerance.  I think he was a one of the greatest men in the world. His name is known widely in the world. We lost great man. I'm so sad. We try to do anything like him. His death gave me motivation. I mourn the death of him.  I did not know him very well. I heard his name in the class of social study. So when I heard this news, I do not think more things. But, now I think his death is a big loss for the world because there is not any person who change bad system like apartheid. We have to follow his example and make better world.  I do not know him very well but I also want to admire him for his spirit and tolerance. I want to be a person who can fight with ruling party but it is very difficult because it means I also have to make a effort like him. And I need talent for it.  I pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was courageous to act in order to realize the world where anybody is equal. He challenged to eliminate racial discriminations. His activity was great and had a significant impact on the current peace. R. I. P.  I agree with ID13050. I did not know his achievements in detail. However, everyone knows that he is great and he did a lot to solve racial discrimination problem. We have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.  Nelson Mandela was a great person. We all have to mourn for him. To abolish racial discrimination takes an incredibly hard work and long time so most of us cannot believe or would not take some action by oneself to realize it though we all want the world without discrimination. I admire him for his resolution that he was willing to be arrested or in custody to achieve the big dream.  Nelson Mandera is honorable person. Almost all of us hope the discrimination would disappear, but we can't take some action to solve any problem. To a grater or less degree we also all have prejudice. So we can't claim that discrimination is bad in public in big voice , which Nelson Mandera did.  First of all, I mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. As a person in 21th century, we should strive more for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. He may live forever in our mind.  I know your feelings, because I was also shocked when I heard this news . I know him well because I learned about him in the English class and in the history class, and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man.  I think so too. He had big influence all over the world not only black people but white people. But he was not a special person. He was a normal people. All of black people are like him.  I also agree with you. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. Now he had passed away, but the people in South Africa should face the problems they have now and they should keep trying to make the better country for themselves.  There are various opinions against Mandela. However I think he is a honorable man. The fact that he fought against discrimination and that he made the first step to change South Africa is admirable. We must learn from him, I think. We must learn the spirit to fight against injustice even in a severe situation. However I don't think fighting or protesting is the only way to deal with severe situation, I highly evaluate his way of living.  I think that Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest person over the world. His speech and action changed South Africa. I was so surprised that he had been taken into custody to fight against apartheid. Therefore, I was shocked by his death.  I have read about him only in textbooks of History, but I know that he had fought for his brotherhoods. May his spirit stay in the land of South Africa.  Nelson Mandela is one of the most nice person of this world for me. He has really strong passionate, I have been respected him since when I learn about him at junior high school. When I read this topic I was really surprised, because he had been in prison for as many as 27 years! I can't believe that, and I moved his life.  I agree with your idea. I never know about Mandela up till now, however I learned about him in history class in the other day. He is very great person! I want to be man like him.  I am ashamed of my ignorance of history. I have heard about him a couple of times, but I didn't really know about him actually. Since he died, I came to notice how great person he is that he made an effort to stop discrimination at the time when that kind of insistence is disliked. From now, I want to study about not only him but also people who have done great things in the past. Then I want to be the person who can explain amazing stories of historical people to my future children.  I agree with you. I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.  I was very shocked by this news. Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest people in 20th century, I think. His bravery and decision was second to none. I hope South Africa become more developed.  I agree with your idea. This is because we should more respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. I think for this he is really great person and his characteristic is special.  I agree with you. He is one of the greatest person in the world. I think that his death is a great loss.  I totally agree with you.  Nelson Mandela is great person. I work part-time at Fuji TV and I watched many news of his death. I learned what he did. A lot of dignitary from the world came to his memorial ceremony. It shows how great he is. May his soul rest in peace.  I agree with you. We should respect him because he abolished racial discrimination.  I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination A lot of people must prayed that Nelson Mandela would not die. He saved many people. He made many people be smile. He brought happiness to everywhere. He is a great person. I respect him forever.  I think so. I respected him very much. It is true that even if you have purpose like him, it is rare that you act as he did. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century, too. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength.  I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However I was surprised to hear that Everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. I think he had influence on all over the world and Nelson Mandela is the one of the best politicians of all the times.  I was not surprised when I read this article because I had already known this news. I have known him by studying world history. By being these person like him, now we can live in the peaceful world. I hope the South Aflica more develop and prosper. I respect him strongly and forever.  I know too. He is very popular person all over the world. I want to be him. I want to be person written on textbook.  I agree with you. We need to respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. (I couldn't log in my account. ) Yes, he encouraged many discriminated people. I think we should respect his mind.  I was surprised at this news because he is great people all over the world, but in Japan, I feel, there're a few news. We should not forget him and apartheid.  There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest people in the world and history. He told us so many things. We should greatly respect his patience to overcome the sorrows of many persecution.  I didn't know Nelson Mandela well His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  I also didn't know about him. I feel some irony of world that a great person are become famous after they died like some writers and artist. I could know Nelson Mandela contributed much to make equality society by this article.  I agree with your idea. I respect him and I'm so sad to hear this news. He must be one of most greatest person in the world. We should take over his will.  He was a great person, and we lost a very important piece of human history. He had something that many of us don't have. He had a strong will to make a change, and never gave up even in the most severe situation. Most of us were born with many rights and take them for granted. To remember these great people's feats may get us to think about our lives again, and then we can live more beautiful lives.  I don't think his all achievements are great. He resorted to violence to get a Black Rights. He was not always great person. But he changed his thought and he solved the problem. Finally, he became a first president as black. So I want to praise not only his achievements but also his mind of brave to change his thought for peace.  Nelson is a very wonderful person. We the yellow-skinned races were also segregated by race from ancient times. It is difficult to fight with racial discrimination and to solve racial discrimination. I think that discrimination has decreased now, thanks to Nelson etc. It is the favor which we can also be committing overseas more globally than ancient times. We have to appreciate. I think that a difficult problem will also fight like him.  I was really shocked when I heard he died. I know him well because I learned about him in the history class and in the English class and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man.  I was shocked to hear this news. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. He has a strong sense of justice and he has achieved a lot of great things. We don't have to forget what he did in Africa and the world forever.  I agree with you. He was great because he never gave up resisting the apartheid, and changed the world. Despite his some mistakes, I totally respect him.  I learned his achievement in the class of world history last year, so I know how great he is. it is unforgettable that all of his actions that is not simply aimed at the liberation of Black people but aimed at the equality of all people. As a result, South Africa has grown rapidly recently. I mourn for his death and I never forget his achievements.  When I was high school student, english's text book said about him. So I know him before I heard this news. And I know that he is very important for Africa. So I was very sad.  I agree with you. He did not revenge, and moved in order to improve the world. We should respect this noble spirit of his.  I think your power of expression is so amazing!!! I totally respect him very much, , , , he was great person for us! Mandela R. I. P.  I agree with you. His great characteristic finally abolishes Apartheid.  I have watched a movie whose main character is Mandela! He was great in that he never gave up getting along with people who had persecuted him. Finally he became the President of the Republic of South Africa. Now he isn't in this world, his efforts should be praised by all people and handed down from generation to generation. .  When I was a high school student, I often found his name in the world history textbook. The textbook said he fought for human rights. If he didn't do anything , many black people were still treated unfairly. So I respect him.  When I heard this news, I felt very sad because I esteem him. When I heard the story of his life for the first time, I was impressed. I think we should remember his effort and achievement.  I feel very sad when I heard the news because I personally respect him. South Africa was famous for its racism which was called apartheid. I think Nelson Mandela gave us some hints to live peacefully with another race and I hope his will will never be perished and we will take over it.  Seeing this news article, I was surprised other countries regard the ANC as terrorist. Nelson Mandela was one of the politicians in 20th century. We never forget his achievement and apartheid. I believe that all people in the world should think about racial discrimination.  I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved.  I felt the same feelings of you. I don't have a strong will, so I try to take in Nelson Mandela's will. And also I will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system.  I was so happy about the fact that his anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. And I think it is great that someone tells you that you are the greatest son in the nation after the one is dead. I think we should pray for him too.  I was surprised to hear that. "", His big concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together when Mandela was finally released 27 years later. ""This is very positive. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission . He is fabulous.  I knew Nelson Mandela as a historical figure. So when I heard this news, I was surprised to know him as a man of today. I thought I should be curious about what is going in this world now.  I was very surprised to read this news. The reason is that I had expressed great interest in the Nelson Mandela of thinking and behavior. That his death is very sorry for me, but I'm anxious that the people who inherit of his will and ideas appear. "
JOC JOC-14A-08N 0.54 "I was shocked when I hear the news. I think it is unbelievable that crews run away striving to be first. But the crews of the ferry did as such. The company has neglected the safety. They haven't acted with a sense of responsibility. Today companies struggle with trying to reduce costs. It is necessary. However, they should consider consumers' safety and benefit. I want to say that to companies, especially one in food industry. I aspire a thorough investigation. I want for companies to prevent a recurrence with a clear description of the cause and responsibility.  According to this article, 15 crews insisted that they were not responsible for the Sewol sinking and a ferry operator's chief executive and four employees also didn't admit that it caused this accident that the ferry was overloaded with cargo and had been redesigned. I was amazed by it. After weighing economic growth and the passengers' safety, Chonghaejin Marine chose the former. They cut down the things that never be cut down anyway. And the explanation that crews didn't know that the ferry was overloaded with cargo and had been redesigned is very childish. This is not a matter that can be settled with it. I think they must face the grieving families and consider what they did.  When I read articles about South Korean ferry first, I think that ferry's captain has no sense of responsibility. It is because the captain didn't rescue his passengers but jump into rescue boat first. This is unbelievable accident. In this article, I found that Nam Ho-Man has no sense of responsibility too. He headed Chonghaejin's cargo team. However he didn't know the ferry's cargo limit and how match cargo was loaded on the day of the accident. I think the man who head a company or team must know rules and do one's duty. So I think companies have to adhere rigidly to the rules not to cause same mistake.  I was not able to understand the thing in detail because of a surprise at that time.  It is what is not permitted that the accident happened because they piled it up more than quantity of the freight which they can load onto a ship. Since this news was to have been generated in a country next to Japan, it was big reported in Japan. Of them following the fact that did it, must reflect in various scenes. @@I think that it was good that I can learn it about this news.  CEO should receive the punishment more than the crew of Korean sinking ferry. In the beginning It was thought that the accident occurred because the crew ignored the passenger. It became clear that not only neither a captain but also a crew is bad. The cause of an accident is the design which disregarded safety. The CEO's lawyer insists that they are not teaching that crew put a over wight load . However, it is only going to escape responsibility. As a result of continuing to seek profits, they have caused such an accident. Therefore, they should receive severe punishment.  I was not able to understand what they were saying. I think they don't feel responsibility for this accident at all. For example, the captain left the vessel and jumped to the rescue boat first without rescuing passengers. And he is also Defendant Nam Ho-Man, who headed Chonghaejin's did not know the ferry's cargo limit and did not know how much cargo was loaded on the day of the accident. These mistakes was not happen if they employees know duties. In this case, it is natural that crews give highest priority to the safety of human lives. I learned from this South Korean ferry accident, on working, it is very important that understand duties what we have to do even if how natural it is.  In my opinion , it is quite natural that the CEO was blamed for the accident. Although many of us criticize only the captain of ferry , I think we should criticize the CEO at the same time. The CEO have a responsibility of teaching their employees and should take action what their company did. I'm sorry for family of victims , however, I think this is good time for other company CEO to look back their responsibility.  Reading this article, I was very shocked and was disgusted with the captain of the ship and its crews. They abstain the responsibility of their work. On one hand , I can understand their thoughts and their statements, that is, ""I want to live!"";on the other hand I hold them in contempt. In my opinion, this is obviously a consequence of human neglect. So , they should be strictly punished.  When I knew about this incident at the first time, I was seething at the ferry's captain. However I noticed that I hadn't have understood truth when I read this article. The prosecutors unveiled that the company officials neglected the safety of the passengers and take priority to the profit of the company. I was very surprised at the fact that the mass media changes our thoughts and feelings easily. I feel grief for the victims of this accident and I learned the power of the mass media from this news.  If the reason for the sinking is the ferry's cargo, it's true that staffs escaped with leaving a number of people. They are clearly responsible for the disaster. I was surprised at knowing that there are some people who are still missing. I hope they will be found as early as possible.  It shows how employee's training is important. For Sewol crew, they have no choice but to deny their responsibilities. This is because Sewol crew had not received enough rescue and ethical training. When the accident ocu Some of you think my thought is wrong.  This article shows how employee's training is important. For Sewol crew, they have no choice but to deny their responsibilities. This is because Sewol crew had not received enough rescue and ethical training. Therefore, they had not had the awareness that they were employees and they were responsible for passengers. When the accident happened, they had not known what they should do. They acted as passengers. Some of you think my thought is wrong. somebody think they could serve right action even they had not been taught enough. However, if ever once you have worked, I think you know how it is hard difficult to take responsibility for your job. Ever university students jobs have heavy responsibilities. much more their job has tremendously heavy responsibilities. I think this is not the ferry company and South Korean societies problem, but also the whole world's problem. To gain more economic profits, many company have been run illegally. We should pay more attention to these illegal managements.  I think the lack of responsibility of crew member who carry a lot of people's lives should improve in order not to cause such tragedy. I hope the wreck will be the cornerstone of the consciousness of crew's pride, responsibility.  I think this accident was caused by lack of responsibility of the leader. Besides, it gave the people in the world fear of vehicle. I think it is not only problem of Korean companies. We, people all over the world need to understand the cause of the accident and consider a solution of such an accident. It is most important for us to understand the cause of an accident when an accident occurred. I hope such an accident do not happened any more.  To see this news that caused the dead person of approximately 300, as for me, I can't believe irresponsibility of the CEO at the same time as a heart ached. At first I think that caused this accident is to have been beyond the freight limit of the ferry. In spite of it, I think that they who got away with leaving a passenger when they caused an accident are responsible for the doubles. When many people see this news, I think that they grieved, but think that, with that in mind, it is necessary to understand the importance of the responsibility of the leader all over the world.  According to this article, a ferry operator's chief executive and four employees was at the helm of the vessel when it capsized. When I read this news, the most surprising fact for me was that the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected as next to nothing was spent on crew training. Should we think that benefit is more important than safety? I think the answer is ""No. "" Recently, there may be a lot of companies that pay more attention to making much money, however, they should learn form this disaster and try not to happen such accident again. In this news, we could learn the fact that the crew members, including the captain, said through their lawyers that their employer was responsible for the ship's sinking because sailors had no control over cargo and they said the coast guard was responsible for rescuing the passengers. This made me shocked very much because I think what they should do was not blame other people but apologize to the grieving families. Also, South Korean government have to make more strict laws about safety.  I think that this accident concerns us, too. In a capitalistic nation, we seek profit. However, we should not neglect the safety. The vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo. The crews should have informed the media on the fact that the company sought profit at the sacrifice of the passengers' lives. Therefore, the crews should be punished. Furthermore, CEO is a person most responsible for this accident in this company. He should have made efforts to know what was happening in his company. He should be accused of a serious crime. There is no doubt that we should learn precious teachings by this accident. ""Life is more important than money. "" When I read this news two months ago, I thought the captain was the most irresponsible. However, after reading this article, I thought the CEO was most irresponsible. If the CEO fulfilled his task and noticed careless mistakes, this accident never happened. The CEO must not seek profit but provide people with safety. The chance of accident, all company's CEO should take responsibility and should not take mistakes. I hope such accident never happen from now on.  I was shocked that the vessel made in Japan is converted to make more profit in Korea, and that CEO, the captain and employees are all irresponsible for what they did. I'm sympathize with families whose member died in the accident because who is responsible for this accident isn't clear, so they can't vent their sorrow on anybody.  I was surprised and got angry about two point. The first is the company knew the ship's redesign made top-heavy and unstable. And they spent only $2 on training for any emergency . However luxurious or comfortable the ship is, human life and safety should have priority over all other things. And it is important that they make a profit, but if they do a sly trick , they lose their trust . After that , many people don't want to use it. People seek safety, as they use means of transportation. The second that I paid attention to these lawyer's comment. When I read these sentences , I think we should not seek who have responsibility for this trouble, but should look for what is the cause that the trouble happened. And the company must understand the cause in order to improve bad points. When any trouble like that occurred, all companies don't think someone else's business. They should think and reconsider each company , as if it had happened to them. If so, many troubles can be defended, before occurred.  This news makes me feel sad even if I look how many times. According to this article, it is said that the cause that the ship sank into was result of an excessive cargo. I think that they should be punished immediately because they ignore the passenger, and they escaped even if it was not the crew to have piled up loads. What I was surprised at very much when I read this article was that the ferry company downplayed the security of the passenger, and gave priority to the economic profit of the company. I looked at the state that families of the dead grieved in TV and came to have a pain in my chest. Moreover, I felt anger for the company. I hope that such a case never happens.  I was very surprised at many ferries were redesigned to add cabins and created an exhibition room after its purchase. Not only that, Chonghaejin Marine connivanced it and have continued to overload the ferry. Furthermore, I felt fury because 15 crew members laid blame on others. It is important to make regulation which prohibit overloading ferries and strengthen sailors' emergency training. We mustn't repeat such disaster which many people grieve.  I feel sorry for this tragic accident because I personally think that it was not a unavoidable accident and it is safe to say that it was a man-made disaster. Public transportation or other means of transportations are absolutely responsible for the lives of the people. They should take as much care as they can to save those lives.  When I see this news, I felt anger. Not only the captain abdicated all responsibility but also they piled a lot of cargo that are overloaded. I think this accident was caused by lack of responsibility of the leader. I think it is natural things that crews give us highest priority to the safety of human lives. From this article, I learned we should be think responsibility which we have.  Reading this article, I realized that the captain was not the only one who was to blame. The accident was also caused by irresponsibility of the company he belonged to. The company as a whole, including him, should be denounced, And It is also natural that the prime minister Park is blamed for haphazard investigation. Although I was confused and felt indignant when I hear the news that the ferry capsized because of overloaded cargo, I now think that it is a bit consoling news to the grieving families that so far 292 passengers have been recovered (as ""bodies"", though).  I think that this is the responsibility of the CEO, of course. And the truth that the CEO does not really have a sense of responsibility to have escaped makes me feel deplorable. Not only the CEO but also 14 crew members missed in a sense of responsibility too. It is a pity to become the social trend that such people increase to.  I felt very sad when I read the news. Especially, I felt angry as if I was a relative of the victims. There are two causes of this sinking accident. The first is the crew's ruck of sense of crisis and the ruck of responsibility. Crew must never forget to take the life of the passengers and should have risk management capacity. The second is that laws do not be decided properly. The government make the law strict . So, we must not repeat such disaster.  A government should impose a very strict penalty on the crew of sinking ferry. And I was surprised that weight of cargo caused this accident. If it's true, not only the crew but also designers have a grave mistake. I want to solve the cause of this accident.  What is the cause of the South Korea ferry accident? The answer of this is very various and all of the causes should be reconsidered. However, among them, I think, it is the lack of the sense of responsibilities of the company and the ferry crew that led such terrible accident. Certainly, it is natural that companies put emphasis on pursuing their profits and ferry crew member try to save their own lives, but they should have given the first priority to save their passenger. They need to take a look at what they did, , and other company all over the world should learn a lesson from this accident.  This news that the Korean ferry had sank shocked me very much. It is because a lot of people died in the ferry , who are the same age like me. In addition to this, more shocking matter for me is that this accident was caused by human error. Firstly, the crews' ways of thinking about safety were optimistic. The captain of the ferry escaped firstly and the employees announced wrong information for long time. Of course, there were a few crews with virtuous hearts and they helped passengers at risk of their lives. But this accident was caused by the human error. Secondly, the government should have made more regulations for the safety. Korean government should have regulated the load capacity and manuals in an emergency. Because of lack of regulations, so many people who could have been saved died. We should make exertions to decrease such an accident by human error When I read this article, I was afraid of the risk of accident of vehicle. Until now I never think about it, so this time is a nice opportunity to reconsider the blessing of my life. I think this accident is due to the lack of the sense of responsibilities of the company and the ferry crew.  This accident have been asking us ""Where is responsibility?"" When I hear the news of the accident, I regarded being to blame as the chief of the ferry. However, I don't think so now. Not only the chief of the ferry, but also company he belonged to is responsible for this. It is true that everyone want to save their own lives in an emergency. However, I think there need to be more sense of responsibility of them. Considering these things, we must swear that we let the terrible accident like this never be occurred.  This case is not an accident but a man-made disaster. A captain and crews should let passengers get out of the ferry. That is their job. However, They run away first because they wanted to survive. This is a most ungentlemanly act for them. I am very sorry for the victims and their family. The CEO must take responsibility. He should be executed.  Hearing the news whose South Korean ship was depressed, I felt sad. You have taken refuge from the captain having made the passenger desertion. However, I will change a viewpoint. Should a wrecked ship be kept sunk? This has been a problem very much now. It is because the example where the wrecked ship became @@ of the fish and fish increased in number to keep a wrecked ship sunk was reported. Globally, the crop yields of a tuna increase and the tuna has been whether is exterminated at the problem. Therefore, can't the problem be solved depending on the method of processing of a wrecked ship, either? But there is also still a missing person in the sunken wrecked ship. Sadness of the bereaved family who lost the family is unfathomable. Therefore, it is also important to find out the dead family's dead body and article left behind. This news makes me consider various things.  Grieving families still are frantic . They think that it is the captain of the vessel that is responsible for capsizing the vessel . I hear that some grieving families ask the crew to accept execution . I think it is not humane . It is important for the company of the ship to look into the incident initially and to retrieve the deads . And Korean government should make environment where unveiled investigation can be taken . Korean government has an effect on the end of the incident, I think .  This news made me feel sad because many people were killed by this disaster. Moreover, the captain of this ferry ran anyway when this accident happened. I was shocked to hear this fact.  I believe that it is wrong in choosing economic benefits over risking important lives. The passengers who were mainly just high school students had their whole life ahead of them and because of the crew members personal economical needs, the students lives were lost. Also besides this problem, after the ship had started to sink, the Korean government should have taken quicker measures in dealing with this issue. If the government had taken faster actions in a more earlier stage, there would have been less deaths and more lives would have been saved.  I think it is quite natural that parents of students who were killed in this accident be furious very much. Both parents and students are innocent and only crew, especially captain, is sinful. All of those who are relevant to this accident have to be punished strictly.  I was very shocked to read this article. It is natural that people should demand vast amount in capitalist economy. But, this article seems to told us that demanding excessive profits led to the tragedy. These idea which represent in this capitalist economy deprived numerous life. I think companies which have people's lives in their hands should take the importance into consideration again not to repeat again.  It's very shocking article for me. It is important that people want to choose economic benefits, but we have to consider the way not to harm human's living. The risking of human's living is very important for us, so we must not make some factors which cause such accidents. I think that companies need to carry on business while they pay attention the people's living.  According to the article, the crews were not trained. When the ferry was not at the helm and sinking, the crews had no choice but to leave the ferry because of their inexperience. Everyone thinks this action are same as murder, and I think so too. They should be heavily criticized for leaving the ship while so many people still remained aboard. In addition, according to the article, the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected. If this are true, this tragedy is the very man-made rather than a natural disaster. It is no exaggeration to say that a faulty and sloppy management of safety led to the accident.  Are companies allowed only to go after profits? The CEO focus on profits instead of safety. I'm disconsolate about this article. Company must place maximum priority on human life. In our normal life, we prefer to forget about attention on safety. Every business manager takes the opportunity afforded by this case to confirm safety.  This accident made me angry. I think captain should do his work with a sense of mission and a high feeling of tension. Every passenger believe him, as it were, entrust their life to him. Even if this is an unexpected accident, the captain must not betray the passengers. Such an offender think just to apologize is enough, but this is totally wrong. I think they should consider how the victims feel.  When I read this article, I had grief and fury at the same time. Particularly , I was very shocked at the topic of Chonghaejin. This case was not an unexpected accident. It was just waiting to happen. Thorough this case, I was terrified at human greed for wealth. Which did Chonghaejin executives value more, passenger's life? or fame and wealth? If it had been passenger's life , this case would haven't happened. I pray that their soul may rest in peace.  I strongly agree with your opinion. If the reader had been responsible, this accident would haven't happened. I also want to think again what is responsibility.  I strongly agree with your opinion. I think that the mass media changes our thoughts and feelings easily too. We should not believe everything that mass media say and we should careful about that.  I agree with your opinion strongly. I think that the consciousness to take life of another person upon itself is very important. Then such accidents may decrease if they do so it. We must be conscious all over the world as well as Japan and Korea. We have a sad experience if we do so it. I will pray for a peaceful thing in future! When I read this article, I was really surprised at the fact that the employees at Chonghaejin spent only $2 on training last year. When I first heard this news, I thought the captain and the crews are responsible for this accident. However, I thought that not only they but also the employees at Chonghaejin are responsible for this accident when I read this article. I want the employees at Chonghaejin to take measure not to happen accident again.  I think the captain of the ferry should be responsible. 15 members of the ferry should also be blamed. But the captain has responsible for their member's mistakes and faults. Moreover the captain should know ferry's cargo limit and must load under it. Furthermore the crew members, including the captain, said the coast guard was responsible for rescuing the passengers. However I think they only wanted to escape from being blamed. So the coast guard should rescue the passengers as soon as possible but even if they have to do it, the crew members have to be blamed.  Now, they have got the detail of the accident and cause of it. Next, they should take measures to review their crisis management system. They must get off for-profit steering, and consider the safety seriously. Of course they have the keen purposefulness of betterment. . .  I was shocked when I read this article, because more than three hundred people is still dead or missing. I cannot understand why the captain has escaped from his own ship and leave his passengers. It is natural that the bereaved families abuse crew member and Korean government. I think that not only Korea but also the whole world should think about ""safety"" one more time.  I strongly agree with him. Merchant should think about the customers! Why can you sell your products? Because, people buy those. Your jobs absolutely need customers. Do you forgot those easy things? I would like to ask all companies about that.  I see that human is base in a new light when I heard this news. Human tends to make a near-term profit at the sacrifice of safety and tend to forget the risk and importance of safety. But a compensation of this action is so great. On this accident the Government must reconsider the standard of safety thoroughly.  The most important problem is that the crew members didn't have intensions to have responsibilities for the accident. At least the crew members controlled the ship, and moreover, they left passengers. It is most problematic. I think they should be punished. It is true that there are problems that the ship was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo and the coast guard had responsibilities , but problems that the ship was overloaded is not exact and they also could save passengers. They should have done the best to save passengers.  I think the captain have a responsibility to apologize. Of course, CEO should do so, too. The captain must be punished in the legal way. We must give Korea by technological and scientific support. What is the most important is the feeling of families mourning. Korea should indemnify. medias should tell us that.  I have two opinions about this news. When I read related this news at first, this ferry's clues are poor, I think. Because they struggled for their lives. But in recent days, we can know the details about this accident. In this article, the vessel was overloaded with poorly stowed cargo after a risky redesign and safety was neglected as next to nothing was spent on crew training. So I got angry with the clues who left their passengers in spite of having the responsibilities. And I think if they should save their passengers until the ferry capsized, it is impossible. So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the possibility as clue"".  I have two opinions about this news.

So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the possibility as crew"".  When I read this article, I was very shocked because crew ran away at first. I think this action is bad and if I had been there, maybe I ran away. I can't blame them.  This news is shocking. I was surprised that the captain and crew left many people aboard and plea. I can't understand that they were wrong but escaped. Korean judges should strictly make a statement.  I have two opinions about this news.

So I got angry with the crews who left their passengers in spite of having the responsibilities. And even if they should save their passengers until the ferry capsized, I think it is impossible. So making use of the reflection about this accident, we must reconsider ""the responsibility as crew"".  I can't understand crews' thought. They had duty to protect their passengers and this truth never change. "
ACA ACA-ALP-002 3.1 "The Role of Residential and Nursing Homes in the Last Year of People's Lives ANN CARTWRIGHT Ann Cartwright, B.Sc., Ph.D., is Director of the Institute for Social Studies in Medical Care SUMMARY Almost a quarter of a random sample of adults dying in 1987 had spent at least part of the last year of their lives in a residential or nursing home; one in eight spent all of that year in one. The old, the unmarried. those with difficulty looking after themselves, the confused, the incontinent, the blind, the deaf, and the bad tempered were more likely to be in such homes than others. With their greater dependency. people living in residential homes received rather more consultations and home visits — although not night calls — from their general practitioners. But they did not get more help from community nurses and they were less likely to be admitted to, or to die in, a hospital or hospice. According to the assessments of relatives, friends, and neighbours who answered the questions, the quality of life of people who had been in a residential home for a year or more before their death was similar to that of others who died but had never been in such a home. It was those who were admitted in the year before they died who were perceived as having a relatively poor quality of life in that year. Increasingly, the quality of life during the year before death is going to depend on the attributes of residential homes and their staff. The marked rise in the number of residential homes, particularly the recent growth in the private sector (DHSS, 1987; Bebbington and Tong 1986; Laing, 1985) has drawn attention to the somewhat uncertain role of these homes (Judge and Sinclair, 1986). Two areas of concern are first, who should have residential care and second, the relationship between residential and community care. A recent study of people's lives in the year before their death makes it possible to examine the part residential and nursing homes play in caring for people during the   twelve months before their death. This paper then looks at the characteristics of the people who spent some or all of their time in such homes and at the care they got from general practitioners, community nurses and hospitals. Care and conditions in the homes and the extent of visiting are described and a final section considers the quality of people's lives as perceived by their relatives and others. METHODS The data come from a study of a random sample of adult (aged 15 and over) deaths in ten areas of England in October and November 1987. For these deaths we tried to identify and then interview the people who could tell us most about the last twelve months of the lives of the people who died. Someone was interviewed about 639 of the deaths, 80 per cent of the original sample of 800. Husbands or wives were seen about 36 per cent of the 639, other relatives about 43 per cent, friends or neighbours about 10 per cent , staff of institutions about 10 per cent and other officials about one per cent . Staff of institutions responded about 18 per cent of those who had been in residential homes for less than a year, 47 per cent of those in one for longer. In general, the answers from different types of respondent did not differ all that widely and the variations that emerged seemed, for the most part , understandable in terms of the characteristics and circumstances of the people they were telling us about, although there did seem to be a tendency for the staff of homes to put a more rosy interpretation on situations. For an analysis of these differences, and for further details about the study, see Cartwright and Seale (1990). TYPES OF HOMES AND NUMBERS RECEIVING CARE The ‘homes’ covered in this study include residential homes for older people, nursing homes and other institutions excluding hospitals or hospices. For convenience they are referred to here as residential homes. Fourteen per cent of the sample of deaths occurred in such homes; this compares with a much lower proportion, 5 per cent in 1969 (Cartwright et al ., 1973). A further 9 per cent of the people who died spent at least part of the last twelve months of their lives in such homes; so almost a quarter, 23 per cent, were in residential homes at some stage in the last year of their lives. The length of time they spent there and the types of homes involved are shown in Table 1. Those classed as ‘other homes’ included convalescent homes, a rehabilitation centre, an assessment centre, a holiday home for the disabled and rest homes which may in practice have been homes for older people (the classification was made on the basis of the information given by the person interviewed). A relatively high proportion of those in other types of home were there for less than a month. Sixty-two per cent of those in old people's homes had been there for a year or more compared with 47 per cent of those in nursing homes, but this difference might have occurred by chance. Of the old people's homes, 56 per cent were said to be run by the Council, 6 per cent by a charity and 39 per cent were private. In contrast the great majority of nursing homes, 83 per cent, were privately run. Nearly a quarter of those in nursing homes had not had to pay towards the cost of living there compared with only 7 per cent of those in old people's homes. The reason for the difference seemed to be that the DHSS paid for nursing home treatment in a number of instances: ‘They took the pension and attendance allowance and the DHSS paid the rest.’ Nevertheless the proportion for whom payment was thought to have been something of a problem was 7 per cent of all those in old people's homes (15 per cent for private ones, 6 per cent for others) and 17 per cent of those in nursing homes — further differences which did not reach statistical significance. WHO SPENDS ALL OR ANY PART OF THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR LIFE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME? AGE, SEX AND FAMILY? People who lived longer were more likely to have spent some or all of the last year of their lives in residential homes. People have been counted as spending all of the last year of their lives in residential homes if they had lived in one for a year or more. (In fact, as will be seen later, a number of them were admitted to hospital during the last twelve months of their lives and some died in hospital.) Few under 75 had spent any time in such homes but more than half those dying when they were aged 85 or more had spent at least some of the last year of their lives in one. The figures are in Table 2 which also shows expected age related differences with sex and marital status. Further analyses by age and marital status showed that married people less often spent any time in residential homes than single or previously married people of the same age. The proportions among those aged 75 — 84 were 8 per cent of the married, 34 per cent of the others, and for those aged 85 or more 25 per cent compared with 61 per cent. Neill et al . (1988) found that few married people applied for residential care and those who did so were less likely to be admitted than applicants who were single or widowed. There were no significant differences in the present study between the never and the previously married although it might be expected that people with children might be less likely to go into a home than those without any and the widowed, divorced, or separated are much more likely to have children than the single: 75 per cent compared with 6 per cent. An analysis by marital status and number of children showed that for the married the main difference was between those with no children, 17 per cent of whom had been in a residential home, and those with one or more, for whom the proportion was 5 per cent. For the widowed or divorced there was no difference between those with and without children nor any significant trend with the number of children. So it would seem that children may assist one parent to care for the other who might otherwise go into a home, but apart from this they have   to residential homes for some while caring for and thus avoiding the admission of others, and that these two influences cancel each other out in the statistics. An analysis by the sex of children showed no significant differences between those with a son or sons only and those with only a daughter or daughters. An earlier study (Cartwright et al ., 1973) found that those with a daughter or daughters were more likely to die in their own homes than those with just a son or sons. Data in Table 2 suggest that those with living brothers or sisters may be less likely to be admitted to a home. Part of this is an age effect: the proportion with such relatives falling from 86 per cent of those aged 45 — 54 to 41 per cent of those aged 85 or more. Among those aged 85 or more a similar proportion of those with and without living siblings had been admitted to a home at some stage but among those aged 75 — 84 more of those without any such relatives had been admitted: 30 per cent compared with 17 per cent. These variations reflect the fact that siblings themselves age and die and therefore become less of a source of support as people grow older. CAUSE OF DEATH People who died of cancer were less likely than those dying from other causes to have been in such homes, 7 per cent against 29 per cent. The difference remains when the age at which they die is taken into account. (Cause of death was taken from the death registration form as coded by OPCS.) When the type of home was taken into account, those dying of respiratory disease were more likely to have been in nursing homes — 14 per cent compared with 6 per cent for those dying of other conditions — whereas those dying of stroke were more likely to have been in old people's homes: 27 per cent against 12 per cent. SELF CARE The proportions reported to have had difficulty with various aspects of caring for themselves (getting in and out of a bath or shower, dressing and undressing, going to the toilet, washing and shaving, feeding themselves, making a hot drink, or needing help at night) for a year or more before death was 87 per cent of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more, 60 per cent of those in for a shorter time and 25 per cent of those who had not been in such a home at all. (People who had been in a hospital for all the year before they died have been excluded from these comparisons.) But many of the symptoms asked about were reported for similar proportions of those who had been in residential homes and those who had not; these were pain, trouble with breathing, vomiting or feeling sick, drowsiness, sleeplessness, dry mouth or thirst, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, bed sores, an unpleasant smell, and backache. However, for a number of these symptoms, more people in residential homes had had them for a year or more: the proportions were 31 per cent against 20 per cent for drowsiness, 22 per cent against 14 per cent for dizziness, 19 per cent against 11 per cent for loss of appetite and 4 per cent against one per cent for bedsores. Only one symptom, a persistent cough, was reported more often for those who had not been in a residential home — 24 per cent compared with 10 per cent of those who had spent some time in such a home. When deaths from cancer were excluded the difference remained: 22 per cent against 9 per cent. SYMPTOMS The symptoms reported more frequently for those in residential homes are shown in Table 3. Several of them — constipation, confusion, urinary incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing — have been shown elsewhere to increase with age (Cartwright, 1990a). Some of them, such as mental confusion, incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing, may have contributed to them being admitted to such homes. They can certainly make it more difficult for people to look after themselves. And among those people with confusion, constipation and incontinence, those in residential homes were more likely to have had the symptoms for a year or more. The figures were 81 per cent compared with 39 per cent for confusion, 78 per cent and 52 per cent for constipation, and 54 per cent against 36 per cent for incontinence. Bad temper might result from being in such a home. Another explanation for the relatively high proportion of those in residential homes reported to be bad tempered could be that relatives, friends or neighbours were less likely to report or perceive the person who died as being bad tempered than staff of institutions. Among those in residential homes the frequency with which bad temper was reported was 31 per cent when the respondent was a relative, friend or neighbour, 45 per cent when he or she was a staff member — a difference which did not reach statistical significance. But if the comparison between those who   had been in a home and others is confined to those for whom relatives, neighbours or friends were interviewed, there is still a difference: 31 per cent against 19 per cent. Bad temper could be either a cause or effect of being admitted to a residential home. Other studies have found that caring relatives are more likely to favour residential care as a solution for the elderly confused if the old person exhibits difficult behaviour (Levin et al ., 1989). So the evidence suggests that because of their age and frailty those living in residential homes will have needed more care during the last year of their lives than other people who died. CARE FROM GENERAL PRACTITIONERS People in residential homes remain under the care of general practitioners. The numbers of consultations, home visits and night calls reported for those in such homes for a year or more before they died are compared with those for others under the care of a general practitioner in Table 4. As expected, those in residential homes had more consultations and more visits from their general practitioners than others. But, if anything, they had rather fewer night calls. Of course night calls are usually made in a crisis and the help normally available in residential homes may make it easier to cope with a minor one without calling out a doctor. In the minority of homes (a quarter) where all the residents had the same doctor, visiting rates were higher (16.8 a year on average) than in the majority (three-quarters) where the residents could have different doctors (9.5). However, the proportions for whom the general practitioner was described as reluctant to visit, or for whom it was felt it would have been helpful if the doctor had visited the person who died more often, did not vary significantly between the groups. So it would seem that people in homes where they were free to have a doctor of their own choice were not seen as being more deprived of visits in spite of having fewer of them than people in homes where everyone had the same doctor. Those in homes where everyone had the same doctor might receive less individual attention at visits if general practitioners saw several patients on the same visit. The mixture of praise and criticism for general practitioners' care of people in residential homes was similar to comments about their care of others during the last year of their lives. Although most respondents praised, or were satisfied with, this care the study identified a number of inadequacies. Home visits were much appreciated when they happened   but failure to visit was one of the more common and significant criticisms (Cartwright, 1990b). The matron of a residential home, talking about a doctor who she felt was reluctant to visit said it would have been helpful if the person who died had been visited more often: ‘It would have given her a lot more comfort and the staff a lot more confidence.’ When asked why she thought the doctor had not come more often, she replied, ‘The doctors feel the residents are in a rest home to  save them working.’ The doctor had not been asked to come more often ‘because we're resigned to the fact that, unless it's an emergency, he won't come out.’ The matron also told us that this patient had to go into a nursing home ‘towards the end’ because ‘she needed morphine injections which the doctor wouldn't give otherwise she wouldn't have had to move to somewhere strange. She had to leave her room, her furniture: that's why she gave up.’ CARE IN HOSPITAL People who had lived in old people's homes were less likely than others who died to have gone into a hospital or hospice during the last year of their lives or to die in one. This can be seen from the figures in Table 5 which also suggest that the longer the time they had lived in an old people's home the less likely they were to go into hospital. But those least likely to have spent time in a hospital or hospice or to die in one were those who had lived in a nursing home for a year or more. This lower use of hospital inpatient facilities was not accounted for by the older age of the people in residential homes although fewer of all those aged 85 or more had spent time in hospital — 64 per cent against 80 per cent of those under 85. Among this older group 46 per cent of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more were admitted, 75 per cent of the others. There were similar differences when people   dying of respiratory disease and of cerebrovascular accident were considered separately: the proportions admitted to hospital were 25 per cent and 47 per cent of those in a residential home for a year or more, 76 per cent and 89 per cent of others among the two causes of death groups respectively. The numbers dying of other causes were too small to analyse separately. The only source of information from this study of any possible reluctance to admit people from residential homes to hospital relates to those who were admitted and respondents’ views on whether they should have been admitted earlier. This showed that in practice relatively few, one in ten, of those who had spent any time in residential homes were thought to have been admitted ‘too late’; this proportion was a quarter for those who had not spent any time in a residential home. Residential homes, and long stay nursing homes in particular, appear to cut down the use of hospital care during the last year of people's lives. What of the nursing care given by district and other nurses to those in old people's homes? HELP FROM VISITING NURSES Just over a third, 35 per cent, of those who had lived in an old people's home for a year or more had had help from a nurse who visited the home in the year before they died. This was similar to the proportion receiving help from district and other nurses among those who had not spent any time in such homes once sudden deaths and those who had spent all their last year in hospital have been excluded. They also received similar numbers of visits. Given their age, symptoms and frailty, it might have been thought that the residents of old people's homes would receive more care from visiting nurses than people in the community, as they received more visits from general practitioners. But some of the less skilled tasks undertaken by district and other nurses for people living in their own homes were probably done by staff in the residential homes. The next section looks at respondents' views of the care given to people in residential and nursing homes and the conditions there. CARE AND CONDITIONS IN THE HOMES Almost nine tenths, 88 per cent, of the people who had spent some time in a residential home were said to have had access to a telephone where they could make calls and people could telephone them. Among those  who did not have this facility, two-fifths were thought to have wanted it. Ninety-two per cent of those in old people's homes compared with 82 per cent of those in other sorts of homes had this amenity — a difference which fell short of statistical significance — but more of those in old people's homes had a room of their own, two-thirds against half. Overall the proportion with a room of their own was three-fifths and again two-fifths of those without one were thought to have wanted one. If the respondent was a relative, friend, or neighbour, they were asked to say whether they thought various aspects of the home were good or not so good. The replies of those who felt able to make these assessments are shown in Table 6. Clearly their views may have been different from those of the people who died, but respondents are likely to have taken into account the reactions of their relatives and friends, and how these respondents felt about the care in the homes is also of interest and concern. The most frequent criticism was of the food, and over this there was a difference between old people's homes for which 26 per cent thought the food ‘not so good’ and nursing homes for which it was 7 per cent. There were no differences between Council homes and private ones on any of these assessments, nor in the amenities available. And the overall assessments of the homes were similar in the two groups and between nursing homes and old people's homes. Altogether 50 per cent were described as ‘excellent’, 31 per cent as ‘good’, 9 per cent as ‘fair’, 6 per cent as ‘poor’ and one per cent as ‘dreadful’, with 3 per cent making other comments. A number of criticisms were exacerbated by feelings that people were in the wrong type of institution. A son whose father had Parkinson's disease and had been in an old people's home commented: They were not equipped to deal with a progressive condition, they were not that kind of establishment. The degree of mental stimulation was absent. It was a very distressing time for him. The whole point of his being there was because of his condition. He could have been in a hotel, had he not needed care and supervision which he blatantly did not get. The daughter of a woman with Huntingdon's chorea who had been in a nursing home described the care she got there as Limited — not because they didn't want to care, they just didn't know how to care for this type of patient…. It should not be registered as a nursing home. The one ‘dreadful’ home was thought to have contributed to the death of the man admitted there: It was an awful place: dreary, badly furnished and he wasn't as clean as he'd been in hospital — food all down his clothes and he hadn't shaved, he really looked unkempt. I don't think the staff cared. I'm sure the fact of moving to the home contributed to his death. He was so well when he left hospital…and the deterioration within a week was unbelievable. I just feel he gave up when he got in that home. (Died of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia aged 73 within 24 hours of being readmitted to hospital after being in an old people's home for less than a month.) A number of respondents commented on the lack of stimulation: ‘They sat in the front room and didn't move. Just sat there, no t.v. and no-one seemed to talk to them.’ When asked about the other residents in the homes, respondents' views were roughly equally divided about whether the person who died had on balance found them helpful (25 per cent) or tiresome (22 per cent ). Most of them, however, 53 per cent, made other comments, generally to the effect that the person had had little to do with other residents: ‘Her mind had gone so she was not able to socialise., Many of the relatives and friends who rated the homes as an excellent place for the person who died to live towards the end of his or her life made rather perfunctory comments: ‘I can't fault the home’; ‘It was very nice, no qualms about it.’ Others were rather more forthcoming: I would say that, instead of‘spoon-feeding’ the residents, they tried to make them independent. The staff were always there to help but didn't impose themselves. This was very good. And they kept her there when they could have sent her to hospital. (Friend of woman who had had a number of strokes.) A wife whose husband had had multiple sclerosis and went to a holiday home for the disabled for two weeks to give her a rest said: It's a good idea, gets them away from home to meet new people. They deserve a holiday like everybody else. He had a good time, said he really enjoyed it and would like to go again, and I had all the washing done for me — he didn't bring anything home dirty except the previous day's clothes. Sometimes relatives and patients had obviously had different views of the home. One daughter-in-law who rated the home as excellent went on to explain that her mother-in-law: hated everything about everything. We thought they were angels in the home and that everything was marvellous. The staff told us she was the most difficult lady — as far as she was concerned nothing was right. She had to share (the bathroom and lavatory) much to her annoyance, but they were just next to her room. You get what you pay for. The views of people who had previously looked after those who died sometimes reflected their gratitude and admiration for the people who took on this task. A friend of 30 years standing who had previously cared for a woman with senile dementia described how: I thought she was just being awkward until she slowly went downhill and became incontinent. I got help from the social services for this: they brought sheets and pillowcases from the hospital. The crux came when she became doubly incontinent and her mind had got to the point where she had forgotten how her body functioned. It was winter and I was changing her clothes three times a day and my self-control snapped and I shook her very hard to stop her sitting down without her pants and was so upset by my behaviour and frightened by what I had done that they agreed to put her in a home. The young nurses were very kind and would kiss and cuddle her. VISITING How much contact do people in residential homes have with relatives, friends, and neighbours outside? This question is considered for people who had been in such homes for a year or more. The number of different visitors they were reported to have had during the last twelve months averaged 5.0. Seven per cent had none, 52 per cent had one to four, 33 per cent five to nine, and 8 per cent ten or more. The number of visits was much greater: 11 per cent had 300 or more — almost one a day, 33 per cent between 100 and 300 — two or more a week on average, 19 per cent 50 — 99, between one and two a week, 4 per cent 20–49 — between one a fortnight and one a week, 14 per cent 10–19 — less than one a fortnight, 12 per cent had less than 10 or less than one a month. The number of visits was strongly related to the number of visitors: of those with less than five visitors, a quarter had a hundred or more visits, but this proportion was three-quarters for those with five or more visitors. Of those who were visited, 44 per cent had only relatives to see them, 11 per cent were visited just by friends or neighbours and 45 per cent by both relatives and friends; the most frequent visitor was a relative for 78 per cent and a friend or neighbour for 22 per cent. Three of the five who had no visitors were said by the people we interviewed to have had no relatives. Neither of the other two who had no visitors had any children; one had elderly relatives abroad, the other, in the opinion of the deputy officer in charge of the home, only had herself to thank: Because of her awkward manipulative ways she just didn't get any visitors. She did get visits from other visitors but they wore off because of her awkwardness. …She went out of her way to be unpleasant to people. Isaacs and his colleagues (1972) found that relatives' failure to provide basic care for elderly people was often associated with their previous rejection by the elderly person. However, for one in five of the people in residential homes for a year or more, our respondents said that there were relatives who they felt might have visited more often. This compares with one in four of those living in the community who were felt to have relatives who might have helped more — a difference which might well occur by chance. QUALITY OF LIFE Respondents were asked whether they would describe the quality of life of the person in the year before they died as good, fair, or poor. Two things appeared to affect this assessment independently. One was whether the respondent was a staff member or a relative. Those spending any time in a residential home were less often described as having a poor quality of life if the respondent was a staff member than if he or she was a relative: 10 per cent compared with 42 per cent. This probably reflects the perceptions of the respondents rather than a real difference in the actual quality of life of the people who died, although staff members may have been more willing to act as respondents for residents they had got on well with, and those residents may have had a better quality of life because of their relationship with the staff. The other factor that was related to assessments of quality of life was whether people had been in a residential home for a year or more or for a shorter  time. Taking all types of respondents together their ratings were similar for people who had not been in a residential home at all and those who had been in one for a year or more, while those who had only spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential home were generally felt to have had a worse quality of life: for 39 per cent of them it was rated as poor compared with 27 per cent of the other two groups. The difference between those spending all and those spending some of the last twelve months in a home persisted when the analysis is confined to those for whom relatives responded. This can be seen in Table 7. In addition, among those for whom a staff member responded only one in twelve of those admitted during the last year of the life was felt to have had a good quality of life during that time compared with nearly half (46 per cent ) of those who had been in a home for a year or more. One possible explanation for these findings is that people take time to adjust to living in residential homes. Another possibility is that those going into residential homes shortly before their death do so in a crisis situation. Weaver and his colleagues (1985) found that residents most able to come to terms with admission were those who had exercised some degree of control or choice in entering residential care. Findings from the present study suggest that once people had become established in the homes their quality of life, in the opinion of their relatives, was similar to that of other people who died and had never been in such homes. DISCUSSION Most of the people, just over two thirds, who spent all the last year of their life in a residential or nursing home were 85 or more, and it is this age group which is predicted to increase most rapidly in the next twenty years (Central Statistical Office (CSO), 1989) so it is likely that increasing numbers will spend the last year of their lives in such homes. But this increase may not be as great as the rise in the numbers of older people if there is an improvement in their state of fitness as Jefferys and Thane (1989) suggest. The symptoms that were more common among those in residential homes, particularly confusion, incontinence, and bad temper, indicate some of the problems in making these homes attractive and stimulating places to live. The description of one man of ninety-four illustrates many of the difficulties: He wasn't ill, it was just general deterioration. He was still quite active for his age, but his mental deterioration was the problem — he'd lost his sense of direction. He found it difficult to accept his own failings. Memory loss was the worst aspect, the fact that he was unable to complete a crossword puzzle in ten minutes as he once could troubled him. He was suffering from frustration. He was worried because he was deaf, worried because of his bowels. He worried a lot. He was, I think, unhappy and tired. He often said he'd had enough of living and was ‘ready to go’ was how he put it. (Died from falling down a flight of steps and fracturing his skull.) That man was admitted to hospital after his fall and died there within a week without regaining consciousness. But in general people living in residential homes were less likely than others either to die in, or to be admitted to, hospital during the last year of their lives. Residential homes seem to cut down the use of hospital care; they probably also reduce the need for it, but this is less certain. They may also reduce the demand and need for night calls from general practitioners and, taking into account the age and frailty of residents, the pressures on the district nursing service. Because of the nature of the sample this study could not ascertain the views of residents themselves. Others who have done so have argued that elderly people are often faced with a choice between an unpleasant battle to survive in their own homes and an equally unpleasant enforced dependence in the institution (Wilkin and Hughes, 1987). In this study relatives and friends generally thought conditions in the home were ‘good’ rather than‘not so good’, although a number of their comments and descriptions indicate that circumstances were sometimes far from ideal and analysis of respondents' views of the quality of life suggest that  the initial period after admission may be particularly stressful for residents. While most residents were in fairly frequent contact with relatives and friends from outside the home, one in five of those who spent all the last twelve months of their lives in a home had either no visitors at all or less than one visit a month. Becoming old and frail can be distressing; to be also isolated from relatives and friends seems dire. The task of relieving avoidable distress and creating a caring and heartening environment in residential and nursing homes is going to be of increasing importance in determining the quality of the last year of people's lives."
ACA ACA-CRS-003 3 "THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by ‘professionals’: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but ‘what is it to be human?’ sounds like a philosophical question — in which case it is also a political one — rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as ‘comprehensive’. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule — that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister — does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, ‘Nothing human is alien to me’, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining ‘human’ group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what ‘humanity’ consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are ‘excluders’ and ‘includers’. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics — that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. ‘parents’ are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a ‘natural expert’, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, ‘When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is — you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .’ Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include ‘their’ children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be ‘philosophical’ in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just ‘this is how we live’, but ‘this is how one ought to live’. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as ‘intelligence’ does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are ‘physically alive but socially dead’: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use ‘massa's’ language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the ‘civilisation’, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (‘What is it to be Black?’, ‘What is it to be a woman?’), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, ‘What is it to be human?’ WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, ‘discourses’, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include ‘expert’ ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a ‘Down's baby’ before the birth — in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception — they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of ‘learning difficulties’. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION ‘When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked’(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do — she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]… I had an instant bond with Marie — I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born — I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor — I've known him since I was a baby — and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, ‘Is your husband Chinese?’ And I said, ‘No.’ And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, ‘Well, I think the baby's a mongol’, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know…and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say ‘Here, is this baby a mongol?’ in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, ‘We've got some news.’ And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, ‘Does she look like anybody in your family?’ I said, ‘Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.’ She said, ‘Oh — you a nurse?’ I said, ‘No, I can just tell by her face’… So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning… Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her… The exact feelings… I wanted her to die… And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. ‘Natural’: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word ‘natural’ is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of ‘hysteria’and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then ‘Once I'd touched her, she was mine.’ She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows — unlike the professionals — exactly what the ‘shock’ is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought… I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them…but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people… They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times…but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that ‘It's natural to feel shocked’, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair…’). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of ‘shock’ have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life — partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. ‘Shock’ and ‘trauma’must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract ‘thing’which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience — becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human — seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. ‘COMING TO TERMS’: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby… These feelings…may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that ‘the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had’(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?… Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of ‘coping’ and ‘coming to terms’describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said ‘Typical mongol’, either ‘Typical mongol features’ or ‘Typical mongol face’, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him… They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: ‘That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.’ That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby… I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things ‘fall into place’. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round — she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner — and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him — virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: ‘Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it’(‘it’ being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is ‘for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to ‘come to terms with’ a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you ‘come to terms’ with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology — a ‘monster’, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they ‘needed to know’, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about ‘having another one’, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it ‘normally’ and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing — let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people — why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, ‘normality’ itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS ‘I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome’(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like…’ cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their…but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people… He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, ‘What's the kids going to be when they grow up?’ I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know… My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses… Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake… Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker… I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed ‘fortunate’ to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs £500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as ‘sad, bad news’ to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the ‘bereavement response’ to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)‘Shock’,(2)‘panic’,(3)‘Denial’,(4)‘Grief’,(5)‘Guilt’,(6)‘Anger’(in general),(7)‘Anger Against professionals’,(8)‘Bargaining’and finally (9)‘Acceptance’. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not ‘professionals’ and ‘parents’. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the ‘real people’. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and — make no mistake — will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an ‘equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having ‘moderate learning difficulties’. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer ‘smaller classes and more individual attention’. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words —canal, lock, barge — but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included ‘night-dress’ and ‘sponge-bag’. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a ‘night-dress’ for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent — teacher association, visit the ‘Spring Fayre’, to volunteer for ‘parent-governor elections’, or attend a ‘Maths Workshop’ were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like ‘his development of spatial awareness, or ‘his confidence on the apparatus’. However phrases like ‘is working hard’, ‘always tries his best’, ‘is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like ‘He is well below average’, ‘He is slow’, ‘He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.’ Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the ‘pirate series’ by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by ‘a highly intelligent girl’. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not ‘the bottom of the bottom set’. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, ‘I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.’ Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, ‘Nice is in every child.’ The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, ‘after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class’. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that ‘whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both’. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children ‘with learning difficulties’) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying ‘He always wants to play…he just wants toys.’ When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested — she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called ‘social concerns’ behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, ‘He reverts when he is with naughty children.’ They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been ‘feeling awful’ all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly £400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision — once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word ‘special’; and phrases like ‘learning difficulties’, ‘becomes anxious’, ‘experienced’ are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, ‘These children, do they learn it at the end?’ The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, ‘I want my child to leave’, and he said, ‘Our job is to help the child go back.’ They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, ‘They have learnt, that's nice.’ The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be ‘mature’ enough to cope with a ‘look and say’approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how ‘look and say’ uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school — lower/ middle/upper — resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: ‘Together, we can achieve more.’ The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, ‘We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.’ Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: ‘He will not come until you sign it…in the end you decide.’ Mr Singh asked his first question: ‘Would it be next September?’ The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away ‘at any time’. Mrs Singh asked ‘Do you have the same holiday?’ and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, ‘I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still…he wants toys…he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do…’ The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, ‘I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.’ The head said it was important to think about ‘whatever is best’ for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for —‘people think it's for mentally handicapped’. ‘It doesn't look like one’, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is ‘a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills’. Its job is to help children ‘who are struggling’. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy — they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, ‘class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.’ Terms like, ‘environmental work’, ‘a full curriculum’, ‘special programmes of work for language development’ would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that ‘parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.’ Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain — she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: ‘If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child…your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.’ An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: ‘parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.’ Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, ‘who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate…’ All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, ‘the majority remain until they are 16 years of age’. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any ‘work’. I was not sure what she meant by ‘work’. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems — speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty ‘sounding’ because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, ‘You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?’ The head said, ‘No, he's not ill.’ Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said ‘Yes, he does have difficulty remembering — particularly sounding’, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be ‘wild’, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, ‘That's our view of Balbinder.’ The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in ‘boys swimming’, ‘wet play’. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed — he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, ‘They are not allowed to speak English at home.’ She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say ‘can I’, or ‘May I’ instead of‘I want to’. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be ‘ill’. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much ‘talk and show’ early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, ‘I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.’ On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was ‘pretty borderline for special school’. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or ‘academic’ language. She reported on his ‘good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that ‘he now speaks both languages all right’. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: ‘I can't rely on myself — I don't know — working all the time — how could I know.’ Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional — parent and professional — child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional — parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional — parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of ‘the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor ‘causing’ the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the ‘fact’ that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. ‘Mum was initially cooperative…and Mr Peel was likewise ‘quite cooperative’’ until the decision was made to Statement…after that he opted out and didn't contact me.’ Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, ‘She seemed to be assessing me rather than John…it's like she's shifting the blame on to me…she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.’ The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: ‘She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.’ In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: ‘On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.’ She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the ‘dynamics’ of this family and to advise them that ‘as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting — the health visitor, the doctor, teachers — but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home…it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to ‘intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the ‘needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that ‘We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.’ For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that ‘John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.’ On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. ‘The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.’ Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions ‘don't ring true with my  own experience’. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is ‘a load of rubbish. It's a legal document…but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.’ However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher ‘It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.’ George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an ‘urgent case’. His teachers reported that the problem was ‘behaviour in class and at home’. In school, George was described as ‘aggressive…he wanders about instead of getting on with his work…he won't conform…he's like his brother…generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.’ Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was ‘brought in’ in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: ‘I don't think he's any worse than other kids — he's picked on by the school.’ Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling — he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help — I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: ‘I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.’ When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says ‘You've sent me away and don't love me.’ Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. ‘We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.’ The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because ‘I haven't been told.’ The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding — if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this ‘fact’ was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. ‘They see residential school as an alternative to ‘care’ but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.’ The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision ‘they really want to make ’. EP : What I suggest we do — nothing's going to be decided today — I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools — at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon ‘professional judgement’. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby ‘a more stable home situation’ was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the ‘named person’. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: ‘We didn't ask for it [the assessment]— it was the education system who said it should be done — if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.’ Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: ‘It introduces so much trauma — you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.’ Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. ‘It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.’ Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive ‘because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope’. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was ‘No way am I going to agree with that.’ On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her ‘rights’ under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a ‘chance to fail’. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. ‘It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities’(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of ‘disclosure’ and ‘involvement’to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of ‘partnership’ and ‘involvement’. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned ‘with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals’(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of ‘need’ is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of ‘special educational need’. ‘Need’ was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the ‘rights’ parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

ACA ACA-CTY-002 1.32 "Marxism and the question of history Marxist literary criticism has not produced a new theory in over twenty years. Not since Macherey's A Theory of Literary Production of 1966 has there been any fundamental theoretical innovation. This date and this gap are by no means fortuitous. For much of this century Marxist literary criticism monopolized the realm of literary theory, for the simple reason that only Marxists consistently believed in its value and strategic necessity. 2 But since the rise of structuralism in the sixties Marxist criticism has been more and more on the defensive. Marxist humanists still often consider structuralism simply as an attack on Marxism; this theory would be more persuasive if so many structuralists had not also been Marxists. By contrast, it is certainly the case that, with certain notable exceptions, there are few Marxist poststructuralists. If by the late seventies the intellectual arguments of poststructuralism began to seem virtually unanswerable, resistance eventually crystallized around the question of history. In its preoccupation with textuality, poststructuralism had apparently forgotten all about it. The earliest such critique in the field of literary theory was that of Frank Lentricchia, who organized his entire account of modern criticism around the premise of a ‘repeated and extremely subtle denial of history by a variety of contemporary theorists’. Lentricchia's argument was quickly endorsed by Terry Eagleton who claimed first that poststructuralism represented a ‘hedonist withdrawal from history’(aestheticism) and, a year later, that it amounted to a more menacing holocaust-like ‘liquidation of history’. Moving beyond the confines of the literary, perry Anderson has similarly dismissed all poststructuralism on the grounds that it represents ‘the randomisation of history ’. But what, we might pause to ask, is this remark supposed to suggest? Is Anderson using the word ‘random’ in its mathematical sense, as one out of a series, or in its statistical sense in which each item has an individual chance? It seems not. More likely he is using it in the more everyday usage of ‘not sent or guided in any special direction; having no definite aim or purpose’(OED), which suggests that any such view of history must have no end, and therefore no teleology. In other words, what  we are really dealing with here is a defence of a belief in the rationality of the historical process. Anderson's history must work according to a rational principle, the dialectic, and be moving towards an end which will reveal and enact its meaning. Without such a purpose, it is assumed, history must be meaningless. The terms of this argument repeat exactly those of the critical debate about univocal meaning, according to which the only alternative to the idea that history has a single meaning must be that it has none at all. But of course no one has really been suggesting that history has no meaning, for the obvious reason that any interpretation of history as such must ipso facto assert meaning. What is in dispute is whether history has a meaning as ‘History’. One alternative would be that history may be made up of the multiple meanings of specific, particular histories — without their necessarily being in turn part of a larger meaning of an underlying Idea or force. Anderson's accusation, which conflates the concept of the differential with the notion of the random, is therefore really directed against the possibility that different histories may have different meanings. But why deny that history can have multiple meanings? De facto , it already has — for even for a Marxist who believes in the possibility of ‘science’ there exists the multiplicity of meanings of truth and of error. We are therefore not so much talking about a single meaning as a true one versus all the others which are false. In a similar way, even ‘History’ as a metahistorical category achieves its single meaning by subsuming a range of ethico-political concepts, such as‘progress’, ‘human freedom’, ‘necessity’and the like, which then form the basis of the regulation and authorization of historical interpretation. This shifts the discussion away from any simple antithesis. The question about history then becomes the more interesting one of the relation between different significations, and the ways in which such differences can, or cannot, be articulated and unified under the same horizon of totalization to produce a single meaning. Until the lonely hour arrives in which the philosophical proof of the truth of history is produced, then history will inevitably continue as a representation and interpretation of the past — rather than Marxist truth and the false or limited interpretation of all other historians. As a form of understanding history will necessarily also be subject to the whole range of questions that surround interpretation, representation and narrative in any form. This is the reason why in recent years theorists have turned their attention back to the question of the historicity of historical understanding, to its status as interpretation, representation or narrative, and, more radically, to the problem of temporality as such. Lentricchia and Eagleton, by contrast, invoke history rather like ‘the political’: an outside, a concrete, that somehow remains exterior to ‘theory’, unaffected by it, capable of enclosing it and even swallowing it up — as if history were in a position to consume theory. History here is self-evident and needs no elaboration. We all know what it is (apparently). But the  problem with the idea that it is possible to dismiss structuralism and poststructuralism with the charge that they neglect history is that this argument itself neglects history. For history, as Althusser noted, has always been a problematical concept. Any examination of the history of ‘history, will demonstrate that it has never had the immediate certainty that is implied in the all too frequent invocation of, concrete history’. Far from being the concrete, it has always rather been the theoretical problem. To acknowledge that amounts to something very different from simply excising history as such. Nevertheless the suggestion that structuralism and poststructuralism have denied history is a persuasive one which now has wide currency. Such an argument, in implying that the problem is simply a question of the lack of history or of its presence, as if history were some undifferentiated entity that could just be added or taken away, stepped into or got out of, skates over the fact that the real question has always focused on the much more difficult issue of what kind of history, and of what status can be accorded to historical thought. The reproach that poststructuralism has neglected history really consists of the complaint that it has questioned History. This becomes clearer if it is considered from the more general perspective of post-modernism which has been widely characterized as involving a return of history, albeit as a category of representation. In fact it was rather modernism, as its name implies (from latin modo , just now, or hodie , today), that tried to awake from the nightmare of history, self-consciously setting itself against the past, and rejecting forms of historical understanding. The argument against poststructuralism really just repeats Lukács' reproach, set out in his 1957 essay ‘The Ideology of Modernism’, that modernism involves a ‘negation of history’. If Lukács' objections to modernism laid the basis for all contemporary objections to poststructuralism, his continuing influence can help us to understand why history in particular is privileged here. II ‘IN HISTORY’ For why, after all, ‘history’ at all? Why, from the point of view of Marxism proper, not the class-struggle, or economics, the state, or social relations? The stress on history as paramount provides a straightforward indication as to where such arguments are coming from: not Marxism in general as a political practice, but the Hegelian Marxism of the philosophical tradition initiated by Lukács' History and Class Consciousness (1923). Criticizing the orthodox Marxism which regarded dialectics as an external law validated by natural science, Lukács argued for the primacy of history over economics as the most significant element in the methodology of Marxism. His stress on Marxism as a historical method that presupposed and required the idea of totality initiated a course that determined the history of Western Marxism to our own day. That history, from one perspective, could be seen as a  consistent struggle to retain Lukács' legacy in which history, the dialectic and the totality are interdependent to the extent that each is essential to the operation of the other in the production of a Marxist science. Poststructuralism, which in its own way also takes part in that history of Western Marxism, differs only insofar as it foregrounds the implications of the theoretical difficulties involved rather than repressing them in pursuit of the unrealized ideal. For Lukács' legacy could also be seen to have bequeathed a curse. The insistence on history as a totality, necessary if historical materialism is to justify itself as true, left Marxism with a fragile category that from the very first was always on the point of breaking apart. To characterize only recent French thought as ‘the logic of disintegration’, as Peter Dews has recently done, masks over the fact that such a logic is fundamental to Marxism itself, the unassimilable dark other to its ‘primacy of the category of totality’. Yet if Lukács laid this theoretical burden upon Western Marxism, he had, ironically, already written the narrative of its subsequent history in his earlier, pre-Marxist,Theory of the Novel (1920). In that work it is possible to see clearly the relation between his insistence on totality and the Romantic aesthetic of totality as the inner necessity that moulds all works of art. More significantly, totality is defined in terms of its absence for modern man who exists in a relation of alienation from the world. The novel, according to Lukács, consists of a striving for unity, a lost state of being represented for him as for many German Romantics by an idealized picture of classical Greece, punctuated by the continual intrusion of a heterogeneous discontinuity. Lukács argues that the novel can transcend this threat of dispersal through an assertion of a continuous temporality, but at the same time he formulates the process in the structure of a fall: ‘Once this unity disintegrated, there could be no more spontaneous totality of being’. This account, whose origins in German Romanticism are obviously comparable to Marx's, points to the subsequent difficulty for Marxism itself: the lost ‘spontaneous’ totality of being can never be retrieved. The objections to poststructuralism at one level therefore represent merely the latest version of the Romantic nostalgia for this unfallen totality of being. The history of Western Marxism amounts to a history of attempts to provide a means for transcending the condition of alienation and achieving that lost totality, not through irony or a reified homogeneous temporality, as in Lukács' novel, but, according to his formulation of Marxism, through history and class consciousness. The problem, however, is that that reconstituted totality is never certain, its status always remains ambivalent. The appearance of History and Class Consciousness at the height of the Modernist movement suggests the degree to which history was being totalized by Lukács at the very moment when the process of detotalization had already begun — even in the aporetic possibilities of his own writings. So in The Historical Novel (1937) Lukács himself would reject as delusion what he calls ‘a specially strong temptation to try and produce an extensively complete totality’, advocating instead a dramatic concentration and intensification of, outwardly insignificant events'. Their relation to the totality emerges not through the form of synecdoche — the typical detail which can then be generalized as metaphor — but should, according to Lukács, be drawn out through the narrative which inscribes and extends a connection between such moments of empirical reality and the general laws of history as a totality. Lukács' historicism depends upon the resolution of this tension between the idea of history and the singular detail. But the fundamental incommensurability of idea and event re-emerges in a precariousness in this narrativization of history where each disturbance in the writing punctuates it with the unassimilable, discontinuous and disjunctive temporality of the event. Lukács' early assault on Marxist economism, subsequently retracted under criticism from the Leninist orthodoxy of the Comintern, became particularly influential in the post-war period among Marxist intellectuals who sought to redefine a new Marxist humanism against the economism of Stalinism with which Lukács' name had by that time itself become associated. Most prominent among those was Sartre, who, in the spirit of Lukács, declared that ‘both sociology and economism must be dissolved in History ’. Today when the primacy of history above all else — the economic, even class conflict — is asserted within a Marxist discourse, together with an accompanying defence of humanism, it can usually be traced back to a Marxism of a Sartrean existentialist form. It comes as no surprise, for example, to discover that the argument about poststructuralism neglecting history was initiated by those whose own intellectual formation can be identified with the existential Marxist humanism of the New Left of the 1950s and early 1960s. But the case of Sartre poignantly demonstrates that the return-to-history argument can really only succeed through a form of historical amnesia which conveniently forgets that history was almost impossible to find. Any historical investigation will show that history has always been a problematic concept for Marxism, not something that has the status of a ‘concrete’ existence outside and beyond theory. This could be demonstrated for Lukács or indeed for Marx himself. But in the context of the alleged neglect of history by poststructuralism, it will be more appropriate to confine our discussion to the Marxism of the post-war period. Here too history has always been the problem not the solution — which is why both structuralism and poststructuralism can be positioned within the broad trajectory of a post-war Marxism that has taken the form of a sustained enquiry into concepts of history and even the very possibility of its conceptualization. III THE CRISIS OF STALINISM Sartre's existential Marxism, as Ronald Aronson has recently emphasized, was itself formulated in response to criticisms of the function of history in his work by the untimely post-war ‘post-Marxist’, Maurice Merleau-ponty. In Adventures of the Dialectic (1955), Merleau-Ponty accused the Sartre of The Communists and Peace (1952) of using an existentialist ontology to justify communism ‘as a completely voluntary effort to go beyond, to destroy and to recreate history’: Sartre founds communist action precisely by refusing any productivity to history and by making history, insofar as it is intelligible, the immediate result of our volitions. As for the rest, it is an impenetrable opacity. Through his ‘extreme subjectivism’, Merleau-ponty argued, Sartre avoided the traditional claims of Marxism to be the realization of history — and thus also the problem of the relation of Marxism to Stalinism. With the growing recognition of the real nature of the Stalinist regime, the ideological divisions of pre-war Europe became too simplistic to sustain, and even the attentiste (wait-and-see) attitude taken after the war by many Marxists, including Merleau-Ponty himself in Humanism and Terror (1947), became no longer tenable. Stalinism posed a crisis for Marxism from which it could, in a sense, be said never to have recovered, the conundrum being that if Marxism is true, as it claims that it is, how did the first Marxist state end up as Stalinist? There are basically two positions that can be taken with respect to this irrevocable split between theory and practice: either Marxism has been shown to be not true, or the Marxism of Stalinist Russia was not proper Marxism. The second alternative poses a serious problem, however, insofar as it leads to the further question, how could such Marxism not be true — in the sense of how could History, in the objective processes on which a scientific Marxism places so much faith, be undialectical enough to produce Stalinism from the October Revolution? How could History have failed to bring about an end to history? Merleau-Ponty's response was to argue that history itself had shown Marxist philosophy to have been flawed; such philosophy must therefore give up its claim to truth. Ironically, then, the trajectory which today produces the Marxist argument that poststructuralism neglects history was itself initiated by the claim that Marxism itself had been invalidated by history. In this context, the major challenge for Marxism became how to explain Marxism's ‘detour’ from itself, a question on which Sartre's project was to founder in the second volume of the Critique of Dialectical Reason . It was Stalin's unfortunate deviation which led to the whole series of attempts by Western European Marxists to return-to-Marx — the major examples in France being Sartre and Althusser, and in Germany the Frankfurt School. Merleau-Ponty, on the other hand, arguing that only one Marxism, Stalinism, could be said to be the product of actual history, rejected any possibility of trying to define a new, more genuine Marxism as the return-to-Marxists tried to do. According to Merleau-Ponty, Western academic Marxism, starting with Lukács, amounted only to the production of ‘ideas without historical equivalents’(204). He therefore repudiated any attempt to begin the painful separation of an ‘authentic’ from a ‘false’, orthodox or official Marxism, choosing rather to stress the ambivalence of Marxism itself. For Merleau-Ponty no sublation could resolve Marxism s own division between its theory and the history of its practice, itself, he argued, an acting out of its theoretical equivocation between history as a process of natural necessity and history as the product of human praxis. These conflicts, he contended, although highlighted in the differences between the Western Marxism of Lukács and the orthodoxy of Marxist-Leninism, could be traced back to the work of Marx himself. Merleau-Ponty's argument thus meant acknowledging a certain equivocalness in Marxist claims to truth, which could no longer claim exemption from critical examination, and led inevitably, therefore, to an early form of what, even then, was characterized as ‘post-Marxism’. Merleau-ponty, whose anticipations of later post-Marxists such as Foucault and Lyotard are readily apparent, therefore rejected not the dialectic as such, nor history, but the closed dialectic as an autonomous principle that was supposed to produce the grand narrative of History: The illusion was only to precipitate into a historical fact — the proletariat's birth and growth — history's total meaning, to believe that history itself organized its own recovery, that the proletariat's power would be its own suppression, the negation of the negation. (205) In a provocative comparison of the failures of the French and Russian revolutions, he argued that the problem stemmed from the fact that no class, whether proletarian or bourgeoisie, can become the ruling class without taking upon itself something of the historical role of a ruling class — especially if at the same time it also considers that, history carries within itself its own cure': To assume that the proletariat will be able to defend its dictatorship against entanglement is to assume in history itself a substantial and given principle which would drive ambiguity from it, sum it up, totalise it, and close it. (221) Instead, Merleau-Ponty proposed an open dialectic which would concede Marxism's equivocalness, and give up the claim to the dialectical logic of History as a process of objective truth. Or to put it another way, he maintained that Marxism can only constitute its totality through its perpetual detours from itself."
ACA ACA-ECV-005 1.16 "5 The Philosopher's Child Judith Hughes SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING Children have served philosophy very well. That is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice. Along with a selection from a list including women, animals, madmen, foreigners, slaves, patients and imbeciles, children have served in that great class of beings, the ‘not-men’, in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves. Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention. They have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood. Generations of philosophers have documented this process. Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come. Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood, boyhood and youth. That is the second thing to notice; the philosopher's children are boys. The fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, no doubt, the reasons for this were largely social. But the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice, though many might think this real and bad enough. Education has an end. Although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘for its own sake’, what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be. Where the end is  person- rather than role-oriented — that is, where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of, say, information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve. Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them. The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter. Education has been directed at the production of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, in short, the autonomous human being. Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species. Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all. The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others. It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy. Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction. This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself. It is also about children. WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children? There are, of course, the familiar and obvious reasons  connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too. When philosophers dismiss women as ‘not-men’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics. Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep. It would be well to know just what this entails. Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like. A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women, they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality, capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics. We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous? Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive. It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children. Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience? What is it to be treated as a child? Women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves. It is no accident that the liberation of women, such as it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general; liberation for one part of the ‘not-men’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you. The assumption that all groups in the ‘not-men’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children. ‘That's what they used to say about women’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false. But it should make us very suspicious. That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all, but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill's famous disclaimer in his essay On Liberty . Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection, Mill (1910) asserts: this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the  maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. (p.73) This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings. The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational. If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children. I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place. Partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘children’ covers such a wide range of potential images, I shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society. She is the child of this paper unless I indicate otherwise. Throughout we should ask ourselves, does this (whatever is being said) apply to her ? First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past. One thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults; in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have. NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18…. the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty; the woman has but its authority is imperfect; so has the child, but in this case it is immature. (Aristotle, 1959,1260A) Children…are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained the use of speech but are called Reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. (Hobbes, 1914, p. 21) [Children]…love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined…[by which]… I mean, that you should  make them sensible by the Mildness of your carriage, and the composure even in your correction of them, that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them. (Locke, 1968, p. 181) In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done. Young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are, or they get puzzled and ask question after question. But as we approach the age of youth reason appears. At what age ought the education for youth to begin? Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect… The youth…is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement. (Kant, 1930, pp. 250–1) If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences. (Mill, 1910, p. 139) What are the philosophers' children like? They have an ‘immature’ deliberative faculty (Aristotle), are not ‘endued with Reason’(Hobbes), until roughly the age of 10 (Kant) and are ‘incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives’(Mill). But they are not completely lost causes. The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the ‘possibility apparent’ of turning into rational beings (Hobbes); they love to be treated as though they were rational though they are not so yet (Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles (Kant). Until the time when these things happen then Mill's disclaimer comes into operation. Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions. The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; that is, on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals. It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both. In either case, the political implication is that denying rights  to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests. In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection. Beyond that, the similarities seem remote. There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle. Apart from being false, such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states. The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational, non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill. Children, according to Hobbes, have the ‘possibility apparent’ of becoming reasonable. In what does the possibility consist? Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the ‘possibility apparent’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones. But what? Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have. It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child. Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others. But then, either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘intelligently’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals. In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it. Locke's remarks are just as puzzling. Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were. How is this possible? Apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is. Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice? Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes; I must at least say something. Is it just that I talk to them that they love? Maybe, but I can also, if I like, talk to my car, but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational. Lockean children have the added  amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves, while Kantian kids, two stages back from rationality, have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions. Mill's minors are a little more complicated. Part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree. But in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions. Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene. All in all, it is a pretty unconvincing picture. If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are. If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults. Hobbes et al . are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why, often in the same sentence, they produce these contradictions. The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery. ILLEGITIMATE INFERENCES The recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot, therefore, be denied it on any account. We should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left, the pederast lobby or children themselves. It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought. In Escape from Childhood (1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be. He sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children's needs, and an oppressive invention at that. He suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote, to manage their own financial affairs, to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and  to make and enter into, on a basis of mutual consent, quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms. Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience. He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years, and remarks: We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add. Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible? (Harris, 1982, p. 49) Now Holt and Harris both have many wise, enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children, but as these remarks show, putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter. Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions. What, we may ask Holt, happens to the child who, dissatisfied at home, seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him? What if no one wants him? Our papers are currently full of ‘hard-to-place’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents. In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others. What, we may ask Harris, happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination? To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination. He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults. These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise. In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here. Suppose Holt's 6-year-old does opt out of school? What happens to her then? What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her? Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead? However much she may enjoy such pursuits, there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied. Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her, who will? His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide. Holt's child is actually the Artful Dodger; mercifully, not all children are. There are other difficulties too. It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to, but Holt clearly does not. He proposes that ‘the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them’(Holt, 1974, p. 15). If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children, then he is mistaken. The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them. He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties, but he cannot forgo them. They are not just available to him, they are his. That is what being a citizen involves. Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children. Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them. But the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities. Failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral; failure to carry out one's duties is not. It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens. Children still would not have full political status. Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen; they are an integral part of being a citizen. Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities  and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark: I do not say, either, that these rights and duties should be tied into one package, that if a young person wants to assume any of them, he must assume them all. He should be able to pick and choose. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) If he can ‘pick and choose’, I suggest, he is not a citizen, he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option. Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem. They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all. Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness. WHEN IN DOUBT, GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense. That it is firmly tied must be correct; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information. Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it. Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the Politics which I quoted earlier; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority. What did he mean? What he did not mean is that women lack rationality; they can and do deliberate. At first sight what he seems to be saying is simply that no one is going to take any notice of the conclusions which a rational woman reaches after deliberation. On further reflection, I think this is exactly what he is saying, and its significance is immense. His  view is that the judgements which women make have no standing. Keeping to the domestic front for the moment, what this means is that the conclusions which women reach, no matter how carefully and intelligently they are worked out, can never have the status of decisions. You cannot decide, though you may desire, to divorce your husband if the law does not allow; you cannot order the wine if only his signature makes the order legitimate. And your inability to decide or to order has nothing to do with your mental powers. But Aristotle is not just making a sociological point about what is and is not permitted to women in his society. His remark goes deeper than that. It refers not to power but to authority, and what I think he means is that although a woman can make good and wise judgements, she cannot be the arbiter of that goodness or wisdom. For that she needs the ratification of men, and that is enough to conclude that her judgements lack authority. Now that is quite different from saying that women always make bad judgements, that is to say, that they suffer from some deficiency of rationality. Aristotle only produces spurious suggestions about a woman's incapacity to think or to stick to principles when he is obliged to say something about why their judgements lack authority. It then looks as though the argument runs: (1) Women lack some moral or cognitive capacity therefore (2) Women (must) lack authority. In truth this version is the argument on its head; its real form is: (1) Women lack authority therefore (2) Women (must) lack some moral or cognitive capacity. The important point here is that Aristotle's women are not autonomous, not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority; that is, their right to make decisions, to speak for themselves is not acknowledged. This acknowledgement is absolutely essential, for without it no mental act which they perform, however well, will count as a decision at all. The point I am making here is based on an observation by Stanley Cavell (1979, p. 460) and repeated by him in many contexts: ‘a human being could not fail to know, confronting me, that I am a human being’. Why not? Because to see someone is to see them as a human being and to see them as a human being is to acknowledge them as such. This acknowledgement is not derived from a prior knowledge of facts, rather it is a precondition of there being any  facts. We do not, on the Cavell model, first discover certain truths about an object and then conclude that it is a person; we first acknowledge the person and only inquire into facts later if necessary. The point was put graphically by my colleague, Ian Ground. Faced with a row of objects we do not, he said, lampooning Wittgenstein, perform appropriately by pointing to one after the other saying that's a tree, that's a tree, that's a man, that's a tree. Rather we will say (pointing) that's a tree,(pointing) that's a tree,(waving) hello!(pointing) that's a tree. What makes us greet the man is not an albeit swift chain of inference, it is his presence which commands the acknowledgement while the presence of the tree does no such thing. Of course, if the man is clearly carved from stone then pointing is in order, and if we subsequently discover that ‘he’ is an inflatable rubber doll we are suitably embarrassed. But we are embarrassed because we got it wrong when usually we do not. In our viewing of the other we see ourselves being viewed; the recognition is mutual. How then is it possible to withhold acknowledgement? Cavell's answer is that it is not. There is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being. In a poignant discussion of the hypothesis that Southern slave owners did not see their slaves as human beings he disagrees: When he wants to be served at table by a black hand, he would not be satisfied to be served by a black paw… Everything in his relation to his slaves shows that he treats them as more or less human — his humiliations of them, his disappointments, his jealousies, his fears, his punishments, his attachments. (Cavell, 1979, p. 376) Treating people as if they were not people is not a possibility; to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster, but it always breaks down. What is possible is to treat people as more or less human. We can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts. This may not be downright evil, but in the absence of potential disbarments (like possibly being a rubber doll) it requires a considerable amount of bad faith. It is very hard to do. This is what Aristotle appears to do to his women. They are human, and are acknowledged to be, they can think but they are not to be acknowledged as authoritative, and if their presence demands such  acknowledgement, they are bad women who should have been taught to hide or repress such demands. Rousseau's blueprint for the education of Sophie is directed at this end, and if it is truly successful, she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement. Then she has been infantilised and she is no longer autonomous. But Rousseau's blueprint contains its own contradiction. If you need to teach people or compel them in some other way to repress their natural demand for acknowledgement as rational, competent, authoritative human beings then you have no answer to the charge of some malefaction between bad faith and dreadful wickedness. Is this unfair to children? When we deny autonomy to our 10-year-old, are we too guilty of bad faith? What reason could we produce to allow that she may have the capacity to act autonomously while denying her the capacity-to-act-autonomously? Whatever it is we should first notice that while the capacity to act autonomously is construed as a psychological capacity, the capacity-to-act-autonomously is not. It is a social capacity which depends upon the acknowledgement of others. What we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust; we have to ask, does her being demand it. CARRYING THE CAN To do this we need to consider another element in the picture of autonomy which was so meticulously side-stepped by Holt. That is, the matter of responsibility. In Freedom and Resentment (1974, p. 19) Strawson talks not of a child's emerging autonomy but of ‘the progressive emergence of the child as a responsible being’. Responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lip-service is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children. I believe it to be central. In his essay, ‘In Defense of Anarchism’(1970), R. P. Wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy. He argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to take responsibility for those actions. To take responsibility is to accept the duty of deciding for oneself what is right. A man, Wolff argues, can forfeit his autonomy by not  taking the responsibility on himself; by, for example, obeying commands blindly; but he cannot abnegate the responsibility which the possibility of choice confers upon him. Since being autonomous includes both freedom of choice and the capacity to reason about those choices, the impairment of either is a bar to autonomy. Against this background he makes two remarks about children: It is quite appropriate that moral philosophers should group together children and madmen as beings not fully responsible for their actions, for as madmen are thought to lack freedom of choice, so children do not yet possess the power of reason in a developed form. It is even just that we should assign a greater degree of responsibility to children, for madmen, by virtue of their lack of free will, are completely without responsibility, while children, insofar as they possess reason in a partially developed form, can be held responsible (i.e. can be required to take responsibility) to a corresponding degree. (Wolff, 1970, pp. 12–13) All men refuse to take responsibility for their actions at some time or other during their lives, and some men so consistently shirk their duty that they present more the appearance of overgrown children than of adults. (Ibid., p. 14) There is a striking similarity between Wolff's way of talking about children and the views we saw put forward by Hobbes, Locke and Kant. Wolff begins with the assurance that children are not rational and then immediately back-pedals to say that actually they are, partially at least. Four paragraphs later where the second quotation appears, the child is not unable to take responsibility but is refusing to take it. She is not an incompetent but a degenerate. Having denied that she is incompetent, I am certainly not going to concede that the only alternative is to make her a degenerate; there must be another choice available. What is missing from Wolff's analysis, though it is present in his terminology, is the recognition of the public face, the mutuality of responsibility. He talks of assigning responsibility to children,holding them responsible,requiring them to take responsibility and these are natural ways of speaking. What they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason; now a third party is present and is an  active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role. People are not only responsible for something, they are responsible to God, other individuals, society or themselves, and this latter Kantian notion is derived from the primary social context in which it makes sense for the concept of responsibility to be invoked. This is just what I was claiming for authority. To say either that someone acts authoritatively or that someone is responsible for his actions may depend upon the possibility of ascribing mental states or capacities but neither is merely a shorthand way of ascribing them. In the case of the fully autonomous person, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. The capacity-to-act-autonomously is the coming together of the two. If both or either is impaired then so is this capacity, and both depend upon the psychological capacities of the agent plus the recognition of other members of the moral and political community. This raises a difficulty. PASSING THE BUCK The problem here seems to be this: am I saying that a child is responsible if and only if we declare her to be so, given that she knows what she is doing? This view has some historical clout. Given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions. Children were still being imprisoned and deported when Mill wrote that disclaimer. Is it then just a matter of fashion, of the times in which we live? Not entirely; to begin with we might take a pragmatic line in the light of new knowledge about the long-term effects of such treatment on a child's subsequent development. We might argue that while we can hold her responsible, the consequences of so doing turn out to be unacceptable. But the horror which writers such as Dickens expressed at the cruelty of his times was prompted by no such knowledge. Dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up at all. What Dickens saw was what most of us see, the inhumanity of treating a child in certain ways. In what does the inhumanity consist? Not just in harsh action; increased concern about children is almost always part of a larger concern about people in general, but when horrible things are happening to people it is not unusual to focus on children and try special pleading on their behalf. This special pleading is, no doubt, partly emotional but it might very well include reference to  children's lack of knowledge and understanding. Yet the inhumanity does not consist in the ascription of certain cognitive states either. We may be quite right to ascribe agency to a child for his acts. The inhumanity seems to lie in allowing the full weight of responsibility to fall on the child. Responsibility is not only about agency. ‘When we say a person is responsible for what he does we mean not just that he was the agent…we also say that the act reflects (back) on the agent,’ writes David Wood (1973, p. 191). How much reflecting goes on depends upon the reflective capabilities of the child and also on the strength and direction of the beam which we, the adults, determine. Perhaps now we can take Mill's insight on board without opening ourselves to the charge of arbitrariness. Mill wanted to protect children against the harm which they might do themselves. The problem which was supposed to bring liberal theory crashing to the ground was that we do not wish to justify interfering with adult liberties on these grounds. It may be that what we are protecting children from is not so much the awful consequences of their ignorant decisions but of the burden of responsibility for those decisions which children are not yet ready to bear and which, for entirely non-political reasons, we cannot choose to impose upon them. If giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a one-person game, then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but I have already argued that they are not and could not be. We can only play at ascribing responsibility outside this mutual interaction; making the horse a senator, blaming the toy which the child trips over are games which do not fool the horse or the toy. Growing up, maturing, emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly. Respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it. We leave unhappy teenagers who ‘don't want to talk about it’ alone; the tearful 5-year-old comes and dumps the problem in your lap. In between, we say, we ‘play it by ear’ and what we listen for is the child's own claim to have its decisions treated as authoritative and to be ready to bear the responsibility. This claim is not a conscious, spoken claim; if it gets to that stage, we have already left it too late. The claim is implicit in the child's own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we  can do no other than acknowledge it. But neither can we impose it. Holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible; we may succeed in the former, without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter. Now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that I have still, therefore, failed to distinguish them from children. However, there is a difference. With children, the presupposition is that we take the responsibility until they show us that they want it; with adults we assume that they take the responsibility unless they show us that they don't. (We are surprised when the ‘man’ turns out to be a robot.) That is what membership of the moral and political community is, and it is a serious business which deserves more attention than I can give here. It is quite correct that children's application for membership should be taken seriously; once accepted there is no turning back, resignation is not an option. To end, a word about voting. Voting is not just a matter of knowing how to put a cross on a piece of paper, nor of having a rough or even quite refined view of the policies of the major political parties. It also, in a democracy, involves being responsible to some degree for the society which we have. Maybe ‘I didn't vote Tory’, but even that does not enable me to opt out of that responsibility entirely. Why else would I buy the sticker? Let us ask our 10-year-old's mother if her daughter is ready to take that responsibility. What would she say? Perhaps that, yes, her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable; yes, she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions. Also, perhaps, that sometimes at night, she finds her crying for the starving of Africa or unable to sleep with the terror of the possibility of nuclear war or desperately seeking a denial of the reality of the horror of the Holocaust. Perhaps she would be angry if, by trying to impose responsibility on her daughter by giving her the vote, we were also taking from her the only comfort which she has, namely that when she is older she will change all that. Or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready; she would be right. Denying the vote to children is not based on some false assumption about 10-year-olds' political knowledge, nor to deny that they have interests, nor to protect them from the harm their votes might do. It is to take responsibility to ourselves for the way the world is. And that really does belong to us."
ACA ACA-EW1-001 1.26 "Revival under Law, 1911–1914 Few contemporaries would have expected Balfour's retirement to lead to a Unionist recovery. The party was in a mutinous condition in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of Balfour's political gifts. Nor was it clear that Balfour's departure was universally desired: at the National Union Conference a few days later, Leo Maxse was booed off the platform, and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting Balfour's decision. A great many crocodile tears were shed, for, since Unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership, they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office. The shock caused by Balfour's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late. The main contenders for the leadership were Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long, representing the two different establishments of the Edwardian Unionist party — the opposite worlds of Birmingham and Wiltshire — but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders, Edward Carson and Andrew Bonar Law. Two strong groups emerged behind Long and Chamberlain, about equal in numbers, but there were few backers for Carson or Law. Carson thereupon fell out of the contest — or rather announced that he was not standing, for no official nominations had been made. The party officers and Whips were solidly behind Chamberlain, but Law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and, urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken, he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow Long to win. Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist (as was Lansdowne, who led the Unionists in the Lords) and that he had not been entirely loyal to Balfour since the referendum pledge. Long was supported by the bulk of the English county members but by few of the party's men of talent. By the morning of Friday 10 November it was clear that neither Chamberlain nor Long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other. A party meeting was to be held on the following Monday and the Whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken. Chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to Balcarres that both he and Long should withdraw and so allow Law to be elected unanimously; he also turned down  Balcarres's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would make such a mess of things that Chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year. Faced with Chamberlain's proposition, and without a majority of his own, Long had no option but to agree. Bonar Law, backed by fewer MPs than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice. Robert Sanders reported the ""election"" meeting on 13 November with evident satisfaction: The Carlton meeting on Monday went off quite admirably. Harry Chaplin in the chair a very great success. A good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement. Walter Long proposed Bonar Law. His speech was one of the best things I have heard. Manly and rather touching. The country gentleman at his best. He spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot. Austen followed. When Austen sat down Chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so. A clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well. Motion carried unanimously. Bonar Law then sent for… His speech struck me as the feeblest of the day. He was evidently moved and nervous. The meeting separated in great content with the Conservative Party all round. It was certainly creditable. The urgency of the events following Balfour's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the National Union Conference. So within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues, Law's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at Leeds; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future. In 1911 Law was known — in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party — as a spirited debater. A.). P. Taylor has noted that Law was trained, if he was trained for anything in his early career, to be a debater. In Glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the Oxford Union or at the Bar, but skills that were very different in appearance. His concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style; he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words. (When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this practice caused consternation at the Treasury, when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures.) As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands. In parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made; the speeches that appear in Hansard were touched up by his staff, and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance. In debate he was a formidable opponent, and one that Asquith was never able to master, for all his forensic skills. Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude  or direct if the situation demanded it. In the long debates over Marconi in 1913 and over the Curragh ""mutiny"" in 1914 Law was able to nail Asquith's evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled. Occasionally, in the onrush of pursuit, he gave commitments that were later regretted, but these were a small price to pay. The Unionist recovery was built around Law's leadership, but what Asquith called the ""new style"" of obstruction, threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with Law. The beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the Parliament Bill. It was in June 1911 that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the House of Commons, led by Lord Hugh Cecil. In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent as any that Law was to use later, and in the crucial decision on the House of Lords Law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers. Ulster's opposition to Home Rule long pre-dated Law's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on Irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader. Before he succeeded Balfour then, Law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership; his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes, to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party. Law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from Balfour: he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where Balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint. Their respective positions explain this in part: as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right, Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party; as the tertium quid in the recent contest, Law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view. His strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels, to articulate their views, and to create unity from the sense of movement. In his characteristic phrase, ""I am their leader, I must follow them"" — but he determined to follow them from the front. As a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot, when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots. Much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism, extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come, but used in the cause of more limited objectives. He certainly held deep convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the Liberal policies that he opposed, but at least a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion, a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end. So in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard. In private conversation he told Asquith""I am afraid that I shall have to show myself very vicious Mr Asquith this session. I hope you will understand."" In later conversations about Ulster, Law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the Unionists. There was then an  open toughness about party tactics; before the Buckingham Palace Conference in 1914 he had Central Office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine, six or four counties of Ulster from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot. From the party viewpoint Law's methods were successful but dangerous; expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise, and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power. The basis of recovery was then Law's fighting capacities as leader. In parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise Unionist morale. Improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament, all linked to the issue of Ulster, and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election, an election that would make or break the Union, the Empire and Law's leadership of the party. All was linked to the sense of a new departure, a ""new style"" , a ""new regime in politics"" and a new team at the helm: as well as a new leader, the party had by the middle of 1912 a new Chief Whip, Party Chairman, party treasurer, principal agent, press adviser, and an almost entirely new team of Whips and organizers. Party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party's control. No general election was fought by the organization set up after 1911, but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913. The space available to Central Office was increased by the acquisition of St Stephen's House as well as St Stephen's Chambers, which had been occupied since 1874; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone. The quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists. John Boraston took over as Principal Agent in 1912, having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the Liberal Unionist Council. He joined William Jenkins, appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the Midlands Liberal Unionists. The party was indeed handed over to Birmingham. Finally, Malcolm Fraser, ex-editor of the Standard and of the Daily Express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of £1,200. Steel-Maitland, Boraston, Jenkins and Fraser made up a team of experts, all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office; the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board. The influence of Central Office toned up the rest of the organization. A new canvass system was introduced in 1911 so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level. This was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly Unionist. In 1914 a register of car owners was  compiled, also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days. By November 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in Great Britain were without candidates, a much better position than the position at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910; few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable, but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of 1913. A programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by 1913, with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect. The financial mismanagement that had reigned before 1911 was ended with the employment of professional accountants. Expenditure on Central Office, district offices and the London office doubled from £32,466 in 1909–10 to $68,957 in 1913–14; the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from $73,000 to over £150,000. To pay for this outpouring, a great drive was mounted for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland. In 1912 ordinary subscriptions still brought in only £12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed. The method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income, and both Balfour and Law were used to raise the wind. Steel-Maitland told Balfour that""Farquhar and I are endeavouring to raise more money. I think we are likely to succeed — thanks in part to the very generous example set by Lord Rothschild. But I would b, e very glad if I might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases. Systematic collections were made from peers and from the City; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 — twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years""expenditure — and there was a special cash deposit of £120,000 for the coming election. In three other areas, as much political as organizational, advances were made towards the management of the press, the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party, and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties. Under Malcolm Fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in Fleet Street. It had been recognized that Liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices, as Sandars had reported in 1909: I told Northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our Central Office, he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the Radical contingent, but that I realized that from the Press point of view, no doubt, our speakers did not play up to the reporters by handing them their speeches in advance, and by other tricks of the kind to which the Radical orators have recourse. This was the essence of the problem: the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search for news. The UOC found that""it is patent that some feeling exists among the Unionist Press that, while in the past they have done much for the Party, the Party has not assisted in their work. In  many quarters it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated with greater courtesy by the Radicals than by their own side."" Fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to Law in 1913 that""the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your Wallsend speech on October 29th. The verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places such as Aberdeen at one o ""clock in the morning of the 30th.""  He went on to quote the response that had been received from editors: Manchester Dispatch: I hope you will continue this form of enterprise. You fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night… Daily Express: I am much obliged to you for the precis of Mr Bonar Law's speech last night. It was a great help to us. The speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the Post Office — which is usual in these cases — that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition. So in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party, much was achieved merely by employing a specialist. The other side of press management, depending on informal contacts, is less easy to assess. In 1911 Steel-Maitland invited Blumenfeld of the Daily Express to Central Office for a two-way exchange of ideas and advice. He also used Law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with Fraser, as with Marlowe of the Daily Mail, and Law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the Unionist editors, J. L. Garvin of the Observer. Law personally conducted the negotiations with Gardner Sinclair over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1914; this negotiation also demonstrates that, as well as producing information and nursing editors, the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business. Sinclair did buy the Observer and the Pall Mall in the end, but not before he had been given a $45,000 guarantee from party funds. Such investments had a double purpose, for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus. One such scheme involved the purchase of the Daily Express by Max Aitken with party funds, but the party was also propping up the Globe, the Standard, and a wide range of provincial dailies. All these transactions were secret, for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party. The papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital. It was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced. Sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain Unionist, but Steel-Maitland doubted if such a promise had any value. The later history of the Daily Express suggests not: when the Express became hostile in the 1920s, Younger raged ""when I think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil"" . The justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost  of any real alternative. The support for the Express in 1912""provides for the introduction of £50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the Party possesses in London, and no less a sum than $700,000 to £1, 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the Daily Express were allowed to go. The struggle therefore went on to keep the Unionist press alive, and in 1912 and 1913 both Aitken and Northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers. The coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease. The National Union was merged with Central Office in 1911 and fusion with the Liberal Unionists followed in 1912. Joseph Chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by Austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the Liberal Unionist Council to merge. To cater for all susceptibilities, the party became the ""National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations"" — a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves Conservative, but the name ""Liberal"" was at last dropped. The Liberal Unionists were admitted to the Carlton Club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated. This was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done: Liberal Unionists who had resisted amalgamation under Balfour and Acland-Hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under Law and Steel-Maitland in 1912. Other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the Central Office orbit. So in 1911 Steel-Maitland offered to join the Halsbury Club in order to guide it on to safer lines — and was immediately accused of disloyalty by Walter Long. Long helped though by placing both Steel-Maitland and Boraston on the Executive Committee of the Union Defence League for the same purpose. Steel-Maitland also explained to Lord Robert Cecil that ""it has been arranged that the National Conservative Union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations, such as the Tariff Reform League, the Anti-Socialist Union, the Primrose League, the London Municipal Society etc.""  The Central Office attitude was flexible, for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of: They represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization, or the CCO was not enterprising enough to suit them. But some caution should be observed. It may be wise, while retaining or regaining control, to trade under different names. In some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained, in others full responsibility may be avoided. With open allies like the Primrose League, the case for collaboration was strong; for the first time in thirty years of existence the Primrose League formally linked itself with the party in 1914. On the other hand, the independence of the Tariff Reform League was a positive advantage: after January 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme, so that Central Office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the TRL without compromising party policy. In general, efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the  patient building up of contacts, although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of Central Office had removed their justification for existence. It was the First World War that finally killed off the ""legion of Leagues"" , but it had ceased to be a problem before 1914. Modernization at the local level was also a matter of patience: The difficulty of all this work is trebled through the face that the Office cannot say ""go and he goes, and come and he comes"" as in a factory. It is always ""by your leave and if you please"" , and the influence in controlling, which might be very great…is only exerted through position, knowledge and willingness to help."" Steel-Maitland's method was the systematic collection of information by the Central Office district agents in constituency books that recorded all income, expenditure and political activity. The National Union and the Whips were used when necessary to exert pressure for reform, but the main influence was the Central Office agents: I propose to make proper local centres of the Central Office Agents. If they are to get full influence for the purpose of bringing constituencies up to the mark, they can only get it by being the channels for help. I propose therefore that speakers in a locality should be supplied by the Agent in charge of it; and that grants of literature and money to organizations be made through them. By 1913–14, over £25,000 was being given away in this manner and in return the Central Office agents were able to ensure the appointment of suitable constituency agents and the choice of good candidate The outlay constituted only about a tenth of the whole of the local parties""expenditure, but a much higher proportion of the expenditure of the backward parties most in need of reform. The First World""War interrupted the process, but it is clear that much had been done by 1914. In the political world there were issues that Unionists could always exploit against a Liberal government such as defence policy and the administration of the Empire. The threatening international situation gave new impetus to demands for a larger navy and a conscript army, both taken up by Unionists. The National Service League ran the campaign for conscription and the Navy League the campaign for faster naval building, but both were led by known Unionists. In 1912 the Conference gave its support and condemned""the criminal failure of H.M. Ministers to maintain the British Navy and the British Army at a standard of strength adequate to National and Imperial needs"". In the following year an even stronger resolution on the navy was passed unanimously, but a resolution calling for national service was conveniently not reached at the end of the order paper; there was an undoubted commitment to a stronger army and navy but some doubt about the wisdom of a party commitment to conscription In peacetime. In any case, all this helped to prepare for the militarist attitude that the party was to take when war came, when it could advocate conscription without any fear of the electoral consequences. Individual Unionists pursued the defence issues even  more strongly than the leaders. Lord Charles Beresford continued his campaign against the Admiralty that had originated in his personal feud with Admiral Fisher, and he made the most of Churchill's unhappy relations with his admirals. The Morning Post joined in when the First Sea Lord, Sir Francis Bridgeman, resigned in 1912 and Bonar Law took up the issue too, suggesting that Bridgeman had been ""brutally ill-used"" by Churchill. The Secretary of State for War, John Seely, was also a favourite target, for he too was a renegade Unionist. In 1913 he came under pressure in the Commons for his failure to promote an air force; Samuel Hoare demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the government's policy by visiting the air bases to see them for himself. Unionists had easy openings on defence issues, for many Unionist MPs were ex-officers, but the experience of the country in the first two years of War suggests that their criticisms were not exaggerated. Defence was linked in the Unionist mind with imperial consolidation through tariffs: the new policy of 1901–2 had followed directly from the military weakness revealed by the Boer War and the approach of probable European conflict reinforced the same cause. The tariff reform camp had a bonus in 1911 from events in Canada: Laurier's Liberal government had negotiated a Reciprocity Agreement with the United States that cut across all of the arguments for imperial preference. Liberals saw this as evidence that the dominions were more interested in going their own way, but Unionists retorted that Canada like Britain had been led astray by a radical government and that Canada's decision was the result of Britain's failure to offer preference. Unionists were therefore beside themselves with joy when the Canadian electorate removed Laurier from office in September 1911 and replaced him with a Conservative, Sir Robert Borden, who now repudiated reciprocity. Unionist associations passed resolutions of support and the Unionist press hailed Borden as the hero who had saved the empire. This boost did much to wipe out the effect of Balfour's referendum pledge, which had been made a month before the Reciprocity Agreement and was erroneously believed to be its cause. It was now of the utmost importance for the Unionists to clarify their own position; Balfour's pledge had been a conditional one and was not in any case binding on his successor, but the unpopularity of food taxes remained. The shadow cabinet decided in April 1912 that it would abandon the referendum idea and return to the full tariff policy. The decision was not an easy one and was criticized by many who feared the consequences, as Salisbury told Law: ""If it may be said to have finally made possible the destruction of the constitution, the prostitution of the Prerogative, the Repeal of the Union and the Disendowment of the Welsh Church, it will probably rank as the most costly policy in history.""  Salisbury was supported in his attitude by his brothers, by Curzon and by Selborne; he would certainly be supported by Derby and by the weight of opinion on Lancashire. The shadow cabinet therefore took its decision in the clear knowledge that it would have a fight on  its hands, but it did so with the support of Lansdowne and Law. Replying to Salisbury, Law urged the positive side of the tariff policy for the economy and the danger of a party split if the referendum were not repudiated; there was a minority of free-traders, but there was also a vociferous majority of tariff reformers. The real reason though went deeper than tactical manoeuvring: I really believe, and it is here I think that I differ from your that there is a great deal in Tariff Reform; and I believe also that there is a great deal even in the food part of it. I do not now allude to preference though of course that comes first. In fact my real belief is that in the troubles ahead of us connected with labour we are moving very fast in the direction of revolution; and though you will consider my hope a baseless one I still entertain it — that it is by Tariff Reform that we might, so to speak, get the train at least shifted on to other lines. These two motivations are worth considering on their merits, for they reveal Bonar Law as a thinker of some insight. The imperial preference aspect was important because it might arrest the trends pulling the Empire apart; reciprocity had shown the danger and there was little time left to halt the slide. In retrospect it may seem that the trend was already irresistible — the First World War certainly made it so — but who is to say that a positive imperial policy pursued energetically in 1902 or 1912 was inevitably doomed to failure? This was the pure gospel of Joseph Chamberlain, especially real to Law because of his Canadian connections, but the real significance of the decision was felt by few in Britain, even on the Unionist side. We can at least now see how important a policy it might have been, how great a shift in the tides of history that it was attempting. In the domestic sphere the policy was equally fundamental, for tariff reform was seen as the antithesis of socialism. The Bismarckian social policy implied by tariffs, the success of the policy in places like Birmingham where it was properly advocated, and its attraction to social engineers like the early Fabians, all lend a certain plausibility to the idea. If something drastic were not done, then British politics would drift into class antagonism such as could be observed in France. The elections of 1906 and 1910 had shown the danger to the Unionist party from a Liberal-Labour alliance on class lines; the budget of 1909 had shown how far that alliance might threaten the social base on which Unionism itself rested; and the encroachments of the syndicalists suggested that there might be dangerous forces yet to be released. The only hope for a pessimist like Law was to ""get the train on to other lines"" — to focus the attention on the national unity of Britain rather than on internal divisions; in other words to emulate Germany rather than France. Again this hope seems set against the tides of history, but again we cannot be certain that a positive policy of Empire and tariffs could not have turned back the tide in 1902 or 1912. The infant Labour Party was just building its strength, but it was not yet capable of winning seats on its own, and it might have been checkmated for a generation by a positive social policy financed from tariffs. The tariff policy therefore  carried with it the last hope of consolidating the Empire and the last hope of reversing the drift into class politics; as a pessimist, Law saw further ahead than most of his contemporaries, and events proved him to be more nearly right than they were. In deference to the opposition within the party, the abandonment of the referendum was kept secret until Law had been able to consult with Borden, who of course insisted that tariffs without food taxes would be no value to Canada, but who also refused to make a public intervention in British politics. Fortified by assurances that confirmed his own views, Law pressed ahead, and the Tariff Reform League was mobilized for another great campaign. Lansdowne announced the changed policy at an Albert Hall rally on 14 November 1912, and Law gave his support at Ashton-under-Lyne on 16 December. The only modification offered by Law in response to the outcry from Unionist free-traders was that food taxes would be imposed only if requested by the Dominions; after his talks with Borden, there was no doubt about this anyway. By Christmas the party was in a furore, with the Cecils and Stanleys agitating against the new policy. Derby found a means of holding his leader to ransom : a meeting of Lancashire Unionists which threatened to disown the new policy was adjourned for three weeks at his suggestion. He protested to Law that he was doing everything possible to hold Lancashire steady, but he was actually doing all he could to keep the issue alive, including the sending of a questionnaire to all the Lancashire constituencies. Law was thus besieged with demands that he should retreat to a compromise position as Balfour had done in 1910, and again these demands came from tariff reformers as well as free-traders. The leaders would now have to resign, to change their policy, or to see their policy rejected by Lancashire Unionists early in the new year. Both Lansdowne and Law opted to announce their resignation at a party meeting, which would revive the open warfare over tariffs that had existed before 1906, and this would ensure the defeat of all the other party causes too. Long was now unwell and Austen Chamberlain could hardly become leader if Law had resigned over food taxes, so that there was no credible successor to Law. Law had indeed already done enough as leader to make his departure unthinkable and so a memorial was drawn up by Carson and signed by almost all the party's backbenchers, stating full confidence in Law and begging him to stay on with a revised tariff policy. Lansdowne and Law could only accede with as good a grace as they could muster; the party was therefore committed to a full policy of imperial preference, but food taxes would be excluded unless approved by a second general election. Law was bound to give way but in doing so he sacrificed the only positive policy he had. Without food taxes, he would have nothing to offer the Dominions to induce concessions in return and it would be impossible to advocate the policy with the fervour that would alone enable it to challenge the distribution of wealth as the central political issue of the future. In the urge to protect itself for the  negative battles of the present, the party thus pulled back from its only truly positive policy for the future. This dispute was the only major internal wrangle between Law's election and the war, but it illustrated the fragility of his achievement as a flash of lightning illuminates a landscape. Relations with Austen Chamberlain were never quite the same and although only a handful of MPs refused to sign the memorial they included personal friends of Law like Amery and Aitken. The unity of the party survived and was even strengthened by the clearing of the air, but the crisis left a bitter taste. Behind the scenes efforts were being made to broaden the party's appeal by strengthening its policies for social reform, the essential counterpoint to the theme of tariffs. This had been the intention of The New Order in 1908 and many of its contributors were enthusiastic backers of the Unionist Social Reform Committee when it was set up in 1911. This was always an unofficial research body, but it employed full-time staff, was housed at Central Office, and used the full machinery of party publicity to make itself known. This may have been due to the support of Steel-Maitland who was a founder member before he became Party Chairman and who later served on its committee on mental health. The purpose of the USRC was explained by its secretary to Lord Willoughby de Broke in August 1911: ""I still remain convinced as I have always been that unless you put yourself straight with the people on Social questions all your Tariff Reform, Home Rule or Constitutional thunderbolts will be discharged -in vain. You have to establish your bona fides before you can be listened to."" F. E. Smith was chairman of the new organization and announced its formation in a party magazine in the previous month; the range of subjects being investigated then included such diverse topics as police, aliens, asylums and railway clerks""compensation. The committee ""had secured the services of some of the best experts available"" and had sent observers to examine social legislation abroad.  ""By this means we hope to place at the disposal of our party in Parliament and in the country a trained body of fully formed critics, able not only to expose and correct the usual crudities of Radical-Socialist legislation, but to give form to a comprehensive policy of social reform.""  The USRC was therefore set up to play a role like that of the Conservative Research Department after 1929, but more unofficially. The committee's main concerns reflected the interests of its keenest members: the law of aliens covered by Edward Goulding, the poor law covered by Jack Hills, and rural housing covered by Arthur Griffith Boscawen. By 1914, Maurice Woods was able to announce that the committee had completed its immediate programme in every field but one and had therefore embarked on several secondary projects. The most successful project was on housing, which was exploited by the USRC in parliament and by Central Office in its propaganda. Griffith-Boscawen introduced in 1912 a Bill to make improvement grants for rural housing, a proposal that provided a Unionist response to Lloyd George's Land  Campaign. Unionist MPs made much capital from the embarrassment of Liberals who had to vote the Bill down and from the ineffectiveness of John Burns, one of the weakest of the Liberal ministers. Our Flag covered the debates in detail and three leaflets were published, the last with the pithy legend""The Housing Problem — Radicals block Unionist Action. The aim of the USRC was to create just such an impression as Disraeli had done — that Unionist action would be worth more than Liberal words — and they often quoted him with pride. The greatest difficulty for the USRC was within the party, for any commitment to a positive social policy would be resisted by those whose vested interests were threatened, as Robert Sanders noted over labourers""wages: George Kidner came to me in a great state of mind because he has been asked to appear before a committee consisting of C. Bathurst, Peto & C. Mills & sitting at Central Office. This committee suggested to him a policy that included a tribunal to fix the labourers""wages. Kidner much perturbed at such a suggestion. St. Audries actually wrote Bonar Law on the subject & got a reply saying the policy was quite unauthorised. The USRC therefore made only a limited impact; most of its members sat for industrial seats and its propaganda was concentrated there for their benefit. Bonar Law was prepared to make the right noises — in 1913 at Manchester he called for a positive social policy in Disraelian lines for ""the swing of the pendulum is not enough"" , but he would give no more active support. The value of the USRC was thus of an indirect kind; by involving more than seventy MPs and peers in social research the Unionist belief that the party was a party of reform was re-established; it began the trend towards research for political action that was to accelerate after the war; and it affected much later policy by influencing those who were to make it. Baldwin, Steel-Maitland, Hills, Griffith-Boscawen, Ashley, Ormsby-Gore and Baird were all members of the USRC, and all ministers after 1922. When in 1918 the party needed a social programme for negotiations with Lloyd George, it was to the work of the USRC that they turned; in 1922 Griffith-Boscawen was able as Minister of Health to do some of the things he had attempted in 1912; much of Neville Chamberlain's work as a reformer of the Poor Law was presaged by a USRC report of 1913 written by Hills. (Neville Chamberlain was not himself a member of the USRC because he was not an MP but worked with it.) The value of the USRC lies in its long-term contribution to Conservative policy and in its re-creation of the tradition of Conservative reform that perished with Randolph Churchill. Paul Smith has argued that Disraeli was no great reformer but was of enormous value to the party because he was believed to have been one; in rediscovering Disraeli, the USRC rediscovered the myth too. Little of this positive side of Unionism was visible in 1912 and 1913 for it was submerged in the negative task of weakening the Liberal government and  resisting Home Rule. More typically, the Unionist belief in the Empire was set against the Liberal plans to break up the United Kingdom, as in the leaflet Under which flag? of July 1914: this made the comparison between Unionists who had fought in South Africa and Liberals who had been pro-Boer and who would now shoot loyal Ulstermen. This stark contrast provided the basis for Unionism's last great campaign. The parliamentary battle had an air of shadow-boxing about it, for the ultimate outcome was certain from the start and the timetable could be predicted almost as easily. Under the Parliament Act the Lords could bold up legislation for two years, so Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would both become law in 1914, at least a year before an election need be held. There was no doubt that the Liberals would press on with this timetable, and little doubt that the Labour and Irish MPs would support them; Unionists could not therefore stop Home Rule becoming law. Their tirades in parliament were designed for consumption outside, to be read in the constituencies, in Ulster, and at the Palace. The anger of the Unionists was based partly on the old political frustration of government by log-rolling, and partly on a new constitutional point. In 1910 few Liberals had argued for Home Rule in their election addresses or speeches, so they could not be said to have a clear mandate for it. Nor had the Liberals said clearly what sort of reform they would impose on the House of Lords, and the reform that was passed in 1911 left a serious constitutional problem. Asquith's reform had been presented as an interim measure and the preamble to his Bill stated that the Lords""powers were being curtailed pending the introduction of a reform of their composition. The government made no effort to redeem this promise but Unionists believed that they were in a temporary phase pending the reconstruction of the upper house, and that it was therefore no business of the government to bring in other constitutional Bills before they had settled the constitution itself. For the time being the constitution was as Bonar Law argued ""in suspense"" , and so unconstitutional opposition would be justified. The Unionists also had two other arguments in their case. In the first place it could be argued that a democratic government would not impose unreasonably on minorities; this exposed the party to Liberal charges that they were indifferent to the Irish Nationalists, but it also exposed the weakness of the government's position, as Law explained to the Commons in January 1913: If you say that the Nationalists of Ireland have a right to claim to go out of the united Kingdom as a community if you say that five or six per cent of the whole of the United Kingdom have that right because they wish to have separate rule for themselves, how can you say that a body in Ireland, not five or six per cent, but twenty-five per cent of the whole population, has not an equal right to separate treatment? That argument has been put by many of us, and by myself many times, and it has never been answered. The second argument had a more practical flavour and consisted simply of a  demand that the issue should be put to the test of an election. Since there had been no clear mandate in 1910 and since the Lords could not now force another election, Unionists would have to resist until the government called one themselves. Asquith replied that the question of mandates was not so simple, but he was opposed to an election for the same reason as Unionists wanted one:— both knew that Home Rule was not a winning policy outside Ireland. Law taunted Asquith with this in March 1914: I said to the Prime Minister: Make certain — and surely, in face of all this trouble it is worthwhile making certain — that you have the will of the country behind you, and, so far as the Unionist party are concerned, we will absolutely cease all unconstitutional opposition to the carrying of your measure. Note Law's own use of the word ""unconstitutional"" to describe his actions and the extent to which all was pinned on an election. At bottom then there was some democratic basis for the Unionist case, for the government was pressing on with a reform that they knew was not backed by the electorate. It may be alleged that such Unionist arguments were specious, that their concern was solely to exploit a winning issue at any cost to the nation, but this would be to misunderstand the Unionists themselves. Many believed that the Liberal Labour alliance was a threat to a system of government built up over centuries and they were not prepared to see this done without at least a clear decision by the electorate. And it is vital to see that there was a real Unionist case against the government, for this alone explains the popular support that was mobilized and the impression that was made on the army and the King — the only forces left to stop the government. There is no doubt that Unionists believed in what they were doing or that they saw the government's actions as justifying their responses. In 1912 Walter Long accepted the phrase ""the new style"" and flung it back at the government: ""The New Style consists in the cynical violation of the honourable traditions of public life. Government in the New Style consists in gambling with the interests of the nation to propitiate the various mutinous factions which hold the balance in the House of Commons."" Law also charged the government with being under the control of Redmond: I am not going to say anything about the subserviency of the Government. There is no need to tell the country about that. Everybody has seen it. It is impossible to look at any of their actions during the past three years without seeing that they are carrying Home Rule at the dictation of the Nationalist party, but that in order that Home Rule may be carried they are turning up everything in the country. These statements spoke for the whole Unionist party in their vigorous tone, in the denial that Unionists were responsible for the state of things, and in the laying of blame on the Nationalists. In Parliament there was non-cooperation that became almost a guerrilla war between the parties. Exchanges between Bonar Law and the government became ever more abrupt, as the following example from March 1914 shows: Mr Churchill: It is admitted that a misunderstanding on the point arose. Mr Bonar Law: Rubbish! Mr Churchill: Do I understand the Right Honourable Gentleman to say ""Rubbish"" ? Mr Bonar Law: Yes. Meanwhile, the Whips pursued the government in the hope of catching them out in a snap vote; at the least this would disrupt their progress and there seemed an outside chance that the government would tire of the interminable pressure and throw in the sponge. It might not succeed in stopping Home Rule, but it could certainly take up enough time to stop a Plural Voting Bill from getting through. The government's full majority of over a hundred was difficult to muster because of the absence of Irish MPs, and the effective majority was gradually reduced by constant harassment. In February 1912 the majority was down to fifty or sixty; in June the Unionists made their first real attempt to ""snap"" the government and got the majority down to twenty-two. At the same time Unionist speakers filibustered all other Bills and pairing was stopped. In July the government majority fell to three on one vote but this narrow margin produced better attendances on the government side; Unionists therefore sent their MPs off to speak around the country ""with an occasional rush to London to keep the Rads. there"" . These wearing tactics led to the government's defeat in November 1912. All was carefully organized, not only for the debate and the vote, but also for the disorder that would follow when Asquith moved to rescind the vote: Ministers were shouted down, a copy of Standing Orders was thrown at Churchill, and the Speaker had to suspend the House until the following week because of the danger of actual fighting in the House. After the weekend, the Unionist Whips decided that they had taken things far enough, having wasted an entire week of parliamentary time and given their supporters a sign of the vigour with which the fight was being waged. For the rest of the session and in the spring of 1913, the Liberals took no risk of further defeat, but this required constant attendance at the House by Liberal MPs; the result was that there was no autumn session in 1913 and no Plural Voting Bill was passed. It would now be too late to force the abolition of plural voting on the House of Lords before the next general election; something at least had been achieved. In 1913 the Unionists found a new line of attack through the Marconi Scandal. This has to be seen against the Unionist belief that Asquith's government was corrupt as well as irresponsible and radical. At the Albert Hall in January 1912 Law had made this point with characteristic bluntness: Liberals were expert only ""in electioneering, in the small trickery of politics"" . They had given rewards and favours to their supporters, especially in Wales, and""have succeeded in six years in creating a political spoils system which already rivals that of the United States. If we have a few more years of Georgian finance, the only attractive, the only lucrative profession left in this country will be that of a Radical Welsh politician."" Steel-Maitland wrote to The Times in 1913 to accuse the Liberals of corrupt practices at the Wick  Burghs by-election, and Sanders noted that at Taunton they had given away half-crowns wrapped in Liberal leaflets; both contests went against the trend, so there may be some truth in the allegations. In April 1914, George Younger wrote in Our Flag about ""Radical"" Buy ""Election promises"" and cited ten cases from the past six years when Liberal by-election candidates had made promises to local groups of voters on behalf of the government promises of a change in policy to benefit local crafts or industry or employment. Such actions did not infringe the Corrupt Practice Acts but they did make them virtually inoperative. Unionist publications also devoted much attention to Asquith's Honours Lists, and in October 1912 Our Flag listed thirty-nine ""Radical Plutocrats"" , of which twenty-three had been ennobled by the Liberals — ""so far"" . The allegation that the Liberals were selling honours in return for political contributions was brutally clear. It was in this general context that the Unionist attitude to Marconi was set. In October 1912 both Rufus Isaacs and Lloyd George denied that they had engaged in dealings in Marconi shares, but a Select Committee was set up to investigate the allegations of sensationalist newspapers. Only when it became clear, through a libel action against Le Matin early in 1913, that the government had misled the Commons did the Unionists move into action. The Liberals secured the majority report of the Select Committee but the Unionist members under Lord Robert Cecil extracted ever more damaging evidence from the witnesses interviewed. Debates followed in parliament with the Unionists in full cry, for the Liberals seemed to have been caught out in a case of open corruption. In the end of course the government's majority triumphed and the whole affair died away, but Marconi remained a favourite cry of Unionist hecklers in 1914. It must be noted first that the Liberals really did have something to hide over Marconi, but it must be. noted also that Unionists were not being very honest in their more general allegations. The misleading of the Commons by ministers, the deliberate absence from Britain of the Master of Elibank (so that he could not be questioned), and the evasions of the Prime Minister all created the suspicion that something was wrong and Unionists were perfectly justified in their attempts to find out what it was. On the more general point, charges of corruption were disingenuous. The practice of selling honours had been increasing under all governments and it was becoming more marked in both parties. Lord Hugh Cecil doubted if his father had dealt in such things but suspected""that both Asquith and A.). B. know quite well that honours are sold"". In 1913 Lord Selborne tried to mount a campaign against the sale of honours but he had a lukewarm response: Salisbury thought it would not achieve anything useful, Lansdowne urged that the views of the party organizers should be sought, and Law urged him ""not to obscure the Marconi issue"" . Law knew that ""a year's peerages have been hypothecated"" even before he became leader, and he probably knew that the party could not do without this source of income. It was also useless to pretend that corruption at  elections was one-sided; the scale was far smaller than thirty years earlier, but it went on just the same in both parties. Marconi thus had a special importance because it provided an issue of corruption that could not be turned back by Liberals against the Unionists, and for this the Liberals had only themselves to blame. Asquith's appointment of Isaacs as Lord Chief Justice just a few months after he had narrowly escaped (and actually deserved) parliamentary censure, was a brave example of loyalty to a colleague, but it also demonstrated exactly the insensitivity that Unionists had denounced. This ambivalence towards public morality was crucial when set alongside the Unionists""extra-legal activities over Ireland. It was the campaign out of doors over Ulster that was the centre piece of the whole Unionist campaign. For all the noise and fury, the Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons in January 1913 and again in July, and would become law in the autumn of 1914. If it were to be stopped at all, then it could only be by means that fell entirely outside the constitution. The first such means involved the King and the second the army, but both rested on the assertion that Ulster would not accept Home Rule. It was argued that the King might intervene either to persuade Asquith to call an election or to refuse his assent to Home Rule until there had been one; this was certainly within the theoretical Royal Prerogative, for the King had an undoubted right to advise his ministers and — by the Unionist argument at least— his power of veto had been necessarily restored by the removal of the powers of the Lords. Only the King could now give his people the right to vote on a divisive issue, a situation that naturally appalled the Palace. Law pessimistically told the King that he would in any case alienate half of his subjects, Unionists if he gave his assent to Home Rule and Liberals if he did not. Such warnings succeeded in bringing the King into the negotiations; by 1914 the King was trying to secure a compromise settlement, in itself a major advance for an opposition. It was the second Unionist lever against Home Rule that helped to involve the King, for it assumed that Home Rule would become law, would be repudiated in Ulster, and that then the army would refuse to enforce it. The resistance of Ulster had not been created by British Unionists and could hardly be said to depend on them, but the knowledge of support was certainly useful to Carson and Craig in giving their plans for rebellion an official look. At Blenheim in July 1912 Law spoke to a mass rally of English Unionists, including over a hundred MPs, and made his commitment to Ulster absolutely specific. Categorically, he argued that force in Ulster would overthrow parliamentary majorities if necessary and he assured the party's support in advance with no limitations. In a similar rally in Belfast in April he had taken the salute from over 100,000 Protestants in military formation. He went on to commit the party in support of the creation of the Ulster volunteers, of the formation of a Provisional government, and of the gun-running at Larne in April 1914. Again and again he spelled out his commitment — almost always  linked to the question of the mandate, as in the Commons in January 1913: Suppose we submit it to the electors? I say that, so far as I am concerned. if that is done we shall not in any way, shape or form encourage the resistance of Ulster. I say that without hesitation. [MR WINSTON CHURCHILL: Are you encouraging it now?] I rather differ from the Rt Hon. Gentleman. I am never ashamed to say exactly what I am doing. I have said before, and if it be any satisfaction to him I repeat it now, that if you attempt to enforce this Bill, and the people of Ulster believe, and have a right to believe, that you are doing it against the will of the people of this country, then I shall assist them in resisting it. Not only would Ulster be right to resist, but so would army officers who refused to enforce the decision of parliament: Put yourselves in the position of an officer. He believes in his heart and conscience, as I do, that the Government are doing this thing without the consent of the country, that in pressing it forward without the approval of the country they are as much a revolutionary committee as President Huerta who governs Mexico. That is really my position and, unless I believed in it I would not feel justified in the course I have taken. Unlimited support was promised, and unlimited support was given; that was indeed the only way in which the strategy of stopping Home Rule ""out of doors"" might succeed. Behind the scenes though, neither Law nor his party was so sure of the grounds and there was certainly some fear of the consequences. Austen Chamberlain represented such fears when he told Willoughby de Broke of what might be yet to come in November 1913: Civil War is an awful thing, not to be lightly encountered, but it is not the greatest evil which confronts us if the coercion of Ulster is tried. For if that is done, the House of Commons v. the Amy will break in the process. If officers throw up their commissions and troops refuse to fire, Home Rule is dead, but a great deal else is dead too. I won't dwell on the dangers of foreign complications, real though they be, but how will you meet another general strike on the railways or in the mines? It is not civil war that is the greatest peril but anarchy. And despite his public utterances Law too was ready to take up a more pragmatic attitude when negotiating; if Ulster could be excluded, he was quite prepared to abandon the rest of Ireland to Home Rule; Carson shared Law's view and was kept in touch with the negotiations throughout. Two problems intervened though to prevent a compromise, both in the secret negotiations of 1913 and the Buckingham Palace talks of July 1914. On the Unionist side men who had been fed with the heady talk of absolute resistance mobilized to resist what they now saw as the sell-out of the Southern Irish Unionists. The diehard peers began to organize another revolt, and the threat of a split like 1911 loomed. This gravely restricted Law's room for manoeuvre and made it impossible for him to accept the only compromise that Asquith could offer. On the Liberal side, anger at the illegal campaign against Home Rule had made it equally difficult for Asquith to compromise, and he too could see no other way forward. By 1914 the terms of a possible compromise were emerging, by which Unionists would accept Home Rule and Liberals would agree to exclude Ulster; argument continued over the exact size of an excluded Ulster and the length of time involved in exclusion, but the logic of the negotiations pointed to this settlement in 1914 just as it was to do in 1921–22. The tragedy of 1914 was that neither side could accept this obvious compromise because neither could sell it to their own followers. Law had indeed brought Asquith to the point of conceding all that could be hoped for from Ulster's resistance, but he was unable to seize the fruits. He believed that Asquith ""is in a funk about the resistance of Ulster, and I am convinced that he will not face it when it comes to the point"" . Compromise having failed, there was left only force. The final Unionist weapon would then be the army and the last political tactic was the scheme to amend the annual Army Bill in the House of Lords. As this was a Bill that was passed for one year only, the refusal to pass it would effectively restore the Lords' power over the government by taking away its legal control over the army. In the early months of 1914 the Unionist leaders prepared for this desperate throw, and the plan was only abandoned when the ""mutiny"" at the Curragh showed that it was unnecessary, for the officers would not in any case agree to coerce Ulster. The Curragh incident was a sad case of panic, bungling and hesitation by the Liberals, for which the Unionists bear only an indirect responsibility, but once the crisis broke the Unionists were quite convinced that it was the result of a plot against loyal Ulster an ""Ulster Pogrom"" . Movements of the fleet, secret meetings at the War Office, and the equivocations of the Prime Minister all lent some credence to this view, but there is no doubt that the Unionists themselves believed it. Unable to accept concessions in negotiation, Law now saw much the same deal offered in public by the Liberals themselves, when Asquith announced an Amending Bill to satisfy Ulster's fears of Home Rule with a period of exclusion. There remained doubt about the length of the exclusion, but it would certainly go past the next election and so allow a Unionist government to make it permanent. The campaign of resistance had then succeeded, but few Unionists were celebrating; Lord Winterton in Sussex and Willoughby de Broke in Warwickshire were among the Unionists who were preparing to spread an Irish civil war to England by setting up ""commandos"" of diehards among the yeomanry — but it was not clear whom they would fight if the army refused to support the government. With the failure of the Buckingham Palace Conference in July 1914 the party prepared to redeem the pledges to Ulster of the past three years. From this grim situation the party was saved by the First World War. The verdict on Bonar Law's first three years as leader must be a two-sided one. From the national viewpoint there are some credits and one massive debit. It was Law's achievement to keep the extreme right within the mainstream of the political system when it might have felt the need to  abandon party politics altogether. It is the particular genius of British politics that the major parties have always managed to hold on to their respective extremists and so to draw their teeth. This was never more threatened from the right than in the years before 1914 and a leader who had respected constitutional niceties at that time would have driven them out of the system where they could have been far more dangerous. Law's campaign against Home Rule also brought the Liberal government face to face with power politics and showed up the hollowness of the reasoned optimism that underlay Edwardian Liberalism. The First World War provided a similar test and again only the Labour and Unionist parties were able to meet it squarely, but the battles of 1912 and 1913 had given advance warning of what was to come. The imperial and defence campaigns perhaps did something to prepare the nation for war and they certainly prepared the parry to take the lead when war did come in 1914. Against these points must be set the fatalism with which Law watched his country drift into civil war; the patriotic party became begetters of rebellion, the party of order suborned crime and mutiny, and the leader of the opposition in parliament approved and supported the destruction of both the practice and the authority of parliament. It should not be thought that Unionists enjoyed such a situation, for they certainly did not, but nor can it be suggested that they saw any real alternative, for in truth the basis of agreement on which parliamentary government""rested had all but broken down. So Law said of the Liberals in 1914: ""They have become revolutionaries, and becoming revolutionaries they have lost the right to that implicit obedience that can be claimed by a Constitutional Government.""  In this Law shared the view of his party, but it would have been substantially the same without him. It is indeed hard to see how any Unionist leader in these years could have acted against such firm convictions to put the national interest first. From the party point of view, Law's leadership had been a considerable success. He inherited a party that was weak and unsure of itself, he raised its morale, gave it purpose and pulled it together. Without this revival before 1914 it is difficult to see how the parry could have survived the ten turbulent years that followed. By 1914 Unionists again really believed in their cause, as few had done in 1911. By 1914 the Liberal party was on the ropes and the Unionists could look forward confidently to the election that could not be long delayed. Debate has been fierce between Liberal and Labour historians as to what can be proved from the by-elections of 1911–14 about the relative strength of the two Progressive parties; it is an indecisive argument in its very nature because of the confused pattern of results and the lack of any truly comparable figures for 1910 or 1906. What cannot be doubted is that Unionists, who had drawn level with the Liberals in 1910, had made up more ground on them since. By the outbreak of war, the party had 287 MPs, thirty more than the Liberals and almost as many as the combined Liberal-Labour vote. Of these by-election  gains more than half had been in straight fights, the implications of which were unmistakable. An article in Our Flag in November 1912 pointed out that the average turnover of votes in by-elections had been about 1,300 votes per contest and that only 250 votes per contest was needed for an overall Unionist majority. So in straight fights the Unionists were apparently on their way to a big win and the Labour-Liberal battles in three-cornered contests were merely an added bonus. Local elections confirmed the trend and their historian has interpreted them as showing that ""by 1913, the Conservatives had rarely been stronger in the Councils of the land, or indeed more poised for success in the forthcoming general election"" . Much would depend on the exact state of affairs in Ireland and something would depend on the success of the Progressive parties in patching up a new electoral pact (although after the events of 1912 and 1913 it could not be expected to work as well as in 1910), but all of these factors would operate in the broad context of a probable Unionist victory. So in saving the party from a desperate situation in Ireland, the First World War also robbed the Unionist party of a return to power. Bonar Law's Party Bonar Law was a startling choice for the party of the ""Hotel Cecil"" , for he was a self-made and almost self-educated businessman from the outlying parts of the Empire (Scotland, Ulster and Canada provided his roots). He was inexperienced and little known before he was propelled into the highest office by his friends' ambition for him and by the deadlock between Long and Chamberlain in 1911. He had entered parliament in 1900, twenty-six years after Balfour, he had held no Cabinet post, he had taken no active role in party institutions, and he had not involved himself much in the social world of Westminster. However, his candidature in 1911 had been aided by three factors: he was a Conservative rather than a Liberal Unionist, but he was the sort of Conservative who would be acceptable to Liberal Unionists as well; he was a diehard in opinion, but he had remained loyal to Balfour's policy throughout the recent twists and turns; and he had staked a claim by his abandonment of his safe London seat to fight North-West Manchester in December 1910 (at no real risk, for an alternative safe seat was always available to him if and when he lost). Law's claims were therefore substantial, but they were known to few outside parliament, Glasgow and Manchester. In welcoming him, the party thus welcomed him as a stereotype. One thing about him that was widely known was the fact that he was a businessman, and so it was as such that he was welcomed; the party could even claim some credit for being the first to elect a businessman as its leader — much as it claimed credit in 1975 for electing a woman, although Margaret Thatcher had certainly not been chosen for that reason. At the National Union rally at Leeds the week after Law's election, a local delegate called John Gordon remarked that Law was ""a man of enormous business capacity (Hear, hear)"" , and suggested that there should be more such men in parliament. On the previous day, Alfred Hobson of Sheffield had told a party lunch that they had been fortunate in securing a businessman, whose qualifications in that respect would certainly appeal to men in the North of England. (Hear, hear). At present, we did not pay the same attention to the commercial development of our country that other nations paid to their development on those lines. We wanted more businessmen at the head of affairs. Others who were less impressed by what they knew about Law were  surprised by what they discovered of his actual abilities, perhaps because his anonymity had prepared them for the worst. Lady Dawkins, who had never heard him speak before, surprised herself by her reaction when she heard him speak at the Albert Hall in January 1912: It was a splendid meeting yesterday and they gave Bonar Law a magnificent reception. His delivery was extraordinarily good and, though he spoke for an hour and a half I should think, his voice never failed him and every word was clear — and bold. It wasn't brilliant oratory, no flowers of rhetoric à la Curzon, or subtle ""nuances"" à la Balfour, but it was good hard sound commonsense and the way he showed up the government was admirable. What I liked about it was that though it was biting sarcasm, the way he spoke it gave you the impression not of a man who was bitter in any way, but of a man who pitied the members of the government for being so rotten and pitied us for being governed by such scum. He held his audience all through his speech you felt he was in touch and in sympathy with them and they with him. He was so extraordinarily quiet and self-possessed, it was almost as if he were chatting to us confidentially about it all instead of making an elaborate speech. I am bound to say that his personality and his voice with his Glasgow accent were a little disconcerting at first(I felt rather as if I were being addressed by my highly educated carpenter), but he inspired me with such confidence as he went on that I forgot that, and of course one has to recognise that a new era in political life has dawned for England, the old aristocratic school is practically swept out of it, it is the dawn of the new ""regime"" . As long as we are in safe hands, while we are with a sincere man like B.L. we are safe, but I am not sure that it is a good thing on the whole. Still, I suppose we must move with the times. This account sums up much of Law's appeal and explains his quick success as leader. He combined a cold approach with references to emotive issues like the Boer War, he spoke in a matter-of-fact way, he made clever use of sarcasm at the expense of opponents, and he recognized the value of a decisive attitude that would be firmly grasped by a party audience. His unconventionality, his unorthodoxy and his accent all helped the party to feel that it had made a step forward: ""the dawn of the new regime"" . As Lloyd George perceptively remarked in 1911, ""the fools have stumbled on the right man by accident"" . Bonar Law has usually received a bad press from historians, who have portrayed him as a hard, dour, humourless fanatic. The balance was righted by Robert Blake's biography, a book of great judgement and insight but still without great sympathy for the man. For it is the personality of Law that has remained as elusive to historians as it was to his own contemporaries. He remained a very private individual during his twelve years at the top, rarely venturing into society and always preferring a quiet dinner alone or with chosen friends to an elaborate occasion. After the death of his wife in 1909 he took no interest in the society of women, he had little interest in food and he was a teetotaller. As leader of the party he gave the usual dinner for colleagues at the start of the session but he was happy to leave the rest of the social management of the party to Lady Londonderry. He was obliged to  attend some party functions and to receive the chief guests along with the hostess, but he received little pleasure from such occasions and rarely attended them outside London. His lack of social. graces could be an embarrassment, for he had no polite small-talk and did not pretend to any; his visits to Windsor were an ordeal for guest and hosts alike, to him because he disliked formality and to his hosts because he was so difficult to entertain and because he did not mince words with the King. He thus remained an enigma, a man who could not be known as most politicians were known and who seemed to shun such contacts. The outward appearance of gloomy taciturnity was therefore taken for the whole man. To friends, though, Law appeared very differently, and the people who became his friends provide testament to the fact; he was very close with both Max Aitken and David Lloyd George, neither of whom was very likely to enjoy the company of a gloomy boor. Indeed, when Law left the government in 1921, Frances Stevenson noted in her diary that Lloyd George had ""lost an ideal companion with whom he could laugh and joke and enjoy himself"" . Both Aitken and Stanley Baldwin had an admiration for Law that bordered on veneration. Others never managed to penetrate his reserve, for he had a deep suspicion of others who could turn out a compliment at will or turn a barbed shaft with a sally of their own, and above all he hated pomposity and egotism; this goes far to explain his view of Churchill and of F. E. Smith. When offered the leadership for which he had fought so hard, Law almost lost It by his apparent doubt; in his speech of acceptance he spoke at length of his unfitness for the job; when told that he was now a great man and must learn to behave like one, he replied ""If! am a great man, then a good many great men must have been frauds.""  Indeed Law determined not to try to look like a great man and therein lay the secret this success. He put himself forward as a self-consciously ordinary man, a politician who asked to be identified with as an equal rather than deferred to as a leader. Even Lloyd George, whose origins were as lowly as Law's had been, could not stoop to so humble a style, and only Stanley Baldwin (who drew much of his inspiration from Law) was able to do so successfully. If Law had a political model, then it must have been Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a fellow Scot who had shown that an ordinary man could hold the highest office without discredit and that he could beat the clever and the politically sophisticated at their own game. Commentators on Bonar Law's election to the leadership all agreed that the party had taken a decisive turn. For Walter Long proposing Law as leader, the decision marked the end of an era, the swansong of the country gentleman. For H. G. Wells, the change to Bonar Law marked a distasteful new attitude by the Unionists; when Balfour's""essential liberalism came face to face with this new baseness of commercialized imperialism, with all its push and energy, he made a very poor fight for it. He allowed himself to be hustled into the background of affairs by men with narrower views and nearer objectives."" As far back as 1904 Winston Churchill had foreseen the  same change when he predicted the tariff reformers' coming takeover of the party. Lord Robert Cecil detected the same change when he deplored the tariff reformers'""whole way of looking at things. It appears to me utterly sordid and materialistic, not yet corrupt but on the high road to corruption."" Tory aristocrats, Liberals and Fabians all saw in Law's election the triumph of this ""new mercantile Conservatism"" and the final triumph of tariff reform; the party was now in the hands of hard-faced businessmen, and all sorts of undesirable results would inevitably follow. Law gave credence to such fears by his unashamed espousal of the image created round him; in May 1912 he told the National Union that ""nobody knows better than I do that political work cannot be done on strictly business lines, but the nearer you can approach to business lines the better for the political work"" . Steel-Maitland was running Central Office like a business enterprise, not in order to make a political point, but because it was as natural to him as it had been foreign to Percival Hughes. The party magazine Conservative and Unionist quite specifically welcomed Law's election, because ""as a great captain of industry, his knowledge of the conditions of the workers will be an invaluable guide in the development of the Unionist policy of Social Reform"" . The resistance of Ulster was also linked to its business roots with such slogans as ""Industrial Ulster is united"" or ""They mean business"" , and Law made the same point when he described in Norwich a recent meeting that he had addressed in the Ulster Hall: That meeting consisted of practically the whole business community of Belfast. They are the very class which hate disorder, which know that disorder injures their business, perhaps ruins their business, yet this class showed an enthusiasm which equalled, if not surpassed, the enthusiasm of the workers in the shipyards. The merging of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists was described by John Boraston on similar lines: The promoters of the amalgamation are a body of keen businessmen, well knowing the difference between an investment and a speculation. They regard the fusion as a sound investment and, although Unionist stock has appreciated greatly since the new issue, there is not a man of us who has the slightest intention of selling out. So under Law the language of the boardroom became commonplace on the platforms and in the propaganda of the party. There has rarely been a clearer example of the extent to which a Conservative leader sets the keynote for the party the extent to which it is moulded round its leader. In all this, it was easy to forget the fortuitous circumstances in which Law had actually become leader in 1911. Walter Long was a country gentleman who played up to that image for all he was worth, using Henry Chaplin-""the squire — as his political model. Austen Chamberlain had been trained to be a conventional statesman; Rugby, Cambridge and a determination to live down his father's reputation had all combined to make him the most conformist of politicians. Neither Long not Chamberlain would have made great changes in  the party, and the election of either would not have seemed to signify a great change. Moreover they and their supporters were still present in Bonar Law's party, so that the scale of the real change would be heavily circumscribed. Law could give his party a new image, but the reality would remain much as before. The leadership was actually a collective one rather than a personal domination, and Law recognized his obligation to take the advice of those who were seen to be worthy of consultation by the party as a whole. He called the shadow cabinet together rarely and restricted its membership, but this did not remove the obligation to take advice. We must turn to Law's leading supporters as well as to himself in order to assess the real character of the party. Our Flag printed New Year messages in 1914 from Lansdowne, Bonar Law, Selborne, Austen Chamberlain, Long, Carson, Smith, Steel-Maitland, Lord Edmund Talbot, and George Younger, in that order; the last three were presumably included as Party Chairman, Chief Whip and Scottish Whip, but the rest of the list may be taken as indicative of a rough order of precedence at that time. Lansdowne came first because he had been leader in the House of Lords since 1902; he was too old to be a rival to Law and he cooperated with him fully, though not without some condescension. He played a vital role because the Lords were central to Unionist tactics and because the only alternative leaders there — Selborne or Curzon — had each alienated some Unionist peers by their actions in 1911. Law consulted Lansdowne on all matters of importance, kept him informed of the progress of negotiations over Ulster, but found him difficult to convince of the merits of compromise. Lansdowne was more exposed to the views of the real diehards and was thus a restraining influence on Law. With Lansdowne should be linked Balfour who, though he occupied no official position after 1911, was still close to the centre of the party. Relations with Law were cool but courteous and his tactical advice was always available on difficult issues, such as the question of the Army Act in 1914. Selborne was of significance because he was a man who had a foot in every camp; related to the Cecils, he was also a Liberal Unionist, a tariff reformer, a diehard, and a Liberal Unionist. He had been Liberal Unionist Chief Whip, with Joseph Chamberlain at the Colonial Office, First Lord of the Admiralty, Milner's successor in South Africa, and a ditcher over the House of Lords. In 1914 he was still only fifty-five and could look forward to a major job in the next Unionist government. He had not wished to leave the Commons when he inherited his title in 1895 and thereafter he became an unceasing advocate of the House of Lords, defending its powers, resisting the sale of peerages, and demanding its reconstruction so that its powers could be restored. Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long were both treated with respect by Law, tribute to their withdrawal in his favour in 1911, but they reacted very differently. Long was a choleric, short-tempered man who was a constant trial to colleagues in opposition or in power. He bad a good platform manner and a  great capacity for work but he was an inveterate intriguer. He had constantly worked against Balfour, criticizing him freely in letters to colleagues and using his party positions as independent bases against the leader. From 1912 though, his health was not good and he was no real threat to Law, but he retained the backing of a large section of the rank and file in the House of Commons. Austen Chamberlain on the other hand was always reserved and never seems to have fully understood Law's belief in his party nor his readiness to sacrifice even profound beliefs for the sake of unity. He was hurt by his failure to win the leadership in 1911 and by the hostility to his family manifested during the contest. He made it clear to Law that he did not think that Law was well qualified to be leader and that he reserved the right to contest any future vacancy, but Austen was too loyal a man to conspire; relations were not very friendly, but there was total cooperation. Sir Edward Carson occupied an independent position as the spokesman of Ulster. Although not an Ulsterman himself, he gave to Ulster the charismatic lead that transformed resistance into armed rebellion, and he was a popular platform speaker with Unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea. Although the leader of the Union Defence League in succession to Walter Long, he shared Law's belief in the inevitability of ultimate compromise, and this made him, like Law, an object of suspicion to the diehard Irish Unionists. F. E. Smith worked closely with Carson in the Ulster campaign. He was the rising man in the party, only thirty-nine in 1911 when he joined the front bench, as brilliant an advocate as Carson and a man of devastating wit. He was by far the most popular Unionist speaker after Law in 1912 and 1913, the man that every local association wanted to open their bazaars and fates. His speeches in parliament were separately published, as were those of no other Unionist of the time except Balfour, and he received the signal honour of a Privy Councillorship on the recommendation of the Liberal Prime Minister in June 1911. These then were Law's senior colleagues in the work of opposition and would have presumably occupied the senior posts in a Law government; they scarcely add up to the image of a party of ruthless businessmen and, if other probable ministers are added to the list — Lords Derby, Curzon, Salisbury and Crawford, together with Finlay and Cave, both lawyers — then it seems even less so. The only Unionists who conformed to the picture of what the party was supposed to be like were either men outside the mainstream like Milner, or men too junior to have much real influence like Steel-Maitland, Aitken, Amery and Goulding. Bonar Law himself was the only one of the shadow cabinet who fitted the image of his party, and for him part at least, was assumed for the occasion. Most of the party leaders were in any case inherited from Balfour and it would take time to find men of the new stamp, even if this were possible. The Balfourites did gradually fade from the scene; Acland-Hood, Wyndham and Lyttleton all died, Halsbury and Akers-Douglas became too old, and Midleton was dropped. But in their place, Law did not fill his shadow cabinet with assertive businessmen. Far from it, for even after  the influx into parliament of the ""hard-faced men"" of 1918 the Law government of 1922 included as many old-established peers as any of the time. Salisbury had remarked in 1911 that ""whatever your own opinions, the Conservative party can only assimilate change gradually"" , and this was certainly so in the case of personnel at the top. A Law government in 1915 would have included hardly any more MPs from a business background than Disraeli's 1874 Ministry or Salisbury's of 1895. Not all members would have been aristocratic or from the gentry, but the fastest route to the top was still through the law rather than through commerce. Unionist MPs in 1910–14 have been exhaustively studied by J. M. McEwen and J. A. Thomas, and the following analysis is based on their work. The clearest characteristic of the parliamentary party was its strongly regional base. Unionists held 54 per cent of the English seats, but only 18 per cent of the rest, and this severely limited the recovery from 1906. Ireland outside Ulster was intractable, but the lack of a Unionist revival in Scotland and Wales cost the party about thirty seats when compared to 1895 or 1900. Within England too there was a heavy concentration: the party held most of the seats in the Home Counties, Wessex, the West and the West Midlands; just over half in London, the East and the North-west; well under half in the East Midlands and North. Strength was still predominantly in the counties; the English counties returned almost half of the parliamentary party, the squires who made Walter Long such a force, and of these 128 MPs over a hundred owned land or lived in the division that they represented, a strong territorial base. This was further reflected by the fact that a third of the MPs did not keep up a house in London, confirmation of roots outside Westminster; sessions lasted for only about thirty weeks a year and even during session the attendance of backbenchers was sometimes spasmodic. Unionists had a slight majority of the English borough seats, but this was based on the small towns of the West and South rather than the heavy industrial centres of the North. The Unionist preponderance in London rested on the western residential suburbs, eighteen constituencies that elected Unionists at all elections from 1885 to 1910. Of the major cities only Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield elected more Unionists than Liberals in 1910, but Unionism was also strong in Plymouth Brighton, Preston, and Bath. Where old cries could still be made to work, old strongholds in the seaside resorts, cathedral towns, market towns and suburbs returned to their previous loyalty. Where the joint appeal of Liberals and Labour had bitten more deeply into the Unionist vote there was no visible recovery of ground; so in 1914 there were no Unionist MPs at all from Leeds or Bradford, Leicester or Derby or Stoke, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, Southampton, Stockport, Bolton, Blackburn or Northampton. Every one of these towns had returned Unionists in 1895 or 1900 and no Unionist government would be elected without some victories in such places. The by-election gains in Manchester in 1912 and in Ipswich on the eve of the war perhaps showed  that this recovery was at hand. The borough MPs were very different from their county colleagues, and only thirty-seven of the eighty-six from English boroughs even lived in the same towns; many were carpet-bagging lawyers, induced to stand at the last moment and at the expense of Central Office. This distribution was much like that of the 1880s: the reliance on the counties, the growth of suburban strength, and the lack of strong local roots in the industrial areas were all traditional features. In background the party was less exclusive than might be expected. Only nineteen MPs were heirs to peerages and of these seven were from families that had been Liberal before 1886 and another five were new creations since then; thirty-eight MPs were related to peers by blood and another forty by marriage. Only sixteen Unionist MPs were baronets (less than the number of Liberals, a testament to the eight years of Liberal government), and these were the owners of new wealth rather than old titles. There were twenty-one knights, but these too were more often lawyers, merchants and colonial administrators rather than landed gentry. Eighty-one MPs had some connection with a landed family (on Burke's celebrated definition) and fifty-five of these sat for seats that were adjacent to their family holdings; conversely there were only two whose fathers had been working-class (Jessie Collings and Henry Duke) but a host whose fathers had been lawyers, clergymen or doctors (including Law, Smith and Aitken). Fifty-three were the sons of MPs (18 per cent, much like the 17 per cent of Liberals) and twelve of these sat for the same seat, although few like Stanley Baldwin succeeded directly; fifteen of these fifty-three were sons of Liberals, further evidence of the value of recruits brought over in 1886. Unionists were most distinct from Liberals and from other generations of Conservatives in their age; the average age was only fifty in 1914, there were four Unionist MPs under thirty and sixty-two under forty, and half of the party had been under forty when first elected. This reflected the extent to which politics was a career that followed quite naturally from station and the clearing out that had taken place after 1906. Few Unionist MPs had any need to earn their livings, and it was usually the lawyers and businessmen who were the older members. The parliamentary party was thus a relatively young group of men, with the most privileged also the youngest. In education the party conformed more to what would be expected: 196 MPs had been to public schools (68 per cent of the party, twice the proportion of Liberals) and eighty-six of these had been at Eton, almost a third of the party. Only thirty-four had been to other secondary schools, scarcely more than the number from the second most popular public school, Harrow. The same pattern can be seen in higher education, with 144 Unionists going to Oxford or Cambridge (88–53 to the dark blues), again twice the proportion of Liberals. A few had been to other universities, to Sandhurst, Dartmouth or an agricultural college, making 190 in all who had had some form of higher education. The educational background of the party thus suggests a single  integrated elite still drawing heavily on the most exclusive sources. The difficulty of interpreting such information is highlighted though by the fact that this educated elite, two-thirds of whom had been to public schools and universities, chose as their leader a man who had been to neither. The problem of interpretation is compounded in considering MPs occupation and interests; it was not unusual for a young man from a landed family to be called to the Bar (but not to practice), to serve in the armed forces (but not to become a professional soldier), and then to settle down to a political career with several directorships. It would be misleading to classify such a man as ""lawyer"" , ""officer"" or ""businessman"" . So 156 MPs had some identifiable business interest, a little over half of the party, but for most of them some other interest seemed to predominate. Occupations are therefore given, subject to these limitations of interpretation, in Table 5.1, with the figures for Liberals as a comparison. Table 5.1 Occupations of Unionist MPs and Liberals, 1914 Unionist Liberal Land Large landowners 32 9 Small landowners 19 3 Heirs to estates 16 4 67(23%) 16(6%) Official services Army 53 15 Navy 2 1 Diplomatic 5 4 Civil Service 3 4 63(22%) 24(9%) Professions Barristers 79 59 Solicitors 12 12 Authors/Journalists 7 13 Printers/Publishers 2 10 Lecturers/Teachers 3 10 Others — 7 103(36%) 111(43%) Commerce Merchants 14 24 Stockbrokers 6 3 Bankers 7 4 Insurance 1 3 Accountants 3 1 Others 9 6 40(14%) 41(16%)  Industry Manufacture 7 18 Shipowners 2 8 Textiles 2 14 Iron 6 8 Coal 1 8 Engineering 3 5 Building — 2 Brewing 9 1 Working men — 8 30(10%) 72(27%) Land no longer dominated the party, the bulk of which was now made up of officers and lawyers, with army officers and lawyers between them making up almost half the total. In the less prestigious occupations, Unionists were still more likely to have investments in railways, banking or insurance than in coal, textiles or engineering, more likely engage in commerce than in industry. The parliamentary party on the outbreak of the First World War can therefore be seen to be in a rough state of balance, with the interests of land, services, professions and business in a near equality. Any change would of course be a small one and would only be seen in candidates adopted after the ""new regime"" of 1911 and fighting for the marginal industrial seats of the North. The MPs elected in 1918 came near to meeting the expectations of 1911 and many of these had indeed been selected as candidates before the war: in 1918 the average age rose sharply (over half were over fifty), the proportion with interests in the land fell, and the proportion with interests in business rose from 24 to 41 per cent. This generation of new men might not have been elected but for the war but they would certainly have been trying to get elected in a general election in 1915. The final characteristic of the MPs that can be traced is religion, which shows as traditional a pattern as any. Very few Unionists were Nonconformists and most of these had come into the party from the Liberal Unionist side. There were rather more Presbyterians, a few Roman Catholics and Jews, and an overwhelmingly Anglican majority, at least 90 per cent of the party. In an age when all Unionists professed some form of religious belief and when Anglicanism was the assumption of those who professed no other form of Christianity in England, some of this may be taken to be assumption rather than conviction. But to exaggerate this would be to misjudge the tone of the party in religious affairs, for if the Church of England was the ""Tory party at prayer"" then the party was also the Church of England in politics. Many Unionist politicians were prominent laymen in their own right, as were Selborne, Joynson-Hicks, Samuel Hoare and Edward Wood. The Cecils regarded the protection of the Church as a special family responsibility and Lord Hugh was as moved to indignation by the disendowment of the Church in Wales as by the People's Budget or the attack on the House of Lords. To Selborne it was no more nor less than ""robbing the church"" and many  Unionists saw it in such simple terms. The party's Anglican commitment was as firm as ever before 1914, even though it was being led for the first time by a man who was not an Anglican himself. Holding the elements of the party together were two factors of a very different kind: the social world of clubland and society cemented the ties between leaders and followers, and the organizational web of the National Union extended the same ties through the country. Bonar Law might dislike the social round and might rarely visit the Carlton Club, but he did not try to change its role. Party meetings continued to be held at the Carlton and it played a greater part in holding the party together when the Liberal Unionists joined. Other clubs did much the same things for provincial leaders; it was to the Constitutional Club that Salvidge went when in London and it was there that he stayed. It was to the Carlton as well as the Whip's Office that Robert Sanders went to hear the news and discuss political events, and it was to the Carlton too that he went for recreation when the business of the House was too tedious to be borne any longer. Social forces could be used even for directly political purposes, as Sanders himself found when he needed speakers for the South Somerset by-election in 1911; F. E. Smith could in fact be prised away from the West End only by social pressure: A comic little episode about the South Somerset election. I asked F. E. to go down, so did Talbot. But he declined on ground of being too busy. Doughty the same. I then suggested putting the Carnarvons on F.E. This was quite effective — a countess on the doorstep brought F.E. in at once. He is to go down Monday next. Doughty on getting a letter from Carnarvon, actually came and asked to go. Curzon was more difficult to drive down to the provinces. as Steel-Maitland reported to Law in 1914: ""sunderland: He says he cannot manage thee distant meetings. They are beyond his strength. If we come in, you ought to be kind to him and not ask him to sacrifice his health by taking office."" In general though the social world played a more nebulous role, oiling the wheels, providing opportunities for informal meetings and leisurely discussions, as Lord Midleton recalled in 1929 when bewailing Baldwin's neglect of such methods: We all know how the week runs away with official interviews and calls, and how difficult it is to remember all the people with whom you ought to keep in touch, but when I think of the number of things which people of different types, like Lady Londonderry and Lady St Helier and others, have got settled by letting people meet at the dinner table, I despair of a man who never sees even those who have been longest in office on any occasion. Your statement that he never once consulted you on a church appointment is conclusive. After all, if you happened to be next him after dinner for ten minutes, he would get invaluable hints. A hostess like Lady St Helier, an open-handed host like the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, or a fixer like Aitken with a house near to London, could all be useful in keeping the wheels of party turning. The structure of the National Union was a recognition of the reality of local powers and in this respect the party resembled less a unitary structure than a collection of private franchises. The authority of the Earl of Derby in the North-west, celebrated in the soubriquet ""King of Lancashire"" , was only the best known of the independent fiefs where the writ of the party leader did not run. In 1912–13 Derby demonstrated his power by mobilizing Lancashire to wreck Law's policy on food taxes. Derby used the machinery of the Lancashire provincial Division to gather his forces, but it would be a mistake to see his institutional position as a source of strength; the President of the Lancashire Unionists was a man of influence because he was Earl of Derby and not vice versa. He gave authority to the party rather than drawing from it, for the local standing of the Stanleys was altogether independent of party. They had consolidated their position since the fifteenth century and had latterly built up an impregnable position in the social infrastructure of the region. A brother of the Earl was MP for Bootle until 1910, when he gave up his seat to Bonar Law after Law's defeat in Manchester. Ormskirk and Chorley were both county seats under the family influence and Stanleys had sat for both seats in the recent past. Local parties, local clubs, churches and voluntary organizations were all patronized by Stanleys and proud to have a Stanley as patron. It was inevitable that the Earl should be Lord Lieutenant of the County, and that he should be President of the Lancashire Unionists. Part of the basis of this local standing was financial — the generosity with which the family backed local institutions and the land held directly from them — but part was also due to more intangible influences. The Stanleys were careful to place themselves at the head of local opinion rather than ride the county roughshod and their identity of opinion with local Unionists on political and religious matters made them even more powerful. Something of the same territorial influence can be detected in other counties too; in the East Midlands, the spheres of the Dukes of Rutland and Devonshire were rarely challenged. Nor were such examples confined to feudal counties, for family influence could also be seen in boroughs and on occasion even in big cities. Folkestone was a pocket borough of the Rothschilds, Southend was falling under the control of the Guinness family, Plymouth was learning to love the Astors, and Samuel Roberts was building up the influence in Sheffield that was to provide a seat for his family until 1966. A combination of public philanthropy and attention to local interests could yield quick results, even for an outsider like Max Aitken in Ashton-under-Lyne. Others were content to wield power in the party machines rather than in the public eye. Salvidge of Liverpool was the best-known example, becoming chairman of the National Union in 1913 and often cited as the only party boss on the American model in English politics, but his authority in Liverpool was no greater than that of Sir James Oddy in Bradford or Sir Percy Woodhouse in Manchester. Such men owed their positions to the constant manipulation of the party machinery — and so confirmed the worst of Ostrogorski's fears; they  sat on every local committee, raised money for the local party, decided the selection of candidates and kept their fingers firmly on the local pulse. The true pinnacle of success in this field was the Chamberlains in Birmingham, who combined an attention to organizational detail with a liking for the lim light. When Neville Chamberlain became Mayor of Birmingham in 1915, he was the eighth member of the family to hold the office in half a century, and he was never to forget the influence of his local roots. Even when a cabinet minister he found time to write round for subscriptions for the Birmingham Unionists and to attend their routine meetings. When facing a critical party conference in 1921, Austen Chamberlain had urged Neville to see that suitable people were selected to represent all twelve Birmingham divisions and to pay their expenses to make sure that they got to Liverpool. Birmingham was quite independent of the party and as late as 1929 was not afraid to show its independence: in that year Neville Chamberlain complained bitterly when he discovered that the Party Chairman had written to businesses in Birmingham for contributions to party funds, for this was regarded as poaching from local preserves. In the previous year, Central Office wished to promote Captain Edwards, the chief agent for Birmingham, to be a Central Office district agent, but they were thwarted by the Chamberlains, who wished to keep him to look after Birmingham; Neville Chamberlain arranged to have Edwards paid enough in Birmingham to keep him there and the interests of Birmingham thus prevailed over those of the party as a whole. In organizational terms, the question of local independence was mainly one of finance. Central party funds could not pay more than a tiny proportion of the total cost of running a local association in every constituency; not paying the piper they were unable to call the tune. The dangers of dependence on rich men would be and were regularly pointed out: if the local parties were not themselves independent then they would have to turn to rich outsiders to fight their elections for them, as The Times pointed out in 1911: If the local organization after an election remained active, on a permanent basis of annual subscription, with a permanent organizing secretary who would attend to the registration work and become the agent at the next election, a candidate could, and probably would, be selected on his merits, and the constituency would be independent of men whose only merit was their wealth. Independence was thus a two-way phenomenon; local parties should be independent not only of central direction but also of individuals. This explains the popularity of Liverpool as a model for local associations after it was publicized in 1911, for Liverpool was popularly believed to exemplify such local independence. So when a new agent was appointed in Ecclesall in 1912 he was recommended as having come from ""the great school of Liverpool, where he worked for Mr James Thompson"" . When the structure of organization in the whole city was reviewed in Sheffield in 1911, it was 10 Salvidge that local Unionists turned for advice, as did the Manchester  Unionists at the same time. When Harold Smith, the brother of F.E., was asked for advice in organization by Huddersfield Unionists, he delivered them a lecture on Liverpool methods, and in the following year they elected F.E. Smith as their President to carry through reforms that would make Huddersfield like Liverpool. When Darwen needed a new agent in 1911, it was to Salvidge rather than Central Office that they turned for help in finding one. Even if Liverpool methods had been universally adopted — and very few areas had the same religious background as Liverpool, the real basis of Salvidge's success — then change would be slow and limited. The most that could yet be achieved was independence from rich outsiders; independence from rich local men was as far away as ever, even in Liverpool. Nor is this surprising when the actual cost of politics is remembered; about $400 a year was needed to finance an effective local party, and this excluded registration or special campaigns. It also excluded the cost of elections, for these were a financial problem for the candidate, not for the local association; in a large county division an election could cost as much as £2,000, and even an unopposed return in a borough would cost a few hundred pounds to the lucky winner. Over a long period then, the cost of elections was still more than the cost of the permanent organization, and this cost was so great as to rule out all but a tiny minority. The cost was indeed so great that there were not even enough rich and unsuitable candidates to buy up the nominations. Many seats went uncontested in 1910 because of the lack of moneyed candidates, and in December Central Office paid out over £100,000 in subsidies. Most of this largesse went to the most hopeless seats, to constituencies where no real preparations had been made, to places where nobody would risk his own money. The effect of this was that Central Office, for all its generosity, did not have much control over the selection of candidates in places where the man selected might actually win, and this did not change much before 1914. Balfour explained this in 1908 over his inability to protect Robert Cecil, ingeniously making a virtue out of necessity: Top talks as if it rested with me to settle who were to be the Unionist candidates for the constituencies. This has never been the Conservative system… Both in theory and in practice we endeavour to have a representative Association in each Division, and on them — and them only — lies the responsibility of selecting their candidate. With that choice the Headquarters of the Party never interfere. In 1912 the same principle was reaffirmed to W. A. S. Hewins by Bonar Law, in a letter that was actually drafted for him by Steel-Maitland: ""If a constituency definitely refuses to accept a candidate, even if the Central Office wish them to do so, they cannot be forced to take action against their will. In the ultimate resort also, the association of a constituency must be held to be the proper exponent of its wishes."" This was not just a polite brush-off, for Steel-Maitland was anxious to find a seat for Hewins (who was a tariff reform professor of economics who would be a great asset in parliament) and finally managed to do so. But Central Office could exert only informal  pressure, since it could neither bully nor bribe its local supporters, and this is exactly what Steel-Maitland set out to do through his district agents. Any change would be gradual and for the time local parties were left with a free choice. Nothing better illustrates the social balance in the party and the fierce independence of the local parties than the argument about the selection of working-class candidates. Resolutions were passed by the National Union in favour of the principle, but as before no local party would put the good intentions into practice. A resolution proposed at the 1912 National Union Conference tells the whole story; originally the resolution approved, ""the candidature of Unionist working men and earnestly recommends the allocation to one of them of a safe and suitable seat at some by-election in the near future, as evidence of the reality of the movement"" . This got to the heart of the matter, the need to make reality out of pious hopes, and it recognized the propaganda value of a contest between a Labour candidate and a Unionist working man in a critical by-election. One such seat would not seem to be an excessive demand in pursuit of an accepted objective, but it was more than the Conference would accept. Steel-Maitland explained that a working man was being selected at Bolton as the choice of the local party, on that very evening, but he did not approve of such specific commitment as the resolution suggested. The recent reorganization of the party had been carried out because""they wanted to get a real popular element in the direction of the party, but no attempt should be made to interfere autocratically from the H.Q. to the constituencies. Time after time he had pressed the claims of a workingman candidate on a constituency"", but they had properly chosen the man who was considered to be most suitable for the constituency. Other delegates supported his view and the motion was amended to read: That this Conference, while recording its desire to see working men in Parliament on the Unionist side, thinks it undesirable that any distinction should be made between them and other members, and therefore expresses the opinion that all Unionist organizations should select and support with all their power the best candidate they can find to represent their constituency, irrespective of his social and financial status. This was little help: giving a working man equality of opportunity was tantamount to rejecting his claims outright, for the scales of wealth and influence would remain weighted against him. Labour's success was based not on equality of opportunity but on the assertion that a working man was more equal than others in his claim to represent the working-class electorate. As long as a Unionist MP had to pay his election expenses, or an association chairman to ""treat"" the party workers, or a constituency delegate to pay his own expenses to a midweek conference, then few working men would ever be selected for any of these posts. The party's real attitude was shown clearly enough in the Conference of 1913, when it reaffirmed its opposition to the payment of MPs (another form of scarcely disguised class discrimination) by  an almost unanimous vote. Funds were organized as before to pay election expenses for working-class candidates, based on Liverpool and Birmingham, and publicised by the Standard and the Morning Post. Hampstead Unionists agreed to support one such fund by levying a guinea subscription from all members of their Executive Committee — a decision that says much about the composition of the Executive Committee itself. Monmouth Unionists backed another fund, but for their own candidate they chose the nephew of their president, Lord Tredegar. Bosworth Unionists agreed to accept ""an assisted candidate"" , but only if no ""man of means"" could be found. And in Bolton, where an assisted candidate was selected by an association with a large working-class element, he found himself facing a Liberal rather than a Labour opponent and went down to defeat. In its social character and its local structures, the Unionist party of 1914 was caught in a dilemma. Old antagonisms had been revived by the tariff dispute, but time would heal these wounds and continue the long-term trend towards one homogeneous propertied elite. This would solve many of the party's difficulties inherited from the past, but it would do little to settle the pressing problems of the present and future. The gradual consolidation of wealth in the party was making it more difficult to preserve the classless, ""one nation"" appeal to working-class supporters. It was increasingly difficult to appeal to the working man whose vote might put the party back into power without antagonizing the wealthy man whose financial assistance was crucial. Robert Sanders noted exactly this problem when the party had to formulate and answer to Lloyd George's land campaign of 1913: ""A certain number of our party go openly for wage boards. Men like St. Audries and Banbury scout the idea and say ""stick to the farmer who is on our side and never mind the labourers whose votes you won"" t get anyhow"". A crushing Unionist victory in 1915, bringing with it disaster for the Labour party and a major setback for the ""New Liberalism"" might have ended the difficulty, but when the First World War intervened the problem remained."
ACA ACA-EW1-002 1.42 "War and Coalition ""Lloyd George would secure a greater hold on the rank and file of our party and he would also be so dependent on that party after the election that he would permanently be driven into the same attitude towards our Party which Chamberlain was placed in before, with this difference — that he would be the leader of it. That would, however, Jam inclined to think not be a bad thing for our Party and a good thing for the Nation. I am perfectly certain, indeed I do not think any one can doubt this, that our Party on the old lines will never have any future again in this country."" (Bonar Law to Balfour, 5 October 1918). The First World War It is often asserted that the First World War rescued the Unionist Party from an impossible position and left it poised to become the dominating force; the war broke up Liberalism and destroyed the Liberal-Labour alliance, so opening the way for Unionism; Lloyd George carried the party to victory in 1918, incurred the odium for the post-war slump and was cast aside ungratefully in 1922. John Stubbs has identified other effects of the war in the growth of backbench activity, the ending of old issues like Ireland and the strengthening of the Unionist case in others, especially tariffs. Such objective judgements have some validity, but they do not distinguish between the positive effects of war and the damaging effects of coalition. In assessing the decline of Liberalism, it is usual to separate the effects of war and coalition, and it is equally necessary in assessing the survival of Unionism. The prospering of Unionism had less to do with the war than is generally assumed, and it was more healthy in 1914 and less certain of prosperity in 1922. Unionists of the time would scarcely have recognized the terms of the debate, for in 1922 the party was still embroiled with Ireland and the House of Lords, held a smaller share of the popular vote than ever before, and was still split as it had been since 1902; few Unionists would have seen the war as a turning-point for the better in the party fortunes. Only after 1922, with the war at last receding from memory and coalition over, did the party take the decisions that led to its successes of the next twenty years. The good effects of war can be detected only in the long term, and there were bad effects too, while the consequences of coalition for the party were immediate and almost wholly negative. It is necessary then to consider in turn the war, the effects of coalitionism, and the years between the end of coalition and the party recovery in 1924. Conservative recovery after war and coalition does not demonstrate recovery because of war and coalition, and indeed the opposite might well have been the case. The effect of the war can be seen under five heads, all following from the actual European conflict: the running of the war effort; the advance of Labour; the advent of democracy in 1918; the effect of war on the party structure and organization; and the effect of war on popular attitudes. The advent of war was not seen by Unionists as a need to turn back to a conventional patriotism, for Unionists had never doubted the patriotism of  their previous stance. In resisting Home Rule and arguing for tariffs, Unionists had seen themselves as acting in the interests of nation and empire against a government that had the interests of neither at heart. The war vindicated the anti-German tone of the tariff campaign, the calls for a stronger navy, the demands for national service, and the defence of the army. If Unionists were vindicated by the war, not just in its taking place but in its nature, then by the same token Liberals were exposed. The war took away the unfortunate necessity, as Unionists saw it, to play with fire in the national interest, but it did not materially alter their view of themselves. If the war brought them more into line with popular feeling, then it was not because they had changed, but because popular opinion (or at least the Liberal-Labour part of it) had at last seen the light. This was demonstrated in the first political crisis of wartime, a carry over from peacetime. Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would become law in the autumn of 1914 and there could now be no election to stop this from taking place. Negotiations centred on the need for national unity in the face of an agreed threat, and provided a test of the genuineness of the parties""commitment to the national cause. A political truce was called within a few days of the outbreak of war; a pact to end contested by-elections was first signed on 6 August, and a joint recruiting drive began before the end of the month. But the Irish and Welsh issues remained; the National Union agreed to approve the truce only on a strict understanding that both issues would be satisfactorily settled. Unionists demanded that both Bills should be frozen in their present position, as passed but not to become law for the duration, but Asquith would not accept this for fear of criticism on his own side. The government thus decided that both Bills would become law, but would then be suspended for the duration. A few Unionists wished to use the Lords to block this procedure, so prompting a constitutional crisis in wartime, but Law and Lansdowne persuaded the shadow cabinet to swallow their feelings. Party opinions were partially assuaged by a protest meeting at the Carlton Club and a demonstration walkout of the Commons by the entire party, but the outcome was not affected, and so Home Rule became law. The success of the party's resistance to Home Rule had been founded on absolute faith that it was the most important issue, but by 1914 this was no longer the case. Nevertheless, the party made only a limited concession; Home Rule's suspension was real, and every attempt to implement it in wartime provoked sufficient Unionist outrage to stop it. Opposition to Home Rule was put on ice for the duration with the Bill, but opposition was as genuine in 1918 as it had been in 1914. In the meantime, the war gave chances to show the responsible nature of the party through its collective action in parliament, through the restraint of its leaders and through the patriotic actions of its individual members. Winston Churchill had welcomed Bonar Law as party leader in 1911 with the reflection that ""if ever a national emergency makes party interests fade, we  shall find in the Leader of the Opposition one who in no fictitious sense places the country and the Empire first"" , a tribute that was certainly justified by Law's role between 1914 and 1918. More than a hundred Unionist MPs were usually away from the House on military service, and 125 Unionist agents served in the trenches; the party organization was used in the war effort at no cost to the country; every local party was decimated by volunteers who joined up in the first rush; and at every level, the number who joined up was more than matched by those indirectly involved through recruiting, raising money, running war charities or breeding remounts. The party as a whole proved the reality of its patriotism from the first days of the war, and the logic of this continuation from peacetime was underlined by the speed with which Ulster Unionists rallied to the flag in 1914, and the gallantry with which they died on the Somme in 1916. The war underlined the Unionist belief in the patriotism of the British people and their belief in the failings of the Liberals, but for themselves it merely confirmed what they knew already. At first all criticism of the running of the war was muted and was aimed at measures rather than men. In parliament it was difficult to adjust to the new situation, whereby the party was supposed to abstain from all criticism of the government but had no say in its decisions. Such an open-ended commitment to a government that most Unionists regarded with contempt could hardly last for long: Law found it convenient to make use of the Unionist Business Committee, constituted in January 1915 as an official opposition group, and he suggested Walter Long as its chairman, so harnessing Long's vindictive powers and giving the party some means of influencing the government without breaking the party truce. It was only the first of many devices that articulated party opinion against governments that the party theoretically supported. Unionist concerns were still as much with traditional areas of disagreement with the Liberals as with the War; the UBC made the running with its concern to shield British industry from the war, much as it had previously been intended to protect it through tariffs, and Stanley Baldwin first made his name through its committees. As John Stubbs has written, ""that backbench activism was centred in such an essentially non-landed element of the Conservative Party tends to confirm the view that the party's centre of gravity was increasingly urbanised, commercialised and industrialised"" . It also reflects the fact that many of the younger, landowning county MPs were simply absent from Westminster; as Yeomanry officers they were liable for service in wartime and, although the Yeomanry could not be compelled to serve abroad, few did not volunteer. The UBC was never more than a small minority of the parliamentary party, with a general attendance of about forty, and its influence was more a result of its being first in the field of opposition, than of its numbers or its members""economic power. It is clear though that the economic tide was running very much in the party's direction in 1915–16; in 1915 the first industrial tariffs for half a century were imposed, and by a Liberal Chancellor; in 1916 even the Manchester Chamber of  Commerce joined in the demand for industrial protection, causing the resignation of its chairman in protest at the abandonment of a century of belief in free trade. In parliament, the bitterest domestic dispute concerned one of the oldest issues of all, drink; Lloyd George proposed restrictions on the drink trade to help the war effort, and suggested that the trade should be nationalized. A pilot scheme was introduced but Unionist indignation was fierce, led by Sir George Younger for the brewers. Bonar Law first welcomed the idea as a means of reducing his party's dependence on ""the trade"" , but opposed it when he recognized the scale of party feeling. Throughout 1915–16 though the issue of increasing importance was the running of the war. A party that had thrown itself so uncompromisingly into the campaign against Home Rule, and which had long ago accepted the need for ""organization"" in domestic affairs, could hardly accept for long the leadership by ineffective compromise which was what Asquith offered. Nor could Unionists, who had flocked to the colours in 1914, accept for long inequality of sacrifice when the nation's greatest need was manpower. Unionists had less compunction than Liberals in employing compulsion for desirable ends, and the Milnerite wing of the party had been preaching the gospel of ""national efficiency"" through organization, making a positive virtue of compulsion. Once the war came, and especially after the flow of recruits proved insufficient in 1915, Unionists called for conscription and for a nationally organized war effort. At first the party leaders resisted such demands as being likely to destroy the party truce and so tried to avoid the public discussion of. such subjects. In February 1915 the National Union Executive refused to sanction a scheme to use the party agents to find recruits, since it ""might savour of compulsion"" and in April the Committee refused to debate a motion on compulsory service because of the party truce. In September, the Executive asked to meet Bonar Law to discuss the subject, now that Unionists were in government, but Law refused any outside discussion until the cabinet had made up its mind. Throughout the winter of 1915–16, Law played for time and stalled demands for a meeting of the Central Council, while Unionist ministers pressed the party case in cabinet. Party opinion was mollified by the Derby Scheme of November 1915, whereby the agents and activists of both parties were used to canvass for recruits; the party organization was turned over entirely to recruiting and the scheme cost the party £29,000. By February 1916 pressure was mounting again, and resolutions calling for compulsory national service were flowing in; the Executive refused to debate them, but passed them on to Law nevertheless. In cabinet Unionists pressed the Liberals steadily towards a full policy of conscription, which was finally introduced in May. Criticism of the running of the war went on though, and in June the Executive passed a resolution calling for a more active prosecution of the War. The Easter Rising in Dublin and the government's abortive plan to rush through a Home Rule settlement caused an even greater furore; this time  Bonar Law had to agree to a meeting of the Central Council, but only alter the cabinet had dropped the Home Rule idea, and with a stipulation in advance that questions would be allowed but not resolutions. Throughout the autumn, the barrage of criticism went on in parliament and in the party. After Carson resigned from the government in November 1915 he became the acknowledged leader of the hardliners, organized in the Unionist War Committee. The UWC was a far more serious threat than the UBC had been: it was entirely outside the control of the party leaders and backed by over a hundred MPs; it was aimed at a government that included Unionists as well as Liberals; and it seemed likely to be a vehicle for the overthrow of Bonar Law by Carson. Its importance was based on two temporary factors, the great Unionist support for its ideas rather than its leaders, and the loyalty of Law to Asquith, which left an opening for Carson. Once Law resolved, after the Nigeria debate of November 1916, that he would work with Carson and Lloyd George to enforce on Asquith the policy that the Unionist MPs wanted, his position was safe. Law's feeling for the sense of the party was less sure than usual in 1916 but, once certain of the party feeling and the national interest, he did not waver in his demand for a different sort of government. Once the political crisis of December 1916 had been weathered and a government had been formed to pursue the Unionist war policy, and with Law himself entrenched at its centre, Unionist support for both Law and for the government remained until the war's end. Agreement on the prosecution of the war remained through 1917 and 1918, and effective opposition to the government passed from the Unionist back benches to the Asquithian Liberals and the House of Lords. From his position as Chancellor, Law could exercise sufficient influence on the domestic management of the war to avoid further problems, and as Leader of the House of Commons and de facto deputy Prime Minister he could also deal with most of the political problems as they arose. So he headed off demands for a capital levy, knowing it to be unacceptable to his party, but Britain nevertheless paid for a higher proportion of the costs of the war from taxation than the other combatants; he was also able to launch the Victory Loan of 1917 at an interest rate of only 5 per cent, having a surer sense of the patriotism of potential subscribers than did the Treasury. There was thus a community of interest in the war between party and government in 1917–18 as there had not been before, and the party was hardly shaken by the secession of a few diehards to form Henry Page Croft's National party. There was no danger that the party would be outflanked on the right as long as the war remained the most pressing national and party interest, and the National party was a complete fiasco. Commitment to the war could have become a problem in itself as the chances of victory became remote. Just as Unionists had rejected an Irish compromise in 1914 after years of commitment to Ulster, so they could not envisage anything short of total victory after the national sacrifices since  1914. When Lansdowne communicated his despair about the war to the press in 1917 and called for negotiations, there was a storm of protest. He had been fading from importance for some time, had been replaced as Unionist leader in the Lords by Curzon and was not a minister under Lloyd George. He was now reviled by the party that he had helped to lead for fifteen years; in his own word he was ""excommunicated"" . Commitment to the war also determined the Unionist response to Lloyd George's disputes with the generals in the winter of 1917–18. Sympathy was with the generals rather than the Prime Minister, hardly surprisingly in view of past events, but sympathy never went far enough to weaken Lloyd George's position greatly. Haig was saved from dismissal by defenders on the Unionist side, but Robertson's removal caused a small stir, and Unionists voted in force to save Lloyd George's face in the Maurice debate. It was doubly difficult for Unionists to resist the substitution of Sir Henry Wilson for Robertson, for Wilson was the most Unionist of all the General Staff and Robertson had not enjoyed good relations with Unionists; Derby's weakness at the War Office and Law's loyalty to Lloyd George were sufficient to defuse the situation. The dismissal of Haig would have been much more serious, but with Law's advice Lloyd George did not take the risk. Over Maurice's allegations, Unionists voted under no illusions; Maurice had indicted Law as well as Lloyd George, and a packed meeting of the UWC under Carson resolved to back the government, not because they believed its explanations but because of their belief in the war. The only alternative to Lloyd George's lies were Asquith's half measures. There was a continuity then in Unionist attitudes to the war, going on into the post-war years in demands for a harsh treatment of Germany after defeat. Lloyd George discovered in 1919, as Law had done in 1914, that a Unionist party that had given its total commitment to a cause would not be fobbed off with a compromise. In the years before 1914 the iron of partisan politics bad entered into the Tory soul, and in the battle for Ulster every weapon had been deemed acceptable. After 1914 there was the same certainty about the war, and it was indeed the inflexible determination of the Unionist party, sure about ends and pragmatic as to means, that was the bedrock on which Britain's war effort rested. Opposition to Home Rule had been canalized into a patriotic war and so the party ended the war in a confident mood, as it had begun it. In the shared community of sacrifice the party had undoubtedly widened its community of interest with the British people, and was able to speak for all of the people in 1917–18 as it had spoken for only an embattled half in 1913. The party therefore reaped the benefit of its national identity in the election of 1918, capturing the mood of the moment as surely as Lloyd George did. In the strident campaign of December 1918 the Unionists were in their element, sure of what must be done as no other party was sure. In its external elements then, the war widened the Unionists""confidence and appeal rather than created it, lining up the nation with the party rather than the reverse. In its domestic aspects though, things had gone very differently: Unionist fears about the growth of Labour extremism had been widespread before the war and had stemmed from two different factors. There had been good reason to know that Labour could damage Unionist electoral prospects and the dangerous prospect of a class-based party system had been present in the Liberal-Labour alliance. Underlying this had been a deeper fear of more extreme socialists, especially the syndicalists, who might threaten violence and revolution. The War threatened to sweep away such fears in the uninhibited jingoism that greeted the outbreak of hostilities. The train was at last ""on different rails"" and Unionists could not fail to rejoice at the disarray on the left, but the different rails might prove more suitable for Trotsky's ""locomotive of History"" than for Unionist imperialism. By 1917 Unionists had more cause to fear than to rejoice, for the Labour movement had been greatly strengthened by the war in both its aspects; increasing membership and growing militancy in the trades unions, growing confidence in the Labour party, the arrival of organized revolutionary extremism in the shop-stewards""movement all pointed to a grim future. The troubles in Sheffield and South Wales, the example of ""Red Clydeside"" and the inspiration of revolutionary Russia might all be signs of a new and terrible future. Unionist fears were based overwhelmingly on ignorance, in isolation from working-class attitudes at home and in the trenches, and on the certainty that things could not be the same again. By 1918 these fears had reached fever pitch; one Conservative MP recalled that his family had expected that the end of the war would be followed by atrocities like those in Russia, that ""families like ours would be strung up from the nearest lamp post"" ; Robert Sanders was surprised to see on Armistice Day that the crowds were actually cheering the King, so unlike the fate of the Russian royal family a few months earlier. Such fears were vastly exaggerated, for if Britain ever did reach a stage of possible revolution, then it was certainly after rather than during the war, but in isolation from working-class opinions, they seemed real enough to Unionist MPs and their supporters in 1918. Unionist reactions were twofold, first to play up the war itself as a unifier of classes, and second to exploit divisions in the Labour movement in the hope of carrying them over into peacetime. The party's first object was the prosecution of the war, and this could be linked convincingly enough with attacks on malingerers and deserters; long after 1902 Unionists had continued to revile radical Liberals (including Lloyd George) as pro-Boers, and this view was easily adaptable to the Labour party in the new war. The campaign for conscription was at least in part intended to force opponents of the war out into the open, so that their lack of patriotism could be exposed when it would be unpopular. When conscription came into force, Unionists pressed for the disfranchisement of conscientious objectors, more because it would be a sign of civic excommunication than because their numbers were significant. The reverse of this policy was a Unionist proposal that all men in the armed  forces should qualify for the franchise as of right. A clear division was to be made then, with all who served their country being enfranchised and all who refused being disfranchised, in both cases irrespective of age or other considerations; the war was to be the test and the policy was to be ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?""  Neither policy was implemented, although gestures were made in each direction. As President of the Local Government Board, Walter Long surprised opponents and supporters alike by the fairness with which he treated conscientious objectors, but local Unionists on the appeals tribunals were far less tolerant. The franchise was eventually widened as a result of the Unionist demand, but not as they had expected. Unionists did though make war service a main plank of their electioneering whenever they had the chance. In 1918 Sanders noted that""I had a contest with Plummer, the Bridgwater Trades Union Secretary. His supporters said he had got wages raised and would get the agricultural labourer 40/ a week. My supporters said ""Sanders went to fight and Plummer did not.""  On such issues are the fates of Empire divided."" After the war, Unionist candidates with commissions, good war records and decorations made the most of their advantages, especially when they could be set against opponents who had opposed the war or stayed at home. Ramsay MacDonald was beaten by such a campaign in 1921 with language that made the general election of 1918 seem tame. As late as 1931, the war records of Labour candidates were still held against them, although by then Ramsay MacDonald, like Lloyd George before him, had been forgiven his sins. Exploitation of divisions in the Labour movement was the concern of only a small number of Unionists, linked mainly with Lord Milner and with Central Office. The British Workers' League was founded under Milner's wing as a front organization that was linked in principle with the coalition as a whole but was run from the Unionist side. Its leader was Victor Fisher and it was dedicated to providing a point around which ""patriotic labour"" could rally. It asserted the need for social reform within a broad imperial policy and attacked the official leaders of the Labour movement for their failure to dissociate themselves from pacifists and militants. In the Labour movement it never made much impact, for it always remained an alien force, financed and directed from outside, but it achieved something in taking the battle on to the streets in order to break up the meetings of the left. Even here more was achieved by the ""patriotic labour"" men who had originated in the Labour movement and stayed in it, such as Jack Jones in West Ham. Central Office had great difficulty finding seats for the candidates of the National Democratic Party (NDP), as the BWL had become by 1918, and it took some time even to find a place for Victor Fisher himself before he was finally installed for Stourbridge. Unionists did not wish to stand down where they had a candidate of their own ready to fight; in these circumstances, the NDP did remarkably well in 1918, winning eleven seats, all in Labour strongholds where neither Unionists nor Coalition Liberals had much desire to stand, and  they beat both MacDonald and Henderson. After the election, though, the NDP faded into the ranks of the coalition majority, having neither roots nor party organization of their own, and Unionist efforts were carried on instead through a Labour wing in their own party. The Labour vote was badly hit by the NDP even in working-class strongholds, but no impression was made on the Labour movement. The general question of Unionist attitudes to Labour was highlighted at the Special Party Conference in 1917 where Law came under a strong attack. He gave his followers an analysis of the situation straight from the shoulder, with no false optimism about the immediate prospects and considerable perception about future events: There is another thing which I know you were thinking about a great deal, which all of us must think about. That is, the future of our Party after the War is over. You would like, I daresay, if I could give you a clear and definite policy. Well, I cannot. We are looking into a fog. It is absolutely futile to try to make plans for conditions which you cannot foresee,(Hear, hear). But this I would say to you. I am not sure that you will agree with me, but I have no doubt about it; our Parry on the old lines will have no future in the life of this Country (Hear, hear). What is the future likely to be? It is all guesswork, but we cannot help thinking about it, and I have thought a great deal about it. There seems to be two possible ways in which our Party can keep its old force. One would be if- I will not say the Labour Party but the extreme Labour Party — were to get so powerful that it would be a menace and we should have thrown on the other scale all that was moderate in the Liberal Party as well as our own Party. That is not going to happen in my judgement without some leader who commands the support of a large section of the country, and I do not see where that leader is going to come from. But the other way in which our Party has a future is the way in which I would like to see it have a future. In the past we have suffered tremendously, because we have always had the whole of organised Labour against us. It is that that defeated our Tariff Reform proposal — that and that alone. Well, gentlemen, there is splitting in all parties, and when you feel that our Party is suffering a great deal, look at the others and ask which of them is worse? There is splitting in all parties, and nowhere is it more marked than in the Labour Party (Hear, hear). Now, gentlemen, this war has shown that among the leaders of Labour there is a body which is national and patriotic (Hear, hear and applause,) and feels these sentiments as strongly as we do. I feel it is our duty to try to get — I will not say on our side but to work with us — the section of Labour which is national and imperialistic (Applause) We have got to get on our side if we can, the section of Labour which recognises that for all classes, employers and employed, production is the one thing to be aimed at (Applause), and that anything which is detrimental to that is detrimental to anybody. Well, gentlemen, you have cheered this. Everybody in our Party welcomes that with their lips, but I will tell you what I think about it, and I am going to speak quite frankly. There are a great many who imagine that we can get Labour to take the shilling for us as it were and to fight simply for our old aims as an adjunct to our Party. That is not going to happen (Hear, hear). If we are going to become part of that larger Party we will have to pay the price. I am not going to attempt today to foresee what that price will be. It may be that it is a price which none of us will  pay. It may be that when the time comes our Party will be divided in regard to this matter. But, gentlemen, of this I am certain, the Conservative Party has been a good thing for this country and it is our business today, and as long as we can, to keep that Party solid; and if splits must come, to delay them as long as we possibly can (Applause). In this single speech, Law foreshadowed the development of the party for the next fifteen years; the strategic dilemma over relations with the other parties after the war, the need to make real concessions to make a coalition workable, the openings that could be created by a national leader of independent reputation (Baldwin as it turned out), and the outcome when the moderate men of all parties came together in 1931. At the same conference, Law warned the Unionists that they must accept the government's plans to extend the franchise, whatever their personal opinions: It is very difficult to see…how you could stop much short of the Bill which is now before the House of Commons. And, gentlemen, I should like to say this also; our Party if it is properly conducted has no reason to fear that the mass of the people in this country will not support it (Hear, hear). If we cannot win that support, we may as well go out of business, and it is our duty now at all events to make the best of the situation which has arisen and to see that everything is done to make our Party what Disraeli called it — and what, if it is to have any existence, It must be — a really national party. It is ironical that one of the most beneficial developments of the war years, the Representation of the People Act of 1918, should have occasioned so much party opposition. Consideration of the franchise bad followed Unionist demands for votes for servicemen, and a Speaker's Conference was set up in 1916, with the Unionist members led by Sir William Bull and Sir Harry Samuel. It seems that a deal was hatched behind the closed doors of the Conference, by which Unionists accepted a widening of the franchise to include all men and some women, in return for a Liberal agreement to accept some plural votes and a complete redistribution of seats. Liberals had argued for a wider franchise for years and Unionists had demanded a redistribution, so both sides got something of what they wanted and proportional representation was thrown in with the present mood of Labour in mind, so that the anti-socialist parties would be able to consolidate their position if necessary. Unionist reactions to these proposals, published and embodied in the Representation of the People Bill early in 1917, were very hostile indeed; it seemed a reckless step to give the biggest ever increase in the franchise in the midst of a major war, to throw away some of the plural votes on which the party had relied, and to receive in return a redistribution that could bring almost anything. A bitter debate in the Executive of the National Union on 8 February 1917 resulted in the setting up of a special sub-committee to consider the Bill; a suggestion that MPs should be ineligible for the sub-committee  because they had let down the party so badly in the Speaker's Conference was only narrowly lost. At the next meeting, the proposals were considered one by one, along with the views of the sub-committee; every proposal was criticized and a highly critical sub-committee report was adopted nem. con., with Sir Harry Samuel finally abstaining after failing to convince his colleagues of the rightness of the proposals. The party view, express d well by the Conservative Agents""journal, was that the Unionists in the Speaker's Conference had been taken in by the Liberal members, that they had not sought or received any professional advice, and that they had blundered accordingly. However, the Central Council recognized in April that a franchise change could not now be avoided, but resolved to support it only if the government would agree to restore the House of Lords at the same time. Reports from the constituencies in May showed 259 local parties against the Bill and only thirty-two in favour; eighty-three suggested no change in wartime; twice as many local parties supported votes for women as opposed the idea, by ninety-eight to forty-four, and there was little or no support for proportional representation. By May the principle of change had been accepted as inevitable, for once an extension of the franchise had been proposed, it would be suicidal for the party to oppose it, and there was thus a need to concentrate on pressing detailed amendments, for example to protect the interests and representation of agriculture. But the partisan warfare went on: Walter Long and his PPS, Sir William Bull (who had been on the Conference himself), reacted angrily to complaints from the agents and suggested that the professional organizers wanted to keep the system as complicated as possible so that they could keep their pay and privileges. The agents took this as a slander on their profession and replied in kind. Bull also continued the fight with greater subtlety through the Daily Telegraph: he wrote for the Telegraph regularly in 1917, either directly as ""our political correspondent"" , or indirectly by feeding information on the Bill to the paper, and this helped to keep at least one part of the Unionist press briefed with the official party line. It was increasingly difficult to see what the party line was: the Chief Whip, Lord Edmund Talbot, had summoned Robert Sanders back from war service and after his return in May 1917 he was pressed into the party's service. Sanders had been a Whip and a specialist in franchise matters before the war, so his return to Westminster gave an added impetus to the party campaign against the Bill; he became a sort of unofficial party Whip against a government that the party supported, cooperated closely with George Younger, by this time Party Chairman, and eventually became deputy chairman of the party himself in 1918. The battle now shifted to parliament, where the second reading was carried by a huge majority on 22 May; many Unionists spoke against the Bill, but few could bring themselves to oppose it in principle, and so Sanders could mobilize only forty MPs to go with him into the No lobby. But this signalized  the beginning of the open fight. In June the National Union finally decided its attitude: it was duly recorded that: the Unionist party…has always been in favour of: 1. An extension of the franchise. 2. [votes for servicemen] 3. Simplification of Registration. 4. An Equitable scheme of Redistribution. 5. All of these proposals to be applicable to the whole of the U.K. 6. Concurrently, a scheme for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber with adequate powers to be introduced. It will thus be seen that the Party is in favour of Electoral Reform being dealt with on a sound basis, but at the proper time. Since reform was now unavoidable it must be made certain that Ireland would be included under the redistribution clauses and that the House of Lords should be restored to entrench resistance to Labour. The details of amendments to the Bill needed to press these points were sent to each Unionist MP, from Central Office not from the official Whips, and a special committee of agents and National Union leaders was set up to give MPs professional advice. By mid July Unionists in the Commons had tabled and spoken to over 160 amendments, with the heaviest burden falling on Younger and Sanders. Pressure was such that the government, in the person of George Cave the Unionist Home Secretary, was frequently forced to allow free votes, so several useful amendments were carried. Instructions to the boundary commissioners were revoked and amended so that they would be able to consider economic interest as well as population and community in the drawing up of the new constituencies; this was regarded as vital by the Unionists, for it seemed likely that the merging of the small boroughs into the county constituencies would take away the last of the agricultural seats. Similarly, an amendment carried in November 1917 did much to nullify the reduction of plural voting rights for town dwellers. Before 1918 electors could have more than one vote, provided that they could quality in different towns or counties; it was now proposed by Unionists that the qualifying area in boroughs should become the constituency rather than the borough itself. A shopkeeper with a shop in Bristol Central and a home in Bristol West would now qualify for a vote in both constituencies; under the new system, there were few ways to qualify for plural votes, but it was much easier actually to qualify, and so tens of thousands of new plural votes were created, overwhelmingly Unionist. At the end of 1917 there was much parliamentary manoeuvring over proportional representation. The original proposal had been for PR in the cities but this was opposed by Unionists who were concerned to protect the efficacy of the business vote; Central Office also opposed the alternative vote when it was put forward in the debates, and the majority of Unionist MPs and the National Union never backed either system. The Commons could not  agree on a scheme and several were inserted in the Bill by a temporary majority of one day and then removed by another majority later. The Lords entered the fray in December with a strong preference for PR as a means of keeping both the Labour party and the Commons in check, so that in January 1918 there were disputes between the two houses as well as between and within the parties. The outcome, perhaps inevitably, was that no new voting system at all was introduced, except for the university constituencies (for it was deemed that graduates would be able to follow the mysteries of PR even if the rest of the electors could not). The Representation of the People Act thus became law in February 1918, ushering in an era of near democracy, increasing the electorate from the 7.7 million of 1910 to 21.4 million in 1918, over three-quarters of whom had never voted before. The Act of 1918 set the scene of the entire political world between the wars, often through consequences that were not seen for a generation. Unionists proved quite able to handle the new mass electorate, and their efforts to gear up to meet new challenges in and after 1911 had set them on the right road. The party took more easily to modern electioneering than did the Liberals, and gained an unexpected bonus in the votes of women, who have been a force for conservatism since their enfranchisement in 1918. What could be anticipated with confidence was the beneficial results of redistribution, for Unionists had expected them for some time. Before the war, Unionists had pointed to the huge disparity between the smallest and largest seats (in 1910 Kilkenny had an electorate of a few hundred and Romford an electorate of over 50,000), and had noted that Unionist constituencies were on average larger than Liberal constituencies, far larger than those of Nationalists in Ireland. ""Increasing population in England and migration of middle-class voters from the towns to the suburbs had led to these disparities and to a situation where any redistribution would help Unionism. In 1911–12 Major Morrison-Bell MP constructed a model to demonstrate these disparities of distribution and had toured the country with it for propaganda purposes; the obvious over-representation of Ireland was especially useful to a Unionist party that wished to claim that Redmond was holding the Empire to ransom. The changes in population in the decade 1901–10, revealed in the 1911 census, demonstrated the rapid increase of population in Unionist areas and the static position in Liberal and Nationalist areas. The LCC area had declined in population by 0.2 per cent overall, but within that Lewisham had increased by 26 per cent and Wandsworth by 34 per cent; the population of Middlesex was up by 42 per cent in ten years, Essex and Surrey both by 30 per cent , while the population of Ireland had fallen by another 2 per cent . Time was clearly on the Unionist side. In the event, the actual redistribution of 1918 came as something of a disappointment, for although there was redistribution within Ireland, the overall number of Irish seats remained the same, and there was only a small increase in the number of English seats. But there was a net gain of some  thirty seats to the Unionists in direct comparison with the last elections in 1910, a strong position for a party that was already the largest in parliament. This position was further improved by the effective withdrawal of Sinn Fein from Westminster after the election of 1918 and the second redistribution in Ireland in 1921 after the Government of Ireland Act, which gave another bonus""to the Unionists by removing about seventy opponents from the House of Commons. The net effect of the Acts of 1918 and 1921 was thus to improve the Unionist position by a hundred seats, not just in that parliament but in every succeeding one too. In other words, quite apart from the franchise changes that did the party no net harm, the changes of 1918–21 transformed the Unionists from the natural minority that they had been in 1914 to a natural majority party until the Second World War. Under the electoral system of 1918, the Unionists had a minimum vote of at least 38 per cent of the electorate, and this would bring at least 250 seats in a parliament of 615; in a political world of three parties this almost guaranteed that no other party would govern alone and that the Unionists would usually have a majority. Within this there was an equally important change, for not only did the number of Unionist seats increase, but so did the number of safe seats. Neal Blewett found just forty-eight ""predominantly middle-class"" constituencies in 1910, while Michael Kinnear found seventy-five in 1921 (and Kinnear's figure is certainly an understatement, for he could not get figures for divided boroughs outside London, many of which certainly would come into his category, so the real figure may be more like ninety). The already safe seat at Wandsworth was divided in 1918 into five safe seats; Lewisham, Hammersmith and Fulham were each divided into two seats; the number of seats in the outer London suburbs of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Middlesex went up from fifteen to forty, of which thirty-five were held by Unionists at every election before 1945. The value of such an expansion of political suburbia has been demonstrated by Michael Kinnear. There were 200 seats with a substantial middle-class element, and these were overwhelmingly Unionist at each election between the wars. If the agricultural seats are added to the middle-class strongholds, it can be seen why Conservatism was so strong between the wars, for the party could count well over 200 seats as unshakably safe and on 300 as reliable enough to be won except in a very bad year. At a time when many middle-class voters would be looking for the party that would best defend them from Labour, this Conservative strength would be of vital importance. The Conservatives would not always win under the electoral system of 1918, but they would rarely do so badly as to allow anyone else to win. The revival of activity occasioned by the 1918 Act and its redistribution may have helped to revive local Unionist parties, but in fact the war had a less serious effect than might be expected. In the first months, when hostilities were expected to last for only a few months, party activity was hardly affected at all. A registration campaign was conducted in the autumn of 1914  and Central Office encouraged the continuation of normal activities. Continuation of the war in 1915, together with the absence of key figures at every level, led to a suspension of all but routine party business. The typical pattern was for the local parties to meet only once a year in 1915 and 1916, to re-elect their officers for another year; agents who had enlisted were kept on the books by retaining half their normal pay, to compensate them for loss of earnings in the national interest and to keep them available for a resumption of partisanship. Central Office tried to keep the local parties alive, for the party truce was only renewed for a few months at a time and parliament was prolonged beyond its five-year term only for a few months at a time too. Subscriptions fell steadily and expenditure fell even more sharply with the reduction of salaries and the suspension of propaganda, so that most local parties ended the war with a substantial profit; but this concealed a real weakness, for expenditure could be revived by a single decision, while income could only be revived by many years of patient work. In 1917 the state of readiness slipped further, with most local parties holding no meeting at all, some sacking their agents, and closing their offices. The agents who remained operated a skeleton service for several constituencies, with the salary shared out too; they visited each office once a week to answer letters and transact routine business; the Annual Report for the Yorkshire Area for 1916–17 claimed ""we still say no offices entirely closed"" but this was no longer a realistic picture of party activity. Things had got even worse on the voluntary side, for without subscriptions to collect or canvassing to do, the whole basis of the voluntary party had gone. The Yorkshire Annual Report for 1920 recalled that ""November 1918 found all Party organizations the worse — not for War but for inactivity"" . The party structure was probably saved by two features, the recruiting of 1915–16 and the need to cope with the Representation of the People Act in 1918. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee ran the national campaign for recruits in the first eighteen months of the war, through party rather than national channels. The Committee was convened by the Chief Whips of the parties, and the chief professional organizers became joint secretaries. Boraston was thus directly involved in administration, and Central Office looked after the organization of recruiting meetings; the Liberal offices dealt with literature for recruitment and Malcolm Fraser was transferred to Abingdon Street to help with the management of the press. The entire effort was run like a political campaign, with the canvassers, speakers, stewards and publicity all run on tried and familiar lines. District and constituency offices were similarly involved and in many areas the national example was followed, with the agents of both parties working under a mayor or lord lieutenant. The Derby Scheme of 1915 allowed the local parties to mount a full-scale exercise in canvassing and knocking-up. When the state took over recruitment under the Military Service Acts, the party continued to be involved: many agents were transferred to the army, where they continued to  do the same job, and many party offices were lent to the government as recruitment centres. In 1917 party organization was used for the War Savings and War Aims movements. This all reflects the important part that political organizations played in the Edwardian era, for when politicians needed means of communication and organization in a time of crisis it was to the parties rather than to the state that they turned for the machinery and the expertise; it was not to be the same in 1939, with consequent effects on the state of the local parties by 1945. Through recruiting and War Aims publicity. even tapers and tadpoles could play their part in the national cause. Central Office was able to keep going at full capacity through 1915 and 1916, but here again there was a falling off in 1917. Boraston was so much involved in war work that his assistant. William Jenkins. had to be promoted to Joint Principal Agent to look after the party. and he was also given a promise of the reversion of Boraston's job. By this time too there were economies in staff and publications because of the war: Gleanings and Memoranda, the Constitutional Year Book and other semi-partisan pieces of literature were suspended in 1917 for the duration. The middle of 1917 saw the party at its lowest ebb, but the demands of an approaching general election produced a recovery. Professional advice was important to the MPs fighting the Representation of the People Bill and National Union committees began to meet again at every level to discuss the Bill's consequences for the party. There was a conference in late 1917, the Executive met regularly. and the Central Council met a record four times in 1917. The rules of the national Union were changed to allow a special appeal to working-class and women voters. Constituency parties had to be wound up and re-formed to conform to the new boundaries. and all this at the worst point of the war. Local campaigns to resist unsatisfactory new boundaries were run and in some cases were very successful. In Cheshire the plans put forward by the boundary commissioners were opposed by local Unionists and counter-proposals put forward by their chairman, Sir Alan Sykes. were adopted instead: this produced a new constituency called Eddisbury. which would be a most peculiar shape. but which would be almost wholly agricultural — and strongly Unionist. Finally. the passage of the Act into law made a general election a certainty in the near future. For the local parties this increased the urgency of changing the local structures and settling candidates; for Central Office it meant the negotiation of a pact with the Coalition Liberals and the NDP, the arrangements of a joint platform. and the production of anti-Labour party literature. all of which were under discussion from the spring of 1918. In every way, then, the party organization emerged from the war years in reasonably good shape; it had played its part in the war and its local and national structures were attenuated but intact (a major and significant contrast with the effect of war on the Liberals). and a large reform had been carried out with little trouble. Great efforts would be needed to restore the party to its strong position of 1914 and to carry on with  the fundamental changes that had been under way then, but the war years had done no lasting damage. The final effect of the First World War was less tangible, the impact of war on the attitudes of Unionists themselves, but there is no doubt that the holocaust did leave lasting effects. The effect of war on religion was among the most profound of these influences. For the party that had leaned heavily on the established Church and derived satisfaction from its role as defender of the Church, the decline of religion was a serious blow. After the war clouds rolled away old arguments about Home Rule were quickly resumed, but the issue of the Welsh Church was easily settled: Lloyd George offered compensation and the Welsh Church was duly disestablished in 1920 with little Unionist complaint. The House of Lords, trade unions, and licensing continued to raise as much heat as before in Unionist minds, but the issue of the Church was drowned in the mud of Flanders. Fisher's Education Act of 1918 raised far less sectarian strife than Balfour's had done in 1902, less even than Butler's was to do in 1944. In part the death of the old politics of Church and Chapel was a consequence of the catastrophic effect of the war on militant Nonconformity, and especially on Nonconformist Liberalism, but in part it was also due to a new doubt on the Unionist side. The Prayer Book debates of 1928 and the arguments over tithes in the 1930s showed that many Unionists still counted the interests of the Church high in their priorities, but the battles were no longer party ones. The party was as sure as ever about Christian principles, and the advent of women into the organization may even have strengthened the connection, but there was no longer certainty about forms and institutions. Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms, and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself. Bonar Law became ever more pessimistic after the death of his sons in action in 1917, but the reaction of Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain was more positive. To both of them, the human sacrifice of 1914–18 created not just a deep loathing of war but also a determination that such sacrifice should not be in vain. Baldwin had a profound distaste for those who had made money out of the war and in 1919 he made an anonymous donation of part of his wealth to the nation as his personal sacrifice; Neville Chamberlain was greatly affected by the death of his cousin Norman and determined that such sacrifice should not be wasted. For many there was a conviction that the post-war world must be made a better place, a view that recurred regularly over the next twenty years. In 1925 Winston Churchill, no empty idealist, introduced his pension scheme with the hope that the sufferings, the sacrifices, the sorrow of the war have sown a seed from which a strong tree will grow. This is the finest war memorial you could set up to the men who gave their lives, their limbs, or their health, and those who lost their dear ones in the country's cause. For the older men, who had sent their sons to slaughter, there remained a determination to make conditions better; for the younger men there was an almost obsessive guilt at having survived the holocaust when so many friends had died. In their different ways. Harold Macmillan and Anthony Eden shared the same reaction; the young Robert Boothby was one of the few who were disappointed by the Armistice, because he had been too young to fight. Not everyone was affected by the war in this way. but a large group in the party were scarred by the First World War for the rest of their lives. and as a result the party acquired a moral calibre that it had not had before. The Unionist party thus emerged from the war reassured in its identity as the national party, more closely in touch with the national mood than in 1914, with its electoral prospects much improved. but, like the rest of the nation, affected deeply by the war. The only cloud, and in 1918 a threatening thunderstorm to all appearances. was the challenge from Labour. The struggle to determine the party's attitude to the aspirations of Labour was to be its chief battleground for the next six years. Coalition troubles, 1915–1921 For ten years after 1914 the theme of party was accompanied by a strong counterpoint: the idea of coalition. For Rosebery, for Milner, even for Lloyd George, there had been temptation in coalition ever since the Boer War, but such dreams had never come into the political daylight. But when war came the persistent pedal-point of coalitionism sounded all the louder for the sudden silence of the party truce. A coalition government was formed in May 1915, continued under Lloyd George in December 1916, and carried over into peacetime in 1918. Once established, coalition proved difficult to shift and coalitionists developed an ideology of their own. During Lloyd George's premiership, the counterpoint of coalition almost drowned the theme of party, and many Unionists feared for the survival of politics as they knew it. The coalition facilitated a realignment from the two-party Liberal-Unionist contest in 1914 to the Labour-Conservative battles of the late 1920s; only with the triumph of coalition in 1916 did the old politics die, and only with the destruction of coalitionism in 1924 could the new politics be born. It is necessary to examine the idea of coalitionism and the political forces that made it a powerful alternative before considering its direct impact on the Unionist party. The most positive argument for coalition, and the one that tipped the balance in its favour, was the experience of war. The Boer War brought the first murmurs of coalitionism, a sense of national crisis brought the first attempt to form a coalition, and the advent of the First World War made it a practical possibility. In each case the argument was much the same: in crisis, it was the duty of politicians to come together so that the best men could be used to the greatest advantage, and so that shibboleths of party could be discarded. Without a combination the nation could not be properly mobilized, for any party government would be opposed by half the nation, and would be forced to consider its own extremists as more important than moderates on the other side. Coalition was the negation of the party system, for as party assumed a grouping from the centre to one of the extremes, coalition assumed a grouping at the centre to the exclusion of extremists. A coalition in 1910 would have excluded Ulster, Irish Nationalists, and Labour; coalition in 1915 excluded anti-war MPs and diehards. The very existence of coalition meant a struggle for the survival of party, a struggle that the Liberals lost, that Labour  won by keeping clear, and that Unionism almost lost too. By May 1915 Unionist leaders were convinced that they must give up some independence if they were to influence the war; the liquor issue seemed to show the danger of staying aloof, and the shell scandal seemed to show that they were needed inside. National and party interest thus combined to make Sonar Law promote a coalition, but it was the national interest that was cited as the reason for joining Asquith. It was also the national cause that prompted Law to accept a junior position; he took the Colonial Office himself, a backwater in wartime, and Liberals retained most of the major posts. In a negative way, Unionists had an important influence on the new government. securing the removal of Haldane, the demotion of Churchill and the placing of munitions under Lloyd George. Unionist ministers were also able to move the Liberal majority closer to the Unionist view of how the war should be run, notably on conscription and compulsion. Asquith's 1915 government was only halfway to coalition; it was in fact a coalition of parties rather than a coalition of men, and it was run so as to maximize continuity. Unionists were therefore soon frustrated by what seemed the weakness of their leaders in swallowing- Asquith and getting nothing in return. In parliament the position seemed worse now that the Unionist leaders sat on the government front bench while their followers continued to sit as the opposition. But it was the continuing failure in the war and Asquith's inability to take important decisions in time that really fuelled Unionist discontent in 1916. By the summer of 1916 the Unionist backbenchers were used to voting against the government. and were close to acting as a full opposition again under Carson. In the crucial Nigeria debate in November Law actually did quite well, for he persuaded a narrow majority of Unionists to back the government. At the height of the criticism, Law met constituency chairmen and agents at the Queen's Hall and told them that the question whether or not this government was wise must be judged on very broad grounds. This is the question which everyone ought to ask himself, and the only question — are we as a nation in a better position to prosecute the war as a consequence of it than we would have been by any other arrangement? I have no doubt of it. A year later he recalled that he had supported Asquith because""rightly or wrongly. I was afraid of any alternative at the time"". In 1916 he cited conscription and the suspension of trades union restrictions as things that coalition had done for the nation; Gleanings and Memoranda headlined the speech ""The Coalition Form of Government almost indispensable.""  The argument for coalition was pragmatic. that no other government was fitted to the war effort, but it had significant undertones: coalition was especially useful in providing the party with allies more able to secure the cooperation of the working class. Although the Nigeria debate was a relative success after a year of criticism, its significance was not lost on Law: it was held on the subject central to  Unionist economic attitudes; Law and Steel-Maitland were singled out for censure, a pointer to the level of party discontent Party feeling had built up much as Law's own had done; having fought off the direct attack, he took the party along with him in the effort to reconstruct the government on more businesslike lines. There is no question of Carson, Law and Lloyd George conducting a conspiracy to unseat Asquith in December 1916; Law and Lloyd George at least wished to retain Asquith in government and they kept him informed about their plans. Asquith's fall was the result of his own miscalculation, especially of his reluctance to believe that the Unionists would prefer Lloyd George to himself in a contest. When the real crisis broke the Unionist ministers acted to strengthen Lloyd George's hand, from a conviction that only greater power for Lloyd George could put enough drive into the war effort. Unanimity was less marked in the scramble for office after Asquith's departure; ""the three Cs"" , Curzon, Chamberlain and Cecil, managed to keep official party interests to the fore by ensuring that Curzon rather than Carson should join the war cabinet — disloyalty might be useful but it should not be seen to pay. For the rest of the war, the party's loyalty to Lloyd George was strengthened when he became not only the organizer of victory but the inspiration of the country. National service remained the prime reason for coalition. With the approaching end of war in 1918 coalition became more positive because the coalition now had to deal with the issues that had been put aside for the duration, and more controversial because this pushed some Unionists into outright opposition. The government had prepared ambitious reconstruction plans, partly devised to put a moral basis into the war effort and partly produced by progressive ministers and their advisers. It could now be argued that the unity of wartime should be carried on to deal with peacemaking, demobilization and economic reconstruction. The government that had won the war would smooth the transition to peace and would redeem its promise of a land fit for heroes. Such was the argument adopted by most Unionist candidates in the 1918 election, a positive programme of the sort put forward by Lloyd George in 1910. A deal on the government's actual policies was done, again like that proposed in 1910, except that the Unionists now held rather more of the cards. The basis of the argument was still the national interest, but the emphasis was now on positive domestic possibilities rather than on negative foreign problems. Underlying the Unionist acceptance of coalition in 1918 was a darker attitude to the future than appeared in the coalition programme. It was important to retain Lloyd George, not just as the man who had won the war but also as a man who could talk to the working class; and if a revolutionary situation were to arise, then it would be far better if Unionists could call on Liberals to help resist it. The post-war coalition thus had two distinct justifications, a positive sense of what could be done and a negative dread of the alternative. In 1920 Birkenhead put forward both lines of argument when  he argued for greater coalition cooperation in the press. Gradually. though. the failure of coalition policies. failure to deliver the goods in almost every sphere. reduced the positive side of the argument to nothing. By 1922 coalition was based on fear, though by that time on fear of parliamentary Labour rather than revolution as such. It was still possible to argue. as Younger did in January 1922, that a coalition could best carry through the policies that Unionists wanted, but by then the main Unionist demands were directed against Labour anyway. the reform of trade union law and restoration of the House of Lords. By the autumn, the arguments for coalition were entirely negative. Coalitionism, though. was a matter of men as well as measures. The change to a real coalition in 1916 had been occasioned by the need to give Lloyd George a freer hand as much as by concern for structures. The government then developed a momentum of its own as a focus of loyalty that ran against the party system. There had always been more in common between the front benches than either had in common with their followers in the country. By 1920 several Unionists actually thought of themselves as coalitionists. Austen Chamberlain made no secret of his belief that coalition produced better government than party. and he reached a stage of heavy dependence on Lloyd George; Birkenhead found it more congenial to work with men of ideas like Churchill than with the squires who would fill out a Unionist ministry; Balfour had always striven to practise government by agreement. and Curzon was attracted by the glamour of the ""first eleven"" . By 1922 the team of brilliant men who had governed for the past six years could not but see themselves as irreplaceable. They could not easily accept a return to old party cries or the need to oppose men who had become close friends. Nor were such responses confined to the cabinet, for many Unionist MPs could not bring themselves to oppose Lloyd George in 1922 after six years of backing him, and one at least never broke the habit: ""He had become fascinated by Lloyd George. and until the end of his life he would not allow a word of criticism to be heard in his house. If anything went wrong in any part of the world he always said ""That's because you got rid of the little man"" . ""In the organization too there were exponents of continued cooperation; although Younger worked to defeat coalition in 1922 he did not rule it out as a future possibility. Locally. electoral pacts between Liberals and Unionists to resist municipal Labour created the same direct contacts and in some places the pacts remained for the rest of the inter-war years. Coalitionism was not then only a political creed, but also a web of friendships and habits that underpinned political cooperation. By 1922 it was for some such a strong attitude as almost to obliterate the normal responses of party. Coalitionists saw well enough the contradiction between politicians who were elected through parties and a government that was the negation of party. and party men saw it too; hence the contentiousness of the various schemes to square the circle by fusing the two coalition partners into one  organization. Coalition had become a political habit that would be quite difficult to break and had sapped the party's confidence in itself. Most MPs who voted against Lloyd George in 1922 did not envisage a Unionist government as the final outcome, and the defeated ministers did not expect their discomfiture to be permanent. When coalition died in 1924, not all recognized that coalitionism must die with it. In the coalition years the party encountered severe difficulties, some endemic to coalition as such, some related to the times, but together they created a general frustration from which the party was lucky to emerge so well. The first source was frustrated ambition: for seven years from 1915 the party had a share of government. but not a full or fair share. In the Asquith coalition Unionists had eight cabinet posts and Liberals thirteen, although there were far more Unionists in the Commons. Unionists had a majority in Lloyd George's war cabinet, but were little better placed in his government as a whole. From 1916 Unionist MPs were the only reliable support for the government. and from 1918 they had a parliamentary majority of their own, with three times as many seats as the rest of the coalition, but they never held as many as half of the government posts. as table 7.1 demonstrates. At the highest level, Unionists could be satisfied, for they held the most prestigious offices, but the number of jobs was never sufficient to reward the deserving aspirants. Throughout the coalition, there were never more than fourteen offices of cabinet or departmental rank to satisfy the combined ambition of 300–359 MPs and a large number of peers. Normally, the ratio was roughly equivalent to one post for every seven MPs; in coalition, Liberals were appointed on a ratio close to that norm, but Unionists had a proportion of jobs to MPs more like one to twelve or fifteen. Table 7.1 Unionist share of coalition governments, 1915–1922 Cabinet Unionists in Total no. of Total no. of Ministers cabinet ministers Unionists May 1915 22 8 24 9 December 1916 23 13 32 14 January 1919 21 10 30 14 January 1921 21 12 29 14 October 1922 22 11 29 13 The discontent caused by lack of opportunity can be clearly seen in a number of cases, but was a general phenomenon that affected all but the top dozen in the party's collective leadership. At its simplest, about a dozen men were not ministers who would have held office in a Unionist government. and about thirty junior men did not hold a post at all as a result of coalition. (And this at a time when the Unionists could install their own government whenever they wished, through their control of both Houses.) Selborne had resigned from Asquith s government in 1916 and was not offered a post by Lloyd George. From the House of Lords and the National Union he became a  thorn in the flesh of the party leaders, where in a party government it would have been inconceivable that such a man, at the height of his powers and with powerful connections. should be left out. Steel-Maitland had been appointed Party Chairman in 1911 to a post ""of cabinet rank"" , and had served loyally for four years without pay or reward. When the Asquith government was formed there was of course no post for such a recent recruit to the front bench. He wrote to Law to protest when he was offered only an under secretaryship. pointing out that he had only accepted the Chairmanship because of the offer of a cabinet post. Law consulted Balfour and replied that Balfour had not promised in such a way as to bind his successor. that ""of cabinet rank"" did not imply a seat in the cabinet (if not. it is hard to see what it did imply!), and that all must make sacrifices. For eighteen months Steel-Maitland worked with Law at the Colonial Office, a useful liaison that kept the leader and Chairman in close touch. When Lloyd George formed his government. there was a bitter exchange of letters, for Steel-Maitland was now expected to serve under Walter Long. an old enemy. In disgust Steel-Maitland resigned as Party Chairman and in 1919 he despaired of ever getting a senior post and resigned from the government too. He was a man of strong ambition and had a doubtful reputation as an intriguer, but he was an able man who had deserved better of his party. After six years as Chairman, he knew all the important party figures and he became a dangerous foe; in the National Union he combined with Selborne to mount a campaign against coalition and as a Birmingham MP he threatened even- Austen Chamberlain's home base. In normal times, Selborne and Steel-Maitland would have been tolerated and both would have been at least partially silenced by the restraint of office. The same can be said of the junior ministers who finally wrecked the government in 1922; many of these would have been cabinet ministers in a party government. as indeed they were in 1922–23, but they had few prospects under coalition. The careers of Bridgeman. Wood, Amery. Sanders and Lloyd-Greame would at the least be held up for years by coalition, for there was no room for their promotion. This is not to say that they opposed coalition in 1922 merely from personal motives; they had a legitimate ambition to serve their country and resented what they saw as the promotion of less able Liberals. They could only blame the coalition system. for only a change of system would give them their chance. In 1918 Sanders thought he had a chance to become Chief Secretary for Ireland, but was soon reduced to considering himself as a possible Speaker; in 1921 he was passed over for Chief Whip because it did not suit the coalition to have such a partisan in so sensitive a post. and he was fobbed off with an under-secretaryship; in 1922 he worked actively to bring the coalition down. The cases of Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Derby illustrate a different truth about coalition. Both held high office under Lloyd George. but both chose eventually to leave the government. Derby was a weak man whose subservience could usually be taken for granted (in Haig's words he was like  ""the feather pillow [who]bears the marks of the last person who has sat on him"" ), but he was very conscious of his position in the party. Lloyd George dominated him but could never prise him away from his party roots; when Lancashire opinion moved away from coalitionism in 1922 Derby moved with it, and provided the opposition with added credibility. Cecil was more concerned with policy than with party or personal ambition; he parted company with Lloyd George over the League of Nations and post-war diplomacy; once outside the government he manoeuvred with other discontented ""outs"" . with Steel-Maitland to project Grey as a possible national leader, and with Salisbury to provide principled leadership for discontented Unionists. Thus the existence of coalition served to divide the collective leadership by separating those who had power and influence from those who did not, by separating the senior men from their junior colleagues and by cutting off those under the Prime Minister's influence from the rest. Difficulties were accentuated by personal prejudices that had not been broken down. The senior ministers fell easily into the habit of cooperation. but many in the party refused even to attempt the transition. Lloyd George had been the Liberal most hated before 1914 and. after a brief honeymoon with Unionists in 1917–18, he regained his old standing by 1920. Early in 1918, a meeting of Unionist leaders considered future relations with Lloyd George and ""Bob Cecil and Curzon [were]against touching him on the ground that he is such a dirty little rogue"" . To diehards, Lloyd George was ""the"" Welsh Walpole ""and friend of MacDonald who would peddle any opinion and give in to any Labour leader if it would help him to stay in office"" . Neville Chamberlain referred to him as ""this dirty little Welsh attorney"" and Stanley Baldwin called him, somewhat ambiguously. ""the goat"" . There was then a deep distrust throughout the party. as Law discovered in 1920: Bonar addressed a mass meeting. He spoke on excess profits, negotiations with Russia and Ireland. His audience was against him on all these questions and there was no enthusiasm. After the meeting he said to one of the local people that it was very unlike the Last Conference in 1913 when he attacked L.G. for 45 minutes amid great applause. The local man replied ""There would have been as much enthusiasm if you had done the same tonight.""  The honours scandals, the employment of the press lords, incessant changes of policy, and a profligate waste of money were all taken as signs of the degradation of office by Lloyd George. Other Coalition Liberals were disliked as warmly as Lloyd George, more for their present policies than for their past. Edwin Montagu was accused of anti-British motives for his Indian policy; with Reading as Viceroy there were openings for the diehards""latent anti-semitism. Christopher Addison was unpopular because of his advanced social policy and he was eventually driven out by the Unionists. But the bête noire second to Lloyd George was Churchill, whose war record seemed to prove all that Unionists had alleged about his excitability and his unfitness for office. Law was very angry when  Churchill was put in office by Lloyd George in 1917, and the National Union resolved that it was ""an insult to the Army and Navy and an injury to the Country"" . The men at the head of coalition Liberalism were therefore execrated as dangerous. corrupt. or irresponsible enemies. and the same gulf separated Unionists from the rest of the party. especially when the ""coalies"" tried to keep open their avenue of escape by parading their Liberalism. At Leamington, in May 1920, the coalitionists were finally driven out of the Liberal party. but Walter Long only noticed what they had said before they were excommunicated: We have been patient. loyal. self-sacrificing and what do we find? Our Liberal colleagues go down to Leamington and ask the audience to believe that they are just as Liberal as ever they were. In other words that there has been no Coalition, no mutual concessions. but that they have swallowed us. To frustrated ambition was added frustrated partisanship. as Unionists were denied the opportunity to criticize men who were still regarded as enemies. just because they were colleagues. Some refused to accept the restriction but many more nursed resentment in their hearts. Throughout the coalition Ireland, the Empire and the House of Lords continued to divide Liberals and Unionists as always. Over India the Unionists resented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms in general. but nothing stirred their animosity more than the treatment of General Dyer after the massacre at Amritsar. Dyer was applauded by the diehard press to make up for his censure by the government. and a collection for his benefit soon raised $15,000. Any post-war government would have met Unionist critics in its reconsideration of Britain's imperial role, but the existence of a bipartisan policy did not help to secure acceptance. Criticism ran along similar lines over Lloyd George's middle eastern policy. and over his preference for Greece over Turkey. Ireland provided a clearer division. Unionists were critical of Ulster obscurantism when voiced by Carson in 1918 and in no mood to fight another war in Ireland, but neither would they tolerate the coercion of Ulster. While Asquithians were attacking the Black and Tan policy as immoral, the Unionists were accusing the government of irresolution. The truce of 1921 was attacked as a typical piece of Lloyd George chicanery, and it needed all the efforts of the party leaders to stop the party from breaking up the government there and then. Finally. the House of Lords was a prime domestic reason for Unionist acceptance of coalition. but a constant source of friction. No agreed reform plan had been forthcoming in 1917–18 but it remained an agreed priority of the government to the end, and pledge after pledge was given. Each year it was put off because of the impossibility of devising an acceptable scheme. It was exactly the issue that could be best settled by a bipartisan government. for that would avoid charges of the gerrymandering of the constitution; time would show whether the coalition would deliver the goods, and coalition would be judged accordingly. In all these policy questions. and in the others that still separated the parties. the party reacted as an independent group and not as a partner, for the Lloyd George government was never a focus of loyalty for Unionists. Complaints about government appointments or policies could only be met by Law with the barren reply that the party could not expect total control and that in coalition such things must happen — which is just what the critics were saying too. Individual Unionists played important parts in the government and many Unionist policies were implemented in full, but the party as a whole never took the government to heart as its own. The party never indeed accepted coalition as an idea; a majority of MPs accepted the advice of its leaders to keep the actual government in being. but it was always a decision for now, never one for always. Coalition thus involved inevitable difficulties which could only be kept in check as long as the sense of crisis lasted. The decision to continue collaboration after 1918 can only be understood through the actual events of that year. Active consideration of the future began early in the year. for a general election could not be long delayed after the new franchise came into effect and the war was at a particularly gloomy stage. No advice to the government expected victory before 1919 at the earliest, and after the rout of the Fifth Army in March 1918 defeat stared the government in the face. So in the winter of 1917–18 murmurs of opposition began to grow louder than at any time since Lloyd George became Prime Minister, the Asquithians revived their interest as they scented a chance to bring Lloyd George down. and the press became more hostile — The Times and the Morning Post as well as the Liberal papers. The idea of a general election was therefore a tempting one for the government. for a khaki election like that of 1900 would present the government as the war party and leave Asquith and the Labour party no way to avert destruction. In March 1918 the Unionist leaders agreed to open up negotiations with Lloyd George's supporters and set up a subcommittee of Law, Long. Younger and Clyde to investigate. Behind the scenes talks about a coalition programme were initiated and the party""managers met to share out the candidatures for the projected election. By July an outline agreement had been presented to Law and Lloyd George, by which 150 seats were allocated to Coalition Liberals, but no decision of principle was taken. Throughout this tine, the assumption was that the government was seeking a mandate to continue the war, and as late as October Bonar Law could still see ""almost no chance of any joint action of this kind unless it is begun as the result of an election which takes place during the war and under the pressure of war conditions"" . But by that time a renewed coalition and a coalition election would not be arranged to get a mandate for war so much as to reap the benefits of victory. A few months later Sanders recalled that Lloyd George had""prophesied great unpopularity for the government during the period of demobilisation and said if we had an election in the Spring we might get a  Bolshevik Government. I always held that view and did all I could to press for an election before Christmas in order that we might get a majority large enough to stand the racket."" In the course of negotiation. the Unionist leaders realized how much of their own programme could be extracted from Lloyd George. and they recognized too the enormous boost to his prestige that had come with victory. For Law, the issue was that many Unionists would in any case feel compelled to support Lloyd George and that he might command a large personal following in the constituencies; it would be useful to capture him as Joseph Chamberlain had been captured in 1886. There was then little belief in the value of the Coalition Liberals, but a strong belief in the value of Lloyd George; he would be a good advocate with the new electorate and he would in due course be disarmed as Chamberlain had been. As Law told Balfour,""that would be not a bad thing for our Party. and a good thing for the nation"". The final decision was taken at the end of October, with victory only a few days away, and was announced with the publication of a letter from Lloyd George to Bonar Law, a letter actually drafted by Law as a summary of their agreement. By the time that the deal was presented to Unionist MPs on 12 November, two important developments had taken place. The war had come to an end, so an election would now be very soon indeed, and Asquith had turned down Lloyd George's suggestion that he rejoin the government. Law supported the offer to Asquith, and it was logical for him to do so; a government bent on post-war reconstruct on and resistance to Labour would be strengthened by Asquith's presence. But Asquith's refusal greatly strengthened the Unionist position. as it left Lloyd George wholly dependent on his allies. The deal done between the Whips was in any case a good one for the Unionists: Coalition Liberals would have a free run in 150 constituencies (a figure suggested by Guest, but then rigidly adhered to by Younger). but Unionists would have at least twice as many, and they would now be free to attack sitting Asquithians too, and with Lloyd George as an ally. The joint manifesto proclaimed that imperialism would be the coalition's chief objective. and on specific issues that interested the Unionists Lloyd George promised an open mind on tariffs and no coercion of Ulster. Commending this agreement to his followers, Law was anxious that they recognise the advantage of Lloyd George as an ally, for ""at this moment, Mr Lloyd George commands an amount of influence in every constituency as great as has ever been exercised by any Prime Minister"" . Law was equally keen to point out that little was being risked, and to set at rest the fears of his supporters: What I propose does not mean that our Party is going to cease to exist. We go into this election — at least if I have my way — as a Unionist Party forming a portion of a coalition. I should be sorry if it were otherwise. From the time that my colleagues in the House of Commons did me the honour of electing me to be their leader I  have felt that I was in the position of a trustee; and even throughout the war the one thing that I have aimed at constantly has been to preserve. if it could be done, the unity of our Party. What was proposed was not the submersion of party in a wider unit, but a parliament of collaboration between independent groups; no more was discussed in 1918 and, despite the strength of the arguments for further collaboration, they would scarcely have carried the party to a greater commitment. The scale of what had been achieved in capturing Lloyd George was underlined by incidents surrounding the letter of agreement between Law and Lloyd George. At the meeting of Unionists of 12 November, Law read the letter and impressed his audience with the concessions that Lloyd George seemed ready to make. At the meeting of Coalition Liberals though. Lloyd George gave only a summary of the letter and stressed its Liberal contents. When MPs returned to the Commons, it soon became clear that all was not well, as Robert Sanders noted: Our people became suspicious at once. I spoke to Guest and urged the publication of the letter. On Wednesday afternoon [13 Nov.] Bonar sent me word to come to Downing Street where I found L.G., Balfour, Bonar, and Auckland Geddes. Meanwhile there had appeared in The Times a fairly full report of L.G.'s speech to his own followers. L.G. said it must have been sent by someone in the audience who could write shorthand. He said he spoke impromptu. that he had a difficult job and that he was anxious to make things easy for his Liberal supporters. It was agreed that a joint meeting should be held, at which he, Bonar and Barnes should speak. I pressed for the publication of the letter. L.G. rather deprecated that saying he was not in love with it. Further pressure was applied by the Unionists and the joint meeting on the 16th went off well, with ""the famous letter"" duly printed and handed out. Unionists were only interested in a deal that would make Lloyd George's capture public. both to give them maximum advantage at the coming election and to spread the maximum disaffection in the Liberal party. The election was announced, parliament was dissolved, and polling arranged for 14 December. One problem remained to be settled, which was the working out of the electoral pact. No details were given to the National Union or to the constituencies involved, so much hard work had to be done and much recrimination endured before the party could settle down to the campaign. Overall the party had done very well, getting 362 of the 531 ""coupons"" that were offered by Lloyd George and Law to approved candidates, but locally the position could look very different. In Wales the Unionists had only two coupons out of twenty-two, because most of the sitting Liberals backed Lloyd George, but this did not much impress Welsh Unionists. In Brightside the Unionist candidate had been specially demobilised for the election; the Central Office agent for Yorkshire persuaded him to stand down, but it took a  visit to Central Office before his supporters could be persuaded to support a Coalition Liberal that they had opposed at the last three elections. It was only the fear of Labour and strong pressure from Central Office, including the withdrawal of financial aid, that kept the local parties in line, and some rash promises had to be made. So in Banbury and in Newport local Unionists were assured that the deal was for one election only. and that acceptance would not preclude them from running a Unionist next time, promises that caused trouble later. Leigh Maclachlan of Central Office later recalled the anguish that such talks caused there: Deputation after deputation came pouring in from constituencies whose candidatures had been assigned to Lloyd George Liberals. At last, after one particularly painful interview, Sir Robert Sanders, looking thoroughly upset. turned to the writer and said""You must see any further deputations there may be. I won't be a party to turning down any more of these good fellows."" Financial control may have been a vital weapon. for the local parties that defied the pact were mostly from strong and independent city parties used to financial independence. Overall, though, only nineteen Unionists stood against couponed opponents; in only one constituency. Morpeth. did such Unionist defiance cost the coalition the seat. On the other hand, five of the nineteen rebels won comfortably on their own, against Coalition Liberals, Labour, the coupon, and their own leaders. A case can be made out for the 1918 election as a Unionist victory rather than a coalition victory. Unionists had some success against the coupon and even more in places where no coupons were allocated, as in Cardiff and in Manchester. The issues of the election were certainly more likely to benefit Unionists than anyone else: an outspoken patriotism, a pursuit of the fallen foe, and a call to restore the conditions of 1914."" Lloyd George received a hero's welcome wherever he went, but then so did Churchill in 1945, and it is impossible to tell now whether Lloyd George would have fared so well if he had had Liberals rather than Unionists at his back. Unionist candidates used his letter to Law as an election leaflet to reassure their supporters and to parade his capture to the nation. There is little doubt that the coalition was returned to power mainly on Unionist votes, although this was not widely recognized at the time; the Unionists had never won so many votes before, and it was perhaps natural to attribute their success to their new asset. In the general pattern of inter-war elections though. 1918 fits in easily enough: in 1922 the party won the same share of the vote with a similar number of candidates, but without Lloyd George. The scale of the triumph of 1918 no doubt owed something to Lloyd George, but the fact of Unionist victory did not, for without the pact the party would certainly have won some of the Coalition Liberal seats that it prevented them from attacking. and these would have made up for some of the others perhaps won for them by Lloyd George. It may even be that the coupon helped to limit the size of the Unionist victory and to prolong the life of the Liberal Party. In parliament there was no mistaking the size of the victory: there were 382 Unionist MPs out of 707: without Sinn Fein the Unionist preponderance became overwhelming. Not all Unionist MPs ever supported the coalition, but almost all of them took the Whip at some time; the Unionists made up three-quarters of the government side of the House. Unionists therefore looked forward to domination of the government: but this never happened. and the party as a whole played only a junior role for the next four years. Their majority gave Unionist MPs a virtual veto over policies and appointments in the long run, but their junior position in government prevented any more positive control. This tension led on to attempts to fuse the government parties in 1920, to the failure of almost every government policy, and to complete deadlock by 1921. Fusion became possible in 1920 because of the difficulties already met by the government. Lloyd George's absence in Paris had accentuated the arguments about policy; peacemaking had produced a major Unionist rebellion in a telegram to Lloyd George from 233 Unionist Mrs in April 1919, urging stronger action on reparations; the appointments of F. E. Smith as Lord Chancellor (as Lord Birkenhead). and of Churchill and Addison, had been much criticised. The attack on Birkenhead was especially revealing; it centred on his lack of gravity in the highest legal office, but it was occasioned too by his lack of concern for party in the excitement of office. Unionists also resisted Lloyd Georges attempt to go on running things as in wartime, insisting that the war cabinet should be wound up after peacemaking was completed. Nor did they like Addison's reconstruction plans: his Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill was eventually passed. setting up a Ministry of Transport. but only after Unionist MPs had shorn it of railway and electricity nationalization. Similar action forced the abandonment of coal nationalization after the Sankey Report. and of parts of the Excess Profits Tax. Bonar Law was now Leader of the House of Commons without a department, and it was indeed a full-time job to keep the governmental process going there. Outside Westminster the government was losing support: eight seats were lost at by-elections in the first eighteen months of peace. Turnout rose as the opposition parties recovered from their disarray of 1918 and there was a large turnover of votes. When local elections were resumed in 1919 there was a large Labour advance, and only local pacts stemmed the tide in 1920. The weakness of the government at its roots was demonstrated by the events at Stockport in March 1920, when a vacancy occurred there; weeks of argument were solved only by the resignation of the other sitting member, so that there could be a double by-election with one Unionist and one Liberal candidate as in 1918. By the time Stockport had been settled Lloyd George was moving to prevent such situations from recurring. He proposed the fusion of the two coalition parties into a new party, which would be launched on an inspiring  programme of strong government and social betterment. The serious economic situation and the delicate state of Labour relations demanded a stronger government to hold the ring. for the attempt at fusion took place just a month before the post-war boom began to collapse. a development that punctured the inflationary crisis and took""the heat out of the Labour militancy. So, for various different reasons, most of the Unionist leaders approved of Lloyd George's intentions; the party managers agreed because they feared that continuing disorganization on the Coalition Liberal side might eventually wreck the government. Birkenhead put the case for a new party in articles in the Weekly Dispatch. a round robin from ninety-five MPs supported fusion, and Balfour formally proposed fusion in a letter to Bonar Law on 10 March 1920. Other Unionists, including Law himself, were less sure, even though they shared their colleagues""concern about the political and economic situation; nevertheless it was agreed to go ahead, but that Lloyd George should make the first move. Lloyd George would propose fusion to his Liberal supporters, and Bonar Law would follow suit on the next day. In the event the reactions of Coalition Liberal ministers were so uniformly hostile that Lloyd George moved quickly into reverse; when he met Coalition Liberal MPs, he merely suggested greater cooperation with Unionists and did not mention fusion as such. Bonar Law promptly gave up the whole idea, with obvious relief, as he told Balfour: The result of this will probably be not to attempt any real fusion of the Parties but to get cooperation. something on the lines of the Liberal Unionists and Conservatives in the early days. This will be difficult to arrange and will certainly not be efficient, but personally I am not sorry at the turn events have taken. I do not like the idea of complete fusion if it can be avoided, but I had come to think, as you had also, that it was really inevitable if the Coalition were to continue. But it always seemed to me more important from L.G.'s point of view than from ours. As a Party we were losing nothing and, since the necessity of going slowly in the matter has come from L.G.'s own friends, I do not regret it. In March 1920, as in November 1918, Lloyd George's open dependence on the Unionists had been openly demonstrated. When the Coalitionists were driven out of the Liberal fold at Leamington in the following May dependence became even greater, for it removed the only theoretical alternative that Lloyd George and his friends had left. It remains to decide whether the Unionists would have accepted fusion if Lloyd George could have made it a real option in 1920. The party in the Commons would probably have done so, though not without a severing of all connections by a determined minority; there is little doubt though that the party outside parliament would not have accepted fusion, or that they could have prevented its implementation. The parliamentary party could determine the shape of governments and election campaigns. but they could not change the structure of the party itself without a positive vote from the National Union and overwhelming approval in the constituencies. At the Party  Conference of 1920, which coalitionists had hoped would approve fusion, it was estimated that about five-eighths of the delegates were in favour of the existence of the coalition, and the rest against it on principle, but that hardly any of them approved its current policies. The Executive elected at that Conference was packed with diehards, and ""a debate on cooperation against Labour revealed the depth of division: a motion calling for closer collaboration met strong opposition, but so did one calling simply for a Unionist government: They must turn out the man who was the greatest danger to the Conservative Party"" ,(a voice — ""Lloyd George"" ).  ""Yes, if you allow conditions to continue as at present you will find a deliberate attempt is being made to assassinate the Conservative Party.""  In the end a meaningless compromise was made, and the Conference called on all good men to come together to resist socialism, but also insisted that the Unionist party should not sacrifice any of its independence in the process. It is difficult to see how this Conference could""possibly have approved fusion; even if it had done, half the constituencies would probably have refused to implement the decision. A motion which would have specifically committed]the party against fusion was not put on the chairman's decision; the diehards accepted this ruling without demur, no doubt because they felt that they had already made their point. Bonar Law's position remains enigmatic, for he promoted fusion and yet was glad to see it fail. He was never an ideological coalitionist and never fell under L.G.'s spell, for all their good personal relations. Had his colleagues backed fusion in 1920 Law would have accepted it, but he would hardly have stuck to that position in the party crisis that must have followed. His relief in avoiding such a parting of the ways is understandable. With the failure of fusion, and with the subsequent failure of Liberal reunion in May 1920, the coalition settled into a stage of continuous crisis. The deepening economic recession defused the worst industrial problems, but the failure of fusion had deprived the government of the only way of bringing coalition and party into line. From now on time was on the side of the anti-coalitionists, for the approach of another election would eventually reopen the argument to their advantage. By the time of the next possible resolution of the problem at the end of 1921, coalition had signally failed to provide Unionists with what they had hoped for, and Lloyd George had become an electoral albatross rather than an asset. The failure of the programme of 1918 stemmed above all from the lack of real agreement at the time; despite the negotiations, the coalition's electoral manifesto and campaign of 1918 went little further than Lloyd George's letter to Bonar Law. When coalition ministers began to bring forward legislation in 1919 they met a hail of criticism, from Liberals hostile to decontrol and Unionists lukewarm on social reconstruction. To keep all his supporters in balance, Lloyd George had to offer something to all of them, but this meant that every coalition scheme was also hotly opposed by a part of the coalition. Lloyd George disarmed his opponents on Ireland with his Russian policy, and his opponents on Russia with his Irish policy, and they did not combine to oppose him. Another example of this division of opponents was the Amritsar Debate of July 1920. Conservative MPs. voted 122 to 93 against the government. Lloyd George was upheld in this division by the votes of Labour and Asquithian Liberal M.P.s who at the time vigorously opposed his repression of Ireland. Such a balancing act could keep his government in being only by increasing his own reputation for lack of principle. Instead of a systematic policy of imperialism, Unionists had Montagu's Indian policy and Milner's policy in Egypt; instead of settlement in Ireland there were outrages; instead of a broad social policy there was first a reckless waste of money and then an abandonment of almost all that had been proposed. In only one area did the coalition succeed totally, but this argument was a double-edged sword: Lloyd George had weathered the storm of labour unrest, and after ""Black Friday"" this was clearly abating. What was now needed was a means of countering Labour's electoral appeal, and for this a Prime Minister with a cleaner political reputation would be needed. The more the revolutionary threat receded, and the more Lloyd George appeared as a loser of votes, the more the Unionists would be tempted to cast him adrift. In most of this Lloyd George was desperately unlucky, both in the failures and reconsiderations of policy and in the development of his own reputation. Many coalition schemes were wrecked by Unionist hostility, yet Unionists also complained when the government then changed course. The following scenario was typical: government introduces social scheme balanced to meet Liberal and Unionist influence in government, but tilted slightly to Liberalism by the minister in charge; Unionists in the House of Commons wreck the plan and denounce the waste of public money; government withdraws the scheme and is then accused of unprincipled change of front by Unionists. Such was the logic of coalition when the balance of the government did not correspond to the balance of parliament. Successes of the government would always be claimed by all its members, but failures would be left to the Prime Minister. Rapid changes of policy were in any case dictated by circumstances. The uncertain foreign situation was typified in Eastern Europe where in 1920 the Poles seemed likely to extinguish the Bolshevik regime, and a year later the Bolsheviks almost took Warsaw. At home the sudden switch from inflation and boom to stagnation and slump in a few months made changes in policy inevitable. Ireland was a nightmare for all parties; the fifty-year respite gained by Lloyd George in 1921 was certainly based on pragmatism rather than principle but no other policy could have worked. In field after field the government was forced to change course, earning a reputation for dishonesty and lack of principle that, when allied to Lloyd George's prior reputation, could only do him great damage. Nothing exemplified this more than the campaign for public economy which shook the government in 1921. A public  that had seen income tax rise fivefold in five years were only too ready to believe that their money was being wasted. During the war the national crisis kept discontent within bounds, but when income tax actually went up again in 1919 (to pay amongst other things-for homes for heroes) the reaction of taxpayers was very hostile indeed, especially when in 1920 inflation reached unprecedented levels too. The first to sense the new mood was the press, and an Anti-Waste League was founded by Lord Rothermere. Two by-elections at the Wrekin and one at Dover showed the threat that independents could pose on the anti-spending tack, and Lord Salisbury tried to guide the agitation into respectable channels through a People's Union for Economy. Two further Anti-Waste victories in June 1921, on Salisbury's doorstep in Hertford and in the ultra-safe Unionist seat of St George's Westminster, were too threatening to be ignored. Government spending had already been reviewed and cut substantially, but the time had now come for a great public gesture; this was supplied by the appointment of the Geddes Committee, a typical Lloyd George manoeuvre using businessmen instead of MPs or ministers. When the ""Geddes Axe"" fell in February 1922, it proposed cuts in the social services which alienated once and for all the Prime Minister's last admirers on the left; moderate Unionists like Stanley Baldwin disliked the Geddes Axe as being too arbitrary and too indiscriminate, but the rest of the party criticized it as too little, too late, and unlikely to be implemented anyway. Resolutions continued to call for further economies and lower taxation, so the government got no credit for what it had done. After the summer of 1921 the Anti-Waste threat receded, but this was largely because Unionist candidates were now on the bandwagon with them, demanding cuts as loudly as anyone. After St George's, almost all Unionist candidates ran without making promises to support the coalition; this did not mean that all of them joined the diehard group when elected, but it showed that coalition was no longer seen to be a winning ticket. By 1921 indeed frustration with coalition was building up such a head of steam as seriously to threaten its future. The party managers continued to bewail the organizational weakness of Coalition Liberalism, but there had been little opportunity for organizational collaboration; one of the few joint ventures, a magazine called Popular View, was abandoned in 1921 because of the impossibility of producing a lively magazine out of continuous compromise. Money was short in the party by 1921 because there had been no proper revival since the war; members were constantly described as apathetic, and were in no mood to give their time or their money to a party that did not know where it was going. The state of the organization was causing concern to the party managers, for it would deteriorate further unless some definite decision about the future were taken. At the end of 1921 Younger still favoured coalition, but the balance had become a fine one. The National Union had much less doubt, and by 1921 it was committed firmly against coalition. Younger was in a very exposed position, for he was  Chairman of the National Union Executive responsible for carrying out its decisions, as well as Party Chairman and so committed to the leader and the coalition. He tried to escape the cross-fire by getting the two offices separated but could not get the new rules approved. The actual administration of the National Union was separated from Central Office in 1921, and it appointed its own secretary thereafter; it was a change of no great importance, for the National Union continued to work from Central Office and the Principal Agent continued to be Honorary Secretary, but it was a minor declaration of independence. The question that exercised the National Union most of all was the House of Lords, and regular deputations were sent to Law to press for action. By early 1922 tempers were short and the Chairman of the Central Council publicized the dispute in March with an open letter to Austen Chamberlain. This brought a reply from Salvidge, still a convinced coalitionist: I read with amazement Sir Alexander Leith's letter to you in this morning's press. The inference in his letter is that he speaks for the Council of the National Union of which he is chairman. As a member of that Council I emphatically deny that he has had any mandate, or that he is justified in assuming that the Council as a whole takes his view. Despite Austen's soothing reply, Salvidge took the matter up at the next meeting of the Executive, when he demanded whether or not Leith had been satisfied with Austen's reply. Salvidge was right to claim that Leith had overstepped the mark and that he had no mandate for his action, but it is clear that he rather than Salvidge really represented the views of the National Union. In March he explained that he had acted in a personal capacity only and that Chamberlain had suggested that their correspondence be published. At the May Executive the government was rapped over the knuckles for its failure to reform the House of Lords, ""a breach of the understanding upon which the allegiance of the Unionist Party to its leaders depends"" . Salvidge proposed to delete these insulting words but could not even find a seconder; nine MPs were present, including Younger, Sanders and Neville Chamberlain, all of whom must have approved of the resolution or seen the futility of attempting to amend it. The National Union also reacted fiercely to the attacks on Younger by coalitionist ministers, most of all Birkenhead's description of him as ""the cabin boy"" and Lloyd George's of ""a second-class brewer"" . There were fears that it was intended to remove him and substitute someone more acquiescent. In March 1922 Steel-Maitland proposed a strong motion of confidence in Younger that was a clear rebuke to his critics; Younger lowered the temperature by asking Steel-Maitland to withdraw the motion, but the Executive accepted this only ""on the understanding that Sir Laming Worthington-Evans would make known to his colleagues in the Government that the Committee would bring the matter up again unless the attacks by Ministers on Sir George Younger ceased"" . The National Union was then hostile to coalition and quite determined to use its independence if  necessary to protect the interests of the party. The views of the local parties were less clearcut — although the National Union itself was no more than the sum of the local party leaders. There was support for coalition in the North and in Scotland, where local cooperation was pushing back municipal socialism in 1920–21, and also in Birmingham, where Austen Chamberlain traded on the family name and Neville brooded uneasily on the course of events. In southern England, there was forthright opposition, for here the benefit of cooperation was negligible and the Labour threat more remote. Sanders found that Somerset was almost wholly hostile to coalition, and Middlesex and London were both equally critical. It was now that the assurances of 1918 that the pact would be for one election only came home to roost; wanting to be ready in plenty of time, many local parties were by 1921 selecting candidates who would oppose sitting Coalition Liberals. In Newport it was the Licensing Act of 1921 that brought about this decision, but in other places it was India, or Ireland, or public spending. Local parties also pressed sitting MPs to declare that they would fight next time without the coalition label and many gave way to these suggestions. Local parties were not very representative of Unionist voters, but this did not affect their independence or their control over their candidates. There was little to be done to prevent this inexorable build up of pressure from the roots. Taking the lead against the coalition was a small but implacable group of diehards; they were never more than a few dozen in the Commons and, although they attracted shifting support on particular issues, they never threatened the coalition majority. The Lords were more diehard, as they had been ever since 1911, but unless their powers were restored they would denounce the government in vain. Diehard opinions ranged from the virulent obscurantism of Northumberland, Page Croft and Cooper, who saw politics as a black-and-white struggle between good British imperial-minded Christians and Jewish-dominated marxist wreckers, to the high-minded Association of Independent Peers, who were primarily concerned with the effect of coalition on the standards of public life and its failure to halt the drift towards class politics. The strongest weapon in the diehard armoury was the press, for it had the reliable support of the Morning Post, National Review and Spectator, and intermittent backing from the papers of Beaverbrook, Rothermere and Northcliffe. Of the Unionist press, only the Daily Telegraph supported the coalition, and it could make little head against such a tide. This motley bunch of adventurers, undesirables and patriots had by 1921 accepted the general lead of Lord Salisbury. As the son of a Unionist Prime Minister, Salisbury used his name and connections to weld the diehard opposition together and awaited his opportunity. He was desperately worried that coalition, as a cynical combination to keep Labour down, would produce a reaction among working-class electors that would eventually put Labour in power. This was the most respectable strain of Unionist opposition to the  coalition. When the Unionist won the by-election at Newport in 1922, on working-class votes and on an anti-coalition platform, his agent explained that""the working classes had never understood the Coalition. They had regarded it rightly or wrongly as a wangle and as an attempt to ally capitalist forces against the worker."" It was such fears that Salisbury set out to quieten, using his People's Union for Economy to widen the diehards""appeal, and calling for a return to the classless tradition of Conservatism. His own group called itself the Free Conservatives, set up an office to rival that of the official party, and supplied money and professional assistance to rebels at by-elections. Salisbury did not share half the views held by those who accepted his lead, but he was a focus for the increasing Unionist discontent, a respectable public figure acting from the highest motives; by 1921 he had made the diehard opposition a formidable force. In any calculation of the party's future prospects Bonar Law would be a key figure. Throughout the coalition, Law was prepared to support its continuation, but he was rarely prepared to argue for concession that would weaken his own party. In private he got on very well with Lloyd George, but he never hid his doubts; in 1917 he told Unionists that Lloyd George was a man who has the defects of his qualities"", and told his audience that he was saying no more than he had told the Prime Minister to his face; when in 1920 he was told that Unionists would rather hear him attack Lloyd George than defend him, he told this story to the Prime Minister too. For ten years Law had been at the heart of the party's reactions to political events, largely because his own views mirrored those of his followers almost exactly. The extreme diehards had written off Law as the dupe of Lloyd George because he did not come out fighting against coalition policies, hence the witticism that the coalition was an alliance between a flock of sheep led by a, crook and a flock of crooks led by a sheep. But to the bulk of the party, Law s presence in government was a guarantee of the party's independence; with Law in charge the party would extract from coalition whatever there was to be gained, but at no risk, and when stripped of all complications this was more or less what Bonar Law intended all along. He was therefore as vital a figure as Salisbury, and in something of the same way: Salisbury was the link between the anti-coalition forces outside the government, and Law was the link between anti-coalitionists outside and critical Unionists within. Successive crises were dealt with by Law without resolving the fundamental disequilibrium of the situation, for the conflict between coalition and party was as real in Law's own mind as in the minds of a host of Unionists who continued to give general support to the government. It was therefore an event of major significance when Law's retirement was announced in March 1921. He had been unwell for some time and had now gone into a state of collapse. Lloyd George announced his resignation to the Commons on 17 March in a speech that was close to tears, and the reaction of Unionist MPs was equally emotional, testament to Law's great standing in his  party. The effect of the resignation was increased by its suddenness: within two days Law had laid down all his offices and gone abroad. Maurice Cowling has suggested that Law's resignation was tactical, that he could not face reconciling his party to the coming Irish negotiations, and that he was giving up office so as to be available as an alternative to coalition in the future; in Gaullist terms he was becoming a Prime Minister ""in the reserve of the republic"" . Lloyd George perhaps entertained similar doubts, for his first reactions were to suggest that he should resign too, and to ask if he might speak to Bonar Law's doctor. But there can be no real doubt that it was on medical advice that Law resigned, for he was advised that only a complete break would save him from total breakdown, and he was actually suffering from the disease that was to kill him in less than three years. For six months in 1921 Law was in France, cut off from most political information and from all political action. His position after his return in September should not affect the assessment of his resignation in March. The effect of Law's abrupt departure was magnified by the departure at about the same time of Walter Long, the only other Unionist of weight who combined an acceptance of coalition (as a defence against Labour) with a determination that the integrity of the party should not be compromised in any way. Long's health had been deteriorating for years, but he had kept open his channels of communication; like Law his influence was based on years of devotion to the interests of the party, and like Law's that influence had been used to argue the case for coalition. In February 1921 he gave up office and soon afterwards he accepted a peerage and retired from active politics. With the passing of Law and Long there were no Unionists in the cabinet who had both authority and detachment; the link had been broken, but its importance was demonstrated with devastating effect when both intervened to influence the events of October 1922. By this time Long would not have been a possible leader, and so the third contender of 1911 alone remained: Austen Chamberlain. There was some speculation about alternatives, with some canvassing the claims of Derby and Salisbury and others imploring Lloyd George to take over the leadership and unite the parties in a shotgun wedding, but Austen's claims were undeniable. He was elected leader of the party at the Carlton Club on 21 March 1921, proposed by Captain Pretyman who coined in his speech the idea that Conservative leaders ""emerged"" rather than being elected. Austen had certainly emerged as leader, for nobody could have stood against him with any prospect of success, and it was appropriate that his succession should be marked by Pretyman, who was a respected backbencher of long service and represented the inarticulate centre of the party. At the time of his election, Austen was seen as a party man who would be even more attentive to Unionist interests than Law had been. This was a natural enough view for those who remembered his tariff opinions before the war, his stout defence of Ulster and his diehard opinions in 1911. But by 1921  Austen was an ideological coalitionist for both personal and tactical reasons: he had fallen under the personal sway of Lloyd George, he was influenced by Birkenhead and Horne, and he had no doubt that a coalition alone would be able to contain Labour. The intolerance he had shown for free-traders before 1914 was now turned on rebel Unionists who rocked the coalition boat. He had perhaps been too long in high office, too isolated from discordant views by the well-oiled Birmingham machine to take full account of the volume of dissent. Any doubt about his attitude should have been set aside by the speech with which he accepted the leadership: There are moments when the insistence upon party is as unforgiveable as insistence upon personal things, when the difficulties which the nation has to confront call for a wider outlook and a broader union than can be found even within the limits of a single party, and when the traditions of more than one party, the ideas of more than one party need to be put into the common stock. For the next eighteen months, Austen Chamberlain worked behind the scenes to maintain the interests of his party, just as Law had done, but he had no personal sympathy for the diehards or their views, and he made no gestures of conciliation to them. His public speeches were all aimed at converting the party to a positive belief in coalition, leading it from the front — and in a direction where many Unionists did not wish to follow. In losing Law the party had lost a conciliator; in electing Austen it had gained an inflexible leader who would not always put party first. There was reason to think, as the Financial News suggested, that""Mr. Bonar Law's resignation is more than a nine-days wonder. It is probably the beginning of the end of Coalition Government. ""The advent of a convinced coalitionist to the leadership of the largest coalition party was indeed the beginning of the end for coalition."
ACA ACA-EWW-001 2.23 "Foreword: Alan Simpson's tribute to his co-author My co-author and friend Professor A. R. Collar, C.B.E., LL.D., F.R.S., Emeritus Professor of Aeronautical Engineering in the University of Bristol, distinguished aeronautical scientist and former Vice-Chancellor of that University, died at his home in Bristol on 12th February 1986, just ten days before his 78th birthday, and only a short time before our book was published. Roderick's eminence as an engineering scientist and scholar is well known. However, he was also a man of exceptional personal warmth and charm. He was, in every sense, a gentleman and a gentle man. Nevertheless, when the occasion demanded it (as it did during the turbulent period in which he became Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University), he showed great courage and firmness — the latter always in the nicest possible way. Roderick's interests were wide; for example sport (cricket, tennis and football — both varieties), good music (he played the violin), verse (he read extensively and composed, when inspired or provoked, to match an occasion and could recite extensively from memory — particularly W. S. Gilbert), games and puzzles (chess, cribbage, mathematical conundrums and crosswords; he could, at his zenith, do The Times Crossword any day in less than twenty minutes), and art (he was an active member of The Bristol Savages). He was also president of a local Gilbert and Sullivan society for many years. He did much hospital work: for several years up to his retirement he had been Chairman of the South West Regional Hospital Management Board and was an active hospital visitor. His charitable works were extensive. He had been President of the Bristol Rotary Club, chairman  of governors of many schools and colleges (notably R.M.C.S., Shrivenham), and was a Liveryman of the Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators, to mention but a few of his activities. He was the perfect committee chairman: he loved committee work when it was productive, and it always was when he was in the chair. Innate within him was the ability to put committee members at their ease, so that they could give of their best, and he could abstract the maximum amount of information. This ability was evident in his many years of A.R.C. Committee and Council chairmanship and in his chairmanship of the university committees, culminating in his Vice-Chancellorship. At one time he was on 25 committees, over and above those within the University, and was chairman of many of these. At the height of this committee and other administrative work, Roderick often expressed his desire to return to his mathematics and, in particular, to write a sequel to his famous book (with R.A. Frazer and W.J. Duncan) Elementary Matrices. I had agreed to be co-author, but it was not until seven years after his retirement that work could begin, for only then had his committee activities abated to an extent which allowed the long periods necessary for writing and discussion. It is appropriate to recall that Elementary Matrices (1938) was printed nine times in U.K., several times in U.S.A., was translated into Russian and Czech, and finally republished in hardback in U.S.A. in 1983. It was written following a period of pioneering work on the application of matrices to engineering problems, undertaken by Frazer, Duncan and Collar at the N.P.L., Teddington, in the 1930s. Collar was certainly the junior member of the partnership, but those who know his mathematical style are well able to perceive his many areas of contribution to the book. In later years, Roderick confided that he had been far from happy with the title, for the book certainly was not ""elementary"" . Any sequel must be ""more elementary"" and tailored to the needs of the engineering student. This is not to be viewed as condescending: Roderick regarded himself as a student of the subject and said so on many occasions during the writing of the new book. As work began in earnest on the book, I realised that Roderick had lost none of the skills that I, as his research student twenty years before, had regarded with awe. But writing now was not easy for him: he had begun to suffer with arthritis in the year following his retirement, and had had to give up his violin owing to lack of flexibility of his fingers, and as the condition developed, he found writing more and more difficult. This did not deter him, as, between 1980 and 1984, he completed over 400 pages of manuscript. On average, we met for three hours every ten days, constantly revising, exchanging and criticising so that in the end we had both had a hand in everything. The whole must have been rewritten about five times. Roderick was always seeking a better way of putting things in order to remove all possible ambiguities and to assist the reader to the maximum extent: if this meant rewriting 100 times he would gladly do it. He was meticulous, but never pedantic. Roderick's last, and possibly finest, contributions to this book were the Theorems XII and XV of Chapter 1 which were completed in 1985 shortly after the serious fall which perhaps precipitated the leukaemia from which he failed to recover, despite repeated blood transfusions. At this stage, the arthritis in his fingers was scarcely bearable and writing extremely painful. But the exceptional clarity of his thought processes was evidently still totally unimpaired. We last met on the Sunday before his death. Although very weak, he was anxious to discuss technical matters, among which were possible revisions to Chapter 6. He had, a few weeks before, completed an excellent set of autobiographical notes and, characteristically, a sonnet to his wife, Bobbie, on her birthday. Roderick will be sadly missed in every circle in which he moved, but most of all, of course, by Bobbie, whose devotion and fortitude was his greatest comfort in his final illness, and whose forbearance over many years enabled Roderick to spend such a great amount of their valuable time on the book.

ACA ACA-FC1-001 2.01 "[CHANCERY DIVISION]In re A DEBTOR (NO. 784 OF 1991) 1992 April 13 Hoffmann J. Bankruptcy — Jurisdiction — Carrying on business — Debtor selling business and leaving United Kingdom more than three years before presentation of petition — No debts outstanding save for income tax liability — Whether debtor ‘carried on business’ within three years preceding petition — Jurisdiction to make bankruptcy order — Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45), s. 265(1) (c)(ii) In May 1987 the debtor, who had carried on the business of running a nursing home, sold the business as a going concern and went to live in the Canary Islands. No debts remained outstanding, apart from a tax liability in excess of £500,000. In 1988 the debtor made an offer to settle the tax liability which was not accepted, and in February 1991 the Inland Revenue presented a bankruptcy petition. The registrar in bankruptcy made an order allowing service of the petition on the debtor in the Canary Islands. On the hearing of the petition he decided that the debtor had ‘carried on business in England and Wales’ within a period of three years ending with the presentation of the petition for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) of the Insolvency Act 1986and made the order sought. On the debtor's appeal:— Held , dismissing the appeal, that there was nothing in the policy of the Insolvency Act 1986 that indicated that Parliament intended to give the words ‘carried on business’ in section 265(1) (c )(ii) of that Act a meaning different from that which they had been held to bear in section 4(1) (d ) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914; that a debtor did not cease to carry on business for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) until all the trading debts of the business had been paid; and that, accordingly, the registrar had been right in holding that since the tax liability had not been discharged the debtor was still carrying on business and that he had jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order (post, pp. 122B–E, H — 123A). Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186, H.L. (E.) applied. The following cases are referred to in the judgment: Debtor (No. 1 of 1987), In re A [1989]1 W.L.R. 271;[1989]2 All E.R. 46, C.A.

Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186;[1950]1 All E.R. 405, H.L. (E.) The following additional cases were cited in argument: Bird, In re, Ex parte the Debtor v. Inland Revenue Commissioners [1962]1 W.L.R. 686;[1962]2 All E.R. 406, C.A. M'George, Ex parte, In re Stevens (1882) 20 Ch.D. 607, C.A. Sarflax Ltd., In re [1979]Ch. 592;[1979]2 W.L.R. 202;[1979]1 All E.R. 529 APPEAL from the registrar in bankruptcy. On 11 November 1991, Mr. Registrar Pimm, pursuant to a petition presented on 1 February 1991, made a bankruptcy order against the debtor, although the debtor had not lived in England and Wales since 8 May 1987, on the basis that she was still notionally carrying on business in England and Wales within the meaning of section 265(1) (c ) of the Insolvency Act 1986 because though there were no other debts outstanding there was an unpaid tax liability of over £500,000. By a notice of appeal dated 29 November 1991 the debtor appealed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order because she had not carried on business in England or Wales within three years prior to the presentation of the petition. The facts are stated in the judgment. Richard Ritchie for the debtor. Nicholas Warren for the Inland Revenue Commissioners. HOFFMANN J. This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Registrar Pimm, which raises a question on the court's jurisdiction to make a bankruptcy order. The debtor in this case carried on business in this country running a nursing home in the course of which she incurred a tax liability in the sum of about £500,000 which remains unpaid. In January 1987 she went to live in Tenerife and on 8 May 1987 she sold the business as a going concern. There is no evidence that any debts, apart from her tax liability, remained outstanding. In 1988 she made an offer to settle the tax liability, which was not accepted, and on 1 February 1991 the Inland Revenue Commissioners presented a bankruptcy petition which came before the registrar on 11 November 1991. The sole question before him was whether there was jurisdiction under section 265 of the Insolvency Act 1986. That section sets out various grounds for jurisdiction, including the domicile, residence and physical presence of the debtor in England, but the sole ground relied on in this case is section 265(1) (c )(ii), namely, that the debtor within a period of three years ending on the date of presentation, had ‘carried on business in England and Wales.’ The debtor says that she has not carried on business in this country since 8 May 1987, the date upon which the business was sold. The Inland Revenue say that carrying on business for the purposes of this section continues until all the debts of the business incurred in the course of trade have been paid, and that includes the liability for tax. The construction which is put forward by the Commissioners is one which was adopted by the courts in respect of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, upon which section 265 of the Act of 1986 is plainly modelled. Section 4(1) (d ) of the Act of 1914 also contained various grounds of jurisdiction, including when the debtor, ‘has carried on business in England, personally or by means of an agent or manager’ within a year before the presentation of the petition. The only noticeable change in the language in the Act of 1986 is the extension of that period to three years. Section 4(1) (d ) was considered by the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186. The facts of that case were not materially different from this one. There too the only debt remaining outstanding from a business which had otherwise ceased more than a year before was a debt owed to the Inland Revenue. Lord Porter, who delivered the only speech, referred to a number of earlier cases dealing with the construction of ‘carrying on a business’ for the purposes of jurisdiction over the separate property of married women. The relevant statute in those cases had provided simply that jurisdiction should exist over a married woman ‘carrying on a trade separately from her husband.’ The question which arose in those cases was whether the cessation of trade, in the sense of ‘putting the shutters up,’ immediately deprived the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction over the married woman, or whether it continued while the trade debts remained unpaid. It will be observed that in those cases there was no statutory period after cessation of trade during which jurisdiction continued, and the court was therefore faced with a stark choice between saying that the jurisdiction ceased immediately active trade was suspended, or saying that it continued until the business had actually been wound up by payment of the debts. There was no basis upon which any intermediate position could be chosen. It is not in those circumstances surprising that the court decided in favour of the latter construction. In Theophile's case, however, the choice was not nearly so stark. There would have been less practical difficulty about saying that trade ceased when business ceased actively to be carried on, because there was a further period of a year during which a petition could be presented. Nonetheless, the House of Lords applied the same construction. The question before me today is whether Parliament, in using similar language in section 265, intended those words to bear the same meaning as those given to them by the House of Lords under the Act of 1914. The Insolvency Act 1986 is a consolidation Act only in the sense that it consolidates the Insolvency Act 1985 and some other provisions. It is an entirely new code in relation to the Bankruptcy Act 1914. The court therefore has to approach its construction on the footing that the new Act may exhibit policies and intentions which are not necessarily the same as those in the earlier Act, and which require similar words to be given different meanings from those which the courts gave them under the earlier legislation. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)[1989]1 W.L.R. 271, the Court of Appeal was concerned with the construction of a provision in the Insolvency Rules 1986 (S.I. 1986 No. 1925), rule 7.55, which provided: ‘No insolvency proceedings shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which objection is made considers that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity, and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of the court. Under a similar provision in the Bankruptcy Act 1914 it had been held that a defect in a bankruptcy notice of a kind such as could reasonably mislead the debtor was not a mere formal defect or irregularity within the meaning of that provision, and therefore rendered the notice a nullity even though it was not calculated to cause substantial injustice. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)the Court of Appeal refused to follow that approach and held that a statutory demand, which on the face of it contained a number of puzzling and perplexing statements, was nonetheless valid because the debtor knew precisely what he owed and there was no injustice in holding that his failure to pay the debt gave rise to a presumption that he was unable to pay. That approach to construction was approved by the House of Lords in In re Smith (A Bankrupt), Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215, in which Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said, at p. 238, that, in view of the changes in policy shown by the new Act, he felt justified in construing the provision of the Act of 1986 ‘as a piece of new legislation without regard to 19th century authorities or similar provisions of repealed Bankruptcy Acts.’ Those authorities show that, in approaching the language of the Act of 1986, one must pay particular attention to the purposes and policies of its own provisions and be wary of simply carrying over uncritically meanings which had been given to similar words in the earlier Act. It does not, however, mean that the language of the new Act comes to one entirely free of any of the intellectual freight which was carried by words and phrases in earlier bankruptcy or other legislation. Decisions of the court upon the meanings of phrases used in Acts of Parliament may come, in the course of time, to give them the quality of terms of art which Parliament may well be assumed to have intended them to bring with them when used in subsequent legislation. In section 265, for example, terms such as ‘domiciled,’‘personally present,’‘ordinarily resident,’ have had attributed to them, both in the context of bankruptcy and in that of civil procedure generally, a wealth of refined construction which it is difficult to suppose Parliament did not intend equally to apply when those words were used in the Act of 1986. Is there any reason why that should not apply equally to the words ‘has carried on business?’ There does not seem to me to be anything in the policy of the new Act which suggests that in this provision Parliament was intending to give those words a different meaning from those which they had been held to bear under the Act of 1914. It was suggested that the extension of the period to three years from one required the attribution of a different meaning because the Theophile construction meant that it did not really matter what the period was; as long as there was a debt, a bankruptcy petition could be presented. The effect of the outstanding debt would be to prevent the cessation of trade for the purposes of the section. That is not quite true, because the debt must, in order to found jurisdiction under section 265, be a trade debt. For the purposes simply of enabling the petitioner to rank as a creditor, the debt can, of course, be any kind of debt. It follows that the extension to three years does have significance. It enables a non-trade creditor to present a petition within three years after the last trade debt has been paid instead of within only one year. In Muir Hunter on Personal Insolvency (1991), p. 3037, at para. 3–070, it is suggested that the Theophile construction of the Act of 1914 is a somewhat artificial one, and the question is raised as to whether, under the new Act, unfettered by old case law, the long established but artificial construction will continue to be applied. It appears to me, however, that the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186 did not regard their construction as being an artificial one. They came to that conclusion on the grounds that it appeared to them to be a tenable meaning of the words and in accordance with what they thought to be the policy of the Act of 1914 as to jurisdiction. I have already said that, on the question of jurisdiction, I can discern no difference between the policy of the Act of 1914 and that of the Act of 1986, and under those circumstances I think that the registrar's decision was right and the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed with costs. Leave to appeal. Solicitors: Binks Stern; Solicitor of Inland Revenue."
ACA ACA-HWV-006 1.44 "REVIEW ARTICLE Are both aspirin and heparin justified as adjuncts tothrombolytic therapy for acute myocardialinfarction? The use of aspirin and heparin as adjuncts to thrombolysis in the setting of acute myocardial infarction is controversial. Because the two agents have independent inhibitory effects on platelet function and the coagulation cascade, it has been argued that both should be used. Although the recommendation of combined use was based on rational pathophysiological principles, only randomised trial data can be used to assess the net risk-to-benefit ratio for the combination of these agents. We therefore reviewed data from randomised trials of myocardial infarction which provide evidence on the clinical efficacy of aspirin and heparin, alone or in combination, as adjuncts to thrombolysis. Evidence for aspirin as sole adjunctivetherapy to thrombolysis Aspirin, if given in oral or intravenous doses of at least 2 mg/kg (162.5 mg in a typical man), produces a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect due to immediate and near-total inhibition of thromboxane function and platelet aggregation. The Second International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-2) showed conclusively the efficacy of aspirin both alone and in conjunction with thrombolytic therapy for the treatment of evolving acute myocardial infarction. The trial was randomised, double blind, and placebo controlled with a 2×2 factorial design; 17,187 patients who presented within 24 h of symptom onset were assigned treatment with 162.5 mg aspirin daily by mouth, 1.5 million units of streptokinase intravenously over 60 min, both, or neither. The primary endpoint, total vascular mortality, was 23% lower with aspirin alone than with neither treatment (95% CI -30 to -15, p < 0.00001), 25% lower with streptokinase alone (-32 to -18, p < 0.0001), and 42% lower with combined treatment (-50 to -34, p < 0.00001). Thus, the effects of aspirin and streptokinase are largely additive. For patients whose thrombolytic treatment was initiated within 6 h of symptom onset, the reduction in total vascular mortality was 30% with streptokinase alone and 53% with both aspirin and streptokinase. The mortality benefit attributable to aspirin therapy in ISIS-2 was similar when the drug was started 0–4 h (25%), 5–12 h (21%), or 13–24 h (21%) after symptom onset. With  aspirin there were also highly significant reductions in non-fatal reinfarction (49%) and non-fatal stroke (46%). Similarly, there were fewer reinfarctions after aspirin plus streptokinase than after streptokinase alone. As regards side-effects, for bleeds necessitating transfusion, there was no significant difference between the aspirin and placebo groups (both 0.4%), although there was a small significant absolute increase in minor bleeds among patients assigned aspirin (0.6%, p < 0.01). There was no difference between the aspirin and placebo groups in the incidence of cerebral haemorrhage. Thus, substantial mortality benefits can be achieved if at least 162.5 mg aspirin is given during the acute phase of evolving myocardial infarction. Moreover, this benefit is largely additive to that of thrombolysis and can be obtained with a slightly increased risk of minor bleeding and no increased risk of cerebral haemorrhage. Therefore, we believe that virtually all patients being treated for suspected acute myocardial infarction should receive a full dose of aspirin as soon as possible. Unfortunately, aspirin use in acute myocardial infarction is not universal. In a report on the treatment of acute myocardial infarction in US academic centres, only 58.7% of all post-infarct patients were taking daily aspirin 10 days after the index infarction. The proportion receiving aspirin within the first 24 h may be substantially lower. Evidence for heparin as sole adjunctivetherapy to thrombolysis There have been no mortality trials of adequate sample size to assess the role of heparin as sole adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis. Subgroup analyses from 433 patients in the SCATI trial provide the only available mortality data on the addition of heparin to thrombolysis in the absence of aspirin. In the subgroup that received streptokinase with or without subcutaneous calcium heparin, there were 10 deaths among 218 patients randomised to heparin and 19 among 215 receiving placebo (not significant, 95% CI 0.22–1.02). Furthermore, no significant differences between treatments were found for recurrent ischaemia or non-fatal reinfarction. The ISIS-2 trial, although not designed to assess the effects of heparin, also provided subgroup data for patients who received subcutaneous or intravenous heparin at the discretion of the treating physician. Mortality among streptokinase-treated patients was 8.3% for those who also received intravenous heparin and 9.0% for those receiving subcutaneous heparin. Neither mortality rate was as low as that achieved by the combination of streptokinase and aspirin without heparin (8.0%). We must emphasise that non-randomised comparisons of heparin and no heparin in ISIS-2 may be subject to substantial bias. If the decision to use heparin was related to severity of infarction, mortality could be falsely high in the heparin-treated groups. Conversely, because early death prevents the use of heparin altogether, mortality may be falsely high in the no-heparin groups. Despite the paucity of randomised trial data showing a mortality benefit of heparin as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis, routine treatment of acute myocardial infarction in many parts of the world includes immediate intravenous heparin. This practice is based largely on the belief that intravenous heparin increases coronary artery patency rates. However, patency data on heparin as sole adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis do not clearly support this view. In fact, the two trials that directly compared intravenous heparin with no heparin as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis in the absence of aspirin give contradictory results. In Bleich and colleagues' study of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) with or without intravenous heparin, the initial angiogram showed coronary patency in a higher proportion of patients who received heparin (71 vs 43%, p=0.015), but there was no significant effect on rates of recurrent ischaemia or reocclusion in the week after infarction. By contrast, in the trial by Topol et al, addition of intravenous heparin to tPA had no effect on coronary patency rates measured at 90 min (79 vs 79%). Two direct comparisons of the effect on patency of heparin and aspirin as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis are equally difficult to interpret. The Heparin Aspirin Reperfusion Trial (HART) directly compared tPA plus early intravenous heparin with tPA and 80 mg aspirin by mouth; coronary patency rates 7–24 h after therapy started were higher in the heparin than the aspirin group (82 vs 52%, p < 0.0001). However, the 80 mg dose of aspirin used was inadequate to achieve a rapid clinical antithrombotic effect during the 7–24 h when angiography was done. Several studies have shown that whereas full-dose aspirin achieves almost immediate platelet inhibition, doses of 80 mg take as long as 48 h to become maximally effective. Coronary patency was also measured in the HART study at 1 week, when the low dose of aspirin would have achieved full effect; the patency rates in initially patent vessels were 88% in the heparin group and 95% in the aspirin group. The other trial that compared heparin and aspirin plus thrombolysis is that of the National Heart Foundation; selected patients treated with tPA and 24 h intravenous heparin were then randomised to continued intravenous heparin or aspirin (300 mg) plus dipyridamole (300 mg) daily for a week. The dose of aspirin was adequate to achieve rapid clinical antithrombotic effect. The trial showed no difference in coronary artery patency between the continued heparin and aspirin plus dipyridamole groups (81.1 vs 80.2%). Moreover, mortality and reinfarction rates were similar and left-ventricular ejection fractions at 1 month were virtually identical. Thus, this trial shows that 24 h after tPA infusion, an adequate antiplatelet regimen is at least as effective as intravenous heparin in maintaining vessel patency, preserving left-ventricular function, and preventing reocclusion. Thus no randomised trial with mortality as a pre-specified endpoint has shown a benefit of heparin as sole adjunctive therapy for thrombolysis. Furthermore, patency studies provide inconsistent evidence of efficacy, and no trial has shown a benefit of intravenous heparin over aspirin in adequate doses. Evidence for combining aspirin and heparinas adjunctive therapy Data for full-dose aspirin plus heparin as adjuncts to thrombolysis are available from large mortality trials with delayed subcutaneous heparin and small patency studies with early intravenous heparin. The Gruppo Italiano per lo Studio della Sopravvivenza nell'Infarcto Miocardico (GISSI-2), its international extension, and the Third International Study of Infarct Survival (ISIS-3) are large mortality trials that have provided reliable and consistent information on the risks and benefits of combined aspirin and subcutaneous heparin or aspirin alone as adjuncts to thrombolysis (table I). GISSI-2 and its international extension compared directly the efficacy of two thrombolytic agents (streptokinase and tPA) and also tested whether there are additional net benefits of adding anticoagulation with delayed subcutaneous heparin to aspirin therapy plus thrombolysis. All 20,891 patients received 300–325 mg aspirin daily by mouth, starting at the time of randomisation; thus a substantial antithrombotic effect would have occurred by the end of the thrombolytic infusion. GISSI-2 found no differences in overall mortality between streptokinase and tPA, although streptokinase was associated with significantly fewer strokes. The addition of delayed subcutaneous heparin to a regimen of full-dose aspirin and thrombolysis had no significant effect on in-hospital mortality (8.5 vs 9.0%, p=0.29) or total mortality at 35 days (9.3 vs 9.4%, p=0.82). Because the subcutaneous heparin regimen in GISSI-2 was delayed, it could have no more than a moderate effect on activated partial thromboplastin time. Even so, it was associated with a significantly higher rate of bleeding necessitating transfusion (table I). This randomised comparison is consistent with subgroup data from ISIS-2. ISIS-3 compared the efficacy of streptokinase, tPA, and anistreplase and of subcutaneous heparin versus no heparin among 41,299 patients with evolving myocardial infarction. All patients received aspirin (162 mg daily) and the first dose was chewed for rapid and full antithrombotic effect. ISIS-3 found no differences in overall mortality among the thrombolytic agents tested, although cerebral haemorrhage was significantly less frequent with streptokinase than with the other agents. Nor was the addition of subcutaneous heparin to aspirin associated with any reduction in the prespecified endpoint of 35-day mortality (table I). During the scheduled 7 days of heparin use there were slightly fewer deaths in the aspirin plus heparin group than in the aspirin alone group (7.4 vs 7.9%, p=0.06). As in GISSI-2, the addition of delayed subcutaneous heparin to aspirin was associated with higher frequencies of important side-effects, including major non-cerebral haemorrhage and definite or probable cerebral haemorrhage (table I). Reinfarction rates did not differ significantly between aspirin alone and aspirin plus subcutaneous heparin groups. Taken together, the GISSI-2 and ISIS-3 trials provide data on more than 62,000 patients. Overall, they show that treatment with subcutaneous heparin in addition to aspirin and thrombolysis has no significant effect on mortality but does result in an excess of major bleeding necessitating transfusions, as well as cerebral haemorrhage. As well as large mortality trials assessing subcutaneous heparin, there have been three angiographic trials in which patients receiving thrombolysis and full-dose aspirin were randomly allocated intravenous heparin (table II). Only one found any significant difference between heparin and no-heparin groups in coronary patency, and even that small increase was not associated with any significant improvement in enzymatic infarct size or recurrent ischaemic episodes. Thus, despite the widespread use of intravenous heparin no patency data so far support the additional use of this agent once full-dose aspirin has been given with streptokinase or anistreplase. For tPA, intravenous heparin added to aspirin seems to provide a small additional patency benefit. However, this benefit must be weighed against the higher rates of haemorrhage associated with intravenous heparin as well as the higher rates of stroke with tPA than with other thrombolytics. The routine addition of intravenous heparin to tPA therefore may not be clinically advisable, especially since tPA given with full-dose aspirin alone gives much better patency rates (75%) than tPA with no aspirin (43%) or inadequate aspirin (52%). Despite a lack of consistent evidence from patency trials supporting intravenous heparin, the use of delayed subcutaneous heparin in the GISSI-2 and ISIS-3 trials has been widely criticised. Sobel and Collen suggested that clinical decisions on intravenous heparin should await the outcome of unfinished trials. However, no large-scale randomised trial has been done, is forthcoming, or is planned that assesses the addition of intravenous heparin to  full-dose aspirin in the setting of thrombolysis. The GUSTO trial assessed the risks and benefits of immediate intravenous heparin or delayed subcutaneous heparin in addition to streptokinase (and found no mortality benefit), but did not make such comparisons for tPA or anistreplase nor provide any mortality comparison of intravenous heparin and no heparin. Also, because the tPA regimen (front-loaded) used in GUSTO differed from that used in GISSI-2 and ISIS-3 we do not know whether differences in efficacy are due to the more aggressive heparin regimen or to the more aggressive thrombolysis. At present, the only available data on the addition of intravenous heparin to full-dose aspirin plus thrombolysis are from non-randomised comparisons. In ISIS-3, 4852 patients received intravenous heparin off-protocol. Overall, their mortality rate was higher than that of patients who received subcutaneous heparin but lower than that of those receiving no heparin. As discussed above, such non-randomised comparisons are likely to be biased. Thus, although these subgroup data are compatible with the possibility that intravenous heparin adds a small benefit to that already achieved by aspirin and thrombolysis, they also raise concerns about excess risks of stroke (2.1% with intravenous heparin, 1.1% with subcutaneous heparin, 1.2% with none). Net benefit-to-risk ratio of aspirin and heparin in the setting of thrombolysis Despite the lack of some important information, we believe the currently available randomised trial data can guide clinicians weighing the benefits and risks of adding aspirin and heparin to thrombolysis (table III). For every 1000 patients admitted to hospital with acute evolving myocardial infarction, about 100 can be expected to die within 35 days. From the results of ISIS-2, the use of full-dose aspirin immediately would prevent 23 of these premature deaths and cause no increase in risk of cerebral haemorrhage. From the results of all randomised placebo-controlled mortality trials of thrombolytic treatment, its use within 6 h would prevent another 27 premature deaths, although 2 or 3 treated patients would have non-fatal cerebral haemorrhage. Since the effects of aspirin and thrombolysis are largely additive, nearly half of all expected deaths among 1000 acute infarctions can be avoided by their combined use. Once aspirin and thrombolysis are given, however, the additional benefit of delayed subcutaneous heparin seems limited. From GISSI-2 and ISIS-3, addition of subcutaneous heparin is unlikely to reduce mortality but will cause 1 or 2 further non-fatal cerebral haemorrhages and 3 other bleeds necessitating transfusion. The risks and benefits of adding intravenous heparin to aspirin and thrombolysis are unknown and will remain so until trials are done to address this question adequately. We believe therefore that the available evidence strongly supports the use of full-dose aspirin as adjunctive therapy to thrombolysis. By contrast, the routine immediate use of heparin for all patients being treated with aspirin and thrombolysis still requires testing in large-scale randomised trials. If designed appropriately, future studies on new thrombin inhibitors, such as hirudin and hirulog, can provide important and relevant information to this unanswered but crucial clinical question."
ACA ACA-J57-002 1.23 "CONTINUITY AND CHANGE The British Political Culture CONTINUITY AND CHANGE, as we have observed, are features of every political system. In order to understand the extent and nature of that change one has to generate some analytically useful framework. What the opening chapter did was to provide largely descriptive material of the society with which we are concerned. It did not generate a framework that would help us understand the nature of continuity and change in Britain. The purpose of this chapter is to provide such a framework. The emphasis of the chapter will be on the political culture. As I shall seek to show, however, that culture cannot be divorced from the constraints of history and of physical and spatial resources. Each has had a significant impact on the other. The impact has not been in one direction only: the political culture has served to shape political perceptions and actions, and hence to influence the nation's political history. Conversely, those actions have been constrained by the experiences of history. They have also been constrained by Britain's geographic location and limited resources. A number of problems have to be borne in mind. As we shall see, there are problems inherent in trying to give shape to such an abstract concept as political culture. There is the danger of tautology and of failing to distinguish between how a system operates and the way in which people believe it should operate. There is the problem also of attempting to discern the  cause-and-effect relationships among culture, history, and resources. The problem here is analogous to that embodies in the familiar conundrum ""Which came first, the chicken or the egg?""  The existence of a stable political culture in Britain has been ascribed by some to the effectiveness of government. But what has enabled government to be effective? Has it been a distinctive political culture, citizens being prepared to acquiesce in and, when called on, to support the demands made of them by government? If so, what explains the existence of such a political culture? Is not a partial explanation the effectiveness of government? The problem is an acute one in the case of Britain, given the absence of any clear point of departure. Where does English, Scottish, or Welsh history begin? At what point is a political culture discernible? The problem is largely an insuperable one, and all we can do at this stage is to bear it in mind. Fortunately, it does not present an insurmountable obstacle; as I shall seek to show, the importance of the relationship is one of mutual reinforcement. What, then, is the British political culture? How important have been the constraints of history and of resources? How does it compare with other polities? And is it, as some writers have suggested, in a state of collapse? Political culture is a vague abstract concept that has been subject to various definitions. In its simplest form, it may be described as denoting the emotional and attitudinal environment within which a political system operates. Various political scientists have sought to define and identify different types of political culture. Almond and Verba, for example, identified three ideal types: participant, subject, and parochial. Others have sought to generate criteria by which to assess the distinctive features of a political culture. THE POLITICAL CULTURE In his work on political oppositions in western democracies, Robert Dahl observed that patterns of opposition may have something to do with widely shared cultural premises. He noted that four kinds of culturally derived orientations toward politics seem to have a bearing on the pattern of opposition. Those four orientations can usefully be employed to help understand and explain attitudes not just toward political opposition in Britain but to the political culture as a whole. They enable one to draw out the distinctive features of that culture, in a more useful manner than does the framework provided by others, and to consider the impact of both history and resources. Those four orientations, listed not in the order provided by Dahl but in the order I believe to be most significant to an understanding to British political culture, are toward (1) problem-solving,(2) the political system,(3) cooperation and individuality, and (4) other people. Orientation toward Problem-Solving Giovanni Sartori has distinguished two approaches to problem-solving: the empirical and the rational. The empirical approach is concerned with what is and what can be seen and touched, proceeding on the basis of testing and retesting and largely rejecting dogma and abstract or coherent grand designs for change. The rationalist approach, by contrast, is concerned with abstraction rather than facts, stressing the need for deductive consistency and tending to be dogmatic and definitive. Dahl states: ""While the empirical approach takes the attitude that if a program does not work in practice there must be something wrong about the theory, the rationalist will retort that what is true in theory must also be true in practice — that it is the practice, not the theory, that is wrong.""  France has been identified as employing a rationalist approach. Germany and Italy, to some extent, tend also to find such an approach useful. Britain and the United States, by contrast, are seen as the exemplars of an empirical approach. Indeed, it is my contention that this approach is most marked in the British case and that it constitutes the most significant aspect of British political culture. Although more oriented toward an empirical approach, the United States has exhibited some elements of the rationalist. While tempered by experience and (according to Beard) self-interest, the framers of the United States Constitution were informed by Lockean values and sought to impose a political framework in line with a Lockean conception of society. Those values and that conception of society have permeated the American consciousness, so much so that they have largely gone unstated. They have been so pervasive and so self-evident that there has been little point in articulating them. Hence, the United States might be described as being oriented toward a mix of the empirical and the rationalist, albeit with the former being clearly the more dominant of the two. Britain, by contrast, has a distinct orientation toward the empirical approach. Even the political system, however strong the attachment to it, tends to be justified in pragmatic terms. Democracy, having been implemented in largely pragmatic fashion, has been lauded on the grounds that ""it works.""  The point has been well put by Vivien Hart in comparing American and British approaches: ""In America,"" she wrote, ""the emphasis has been on what democracy is and should be, while Britain has been characterised by a more pragmatic and less urgent emphasis on what democracy is and can be.""  Empiricism seems appropriate to the English consciousness. Instinct, trial and error, and incremental change are the essence of the English approach to problem-solving.  ""I believe in the instinctive wisdom of our well-tried democracy,"" declared Churchill in 1945 — shortly before going down to election defeat. Such an orientation to problem-solving has been a distinctive feature of English political culture for many centuries, discernible, I would suggest, since at least the thirteenth century. It is an approach that has informed political actions and hence the political history of the country. An empirical orientation has in turn been reinforced by the experience of history — it is the approach that has always been employed and no external constraints have managed to force themselves on the nation to generate conditions in which a rationalist approach would be possible. In the wake of the War of Independence, Americans were able to sit down and generate a political system from first principles. Invasions by foreign powers and subsequent liberation (or absence of liberation) have put other states in similar positions. England, by contrast, has never been faced with or sought such an opportunity. The closest it came was during the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell in the seventeenth century. When that failed, the country resorted as far as possible to the conditions prevailing prior to its creation. English history is scattered with philosophers generating theories that have failed to find congenial soil in the nation's consciousness. Ideologies have been either discarded or else molded to fit with the experience of history. Prevailing theories, once they no longer seem appropriate, have been dispensed with. The act of dispensing with them has not always met with common assent nor has it always been smooth — the English historical landscape is scattered with periods of violence and upheaval — but once the dispensing process is achieved, it has largely been accepted. Hankering after the old order is congenial to some minds, but seeking to revert by force or civil unrest to the status quo ante is not. In the English perception, empiricism is both a descriptive and a prescriptive term. To the Englishman, it is both what is and what he believes always has been. Orientation toward the political system may be classified as allegiant when attitudes, feelings, and evaluations are favorable to the political system; apathetic or detached when feelings and evaluations are neutral; and alienated when such feelings and evaluations are unfavorable. Italy and France have been cited as examples of political cultures that generate alienation and a large measure of apathy. West Germany has been put forward as having a culture that generates detachment. In contrast, Britain and the United States are among those countries cited as exhibiting a strong allegiant orientation. Orientation toward the Political System Almond and Verba found that evaluation of the political system in Britain was the product of a mix of participant and deferential orientations. A participant orientation was developed in Britain (citizens being oriented to the input as well as the output side of the political system, believing that  they enjoyed access to it), but it was one adapted to an existing deference to the independent authority of government. The participant orientation in Britain, unlike that in the United States, did not displace the deferential, it remained important. The participant orientation finds expression in citizens' beliefs that they can influence government at both the national and local level. Although Almond and Verba found few people in their survey who actually sought to exert such influence, the proportion who believed that they could exert influence was significant. Of British respondents, 57% said that they could influence national and local government. (The figure for the United States was 67%.) Only 19% of those questioned felt that they had no influence at national and local levels. (The figure for the United States was 15 per cent.) By contrast, of Germans, Italians, and Mexicans interviewed, more believed they had no influence at national and local level than believed that they had. Only 25% of Italians, for example, believed that they could influence national and local government, and 47% said they had no such influence. Deference to the authority of government has found expression in a number of ways. It has been shown in a voluntary compliance with basic political laws. Criminal acts tend to be antisocial rather than conscious acts against ""the state.""  (Indeed, the concept of ""the state"" is one that is not well entrenched in English consciousness.) There has been little overt opposition to the parliamentary form of government in Britain. Some may want to modify its form but do not challenge the principle of it, nor do they seek to change its form through unlawful and certainly not violent means. When government authority has been challenged citizens have expressed themselves in favor of maintaining that authority. When called on by government to act in time of war, citizens have been prepared to respond. Such deference has often been seen as allied with a social deference, citizens according certain skills of government to those drawn from a particular group. Walter Bageho, in his classic work The English Constitution, identified England as a ""deferential nation,"" one that had a structure of its own.  ""Certain persons,"" he wrote, ""are by common consent agreed to be wiser than others, and their opinion is, by consent, to rank for much more than its numerical value.""  Such deference, though possibly weakened, survived into the era of mass suffrage and the democratic ideal. It has been seen as a significant feature of contemporary Britain and has been variously offered as a partial explanation of the continuing success of the Conservative party and its socially atypical leadership. Such deference, though, has been contingent rather than certain. It has been based on a reciprocity between governors and governed. The populace has deferred to the independent authority of government and to those who occupy government in return for the satisfaction of expectations. Those expectations have covered the substance of policies (improving material well-being, for example) as well as the form of government. Almond and Verba, for example, found that an overwhelming majority of Britons expected equal treatment from politicians and from bureaucrats. Conversely, those to whom citizens accord deference have been characterized by having an in-bred sense of duty. A stress on responsibilities as well as rights has been a significant and long-standing feature of the British culture and has been well imbued by a large part of the nation's political elite. A paternalistic concern for the well-being of the nation has been a feature of most if not all monarchs and has been associated with a particular and often predominant tradition within the Conservative party. As long as the political system has been able to maintain the capacity to meet the demands and expectations of citizens, an allegiant orientation has been demonstrated by citizens. The longer the system has been able to do this and the longer people have been socialized into accepting the efficacy of the system, the stronger and more enduring the allegiance has been. In Almond and verba's survey, more Britons expressed pride in their governmental and political institutions than in any other feature of the nation that was mentioned. The same pride was found in Americans, on a larger scale. (Of Americans, 85% expressed pride in their institutions, compared with 46% of Britons.) In stark contrast, only 7% of Germans expressed pride in their governmental and political institutions, and the figure for Italians was 3%. Some cultures emphasize the values of cooperating with others, conciliating opposing views, and being prepared to compromise and submerge one's own ideas in a broader and more popularly acceptable solution. Others, by contrast, stress the virtues of maintaining the distinctiveness, ideas, and integrity of the individual, such virtues being considered superior to those of compromise and cooperation. Orientation toward Cooperation and Individuality France and Italy have been cited as examples of countries in which the maintenance of group and individual integrity is stressed in both the general culture and in political life. Britain and the United States are included among those countries in which the political culture emphasizes the virtues of compromise and conciliation, without threatening personal integrity. The Anglo-American perception was well expressed by Edmund Burke in 1775.  ""All government, indeed every human benefit and enjoyment, every virtue, and every prudent act,"" he declared, ""is founded on compromise and barter.""  In Britain there is an almost instinctive distaste for conflict, both in personal relationships and in political life. The formal political framework facilitates an adversary relationship among political parties, but the underlying reality is a quest for compromise. Parties play according to the rules of  the constitutional game. Similar observations can be made about groups in industry and in society generally. There is a penchant, almost, for resolving disputes by discussion, by sitting around a table and ironing out one's differences. It is an orientation compatible with the others already identified and it is eminently congenial to a society that stresses the responsibilities as well as the rights of the individual. It remains an orientation that Britons not only find congenial but also take as the source of a certain pride. A belief that one can have faith and confidence in others has been put forward as a culturally rooted phenomenon, with potentially important implications for political life. Research by Morris Rosenberg has shown that ""faith in people"" is related to democratic and internationalist values and attitudes. In their study, Almond and Verba found that the Americans and the British ""tend to be consistently most positive about the safety and responsiveness of the human environment.""  The Germans and the Italians, by contrast, were found to be more negative, and the Mexicans inconsistent. Orientation toward Other People Trust in one's fellow countrymen remains a significant feature of contemporary British society. A Gallup Poll in 1980 found that 85% of respondents considered other Britons to be very or fairly trustworthy. The experience of history may have helped to consolidate such a sense of trust. Britons have stood successfully shoulder-to-shoulder in order to win battles abroad and to repel foreign invaders from their shores. During the Second World War, the nation did not have to contend with a significant fifth column or with the equivalent of Vichy collaborators. There is little or nothing in recent history that would give Britons cause to distrust their compatriots. Similarly, the experience of history, island isolation, and shared values may serve to explain differing levels of trust that Britons have in other people. Britons tend to retain trust in the inhabitants of countries in which Britain has had or retains colonial interests; countries that share a common language, values, and (in some cases) ancestry; and countries that have stood together in times of crisis. There are strong emotional ties to old Commonwealth countries such as New Zealand, Canada, and Australia. There is also a strong sense of closeness to the United States. Of respondents in the Gallup Poll in 1980, 70% regarded Americans as very or fairly trustworthy. (Only the Swiss and the Dutch received marginally higher ratings.) Another poll a year later asked respondents the extent to which they thought they could trust certain countries as allies in the event of war. The proportion responding that they thought they could trust the United Sates ""a great deal"" was 62% (up from 45% in 1975), a figure not matched by any other country: the closest was Norway, which 37% thought they could trust to the same extent. The two polls revealed lower levels of trust in those countries and  people that historically have been Britain's enemies. To the island inhabitants of Britain, such peoples remain distant (though the English Channel constitutes now more a psychological than a physical barrier), with alien cultures, different interests, and different thought processes. Englishmen and Scotsmen, as Anthony King observed, have tended not to think like Europeans nor to think of themselves as Europeans. In the 1980 Gallup Poll, only 32% of the Britons questioned regarded the French as very or fairly trustworthy. The Russians scored 18%. (The West Germans, perhaps surprisingly, scored 60%.) Only 6% of those questioned would trust the French a great deal as allies in time of war, 4% would trust the Spanish, 4% the Italians, and only 3% the Turks. Again, the Germans did better, 22% being prepared to trust them a great deal. Finally, 47% said they would trust the Italians ""not at all,"" and 45% gave a similar response for the French. Despite British membership of the European Communities, there is an important sense in which Britain and certainly the British still look westward across the Atlantic rather than eastward over the English channel. And despite the travails of recent times, trust in one's fellow countrymen and a discriminating, possibly confident, perception of other people remain significant features of the British political culture. The political culture of Britain may then be characterized, in broad terms, as having the four orientations identified: empirical in terms of problem-solving and change, allegiant in terms of the political system, cooperative in making decisions, and trusting with relation to fellow countrymen and allies. These, it is important to stress, are generalizations — there are always individuals or subcultures that may not have such orientations. What is important is that they are and remain the orientations of most Britons, both at the mass and the elite level. A DECLINING CULTURE? The strength of the culture may be said to lie in the convergence of these orientations — that is, they are compatible with and reinforce one another , and similarly are compatible with and are reinforced by the experience of history. The stress on cooperation and compromise, an emphasis compatible with an empirical approach to change, has facilitated the integration of groups and individuals into the political system. Such integration may be seen as reinforcing an allegiant rather than a neutral or alienated orientation to the political system. History, as we have mentioned, has been kind: the country has staved off invasion by its enemies, and the resources have been available for government to make and meet commitments in response to changing demands and expectations. As a result, it has been possible to interpret the experience of history as justifying or reinforcing an attachment  to empirical problem-solving and to the virtues of cooperation and trust. The interplay of these variables generated what Almond and Verba characterized as ""the civic culture,""  ""a pluralistic culture based on communication and persuasion, a culture of consensus and diversity, a culture that permitted change but moderated it.""  What of the civic culture today? My argument is simply stated: Although subject to modification, the civic culture remains. What has been the subject of radical, almost revolutionary, change over the past decade or so has not been the civic culture but the perceptions of that culture. In short, it has not changed as much as observers think it has. I do not argue that the political culture of Britain remains unchanged. The culture not only allows for change, usually incremental but occasionally radical, but itself can and does change. In good British fashion, however, that change has tended to be piecemeal rather than comprehensive. Some values, attitudes and emotions have been subject to modification over time, but the essential orientations outlined above have not been discarded. They remain the orientations that converge to form the predominant element of the British political culture. What has changed, and changed radically over the period from the late 1960s to the early 1980s, has been the perception of that culture. Analyses of the British political culture have swung, pendulum fashion, from one extreme to the other. At times of apparent stability, contentment, and political success, there has been a tendency to see the political culture in idealized terms, to hold it aloft and laud it as a culture to be admired and possibly even envied. Although Almond and Verba drew attention to some of the inconsistencies and problems inherent in the civic culture, it was nonetheless difficult not to ascribe positive connotations to that culture. There are a number of problems inherent in the political culture. A disposition to incremental change can deflect one from considering or even comprehending wider and more fundamental problems. The combination of an empirical orientation and historical continuity has produced a political system that is complex and disparate. While the American federal system has been likened to a marble cake, the British political system can be likened to a patchwork quilt. It may look to some extent like the original, it may even retain traces of the original, but the many pieces that make the whole were added at different times and have been the subject of change and much repair work. It includes structures that (according to some observers) have facilitated policy discontinuity — a discontinuity not incompatible with an empirical orientation to change — yet comprises such an interdependent complex of political bodies that it has become increasingly difficult for government to govern and to initiate radical and comprehensive change. Such difficulty has been exacerbated by the desire to resolve problems by compromise. Problems that cannot be resolved by reasoned debate have tended to be ignored in the hope that they will go away. Such inherent problems tend to be discounted, ignored, or even interpreted in a favorable light at times when the political system appears to be successfully meeting the demands and expectations of the populace. When the system appears to be malfunctional, usually at times of economic difficulty for the country, some commentators identify such inherent problems as providing at least a partial explanation for the system's poor showing. In the latter half of the 1970s, for example, policy discontinuity arising from an electoral and political system that encouraged an ""adversary style"" of politics was offered as a partial explanation for Britain's poor economic performance. Other commentators have sought to identify the nation's problems not in terms of the effect of some aspects of the political culture but as agents generating and reflecting a decline in the culture itself. In the 1970s and early 1980s, a number of observers began to chart a decline in the civic culture. In 1982, on the basis of some survey evidence, Samuel Beer concluded that ""it is no exaggeration to speak of the decline in the civic culture as a"" collapse """" . He argued that as old institutions failed to meet new expectations, so legitimacy in government would falter and trust in its equity and effectiveness would decline. He hypothesized and sought to show that the consequences of this included a greater self-assertion by participants, a decline of leadership, a weakening of party government, and a loosening of the nexus of class and party.  ""In an ironic sense,"" Beer declared,""Britain is maintaining its leadership. As it once showed the way toward democratic success, today it blazes the trail toward democratic failure."" While Beer's hypothesis is plausible as to the effect of institutions that fail to meet new expectations on legitimacy in government, it is arguable as to the extent to which such a failure to meet expectations has taken place. This is a point to which I shall return in the concluding chapter. Although government capacity to meet expectations has declined, its capacity to meet expectations in the past built up a body of diffuse support, support that now exists independently of particular failures to meet demands. Furthermore, there is evidence that the expectations themselves may be changing, converging more with the capacity of the system to meet them. Certainly, it will be my case that the political culture has neither declined nor been threatened to the extent suggested by Beer and other Jeremiahs. Certain institutions may be under threat (as subsequent chapters will show) but not in a manner inconsistent with the existing political culture. The civic culture may be weakened but it has not collapsed. Its position is similar to that of Mark Twain: reports of its death would be greatly exaggerated. As I shall seek to show, the political culture remains predominantly an allegiant one, and the important question to be addressed is not ""why has there been a decline in the civic culture?"" but rather ""why has that decline not been greater?""

I says  no it ain't  I says I ain't signed anything! He says, that was done over the phone! I said  Yeah. to you on the phone that I  had not seen the job  and that I said yes  alright  knowing I hadn't seen the job, also that you knew that I hadn't seen it  and if I didn't agree with it, then I was gonna change it, and I've changed it! Yeah. Then he started on  he started tutting, the old , I jus sa I just carried on working, I just slammed the Citreon on  cranked that up  and er  he started  going on about oh  this is the price and everything. I just turned round and says  mine was the cheapest price anyway! I noticed the other  quote was over two hundred flaming quid, and you've knocked me down! I said  fuck off out of here! Yeah. It's quite good that that chap had actually showed you  the right  quote weren't it? Yeah, cos  yeah. Yeah. And that, anyway, he then says er  er er er he said, he said something like  I weren't really listening. Yeah. I says I'll Gods our original er  our authorisation.

And he says er  what do you say, he said er  that's good innit  having a big knocker there? He says er  anybody  or anything he says er  you can't let them in can you, well they won't, they can't come in can they? I didn't answer him! I found the letter and he went. Yeah. And that's it. So what's he gonna do about that then? Well he can't do a thing about it! I know. He knows he can't ! He's got the car! You know perhaps he could of  on. That's insurance company. Well they're such pigs aren't they! Ahhh! Yeah, well tha , they've dropped themselves right in it now! They have! In actual fact, what you wanna do now is to er  perhaps have a little er  letter writing to Avon. Yeah. Tell them what you think of them. And er let them yeah let  Yeah do. them know what sort of, how  have behaved. Yeah. Yeah. Can I do it? So  complete with threats! And er  just tell them that er  the way they've behaved, that you thought the way to  I mean  though innit? Well   You thought the way they behaved was er  despicable! Well, it's the way he spoke on the phone in the first place! Yeah. Er  when he wanted to knock it down. Yeah. You know, I was only  been working there a week, well two weeks! Yeah. Something like that. Yeah but you must complain to Avon though! Cos Avon's a big insurance company. And I've done  I know, I've had  I've done lots of work for them in the last couple  And I've done work for them of years. already! Yep. Separate from Quadling  Yeah  yeah. That's right. Now, and he come  their assessor Yeah. looked at the car, and said do it! Yeah. Well    No hassle whatsoever! That's right, yeah. Right, well if give me their address, then we can get a letter. Yeah  you've got address. Yeah, it's at  at er That's it, Wentworth. Wentworth. Oh right. Yeah. Oh well, you know   you can draft a letter up    Oh I will! Yeah, just say that you were very  She'll love me! disappointed with the way their agents, i.e. Quadling er  have been behaving! Dealing , yeah. And er  er  also mention the fact that er  er  you know for a fact  or, or, you know  that er  the other quotes that er  put in a bill, put in a bill for a er  about a hundred pound more than what I did, or whatever, whatever  Mm. it was! And er  they'll know this  and er  Oh yeah! then, then just tell them the facts  you know? Yeah. And also mention that er this bloke came round and issued a  offered er int , er intimidation and threats! Legal threats as well! Yeah, and some days you need to . Yeah. And er  you know  put it down in writing because  that way Avon will then se see  and the , hang on! What's Quadling playing at here! We're not having that! Yeah. We're not having this! Yeah. And also state  that over the years  er  your father  used to run the business  done hundreds of jobs for Avon Insurance  at, and er  also you yourself have done jobs for Avon Insurance before  who have never ever had any trouble whatever so ever! Like er  you know, with any of the work we've done No. er  it's always been er  guaranteed  i.e. if a customer was not satisfied, then one hundred percent we will rectify whatever it is they're not satisfied with. Mm. We always maintain that  our word is our bond  all of our work. And then  to be treated  er  as out and out er  criminals, like this Quadling had done with us  is just beyond all bounds of having reasonable Mm. business sense! Yeah. But wha but when he'd said, turned round and said, oh it's a legal contract! I'd tell him  It's not! to fuck off! Not over the phone. Spoken  as in   but it's  you know You've gotta sign something. I know. But that's  intimidation that is, threats  That's right. at you. Okay, yes I agreed  for the er  the price  but I said that I haven't seen the work. I hadn't seen  Okay. the job. I've, I've quoted for the job. That's right. I says okay  I'll agree to it but I wanna se , I haven't seen it, so how do I know? Yeah. You know  that's what I said to him  on the phone! Oh we'll remember that! By the way, I've told you I got charged er  fifteen pounds did I? Oh I told you Mel, did I? Yeah. And ten pounds from the bank! Cos I was twenty five pence overdrawn! So I wrote a stinking letter to them! A one of the  one of the sentences,, how dare you authorise  the withdrawal of fifteen pounds from account  without prior notification! Or at least having the decency and good manners to at least let me know what you'd done! Yeah! And er, anyway I got this terrific letter back! You should, well  granddad was there  about half an hour reading it! It was er one foolscap plus  of, of words you know, explaining what, what they'd done  and all this  and why they'd done it ! They credited you? And  yeah, they've gone and re-credited me for the fifteen pound! Yeah! Yeah. Great! Bit over the top innit? Fifteen quid for twenty five pence! Well then, no, what it is they've charged for each  Yeah. cheque that you Yeah. you do about a quarter. I wouldn't of minded, like I said to the bloke er  if he, if I'd been er  a hundred pounds overdrawn  or fifty quid overdrawn or something like that, I wouldn't of minded so much because I knew  Yeah. that I would be overdrawn. Mm. And I'd know that I'd incurred that expense. But er  but a mere twenty pe pence! I thought, it's an insult my flipping intelligence! Yeah. That's right. But it was , you know. Well anyway I got this lovely letter back! Oh well! So letter and er  and evening compiling it  has er gained me my fifteen pound back! Yeah. No it doesn't hurt to write a few letters. Old bloke came round today. Oh David! Yes. Cor he did half stink of booze! Oh it's Yeah, apparently he had a row with his Mrs  ex-Mrs  wife. Yeah. He had a row with his new wife  . So why did he come round and see you? Dunno. Start again  on booze! Bought a Volvo, T reg    forty quid! Did he? Well if, if he's got an M O T on it he'll be able to run it until the M O T runs out November. runs out. Oh well he can run until then, then and  just take it out to  and leave it there. He's done it up. Has he? He's doing it up. Yeah. And what are they doing about it, nothing! I reckon it ought to be compulsory that. Like a car needs to go in for the M O T, you've gotta Mm, you've gotta have your eyes tested. for your eyes. Yeah. In Germany you have to carry, if you wear glasses, you have to carry a spare pair of glasses with you! Yeah. I had to do this in Adelaide you know, when I went for my D S V license. I had  loads of dots in front of me  you know, in this machine Colour blind. and er yeah, I had to er tell them what numbers were what er letters  Mm. numbers rather were coming, coming up, you know? And I just ran through them, you know, it was no problem  to me. But I can image yo ,yo , you can stand   You'd fail. doing it. So  and er  ooh I had  they did er  this old butterfly thing as well, the old psychology bit as well , you know. What does that look like? You know ! A blob of ink squashed together what else! You know? Yeah. And er  how old? That was the first time I had to cough for anybody that was, as well. . I didn't particularly like that idea. Just testing for a hernia, I told I hadn't got one! Yeah. Ha! It's like that er  truck driver that came into your place when er  you and er  that bloke that used to there. And a  he came in there and er  for his glasses  and er  old  was having a headache actually  everything Oh yeah. and he, he was a  er  said he was nearly enough, near enough blind! Mm! And here he is  driving trucks around the countryside! Did he? Yeah. And he persisted  as well! Yeah, he didn't need glasses for driving! You know  er! The old, old ones are the worst, I tell you! Yeah. Well anybody over forty years old it ought to be, it ought to be compulsory! Mm. Yeah. It's like, I remember nan  don't need glasses! Yeah. She should be wearing glasses. Yeah. Well what, I'll never forget this chap do up on Avenue Road he were  like that! He'd been driving for  sixty years, you've never had an accident. Yeah, I mean, his vision was absolutely appalling! Yeah. I said, well you shouldn't be driving! Yeah. See even with glasses on! Yeah. No, my driving's alright ma ! But he can't hear nothing about ! No, he can't actually no! Except get the cops in. It's a privilege . I'll always maintain that people with glasses know they've got something wrong with their eyes so  the chances are if they're wearing glasses then they can see properly! Yeah. It's the guy that hasn't got glasses, that's the guy you've gotta worry about. Yeah. That's right. What's the time? Any idea? Five to nine. Oh right. Red Dwarf on in a minute. Yeah. Mhm. Ooh!

I was looking for this blooming half thing sticking out! Ha! They stopped them about nineteen fifty nine, something like that. He's driving around without his glasses on! Why isn't he tested? Fancy having a car for that many years! Yeah. He will though, he'll get more now than  what he's paid for it ! Yeah. Japanese cars, you can stick them! Cheap cars  expensive to repair! They are yeah!

Yeah it's all organised, it's not like  like the gypo's will be doing like this  Oh yes! Yeah. this is all organised bloody down to ! Oh yes, all  yeah! They handled something something like  a thousand pounds worth of cars that  They did. place where they  they were like getting er  ones that had been smashed up, and doing and they said that  the people that are doing it  are top people! You know, they could get a really good job. They'd have made a fortune! Not without them garages! Like, like panel beaters and Doing it  make a  make a fortune doing it    Legally. legally. He said they're doing this as well. Oh! like you got your  your chassis number and engine number and everything like that  Yeah. and you've a number inside the car as well on the  bottom of the car  on the floor  so er  some of them  no, they don't  so some of them take the mickey of them and putting different plates on  of a written off car from a scrap yard  so you can have like a  brand new Sierra smashed up in a scrap yard  and you buy it for like  a thousand pound  and you  this Sierra  with a brand new Sierra, so you change all the plates over  and do all this on the car  and then you got a bloody Sierra worth about  nine or ten thousand pound  Ah dear! brand new! Sure! And you've paid a thousand pound for it, so he's making all this profit all the time! Dear! And the  the police were just showing, you know  the ways that they do it sort of thing. Some of them  Oh yes! just get the plate  and er  like stick it over with a bit of er  filler or something like that  and stick it over the top! And, people are none the wiser they, if they can see it  Oh! they go aye, that's alright, but the only way you can tell  you'd feel a jagged edge  where they  put this plate . On the underneath or something. Or some of them they cut the whole floor out and weld a new  take the floor old car  and weld it back in again. Good He said, and the police said  ! as quick as we find a way, to catch them they think of something else  Yeah! they bloody do it all the time! Oh they do! Yeah! And then it was saying about the ones where they take the front end of a car and  joi , match it to the stolen  Joining it, yeah! one, like the one that Yeah. Fell apart in Manchester. There was one in Manchester wasn't there? The Renault five turbo  going down the road and had a crash and it split in two didn't it? That's it. And they all bloody died! Remember you telling us that. And er   said about it's a regular   and er  they're doing it proper, they're putting them on jigs  so they're welding them and they're out of line and all sorts! Oh! And they were interviewing this feller, he said, oh we went for a day out he said and I'd just bought this car  and I was  really made up with it he said  He wasn't a crook this man? He paid  Oh no! two and a half thousand for this Fiesta  He paid two and a thousand for this car, whatever it was! I was real  made up! And he's travelling along the road and the next thing there's such a bang and it wouldn't go any further! Bloody ! So he got out  and he looked underneath and the drive shaft had fell off  so  he got it towed back to the garage  wherever this garage was  and they had a look at it and all the head  were loose  you could waggle them about! And then he thought, this is queer so he picked the bonnet  took the bonnet up like that  and all the bloody front of the car had come loose  and all all the welding  Oh! had co come loose! Bloody amazing it was! So he said, you know  you can't claim anything off the insurers or anything, so that's all his money  No,. straight up the bloody road! And er  the police, that was in Kent somewhere, the police weren't it? Cos only so many police forces have got  a certain group of men  on the  you know, sorting all the cars out  and  you can take your car there life  er  being like   you've just bought a car or you've got a car  you can take it and the police look over it  to see if it's alright. It's a bit late when you've bought it though! If it's been re-registered sort of thing, so  there's a big line in cars  all . And the police engineers go round with his mate and he's looking at the  engine numbers  and the chassis numbers and all those bloody numbers inside the car  and he's looking like and er  the interviewer said  oh and this woman's in for a shock! She's gonna find out that the car is stolen! Oh! So  she comes back and she had an Orion  erm  she sa , she said er oh well erm  I got some bad news for you, said er  your Orion's two cars been welded together! Oh no, she said you're kidding aren't you? No, no, it's right I said erm  the back end is  such and such a registration Ford Orion  but the front end's off a Ford Escort! Ooh hoo hoo  And you know  she'd but  They're not even the same car? She'd lose the bloody car then, she'd lost everything! Ooh gosh! Bloody  hot it were! And what did it look like ? Oh it, it was smart it was nice! Yeah , what have they, those people who are waiting for the police to check it out, the  is it? No they haven't, they'd been  bought a car  that had been  like, that it sort of been written off and rebuilt or  something like that. Yeah. They knew that had been when  Yeah. they bought the car? So they thought they'd have it checked out? Yeah. Oh I wouldn't buy a car like that, no  The D V L C, if you have a written off  would you? they'll re-register it as long as you can prove the year of the car, they register it  Oh, I see! as that year. But, the registrations  if they can't prove it properly Yeah. you get a Q plate on it  questionable registration. Oh! So  the D V L C don't look into it too deep  they just send  No! an engineer have a look round, oh it looks alright. You wouldn't want one that had been in a smash anyway, it could  Yes! be false  . But you some people who you see will take that gamble  And then there was an  inspector from the Not always, not always impressed but he was er   Yeah. you know, I know you're saying. Oh, I play heck about them I  But  know! erm  I remember when I  when we had the smash in Liverpool with the  Zepher  The old Zepher now, yeah and er  I went there and they give me an estimate  and erm  when it went in  the contacts she does was er  no, it's it's more than we thought  because the chassis's twisted or  Mm. something  so, anyway  I went there  I can't remember all the details but  No. I I went there for something  and my car  ooh I think it was  and we had , you know Fair play, yeah. we went to town If I'd  Yeah. if it, if if I'd have taken it to er   body repair Well they couldn't of done that cos they hadn't  Oh no! got the  Yeah. equipment and all that had they? and if he could find the  he wouldn't of ! Kirby's is the ? So you'd have been running ? Aye. Yeah. It's an old family firm Oh aye! they're all out of it now. Yeah. What happened in this smash up he was talking about? I was pregnant with Nicola, ooh it wasn't a smash as such, you know, it wasn't  serious thing. I was pregnant with Nicola  and it was that we wanted to change  the car, what did we have, a Metropole at the No, we'd just bought it. yes, I know that, but I'm just explaining how we come to be in Liverpool! Yeah. We'd go we been to . We'd gone back for something for them to do something to it, it is the Metropolitan. Oh yeah, it's the Metropole , for this  er  Zephyr. this white Zephyr, and we got it from Liverpool, Wayne's Drive in Liverpool, a big garage. And, we had it  the one with the gear box. Yeah. There's a big Ford dealer in Liverpool. They would  said what they would do  well they did everything while we were there Yes. and said   and they come back And he said  from Liverpool wait a bit, and they said  so, they looked at it  and said we'd have to take it back in a few days time for them to do, they couldn't do it there and then. And, when we were driving back towards the tunnel, do you know Upper Parliament Street? We were  No. you go right through the tunnel and this Queen's Drive was  ooh, about a mile or two out of Liverpool   so to get back to the tunnel you come down Upper Parliament Street, I'll never forget to my dying day, and it was down hill  and these traffic lights down the bottom should of been  should of been, but they weren't operating, they were digging th  they were digging the road   ooh, they weren't there alright, I thought they were just out of order cos it was road repairs  and a policeman was supposed to be on duty  because it was this great big wide Upper Parliament Street, and going across it, if I look at Liverpool   Was there, did you do Upper Parliament Street? Mm. If you say it again I told you! . I don't know what the road that goes across it was, but another great big wide road running across it  Lower Parliament Street maybe? across it, Lower Parliament Street was the other side of the crossroads! Was it? And, I was prattling on to your dad, saying  when we claimed it back  when we claimed it back  we'll  bring it early but  What you want ? Oh, he's so ignorant! I don't know want anything! Well I've heard this story! I was there when it happened! they wanted it early, I don't want anything! Do you want crisps? Nothing! Nothing? Ooh, okay! I'll have a  wine thanks? And  do you want  Medium white wine. crisps? Could I have some cheese and onion please? Pint of Stella please? Yeah? Yeah? A pint of Stella? Yeah. No crisps? you were going on about that  they said  you're bringing back that car. when we send it back in a few days fitting, this job I says we'll want it early in the morning and you can have it in the afternoon, but we were going to spend the day in Liverpool, but you're dad said, I'm not being round all those shops all day, so I said ooh no! And it was me, and I was due to have Nicola the next month,at the beginning of May that the   and I said no, I said! But what we'll do is take it there early in the morning, we'll get he back the bus back to Liverpool, we'll go to the pier head and we'll go on the ferry to New Brighton and there was me prattling all on at him  and the next thing  er, you di , we didn't know  that, we thought we were on the main right of way street  and  your dad started to go across  and I looked, your dad was driving, I was sitting beside him and coming towards us along this other road, which had the right of way but we didn't know was a little black mini, I was a ergh, ergh oh Harry, Harry! Bashed your dad's side, the wing and we could see a policeman putting, it was pouring with rain and he was putting his er, big mac on and he should of been directing the traffic, he told us that, he come over to us and he was only young like   and he said, oh I'd just left, I was on duty here I'd just left to go and put my mac on! Well that was no consolation to us was it! So we swapped addresses with er, can't remember, it was a man  middle-aged sort of man  and er  he then said ooh, well he said I  still think that we were in the right in as much as if that policeman was supposed to have been directing traffic blah blah blah blah blah! So, because we were in the A A he said you could have a ba , and we had to go to court, we had a summons for court, for careless driving, your dad  and your dad said oh   so A A said you could have barrister, or our insurers said we could have a barrister  our insurers, not the one with we're with now Norman , he was to do all the , said we could have this barrister  and it was at Liverpool Crown Court  and, it wasn't till a , and I was alright we we just got a bit of a shock, you know, we could drive the home it was the wing and what not. But, I can hear that bang now, you never forget a noise like that! But, this was just a bang, sort of knocked  Ah. it of  the chap, he reckoned. So, er Nicola was born and er  the court  either came up just before your dad had the   after Nicola was born, when she was a month old. Now he might remember  I think the court come  just before  the  after Nicola , and the car was going to  because I know we had to go on the train to Liverpool  and er, I'd gotta give evidence as well, they made such a  palaver! And, when we were in the  court  sitting in the  corridor waiting, ooh, some horrible types there even then! This policeman was having to give evidence and he'd come to talk, oh I see you've had the baby, cos he was talking to me  it had happened  I said, oh what did you have blah blah blah, blah blah blah, but the little devil went in the witness box, he  denied about not being there on duty about  putting his mac on, ooh and  he'd never clapped eyes on barrister  or a solicitor and they said he'll meet you before the case, so we had to go extra early meet this barrister  and he never came  and so they took us in this little room in all his wig and his gown, we got, oh what happened? What happened? Yeah, and we explained and said that I was pregnant at the time and we said about the policeman, oh no trouble! No trouble! But,the lot, you're dad still got fined! I took, it  was nine pound  we thought, lot of money in those days for careless driving! Yeah. Yeah. So we never forgot that. Mm. Yeah, I I   on the old . So, needless to say I don't like them, but I'll show you on the A to Z where Upper Parliament Street is. Mum. Not Upper Parliament  And we will see. ? Yeah. Yeah. You're being  Excuse me! funny are now? Well don't worry. actually, but I said I wasn't really interested, yeah.

I always say it was that  because they say that they blame  if can go away  but then it can just strike you! Mm. And then it gets in with a vengeance, when Nicola was a month old didn't it? Yeah. So how long were you layed in? And he was just   Were you in hospital for all  For a month. that time? No. I told  you had to lie on a board  Like ? Yeah. You had to lie on a board, his doctor said, oh it's lumbago  which, all the signs are the same, where that pain goes all down your leg effecting the  or mia , sciatica  and have to lie on a board, and we were in the prefab then  and you actually er  not, like some people put the board  are you interested?

FIC FIC-AC2-003 9.04 "Mark could hardly believe his ears when, two days before the EPC meeting, Muldoon told him that Nate wanted him to fly out to Istanbul right away. It was true that a major problem had just cropped up which demanded immediate attention. The Corporation's major vehicle assembler in Turkey was in serious difficulties, due to the fact that the new Government had slapped an embargo on the importation of components to conserve its diminishing currency reserves. United Motors had received two urgent requests for assistance; one from the local Managing Director, who needed help to resolve his serious plant problems, and the other from the Turkish Prime Minister requesting UM investment support to reduce the country's massive trade imbalance. All this was fact. The fiction was that Nate had instructed Mueller to arrange to get Sanders down there quickly, when he had done no such thing. Muldoon spun the line that the deteriorating situation in Turkey was clearly more important right now than the EPC meeting. Events there were taking much the same course as they had in Portugal, and as Mark had resolved that problem in double quick time, he was considered the best man to deal with this new problem situation. All very flattering, but…. The Englishman sensed that the big personal build-up was a blind to hide Muldoon's real reason for wanting him out of the country. He knew full well that the only circumstances in which a regional planning manager would not be expected personally to present his Ten Year Business Plan to the President of the Corporation was if he was already earmarked for promotion and it was desired to give visibility to his successor, or if he was on his way out. Mark knew that he would never be promoted after the Steiner incident so he concluded he must indeed be on his way out, or being moved sideways. Sensing the  game which was being played, he decided to throw several balls in the air for Muldoon to catch, if he could. So he said that he would take the next available flight to Turkey immediately after the EPC meeting. No, that was no good. Istanbul was expecting him. Meetings had been set up. Nate wanted him there straight away; like today; tomorrow at the latest. ‘Well, give me a few minutes,’ Mark said, ‘and I'll ring the Prime Minister's office in Istanbul, to see if they'll agree to a short postponement.’ ‘No, you can't do that,’ Muldoon replied hurriedly. ‘It was Nate himself who had the meetings fixed up, and he wouldn't want them changed.’ ‘But nothing can be more important than the Business Plan,’ Mark insisted. ‘Nothing, but nothing, is ever allowed to take precedence over that meeting. Dammit, it's the future of the European components business I'll be talking about.’ ‘Yes, I know that, Mark,’ the American countered. ‘But Nate has specifically said that you are the man he wants to fly out to Turkey. I'll have to give the presentation on your behalf. After all, I am the Regional Manager.’ ‘But you never give the planning presentations. That s my bailiwick,’ countered the Englishman, with growing resentment in his voice and manner. ‘Yes, I know that, Mark, but….’ The American couldn't continue the charade any longer. Lowering his head, he said, ‘I'm sorry, Mark, but that's the way they want it, and that's the way it's got to be. Klepner can check out the slides for me. They are all done, aren't they, and the text?’ Mark nodded his head. ‘Yes, sure. Everything's finished.’ He only realised the finality of the phrase a second or so later. Muldoon didn't know quite what to say. ‘I know you have worked your arse off to produce the plan, Mark, and it's a great one. No doubt about that. But if Detroit has its reasons, it has its reasons. It's as simple as that. I'll hold the fort and fill you in when you get back.’ Mark turned towards the door. It was pointless to argue further. Muldoon was simply carrying out instructions. ‘Fill me in…that's just about it, Pat, nice choice of words.’ He opened the door and turned toward the American. Who are you going to hand the presentation over to, after you have given the introduction?’ he asked quietly. They both said the name together —‘Klepner.’ Mark was sick at heart as he drove home that evening. He had a blinding headache and simply wasn't thinking of what he was doing as he swung the car off the slip road to enter the motorway. His thoughts were fiercely occupied elsewhere. Without even glancing in the mirror, he crossed the inner and middle lanes into the fast lane and, in fewer than ten seconds the speedometer needle was registering one hundred and fifteen miles an hour, but Mark was oblivious of the fact. Suddenly conscious that he was flashing past vehicles which appeared to be dawdling, he glanced at the speedometer. He was doing one hundred and twenty! He jerked his foot off the accelerator and glanced in the mirror, heaving a sigh of relief that nobody was on his tail. Slowing to seventy, he made his way home. He very rarely spoke about business matters to Georgina and decided on reflection against recounting the day's events except to say that he was leaving for Istanbul in the morning, and would be away for three or four days. The Tri-star jet was two hours late on take-off from Heathrow, and then had to abort on the runway at lift-off point due to a sudden failure of one of the engines. The pilot slammed the powerful jets into reverse thrust, bringing the giant plane to a halt just before he ran out of runway. In a very matter-of-fact voice he apologised for the shut down, due to engine failure, adding laconically that he had left ten thousand pounds worth of tyres on the runway. ‘British Airways will not be at all pleased with me.’ he remarked casually. ‘There goes another Brownie point.’ By the time the plane approached Istanbul in the late afternoon, Mark had put away several large measures of single malt Scotch. Mechanically he had taken each drink offered without thinking, for the simple reason that he had spent the entire journey staring out of the cabin window into the infinity of space. His meeting was not until the next morning, so he could switch off for a few hours. He needed to do just that, for he was tired, morose and bitter and, for the first time in his life, feeling very insecure. Gazing out into the blue, he asked himself if this assignment was his swan song. Must be, he concluded. Nate would never have taken him off the presentation if he wasn't being moved sideways or demoted. But why? To make way for Klepner, Mueller's pet poodle? It had happened before, to make way for Muldoon. Why shouldn't it happen again? If you couldn't trust the bastards then, why should you trust them now? He closed his eyes. What made Nate and the executive committee think that guys like Klepner and Mueller knew more about the European components’ business than the Europeans? What the hell would the US component divisions say if the executive committee was stupid enough to appoint Europeans to manage components operations in the United States? No prizes for guessing the answer to that question. The blonde hostess leaned across him to re-charge his glass for the umpteenth time. His favourite Scotch, Glenlivet. Good old George and James Smith. Now there were two characters you could trust! So easy to relax and forget your troubles when you had a glass of their malt in your hand…. He jerked forward with a start to find the hostess fingering with his seat-belt clasp. ‘Just arriving at Istanbul sir. Please fasten your seat belt.’ Fred Clasper, the militant Merseyside convener, was a desperately worried man. Things weren't going at all well within the UK vehicle Division. Even his own notorious plant, which had consistently gone downhill for ten years under his active leadership, had been steadily increasing efficiency and output for several weeks without interruption. Morale on the shop floor was higher than it had been for a long year and an unhealthy atmosphere of optimism and hope pervaded the plant. Union members were openly expressing the view that there was a real chance that the ailing division would now pull out of its dive with the Peters' Plan, which had been fully supported by Bunker and a two-thirds majority at the plant. To Clasper's disgust, the majority had voted against his recommended call for strike action and he now sensed all too painfully that he was beginning to lose control of his members. Management was once again managing, something which he had never allowed to happen during his ten years as convener. Arising from Clem Bunker's endorsement of the plan, new methods had been introduced which were greatly increasing earnings through higher productivity. Restrictive practices, which Clasper had fought so hard to introduce, were being discarded at a rate of knots in the quest to increase efficiency, output and earnings. As a lifelong Communist, Clasper knew that it was absolutely essential to wrest control of the workers away from the plant management. He had exercised effective control of the labour force for ten years at the giant plant and had been able to bring the workers out on strike at the drop of a hat. It was he, Clasper, who dictated to management the size of the labour force they would require to produce a given number of products, regardless of any figure which management might arrive at by employing accurately measured work standards. If in effect, Clasper said that three men must be employed to do two men's work, then that was it. On those occasions when he had felt the need to demonstrate his power to management, he would create an instant departmental dispute which always had the immediate effect of lowering that day's efficiency to below fifty per cent. Since the plant manager was never able to make up a day's loss of output which pulled down his monthly overall efficiency figures on which he was judged, it was never difficult for  Clasper to prove his point. As he had always succeeded in getting his own way, the workers had been inclined to go along with him, even when their instincts told them that he was wrong. They really had no choice in the matter for he had always been able to threaten any dissenters, or strays, with the loss of their union cards. Successive personnel managers had always caved in to his demands as they knew full well that Clasper would win a stand-up fight. Yet an uneasy feeling had been steadily growing among the ten thousand workers employed at the plant that the benefits which Clasper's militancy had achieved were illusory. Increased earnings, grabbed as a result of strike action rather than earned by increased productivity and profitability had always been subsequently eaten away by inflation. The Corporation was also no longer expanding its British operations, in marked contrast to the frequent expansion of its plants in Germany, Belgium and France. Every long service worker employed at the plant and within the division knew that union restrictive practices had lowered productivity to below the levels achieved on the continent. These more loyal long service employees had an intuitive feeling that the division would ultimately go out of business in the UK if it continued to operate in the way it had behaved over the previous ten years. Even the notoriously militant workers at the Merseyside plant were now beginning to recognise that distinct possibility. It was generally recognised that Clasper was not the man to dismantle restrictive practices, nor to co-operate with management to make the necessary improvements in labour relations if they were to keep their jobs in future. The majority now believed that Bunker's more realistic approach made more sense. Clasper was beginning to be seen by his own members for what he really was: a born agitator and troublemaker who was great to have around when plant managements behaved like bastards because he was one too and would give as good as he got in a stand-up fight. But he certainly wasn't the man to have in the driving seat on the union side when both management and workers were striving for the sheer survival of the company, and needed to work together if they were to pull through. It was being said quite openly on the factory floor that the only place Clasper would lead them to was the end of the dole queue. The Communist convener could both feel and see that he was losing control. Fewer workers bothered to listen to him when he called meetings to protest against the Peters' Plan. He was also being subjected to cat-calls and ridicule. At one such meeting a heckler had got a great round of cheers from the assembled throng when he had told Clasper to get off his bloody soap-box and do a day's work for a bloody change. To his disgust he found that the workers would no longer respond to his call for mass meetings during working hours. They now told him, in no uncertain terms, that if he had something important to communicate, he could do it in the plant car park during the lunch break, or after working hours. They were not disposed to lose both output and earnings by downing tools. In desperation Clasper called a private meeting of the hard core left-wing stewards under his convenership, who could always be relied upon to fight against management and the capitalist system. The British people had just elected a Conservative Government, headed by Britain's first ever woman Prime Minister, who had already earned the reputation of being ‘the best man for the job’ in the Conservative Party. Within days of taking office, she had invited Don Peters to explain the problems which had bedevilled the British vehicle plants during the sixties and seventies and to outline his company's plan for the future. Living up to her reputation, Peters found that she had done her homework thoroughly. She was tough and uncompromising. She noted, she said with a pained expression, that output from the UK Vehicle Division of United Motors had been falling steadily over the previous ten years. At the same time, UM imports had been steadily rising, including very substantial imports from UM Vehicle Divisions on the Continent which had greatly expanded their total output and exports over the  same period. ‘United Motors used to make a very healthy contribution to Britain's export drive. Now you are the biggest single contributor to our balance of payments deficit,’ she said acidly. ‘Trends of this nature don't simply happen, do they?’ she asked with feigned innocence. ‘It has to be planned that way, does it not?’ She wanted to know what the UK Vehicle Division was doing to correct its appalling track record of recent years, particularly when compared with its Continental plants. She then ticked off several points she wished to make. Don Peters had been pleasantly surprised to find the Prime Minister's forthright manner lived up to her advance publicity. The United Kingdom had a serious balance of payments problem in manufactured goods, which was only partly disguised by the revenue beginning to flood in from North Sea oil, which had a limited life. The problem had been seriously aggravated by the poor performances of UK vehicle producers — his own company foremost among them — and the Prime Minister naturally wanted to know what he was doing to correct the adverse trend. It was a straightforward and most pertinent question. He would have posed the same question if he had been sitting in her position. For nearly half an hour, the American explained the plan which the Corporation had recently approved. He then answered the many penetrating questions put to him. In answer to one such question, he replied that he was pleased to say that he was now being given full support by the unions which drew the sharp retort…. ‘NOT BEFORE TIME!’ Before she dismissed him she said unequivocally that it was the Government's intention to rebuild Britain's weakened manufacturing base and reduce the ever-growing importation of manufactured products. ‘If industry doesn't help me to achieve the objectives of the Government, we will have to take appropriate alternative steps,’ she had said with a steely smile. ‘But I hope that won't be necessary. Thank you so much, Mr Peters for the chat. Most helpful. I will invite you to dinner when you correct your trade imbalance.’ Mark booked into The Istanbul Hilton in the mid-evening and, after a shower, returned to the lobby where he purchased a thriller before retiring to the comfort of an easy chair in the lounge. He continued to drink quietly for another hour before going in to dinner. Afterwards he adjourned to the cocktail bar for a nightcap. He was now feeling pleasantly intoxicated from the effects of a steady supply of alcohol, which had lifted his flagging spirits. He was now more at peace with the world of United Motors. Sipping a large Armagnac and enjoying the heady aroma of a Havana cigar, he had come to terms with the fact that life could, and would go on. Whatever lay ahead, maybe it was for the best. All is for the best in this best of all possible worlds, he mused, blowing a great cloud of smoke into the air above him. That's what Voltaire's Pangloss had said, wasn't it? And just look at the problems which had faced poor Candide. Maybe it was time for a change, anyway. Thirty years was a long time to stay with one company. Should have got out after the Steiner incident. Fool not to have done so. Early fifties is leaving it a bit late. Over fifty policy comes into effect. Fate perhaps. Do I believe in Fate? Really don't know. ‘There is a tide in the affairs of man, which taken at the flood, leads on to…’ heaven knows what and where. A voluptuous blonde hooker in a long white gown entered the spacious bar. The front was slashed all the way down to her navel to reveal rounded breasts, which rose and fell temptingly like a couple of ripe peaches. Just inside the entrance, she turned to survey the clientèle , making sure as she did so that all the men got a tantalising glimpse of a very long and elegant leg exposed through a side slit. The bar was fairly full, with groups of local worthies and their wives and a clutch of broody businessmen. From the attention which focused on her, it was obvious that the blonde would make a sale in no time at all. Eyes turned as she walked slowly across the room, brushing by this man and that. To his  surprise, she stopped when she reached Mark's chair and took the vacant seat beside him, nodding casually in his direction and flashing a devastating smile as she carefully arranged herself on display. She crossed her slender legs very slowly so that the panel of her dress fell away to reveal long, shapely limbs plus a glimpse of white satin briefs. Mark smiled the appreciative smile of a man who was just looking, not buying. Must be too expensive for the locals, he mused. Perhaps the fiddle sheet didn't run to outside entertainment more than once a month. Soaring inflation, perhaps. Up sixty per cent this year in Turkey, he'd read in The Financial Times . No…wait a minute. Devaluation of the Turkish lira. Down forty per cent. That's it! She's after the export business. She gives a much better exchange rate and gets forty per cent more lira for every pound, deutschmark or dollar she takes. Not bad, eh, when you're giving your all for your country? She smiled again, which Mark again returned, even though he was not in the running. Just an interested bystander, studying the form in the paddock and placing bets on who would be the jockey who would saddle her up. Chap at the far end of the bar in a grey pin-stripe clearly fancied his chances. Been ogling her up and down ever since she'd entered the room. Down boy, down! She's too expensive for you, even after allowing for devaluation. Where on earth were the Germans? They could afford her. God only knows how many lira there were to the deutschmark these days. Must be bloody millions. He watched her fumble for an intentionally long time in her handbag for the means of lighting the Turkish cigarette she held aloft in her left hand, only a foot or so away from Mark's head. He was an ungallant swine for deliberately not coming to her aid, but in truth he really wanted to see which of the likely lads, would dash forward. Surprisingly, there were no punters. At long last she looked up imploringly from the depths of her tiny handbag, which prompted Mark to produce his lighter. Thank you,’ she said, blowing a thin wisp of smoke in the air. ‘I thought you'd never respond. Are you waiting for someone?, Her voice was cultured and unmistakably English. ‘No, not really,’ he replied. ‘Just enjoying the parade in the paddock,’ he added casually. ‘So you ARE English,’ she said. ‘I thought so. Always give yourselves away, you chaps.’ ‘Is that so?’ he asked. ‘Do tell me, and what gives a destitute Englishman away in a foreign land? Decadence?’ ‘Style,’ she replied, throwing her long fair hair over her shoulders and flashing him the toothpaste smile again. ‘Style?’ ‘Style.’ He raised his eyebrows in surprise and softly sang the words of the song. ‘So you've got, or you haven't got…style.’ She finished the next line, ‘If you've got it, it stands out…a mile.’ They laughed together. ‘Sanders. Mark Sanders,’ he said, introducing himself. ‘Will you have a drink?’ ‘Love one. White lady,’ she replied. ‘Destitute Englishman,’ she scoffed dismissively. ‘My eye. With those shoes? British and Harrods to the last. Name's Virginia, believe it or not. But my friends call me Ginny. More appropriate.’ ‘So that's what gave me away. My shoes. Well, bless my soul,’ he said, with an air of exaggerated surprise. ‘They haven't got holes in have they?’ he asked in mock horror, glancing at the sole. ‘I wondered why you sat next to me, when you obviously had the field to play. Why pick on me?’ ‘I've told you. Style.’ she replied, with her winning smile. ‘And yes, I do like the company of my compatriots. Miss home quite a lot. Daddy fell from grace, poor dear. Lost everything, so I came out here. Well, a girl's got to live, hasn't she?’ She added brightly, ‘Much easier to be a fallen woman when you're miles from home. Must keep up the family tradition you know. Daddy always did say to do what you do best, and I am very good at it…so they say.’ ‘Are you now…?’ he replied. ‘Excellent references.’ She took the cocktail which the waiter had just brought. ‘Cheers,’ she said, raising her glass to him. ‘Happy nights to happy days.’ ‘Bottoms up,’ Mark said, raising his glass in return. ‘Of course. Bottoms up. Now that's an English expression I haven't heard in a long time. Must use it in the future. Very English and most apt.’ Mark glanced round the room. ‘Look, sweetheart, mustn't keep you away from the punters. By the looks of 'em, they are all champing at the bit to place their bets. And you are the hot favourite, bonny lass. No doubt about that. The others haven't a look in. Not in your class.’ ‘Aren't you a gambling man?’ she asked provocatively. ‘No, not me. Not any more. With my luck, Ginny, I'd lose if I backed the only filly in a one horse race,’ Mark told her, suddenly conscious of the fact that his speech was beginning to slur. ‘You couldn't lose with me,’ she said. ‘I'd give you a very good run for your money.’ ‘I bet you would. But it's not your performance I'm worried about, sweetheart. It's mine.’ ‘Never lost a rider yet’ ‘Always a first time,’ he said. ‘Bit out of practice,’ They laughed together at the sexy banter. ‘I like you,’ she said. ‘I like men who make me laugh. Especially in bed. I give encores, you know, when I'm happy.’ ‘At no extra charge?’ ‘No extra charge.’ ‘Bully for you,’ said Mark approvingly. ‘Always satisfy the customer if you are looking for repeat business. Reminds me of a piece of graffiti outside Saint Martin-in the-Fields. The poster said: ‘All ye who have sinned, enter here’ and a bright girl had written underneath: ‘All ye who have not sinned, ring Maida Vale 123456’.’ ‘Must remember that,’ she laughed. ‘Free advertising.’ ‘Smart girl. You'll go far.’ ‘How far do you want me to go?’ ‘I'm not sure I'm physically in good enough shape to take the excitement of the ride,’ he said, raising his glass to her. ‘Maybe you ought to find yourself a younger jockey.’ ‘Nonsense. You look in good shape to me, and anyway, I prefer more mature riders. They pace the race so much better.’ ‘Ah, the filly who prefers the leisurely canter to the short-lived gallop,’ he said appreciatively . ‘How eminently considerate. So what odds do you lay me finishing the course on the bookie's favourite?’ ‘Fifty,’ she said promptly. ‘Fifty to win is a lot of money to lay out on an untried filly.’ ‘Not this one, I promise you.’ ‘Dollars, or pounds?’ he asked. ‘Pounds of course. What do you take me for?’ she asked in mock surprise. ‘My dear Ginny, that's not in question. We've already established what you are. We are simply negotiating the price…! As I think George Bernard Shaw once said.’ ‘You beast. Hardly the way to win friends and influence people,’ she replied, pouting prettily. ‘You can soon go off someone, you know.’ ‘Sorry. My mistake. Mosht ungallant.’ He blinked and shook his head to bring the room back into focus. His speech really was slurred now. ‘So let's have a stirrup cup before that happens.’ He signalled the waiter. ‘Great idea.’ she said. ‘Bottoms up!’ A few minutes later, feeling decidedly the worse for wear after the last Armagnac had been downed, Mark moved unsteadily into the lift with his voluptuous mate. As they entered his room, she reversed against the door, closing it with her bottom. Draping her arms over his shoulders, she cradled his head in the palms of her hands, pulling him toward her to close a hungry, wet open mouth on his. Restlessly exploring with an eager tongue, she eased his  jacket from his shoulders. It fell noiselessly to the thick carpeted floor. He tugged at the zip on the back of her dress while she unbuttoned his shirt and removed his tie. She let the dress fall, pushing him away gently to slip out of tiny white satin briefs. She was naked as she drew him towards her. Her hands slid under his shirt, unbuckling, unzipping, thrusting on downwards. She kissed him again on the lips before mouth followed the path her hands were taking. ‘Do you like me?’ she whispered. ‘Ask a silly question,’ he gasped. ‘Fantastic!’ And then, suddenly, without warning, a bomb-burst of excruciating pain exploded inside his skull and sent him reeling. Head clasped in hands, he sprawled on the bed, gasping for air, as the room swayed crazily from side to side. It was sheer hell. Frightened by what had happened, the girl bent nervously over him. ‘Are you all right?’ she asked tremulously, taking care not to touch him. He struggled breathlessly to find the words. ‘Yes…be all right…terrible pain…give me a few minutes…be OK.’ She looked at the crumpled figure who was fighting for breath on the pillow, perspiration pouring down his anguished face. ‘Shall I get you a drink?’ she asked. He nodded. ‘Scotch…on table.’ ‘Cigarette?’ she asked. ‘No.’ She poured two glasses and gave him one. In the semi-darkness Mark could see her movements. She had a most beautiful body which looked opalescent in the half light. He took a gulp at the Scotch and gave a wry smile at the injustices of this world which caused him to be smitten with another one of those blinding attacks just when he was about to make it. Well, they always said it was the only way to go and he believed it. He was perspiring heavily as he sipped his drink, gazing  wistfully at the voluptuous creature who stood naked before him in the half light with a look of scared concern on her young face. ‘Shall I get a doctor?’ she asked, at length. ‘No. I'll be OK.’ ‘Are you sure?’ ‘Sure. Feeling a lot better already. Thanks.’ He moved himself into a reclining position, head against the padded headrest. The room started to sway again and the pains in his head intensified. ‘Told you I was too old a jockey,’ he joked. ‘Fell at the first fence.’ He was about to say ‘game to the last’ but thought again. She smiled at his efforts to be funny. ‘I was looking forward to the ride. Frustrated filly. Entered then scratched. What a palaver.’ ‘Have to be a stewards’ enquiry,’he said painfully. ‘Lot of money went on the favourite.’ ‘Under starter's orders, so I'm afraid no stake money refunded.’ ‘Of course,’ he said. ‘Jockey to blame.’ She walked to the bathroom and returned with a towel to mop his sweating face. ‘That feels good. Thanks,’ he said. She sat on the bed, mopping his brow. He closed his eyes. Not a bad looking devil, she thought. More than just a few grey hairs here and there. Plenty of lines on his face, which she hadn't really noticed before, but which were particularly noticeable now. No matter. They gave him character and sex appeal. About fifty, she thought. Why was it that she always found herself attracted to older men? More interesting, she supposed. She liked a man with a sense of humour. Had a good figure. quite looked forward to his love-making. Pity. She continued to pat his face with the towel. Wonder who he is? she thought. International business man, that's for sure. Written all over him. Married. No doubt. They all were. Wife who loves him, but who has gone off sex. How often had they said that. No ring on his hand, but that was nothing to go by. Very few married men wore rings these days. Can't blame them. Better chance to play the field. He was breathing less heavily now. Perhaps he was asleep. She dabbed his forehead. ‘Are you asleep?’ she whispered. ‘No,’ he whispered back. He wanted to say: ‘With a girl like you in the room?’ but was too exhausted to make the effort. She kissed him lightly on the lips and rose from the bed to get dressed. Taking his jacket from the floor she opened his wallet and took out two twenties and a ten before returning the wallet to the inside pocket. Putting the money in her bag she checked her face in the mirror and walked back to the bed. Are you asleep now?’ she whispered. ‘Yes,’ he whispered back, with the faintest of faint smiles. ‘I've taken the stake money,’ she said. He nodded imperceptibly. ‘Sorry you…but it wasn't my fault, was it?’ she said. He gave a slow shake of his head. She pulled the bed cover over him. ‘'Bye darling. Feel better soon. Look me up again when you are next in town, won't you? We must complete the course.’ Mark woke to the strangely sad and beautiful cry of the Muezzin, whose plaintive voice drifted across the ancient city to greet another dawn. The pains in his head had subsided, but he felt dizzy and sick, which he concluded was not surprising, considering the amount of alcohol he had drunk the day before. He attempted to go to the bathroom, but found that his left leg wouldn't respond. It felt heavy and lifeless, in much the same way as it had felt that day in Spain when he had gone off the road. He rolled on to his side and rubbed the leg vigorously with his right hand. After a few minutes he heaved himself out of bed, but his leg let him down and he fell backwards. From a sitting position he rubbed and thumped the leg until it responded sufficiently for him to drag himself to the bathroom. It was five o'clock. Hauling himself back to bed he lay awake for some time, before falling asleep. When he awoke again it was seven. To his great relief he found that the pains in his head had almost gone and that he could now move his left leg, albeit with some difficulty. After a while he was able to stand. He then walked slowly and gingerly towards the bathroom, keeping as much weight as possible on his right leg. A hot bath, followed by a cold shower worked wonders for his circulation, and he was now able to move more freely, though still with a pronounced limp. He shaved, got dressed and took the elevator to the breakfast-room. He felt in reasonable shape, as he entered the local MDs office."
FIC FIC-BMW-002 8.88 "CHAPTER TWO As the taxi swept along the Kensington street, its headlights tunnelling into the murky darkness, Harriet leaned forward and spoke through the half-open glass partition. ‘Just here, please.’ The taxi squealed to a stop. Harriet, who had been watching the meter, pulled a note out of her bag and passed it to the driver. ‘Thanks. Keep the change.’ She swung herself out onto the snow-wet pavement, hauling her bags after her. Home! Thank God! She almost ran up the path. Hers was the ground floor flat of a tall old house which had seen better days and the communal front door was reached by means of three stone steps. Harriet had climbed them and had her key in the lock when she heard footsteps on the path behind her and a male voice called: ‘Excuse me!’ She swung round, surprised and a little wary. ‘Yes?’ ‘Miss Varna?’ There was a hint of authority but no menace in the gravelly voice and his overcoat, collar turned up against the cold, looked perfectly respectable, but for some reason Harriet's sense of unease only increased. ‘Who wants her?’ she asked shortly. ‘I'm Tom O'Neill, acting for British and Cosmopolitan Assurance. I called on you earlier but there was no reply and I could see the place was in darkness. I was just leaving when your taxi arrived.’ ‘Thank you but I'm not in need of any assurance.’ Harriet pushed the door ajar and removed the keys from the lock. ‘If you'll excuse me…’ ‘I'm not selling insurance. I want to talk to you about quite a different matter. It concerns Paula Varna. Your mother, I believe.’ Harriet stiffened, totally taken by surprise and annoyed with herself for not realising the moment he mentioned insurance the reason why he was here. But it simply hadn't occurred to her. Of course when one thought about it rationally it was obvious there was bound to be an investigation of some kind, but throughout the long flight she had been too concerned with the purely personal implications of the news  item to give a thought to those who might have a financial interest in the story. ‘Paula Varna was my mother, yes,’ she said, oddly defensive. ‘But I'd really rather not talk to you or anyone tonight. I have only just flown in from Paris and I am very tired.’ ‘It won't take long,’ he persisted without so much as a hint of apology. ‘Just a few questions and I'll leave you in peace.’ ‘Mr O'Neill…’ ‘It might be easier if we talked inside.’ Again, that suggestion of authority. Harriet bristled. ‘I'm not in the habit of letting strangers into my flat — especially at this hour. How do I know you are who you say you are?’ ‘My card.’ He passed it to her and she examined it briefly. Somehow she had no real doubts as to whether Mr Tom O'Neill was genuine. She almost wished he was not. ‘You'd better come in then.’ She led the way into the communal hall which she personally had taken upon herself to brighten up with a vase of dried flowers and a couple of good, but ancient, rugs which she had picked up for a song at an auction sale. In the full light she was surprised to see he was much younger than his bulky, overcoat-clad figure had led her to believe — and a great deal better looking. Not handsome exactly. That was not a word one would apply to Tom O'Neill. But certainly hunky, with strong, irregular features, a full, jutting lower lip and very blue eyes. She turned her back on him, unlocking the inner door, and as the warmth from the storage heaters wafted out to greet them she thanked God that she had had the foresight to leave them on — she didn't think she had been properly warm since reading the newspaper this afternoon — no, not even on the plane. She was longing for a drink — some of her emergency ration of scotch — but she did not see how she could have one herself without also offering one to her visitor, something she had no intention of doing. She switched on the lights, dumped her bag on the table and turned to him abruptly. ‘Well, what can I do for you?’ ‘As I said, I'd like to talk to you about your mother.’ He was regarding her closely, his very-blue eyes disconcertingly direct. ‘As a representative of the company who insured both her life and that of Mr Martin, not to mention the boat, I am anxious to discover the truth of what happened.’ ‘I'm afraid there is nothing I can tell you. I was four years old when my mother died.’ Something unspoken hung in the air between them. She felt it with her pores, saw it in the slight lift of his eyebrow and the way one corner of his mouth tucked. Then he asked suddenly.: ‘When did you last see your mother, Miss Varna?’ ‘I told you — when I was four years old. It was the night before she left for her trip. She came to my room to say goodnight to me…’ She broke off as another memory stirred…that same evening, but later, raised voices coming from her mother's room, her child's feet pattering along the landing, peeping through a crack in the door… Her eyes darkened as she relived it and his sharp investigator's eye noticed it. ‘And?’ he prompted her. ‘After that?’ ‘I tell you I didn't see her again after that night.’ ‘But something happened.’ ‘Nothing happened. For God's sake…’ ‘What did she say to you, then, when she looked in to say goodnight? Did she seem her usual self?’ ‘I don't know. I don't remember. Mom was always… Mom. And I can't see that what she said to me is any of your business.’ ‘I'm afraid a quarter of a million pounds sterling paid out on your mother's life makes it my business.’ He crossed to a small occasional table, picking up a silver-framed studio portrait. ‘When was this taken?’ Suddenly Harriet had had enough. ‘Put that down!’ she snapped. ‘It is your mother, isn't it?’ ‘Yes it is. It was taken before I was born, as a matter of fact, when she was still modelling — she was a top model, you know. But you have no right to come in here meddling with my things. Even a policeman wouldn't dare poke about without a search warrant — and you're not a policeman. You are a private investigator. I don't have to talk to you.’ He looked up from the photograph, totally unruffled. ‘I usually find that the people who lose their tempers when I start asking questions are the ones with something to hide,’ he said easily. ‘What the hell do you mean by that?’ ‘I'm sure you can work it out for yourself, Miss Varna.’ ‘No, I can't. Spell it out for me, please. You're accusing me of complicity in fraud, is that it?’ ‘A four-year-old child? Heaven forbid! However, it would seem that Greg Martin, your mother's companion when the yacht was lost, has been fooling us these past twenty years. He has turned up in Australia, hasn't he?’ ‘I'm sure you know a great deal more about it than I do. I only know what I read in the papers.’ His eyebrow lifted again, an expression of polite disbelief. ‘Really? Then this must all be very distressing to you.’ She ignored the somewhat patronising platitude. ‘As far as I can make out no one has yet said conclusively that this man is Greg Martin', she argued. ‘True. That is something that has to be established. However, assuming it is, then we must look very carefully at what happened to your mother. After all, she too might have survived the explosion.’ His words jarred Harriet and she swallowed at the ball of nerves that suddenly seemed to be constricting her throat. In a way he was only echoing her own thoughts but to hear them spoken aloud and by this unsympathetic stranger was oddly disturbing. ‘And if she isn't dead then where the hell is she?’ she demanded. ‘That is what I am being paid to find out. I had hoped you would be able to help me but since you say you can't I shall have to pursue other avenues. It may take me a little longer but…’ he smiled, and his confidence made her dislike him more than ever, ‘I promise you I shall get there in the end.’ ‘Then in that case I suggest you make a start right away,’ Harriet said. She crossed to the door and threw it open. ‘Goodnight, Mr O'Neill.’ ‘Goodnight Miss Varna. Thank you for your time.’ She did not reply, simply stood holding the door until he had gone. Then she leaned against it, realising that in spite of the fact that she was still wearing her ski jacket in the warm flat, she was shivering again. She levered herself away from the door, crossed to the heavy old sideboard and took out the bottle of whisky and a glass. Taken neat the spirit burned her throat and she held the glass cupped between her hands, staring into space. Was it possible Paula was still alive — and did she even want her to be? Of course the immediate answer was ‘Yes! Oh yes!’ but in truth it was not that simple. What sort of woman would willingly  choose to leave her husband and child without a qualm, allow them to grieve for her and believe her dead? Certainly not the dream mother a bereaved child had created for herself. With a sense of shock Harriet realised that in the last hours Paula had become more of a stranger to her than she had ever been during the twenty years she had believed her dead. A beautiful face in a photograph, a few misty memories, a haunting perfume tugging at her senses, and Paula had been whatever Harriet wanted her to be. Now for the first time she was face to face with fragmented suggestions of reality, distorted perhaps, like the sun glancing on water, but hinting at something very different from the fairy tale princess the child Harriet had claimed as her own. Could you have done such a thing, Mom? Harriet asked silently and was as far as ever from an answer. The image was all she had. She knew nothing of the real woman behind it. The long hours of the night stretched ahead of her and the prospect opened a well of loneliness within her. Despising herself for her weakness she reached for the telephone, dialling Nick's number. For a long while the bell rang and Harriet felt the sense of loneliness deepen. He wasn't there. Then just as she was about to replace the receiver she heard his voice, that soft familiar Scottish burr. ‘Nick’, she said, choky suddenly. ‘Harriet — is that you? You're back then.’ ‘Yes. Just. I was beginning to think you weren't there.’ ‘I'm listening to some music. I had it turned up a bit too loud. I didn't hear the phone at first.’ In the background she could hear The Anvil Chorus from Il Trovatore. ‘Nick — do you think…?’ she began hesitantly. ‘You want me to come over?’ he asked, reading her mind. ‘Would you? I know it's late but…’ ‘I'll be with you in…twenty minutes.’ ‘Oh Nick — thanks!’ ‘My pleasure,’ he said drily. ‘You ask me, Harriet, all too seldom.’ ‘And for goodness sake,’ she said, looking at the almost-empty Scotch bottle, ‘bring something good and strong to drink with you.’ In the time it took Nick to arrive Harriet forced herself to wash and change into a clean sweatshirt, though the most mundane of everyday actions seemed a huge effort. By the time she heard his car squeezing  into a parking space outside she was calmer; at least outwardly, opening the door to him with what she hoped gave the appearance of nonchalance. ‘Hi! Sorry to drag you out on a night like this.’ ‘Don't even think of it.’ He kissed her briefly on the lips and came into the flat, a slightly-built sandy-haired man in his mid-thirties wearing a heavy black overcoat over a sweater and cords. From one of the voluminous pockets he produced a bottle of Scotch and put it down on the table. ‘Drinks — as ordered. I take it you are in need.’ ‘Too true! What a day! Oh, bless you Nick.’ She fetched her glass. ‘Pour me one, will you, when you've taken your coat off. And what about you? Are you drinking too?’ ‘I'll keep you company. But better make it a small one — If I'm driving.’ There was just the hint of a question in his tone. She ignored it, habit making her play it coolly even now, in her moment of need. ‘I got the pictures, Nick. Some beauties, I think.’ She was annoyed to hear the slight tremble in her voice. ‘Great.’ He had tossed his coat over the back of a chair and was pouring whiskies. He handed one to her, looking at her directly. ‘You didn't ask me over here to discuss the pictures though, Harriet — admit it. It's…the other business, isn't it? I take it you did as I suggested and got hold of a paper.’ ‘Yes.’ She gulped at the whisky, then thought better of it. ‘I'll get some ice.’ When she returned from the kitchen he had made himself comfortable on the sofa. She went over and perched herself on the ottoman at his feet. ‘I've had the insurance investigators here,’ she said. He raised an eyebrow. ‘Already? They don't waste time.’ ‘No. I suppose, as the man said, with at least a quarter of a million at stake they can't afford to, but all the same, it wasn't very pleasant. Especially since I'd only just arrived back from Paris.’ She proceeded to relate the interview, keeping nothing back apart from the effect it had had on her, but Nick knew her too well to be fooled. ‘It must have been pretty gruesome,’ he said. ‘Yes — well — it's such a damned cheek! First suggesting I was involved in some insurance fraud and then as good as saying Mom walked out on us! I realise from his point of view his company would be a quarter of a million better off if they could prove it should never  have been paid in the first place, but…it is my mother he was talking about dammit!’ ‘Oh Harri, darling Harri…’ He reached for her, pulling her up onto the sofa beside him and putting his arm around her. ‘And what do youthink?’ ‘What do I think? Well, she's dead of course. She'd never do that to us…’ She broke off. ‘No, to be truthful, that's what I told him, but deep down I don't know. I honestly don't know.’ She gulped her drink. ‘Does it matter?’ he asked. She shook herself free of his arm. ‘Well of course it bloody well matters!’ ‘That's not the point.’ ‘Do you really want to know the truth? It might be a pretty upsetting business.’ ‘I'm upset already,’ she admitted. ‘In any case — I'm going to have to face it sooner or later. That O'Neill man isn't going to let up now he's got his teeth into it. He's going to dig and dig. God what a job! Imagine doing a shitty job like that!’ ‘Not unlike a journalist really,’ Nick observed drily. ‘Well, Harri, you can either sit back and let him do the digging or you can do a little investigation yourself.’ ‘I don't know. I don't know whether I want to.’ ‘I was rather hoping you'd do a nice follow-up photo session for me’, he said slyly. ‘On what?’ ‘That's up to you. But you didn't cover Kuwait in this lot, did you? Or the sweatshops of Korea, or the rip-off merchants in Hong Kong? A trip East may be just what you need. ‘Yes.’ But she sounded less than convinced. They sat in silence for a while, then he looked meaningfully at the whisky bottle. ‘Shall I have another drink? Or am I going to be driving?’ She laughed shortly but it came out as a half-sob. ‘Oh Nick, what would I do without you?’ ‘That is the first time I've heard you admit it,’ he said ruefully. ‘You generally seem to manage by yourself very well.’ She did not answer. ‘Well?’ he pressed her. ‘Do I have that other drink or not?’ She reached for the bottle and half filled his tumbler. ‘Have the bloody drink, Nick. And please… I would like you to stay.’ At first she slept, heavy, exhausted, whisky-induced sleep. Then suddenly she was wide awake, nerves jangling again, thoughts chaotic. She eased herself out of Nick's embrace and he did not stir. How she hated sleeping in his arms! Making love was all very well, pleasant and soporific if not exactly ecstatic, but afterwards…she needed her space. I'm a bitch, she thought sometimes. I use Nick shamelessly and I don't like myself for it. But he's got no one to blame but himself. He allows me to do it. If I were a man I'd tell me to get lost — and fast! Tonight, however, she had no room for such introspection. There were other things on her mind. She eased herself out from under the duvet, reaching for her heavy wool man's dressing gown and tying it firmly around her, crossed to the window. It had stopped snowing now and the sky was clear and black with a few stars. Beneath her window she could see the white humps of the pot in her backyard — pots that in summer she filled with geraniums and petunias in an effort to bring some colour to the uniform greyness, beyond them the wall that bordered the yard was also white-crusted. A familiar scene, yet one that had changed subtly since yesterday — just as everything else had been changed by that newspaper item, the whole of her life being undermined making her feel that nothing was quite as it had seemed. In one way, of course, Nick had been quite right when he had said that whatever the truth it made no difference. There was no going back now, no way to rewrite the years as she had known them. And they had been good years. With a child's resilience she had quickly adjusted to the loss of her mother, who had never been more than a glamorous appendage on the periphery of her world, and Sally had stepped in to fill the breach more than adequately. Now, looking back with the wisdom of adulthood, she could appreciate what she had taken for granted at the time. The moment the news had broken Sally had been there, comforting her, buffering her, cuddling her when she cried. There was a warmth about Sally that superseded all her amusing little vanities and softened the acid remarks she was prone to making — which were in reality a defence  mechanism. Sally had a great capacity for love and a down-to-earth quality that Harriet presumed was a throw-back to her early upbringing and which had been honed and tested in the fire when she had given birth to — and kept — an illegitimate son in the days when illegitimacy was still a scandal. To Harriet Sally had become a surrogate mother and after she had married Hugo that position had been strengthened so that Harriet had felt secure and loved, never questioning her importance to the people who were important to her. Although the glamorous world of fashion and wealth spread wide around her, Harriet's own family circle was tight — her father, Sally, and Sally's illegitimate son, Mark Bristow. Mark had been educated in England and later decided to live there, and it had been because of him that Harriet had first decided to come to London, though nowadays she saw little of him. He was in advertising; he and his partner, Toby Rogers, had their own agency, and paradoxically Mark had spent most of the last year back in the States. He was there now, setting up some important job or other. Had he not been she might have telephoned him instead of Nick, when she had been desperate for company. But then again, she might not. In a way Mark was too close to home, too much a part of the world whose foundations had just been rocked, yet somehow on the outside. No matter what the truth might turn out to be it would not affect Mark. The foundations upon which his life were built were intact. Winds of change might blow around him but his basics were not under threat. Beneath the duvet Nick stirred, flinging his arms across the empty space where Harriet should have been. She stood stock still, hoping he would drift off to sleep once more without realising she was not there. But after a moment he turned over again, mumbling thickly: ‘Harri? Where are you?’ ‘I'm here,’ she hissed. ‘Go back to sleep.’ ‘What are you doing out of bed? You'll catch your death.’ ‘No I won't.’ His concern irritated her. Wasn't that what she had wanted, though? Someone to be here, to care about her? So why now did the very fact that he was awake and talking to her seem like an invasion of her privacy? ‘Come back to bed, love.’ ‘I'm all right.’ ‘No, you're bloody not!’ He got out of bed, exclaiming as the cold  air enveloped his warm sleepy frame. ‘Christ, this place is like an icebox! Hasn't your heater come on?’ ‘I don't have one in the bedroom, Nick. It's healthier not to.’ ‘Healthier! To catch bloody pneumonia!’ He caught her, steering her back to the bed, bundling her in, dressing gown and all. She allowed him to do it though her irritation mounted. She couldn't ask him to stay then yell at him for caring for her. She lay stiffly as he huddled close, sharing the warmth. ‘I was thinking,’ she said into his shoulder. ‘Not now,’ he protested. ‘There will be plenty of time for that tomorrow.’ ‘No, there won't,’ she said. ‘I've made up my mind, Nick. I have to try and learn the truth. If Mom is still alive I have to find her. If she's not, well…’ He did not answer. ‘I'm going home,’ she said. ‘On the first available flight. I'm sorry.’ ‘Don't be sorry. I suppose you'll do what you have to do.’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Only one thing — be sure you take your camera with you.’ She laughed softly. ‘Oh Nick, always first and foremost the editor!’ ‘Always that.’ There was regret in his sleepy voice. She was growing warmer now and drowsier. With the decision made she felt a kind of temporary peace. ‘All right, Nick,’ she murmured. ‘I'll take my camera with me.’ ‘Promise?’ ‘I promise.’ She had no way of knowing that he was thinking not so much of the next photo story she would submit to him as the necessary therapy it might provide. A journey into the past, with skeletons rattling in cupboards at every dark turning, was almost bound to be upsetting. Nick, with his unfailing journalist's instinct, felt in his bones that this one would be more traumatic than most."
FIC FIC-BMW-008 9.29 "CHAPTER EIGHT Edward had a car — an ancient but still magnificent-looking Ford Zephyr. When Sally got off the bus he was waiting for her, leaning against the bonnet, smoking a cigarette and looking more than ever the dashing young man-about-town. ‘Well, what do you think?’ he asked her. ‘It's beautiful!’ she gasped, much impressed. ‘I thought we'd go for a drive and put her through her paces,’ he suggested. Sally agreed readily. To go for a drive in a boyfriend's car seemed the height of sophistication. She only wished there was someone who knew her to see her climbing in. The car had a bench seat in the front and smelled of warm leather and old cigarette smoke. Edward took her on a tour of Bath — perhaps he was also hoping to be seen by someone who knew him!— and then headed out into the country. It was a fine warm autumn evening and although the light was already dying out of the sky the trees still looked magnificent, shades of gold and red blending with some still-green foliage. As they bowled along the country roads Sally sat erect on the bench-seat feeling like a queen. After about an hour's driving Edward pulled onto the forecourt of a country pub. ‘This is supposed to be a nice place,’ he said. ‘All the best pubs are out of town.’ The pub was picturesque and cosy with beams laden with gleaming horse-brasses, farm implements on the walls and a huge inglenook fireplace. They found a wooden bench seat in a corner and squeezed into it with their drinks — Edward had a pint of bitter and Sally a Babycham in a pretty glass decorated with a dancing fawn in a blue neck-bow. Edward put his arm around Sally and little prickles of excitement started deep inside her. She sat quite still enjoying them. Why didn't they last when Edward tried to go further, she wondered? When she thought about the things he did they became even sharper, so that it felt as if an electric shock was passing right through the centre of her  body. But the reality was different. All the lovely prickles and twists stopped and she was left with nothing but a feeling of panic, able to think of nothing but how could she stop him without making him angry. And afterwards there was just a feeling of let-down, of wanting him to hold her and kiss her and pet her like a little girl. No —pet was the wrong word. Petting meant doing that so no, she certainly did not want to be petted and much less to pet Edward. Perhaps there was something wrong with her, Sally thought glumly. ‘This is the life?’ Edward said, squeezing her gently. ‘What a day!’ ‘We had some excitement at home yesterday,’ Sally offered. ‘My sister is going to model in a charity show. I told you she was taking classes, didn't I?’ ‘Yes, you said.’ Naturally Sally talked about Paula. For one thing she was very proud of her, for another when she talked about her lovely sister and her exciting life she felt as if some of the glamour rubbed off onto her. But Edward had never met Paula. ‘Sounds as if she's doing well,’ Edward said. ‘I know. She's only done half the course and already she has been picked out for this job. I think she's going to go a long way — which she deserves to.’ Sally speared the cherry which was floating in her Babycham and popped it into her mouth. ‘Where is the show?’ Edward asked. ‘Bristol. Why?’ ‘Don't you think we ought to go along and support her?’ Sally was so surprised she almost choked on her cherry. She did not think men were interested in fashion. ‘Now that I've got the car we can do things like that,’ Edward went on. ‘We could take your sister home afterwards — if she wants a lift, that is.’ ‘So we could,’ Sally said, pleased. The thought that she was the one with a boyfriend with a car made her feel very important — one up on Paula for a change! They finished their drinks and left. It was completely dark by now, a black velvety night sprinkled with stars. Sally sat close to Edward on the bench seat and he drove with one arm around her, somehow managing to change gear with his right hand. When they were almost home Edward pulled into a farm gateway and turned off the engine. He pulled Sally close, kissing her, and she wound her arms round his neck, enjoying the first little prickles of yearning. All too soon however his hands began their usual wandering, slipping inside her blouse to unclip her bra hooks, pushing her skirt well up her thighs and trying to slip her panties off. Sally sat down hard on them, forcing her legs together, but as usual in the end he won and she retrieved the panties from the floor, pushing them behind her on the seat before they were trampled underfoot. ‘Let's get in the back. It would be much more comfortable,’ Edward suggested. ‘No!’ Sally said, realising the dangers of the back seat. ‘We ought to be getting home. Mum will be expecting me to be on the bus, remember.’ Edward ignored her protest, somehow contorting himself so that he could kiss her breasts, bare now, since her bra was around her waist, and still keep his hand between her legs beneath the rucked-up skirt. Something about the feel of his lips tugging at her nipples began to excite Sally and though she still felt nothing but discomfort from his probing finger she relaxed a little, leaning her head back into the corner provided by the bench seat and the window. It really was a rather pleasant sensation. Edward contorted again, biting first at her throat and then kissing her full on the mouth, forcing her lips apart with his tongue. Sally could taste the cigarettes and beer and found that that too was exciting. Then somehow she was spreadeagled along the seat and he was half-kneeling, half -lying on top of her and suddenly she did not think that what was between her legs was his finger. It was less sharp, bigger, hotter and instead of scratching painfully it felt good. Carefully Sally moved against it and felt a sort of yearning begin in the sensitised area between her thighs. She moved again experimentally. It was nice — oooh, really nice. Edward was still kissing her, his tongue circling inside her mouth, but all she could think about was this new sensation between her legs, a little like the way she felt when they danced, but even better. ‘Oh, Sally!’ he whispered, his breath ragged. Then suddenly he lunged and the pleasant sensation was gone, replaced not by pain but by a strange,full feeling and Sally began to feel frightened again. She wanted him to stop yet at the same time wanted him to go on in the hope that the lovely sensations would begin again. She was also dimly aware that they had passed the point of no return — now she had allowed him inside her it seemed wrong to yell at him to stop or begin fighting him. After a few thrusting minutes Edward gave a strangled cry that  seemed to come from deep in his throat and jerked out of her. He sprawled back behind the steering wheel, eyes closed, breathing heavily and clutching a handkerchief to himself. Sally lay without moving, looking at him in the light of the moon. She felt stunned, as if what he had done to her had somehow paralysed not only her limbs but her senses too, leaving her tense. There was no satisfaction, no pleasure, just a kind of aching emptiness. Then suddenly she became aware of how inelegant she must look, sprawled there with her skirt up around her hips and her bra dangling out of her open blouse. She sat up, straightening her clothes just as Edward opened the steamed-up window of the car and dumped the handkerchief out into the hedge. ‘You won't have any hankies left as this rate,’ she said, then giggled with embarrassment. What a stupid thing to have said! ‘Who cares?’ Edward asked grandly. He reached for her to kiss her again and Sally clung to him hoping that somehow the contact would make everything come right. But after a minute he put her away and started the engine. ‘I'd better get you home,’ he said. Sally felt like crying again. There must be something wrong with her. They'd gone all the way and still she didn't feel any of the things one was supposed to feel — elated, contented,together . Now that it was over Edward seemed to have gone a very long way away from her, as if she was no more than a stranger to whom he was giving a lift. For the remainder of the journey she fiddled with her clothes, trying to make sure she would look respectable when she arrived home and arranging the neck of her blouse to cover her throat where she was sure she must have another love bite. ‘See you on Saturday — same place?’ Edward said as he stopped the car outside her house. Sally nodded, the feeling of let-down growing. She had hoped he might arrange to come and collect her now that he had the car — and now that things were, well,seriousbetween them. But she didn't like to suggest it. As she slammed the car door she saw curtains at lighted windows twitching up and down the road. Well, at least he'd brought her home. At least the neighbours would know she had a boyfriend with a car. Walking up the path to the front door on legs that felt slightly wobbly Sally realised she would have to be satisfied with that. Sally and Edward sat in the very front row of the audience at the Fashion Show on canvas hospital-style chairs. Two feet in front of them was the catwalk, a bare narrow wooden platform angling away from a curtained entrance. Sally stared at the curtains wondering what was going on behind them. Chaos, probably. Paula had told her there were twelve models in the show and each of them had to wear at least ten outfits. One hundred and twenty outfits, not to mention all the shoes and hats and gloves. How on earth did they keep track of them all? When she was dressing to go out Sally was invariably unable to find the belt she wanted, one shoe had gone missing or one stocking developed a ladder. But one hundred and twenty outfits — what a nightmare! She glanced around at the audience who were appearing in twos and threes. Mostly they were very smart women in suits and soft draped dresses. Sally had agonised over what to wear — she was so afraid of letting Paula down — but eventually she had settled on a neat shirt-waister blouse and pencil skirt and Paula had loaned her a poplin duster coat in duck-egg blue with a thick soft grey Lucca Lamb collar. Sally felt good in it — the fur was gorgeously soft when she buried her chin in it and she thought that at least she could hold her own in the midst of all this elegance. The background music stopped and was replaced by an expectant hum, then that too ceased as the curtains parted and a man in a dinner jacket and black bow tie stepped out onto the catwalk. ‘Ladies and gentlemen — welcome!’ he boomed. His microphone whistled a little and Sally winced in embarrassment. The first model appeared on the catwalk, looking so glamorous, so unbelievably chic, that Sally could scarcely believe that her very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance. But a few moments later there she was — tall and beautiful in a little green bouclé dress with matching jacket. ‘It's her — it's Paula!’ Sally hissed, almost falling off her chair in excitement. ‘That is?’ Edward whispered back, stunned. ‘Yes, doesn't she look marvellous?’ Someone behind them coughed pointedly and they went quiet but Sally was wishing she could shout to the whole room: ‘That's my  sister!’ She was so proud she thought she would burst. And so happy and excited that it did not occur to her to worry about the devastating effect Paula was having on Edward. Behind the scenes Paula slipped out of one outfit, letting it fall to the floor, and reached for the next, hanging in the correct order on her clothes rail. The girl who was dressing her pulled up the zipper while Paula kicked off a pair of black suede shoes and eased her feet into crocodile ones. A quick flick of a comb through her hair — there was no hat to accessorise this dress — she reached for the crocodile clutch bag and moved towards the doorway for Arlene to give her a quick check before she stepped out onto the catwalk again. She felt alive as never before, and her eyes were glittering with excitement. Her initial nerves had all gone now although it still felt strange to be on a catwalk rather than the carpeted floor of the room at the Grand Hotel. Arlene gave her a small push to indicate it was time and she moved out. She couldn't wait to be back under the lights again with all eyes on her. As she sashayed down the catwalk she caught sight of Sally and Edward. The first time out she had seen nothing but a sea of faces, so hard had she been concentrating on what she was doing. Now she let her eyes dwell on them for a moment — Sally glowing with pride, Edward with a slightly dazed expression on his handsome face. Not bad! Paula thought. Not bad at all. You have quite a catch there, little sister. She did not dare look at them for too long for fear of missing her footing or forgetting a move but the look on Edward's face added another notch to her enjoyment. She twirled slowly, feeling his eyes on her so that it was as though she was receiving an injection of adrenalin. Oh how she was enjoying herself! She wanted it to go on for ever and ever! She was back at the curtains again. Time to turn, hold one last pose, then move out. But there were still eight outfits to go. Paula intended to make the most of every one of them. ‘Well, did you enjoy it?’ ‘Oh yes! Paula, you were wonderful!’ The show was over, the audience had drifted away to a reception room where they would be further wooed with a glass of champagne and a selection of canapes and nibbles and Paula, dressed now in one of her own suits, smart black barathea, had emerged from the dressing  rooms to meet the waiting Sally and Edward. She was still on a ‘high’, the potent adrenalin pumping through her veins, eyes sparkling, cheeks glowing with a becoming flush that owed nothing to the skilfully applied make-up. ‘Did you see anything you'd like to buy?’ ‘Oh yes — everything! But you know very well I can't. And anyway, it was you we came to see.’ ‘You weren't supposed to be looking at me. You were supposed to be looking at the clothes,’ Paula said artlessly. She was watching Edward out of the corner of her eye. Yes, he was every bit as good looking as she had thought he was when she had glimpsed him from the catwalk. And he owned a car! Not bad at all. He was only an office worker, of course, a clerk of sorts, Sally had said, not quite in the class that Paula intended to aim at, but very presentable for all that. And to think he was going out with Sally! The fact was somehow offensive to Paula's ego. In that moment she made up her mind. She didn't really want him, of course but she simply had to prove to herself that he would prefer her to Sally, given the choice. She smiled at him and felt his quickening interest. It was so easy, so incredibly easy. What was the expression? ‘Taking candy from a baby.’ It summed up the situation perfectly. ‘Did Sally say you might be able to squeeze me into your car?’ she asked, fluttering her eyelashes. ‘Hardly squeeze,’ Sally began, embarrassed, then broke off. Edward was not listening. Neither of them were. Edward was staring at Paula and Sally did not like the expression on his face. She felt the pit of her stomach fall away. ‘It's a big car,’ she finished lamely. ‘Are you sure I'm not making a nuisance of myself?’ Paula gushed. ‘Of course not. I have to drive Sally home anyway.’ The way he said it made Sally feel like a parcel for delivery. ‘I won't be long. I'll just get my things…’ Paula disappeared through the swing doors. Edward gazed after her. There was a glow about him that all men had when they were around Paula. Sally felt sick. ‘What are we going to do on Saturday?’ she asked, catching at his arm, desperate for reassurance. ‘Hmm? Oh… I don't know. Where does your sister go? Perhaps we could make up a party. That would be fun.’ For you, maybe, not for me! Sally thought. Paula reappeared, carrying the little modelling case she had had to buy and equip with cosmetics, shoes and spare tights. ‘I was just saying to Sally, why don't you come out with us on Saturday?’ Edward suggested. ‘We could go as a crowd.’ ‘Oh what a shame! I've already made arrangements for this week.’ But her eyes were flashing — nice try, Edward. Ask again sometime. Who knows? ‘Are you ready?’ Sally asked. All the shine had gone out of the evening. Suddenly all she wanted to do was get home and bury her head under her pillow. On Saturday Edward was late. Sally was frantic. He had never let her down before. Suppose something had happened to him? She waited and waited, the feeling of living a nightmare that had been with her ever since Thursday intensifying. At last just as she was contemplating getting the next bus home he arrived. She ran to meet him, weak with relief, but he was very vague as to why he was late and there was a remoteness about him that she could not penetrate. Something was wrong she knew though she could not have said what it was and she was not in the least surprised when he made some excuse about being a bit busy next week and unable to see her. When he stopped the car on the way home Sally threw herself at him. Tonight she would have been quite willing to let him do anything he wanted just as long as things would go back to being the way they had been. But Edward just didn't seem interested. ‘When will I see you again?’ she asked desperately. ‘I'll be in touch,’ he said vaguely and though it was a long time before she would admit it to herself Sally knew it was all over. That night she cried herself to sleep wondering where she had gone wrong and thinking she could not bear it if she never saw Edward again. It was probably because she was always so reluctant to let him make love to her, she decided. Everyone knew it was what boys wanted. If only she had been a bit more accommodating, a bit more enthusiastic. As it was he had obviously grown tired of the regular struggles and gone off to find someone who gave in more readily. But in spite of what had happened at the fashion show she did not think Paula had any hand in it until next day at breakfast. Paula, nibbling an Energen roll spread with reduced-calorie marmalade, said airily: ‘Oh, who do you think came into the store yesterday? Your friend  Edward! And I think you should know he wanted me to go out with him.’ Sally began to tremble. ‘What did you say?’ she asked. ‘That I couldn't possibly two-time you, of course,’ Paula said, watching Sally slyly. ‘I told him that whilst he was dating my own sister it was quite out of the question. He argued, of course— said that there was nothing serious between the two of you and you knew that. But I was adamant all the same.’ Her eyes narrowed. ‘You are still going out with him, aren't you?’ ‘I don't know,’ Sally said miserably. ‘Well the rat!’ Paula said, but she looked pleased. ‘You…you wouldn't go out with him, would you, Paula?’ Sally asked, hating herself for still wanting him. ‘Oh Sally, what do you think I am?’ Sally did not answer. She did not think Paula would have liked what she had to say. Edward never did get in touch with Sally again. She was sick with wretchedness, convinced she had only herself to blame — and of course the devastating effect Paula had on men — but still puzzled that it could have ended so suddenly without a word of explanation on his part. Besides being heart-broken she felt foolish and a failure. But she never did find out if he was successful in persuading Paula to go out with him now that he was free. She did not want to know. Once, months later, when she went to the Regency on a Saturday night with some girlfriends she practically bumped into him on the stairs. But he merely looked embarrassed and said: ‘Oh — hi!’ as he passed as if she was just a casual acquaintance. During the evening she caught sight of him a few times, always dancing, holding his partners very close, and managing to avoid her eyes. After that night Sally never saw him again."
FIC FIC-BPA-003 8.56 "The C130 Hercules of RAF Transport Command, markings hurriedly painted out, stood near the end of the runway, its engines running up as a car swung in through the raised barrier, and past the RAF Regiment guard. It drove swiftly round the perimeter and pulled in behind the ‘plane, its ramp down, cavernous interior gaping wide. In the dimly-lit interior, Delaney could see crew members moving around, and the bulky outline of some  pieces of equipment, inflatable dinghy packs and harness. And some of those shadowy figures were men of his group. Three had come to G9 via the SAS. Two from the Marines equivalent, the Special Boat Service. Anderson was unique, brought in to fill two vital functions: the need for a medic, and the need to give G9 something special, some angle that would disguise its true nature, an extraordinary elite fighting group trained for any emergency. Each of them for their own private reason needed to live with death at their shoulder. Delaney had, since his young wife, Pam, who always worried stiff at his parachuting, had died underneath a juggernaut, with the son she would have given life to in one month's time. He stepped from the car and turned to slam the door. Connors nodded, his voice lost in the noise from the Hercules. ‘Good luck’ were the words his lips formed. But Delaney, fleetingly, as he slammed the door, saw something in Connors' eyes. Guilt? Had Connors told him everything? Or was he holding something back? The car gunned away. Delaney stood for a second looking after it. Then he shrugged, and made his way towards  the aircraft. The piercing whine of the C130's four Allison turbo props rose even higher, hurting his ears, the air stinking with the smell of burnt kerosene, the hot moist gases buffeting and pulling at his clothes. He ran up the ramp, the sergeant liftmaster activating the hydraulics even before he had set loot on it. Delaney stood, watching the hatch close up, with the last view of the car headlights turning away towards the main building and the control tower. As soon as the hull was sealed, the liftmaster spoke into his intercom. Immediately the engine noise grew even louder, drowning out the sound of Delaney's own voice as he shouted an acknowledgement to the sergeant and settled down in the nearest side seat, strapping himself in. The fuselage vibrated, the interior lights flickered and dimmed; and then with a lurch they began to roll, bumping and jarring on the sectional concrete. Half a minute later the airframe gave one final creak and his stomach fell away as the Hercules lifted off, whining into the night sky. It finally came home then to Delaney what they were about to do in several hours' time. The last occasion he had parachuted into the sea, at night, operationally, had been off South Georgia. As the floor levelled off the lights flickered and came up, the engine noise settling down to a steady background roar. Delaney unbuckled his webbing and stood up, picking his way forward past the life rafts racked ready for the drop. Up in the forward end, behind the bulkhead, sat the five other members of G9, already dressed in thick Navy issue pullovers and fatigues. Theodore Lawton, leader of the second stick of three, greeted Delaney matter-of-factly. ‘Good evening, John.’ Delaney shook Lawton by the hand, and nodded at the other faces, regarding them levelly. Eugene Forster had a quizzical smile playing around his mouth. Barry Silk was eager and expectant. Martin Grant, absolutely placid. Only Doctor Anderson looked grim, face drawn and pale. Delaney settled down beside Lawton. ‘All the equipment aboard? No hitches?’ Lawton nodded. He had been in radio contact with Delaney during the latter's journey down from the MOD to Brize Norton. They all  knew that it was a night drop into the ocean. Nothing more. He began to brief them. Silk looked disappointed and scratched away at his pock-marked face. ‘No sign of life, you say?’ Delaney shook his head, knowing that for Silk nothing alive meant nothing to kill. Eugene Forster lit a cheroot. ‘Our very own Marie Celeste, eh? Interesting.’ ‘It's a holding operation,’ Delaney summed up briskly, ‘more than anything. All we have to do is get in and establish a bridgehead, so to speak. The only one of us who might have their work cut out is Doctor Anderson — if we find a lot of casualties.’ All faces turned towards the doctor. Not for the first time Delaney looked into the eyes that were deep, infathomable pools of green, and at the copper-coloured hair falling around the high smooth cheek bones; at the small upturned nose and a mouth just large enough to hint at the animal sensuality lying dormant beneath the surface. Dormant? Now why had he thought of that? The doctor, when he had first seen her, had awakened a creature deep within him that he had thought would sleep for ever— until the day he died. Its movement had  left an ache in his heart. Maybe the anaesthetic that had numbed his natural instinct to a beautiful woman since Pam's death was wearing off. Delaney felt irritated. ‘There's one other thing,’ he said. ‘You all know the difficulties inherent in getting on board Titron. We have reason to believe an attempt has already been made, by the Russians. How successful they were we have no idea.’ Barry Silk perked up. ‘We take them out if they are aboard, right? No holds barred, and no shit about international diplomatic pressure?’ Delaney agreed. ‘No flack,’ he said and clapped his hands together, rubbing them in a warming motion. ‘There are several hours to go. We've got an in-flight refuelling schedule before the drop, so check your equipment. Then get some rest.’ Delaney tried to avoid looking at Doctor Nell Anderson as he went forward to the flight deck. But it was useless. He could not get over the fact that the only woman who had come through the near-impossible screening, then training, had not been some six foot Amazon with a face like Atilla the Hun — but a petite, feminine five foot three in her stockinged feet, who turned all the men's  head when she passed. A distinct advantage. And the enigma did not end there. Why, he kept asking himself, did a woman, trained in the art of healing, who had been a naval medical officer and not somebody's wife, suddenly volunteer for something that was inevitably going to be highly dangerous — and almost certainly involve her in killing — at close quarters? Her records were, of course, put at his disposal. They were alarmingly sparse. Born in London of an Irish mother and a Scottish father, she had been educated at a convent school in North London. From there she had entered University College Hospital, emerging seven years later with her medical qualifications. After appointments in community service, she had joined the Navy. All straight forward. The only thing that was to him suspicious, was apart from the normality of liaisons at the hospital, there was no mention of a man in her life. And judging from his own reactions he knew that was impossible. But she put up a barrier around her, and allowed no one to pass. When she'd been selected, and automatically compelled to leave the Navy, taking an appointment at a civilian hospital, he'd told himself  that it was his duty to visit her to see that she was settled in…not lonely. But it had come to nothing, and in the process he had recognised the truth behind his motives. That he was attracted to her. Delaney spent some twenty minutes with the captain and crew in the red-lit cockpit with its enormous banks of dials, before passing back to change out of his suit and to check his own equipment. Forster and Grant were asleep. Lawton was reading Blake by the light of a spot lamp. Silk was cleaning his Uzi folding stock 9 mm machine-gun — the group's favourite close quarter weapon, other than the knife. Doctor Anderson was tying her hair back, pinning it tightly to her head. The toilet of the female, Delaney mused. And a species deadlier than the male. Nell Anderson glanced up as Delaney came past, making his way to the pre-loaded freight pallets, the liftmaster, and his kit. Very thorough, she mused. For John Delaney checked everything. Nell finished tightly tucking in the last strand of hair, and pulled on a black woollen balaclava before snuggling down into her sleeping bag, turning her face to the fuselage wall. Unlike the others, sleep did not come easily to her before a job. They had had longer to become philosophical. More fatalistic. Sleep didn't come easily when she was at home, or rather in the room at the hospital. And before that a succession of rooms. Home? She'd never known a true home. Not that her father and mother had divorced. They had just simply and totally fallen out of love with each other, and like the devout Catholics they were, carried on as a pretence. So she had grown up in a cold, almost emotionally empty vacuum. If only they had fought, screamed at one another, gone their separate ways, even had lovers…anything but the sterility of it all, a sterility that had finally been injected into everything they touched. Nell laid her cheek on her hands, held together as if in prayer, forming a pillow. At school, compensating, she had worked and worked and worked, so much so that she had finally made the two A's and a B necessary for medicine in her A levels. It was to be the key. The way out. And then in the clinical years, the disillusion, the suffering, the unfairness, the dying, the inevitability of it all. Growing old, the process of decay had eroded into her one reaming confidence. Her youth. Now, Nell could not conceive of love between a man and a woman, could not bear the thought of ageing. Trapped in her own loneliness, suicide had begun to dominate her thoughts. As a doctor it would have been so easy, and that very easiness, not her by now nominal Catholicism, had held her back, temporarily, from what she knew would be inevitable one day…before she was forty. She could imagine the coroner's disinterested voice. ‘…overdose while in a depressed state…balance of mind disturbed.’ Then, while a Navy surgeon lieutenant — she liked the sport and a contract that would last nicely into her forties — had come the memoranda. With its hints of dangerous work and high selectivity it had seemed like nature's way. The survival of the fittest. Except that she would notsurvive. Trained as they were, the psychiatrists on the screening tests had failed to scratch the surface of her most secret place; had failed to detect the urge to self-destruction which would automatically bar her from G9, as it did in the SAS and SBS. In the steady, stupefying roar of the Hercules, she drifted into an area that was not sleep, yet not awake, a sort of limbo where  she could direct her thoughts — as in a dream. Sex? She was not afraid of it. She had slept with three men in her life. It had nothing to do with giving herself. John Delaney's face came into the dream. His interest in her had been obvious, and because of that she had discouraged it. Somehow he made her feel uneasy. There was something about Delaney, something indefinable, that worried her. His almost too handsome face, for her taste, that is, was saved by the warmth of his eyes, though at times they could become frightening. Then they were hard, cold, merciless windows into an inner world of violence. Instinctively she had sensed that Delaney would demand more of her than a passing gratification. She sensed that he needed more, and this was something that she could not give…the secret places of her mind. Satisfied, Barry Silk laid the last item of his equipment lovingly down, almost as if for a kit inspection. He checked his watch. Another three hours. He lay back, resting his head on his hands that were clasped behind him, closing his eyes even though he did not feel like sleep. He was making sure they were not exposed  to any form of light source, however muted. When he worked at night he prepared properly, never allowing his vision to become impaired in any way. It could mean the difference between life — or death. He smiled contentedly. Lawton turned the page of his pocket edition of Blake. When the stars threw down their spears And water'd heaven with their tears Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry. It was one of his favourites from The Songs of Experience. He closed the book and slipped it into a polythene bag. Even now he didn't fully know what was meant by the line the stars threw down their spears. And it didn't help him to know the scholars found it equally obscure. The forest of the nightalways made him shiver — the association with nameless terrors peering at him through the jungle of a Rousseau painting on his childhood wall. Blake had meant the associated darkness to be the haunts of man's errors. The nightmare side of his intellect. He tucked the polythene bag into the waterproofed ammunition pouch. His gut was beginning to play him up. Careful not to wake the others, he made his way for the third time to the lavatory. Lawton smiled. They never had bowel trouble in the movies. As he sat in a roaring solitary splendour twenty thousand feet over the turbulent, endless ocean wastes, he had no idea of the appropriateness of the poem he had just read. Forster dreamed of a beautiful, sophisticated woman. Dressed in a plain blue silk suit, seamed stockings and high heels, she sipped her champagne, red lips peeking just below the rim of the net coming from a dainty little hat. Haughty, cold, and ignoring him, she could not disguise the hunger in the large brown eyes behind the net. They found his. Mysteriously they were alone now, all the other people in the room had gone, with the  breeze gently swirling the curtains of the French windows leading out on to the terrace. Slowly he put down his glass and moved towards her. Defiantly her chin came up, challenging him, warning that he was beneath her dignity; that if he tried to hiss her she would… He didn't kiss her. His hand went out and cupped her breast crudely. Her eyes blazed with shock, and… The ‘plane bumped, rolling Forster roughly to one side, catapulting him into the bleakness of reality. The ‘plane rolled and shuddered again. Forster hauled himself to his feet, clinging to the sides and overhead rails for support as he picked his way over to Delaney. Seat belt signs were flashing everywhere. ‘What's this, then? I thought you said the weather report indicated gale conditions after dawn.’ Delaney nodded. ‘They did,’ he affirmed. ‘I'm going to check with the pilot. Get everybody ready. We're less than forty minutes out now.’ As he entered the cockpit, the pilot looked worriedly over his shoulder. ‘Bad turbulence. We seem to have run right into it.’ Delaney settled on to his haunches between the two seats, and hung on grimly. ‘What is it like at the DZ?’ The pilot shook his head. ‘Can't be good. I take it you'll want to call the Big House?’ ‘The MOD communications centre? Yes.’ Tight-lipped, Delaney nodded, and moved over to the radio desk. The operator's face was screwed up in concentration, one hand clamped to his left ear plug as he manipulated the dials of the set. ‘We're getting a lot of interference,’ he said. ‘They're barely audible.’ Delaney patiently waited while the operator re-established the link. Then he spoke into a reserve speaker, using the designated call for the operation. His ears were filled with a great roaring, a voice only just discernible, but unintelligible, in its midst. He tried several times. But it was useless. Finally, the operator pulled out a small metal box from a rack underneath his desk, deftly flipped back the lid and plugged in the connection. ‘Nothing for it but to try this.’ He began tapping out his identification in morse code. It took five minutes to establish the link, and for the operator to get out Delaney's short message requesting an abort due to extreme winds in the drop zone. The signal was acknowledged and they were advised to hold. Delaney steadied himself as the ‘plane lurched. The pilot glanced back at him. ‘They can't let you go down in this,’ he said with concern. ‘It would be suicide.’ The co-pilot shook his head. ‘Funny that the met people should get it so wrong.’ Outside the flight deck, a wisp of white flicked past the black window. Why did Delaney suddenly find he was suspicious about the meteorological report? It took nearly five minutes before Delaney, wearing a second set of earphones, looked up sharply to make sure that the radioman, swearing at the weird interference, could hear the stream of dots and dashes coming in. De-coded, the operator swung on his seat to face him. But Delaney could already read the answer in the grim, red-lit face. ‘The message is ‘Albatross’, sir.’ It was the no-abort , go at any cost signal."
FIC FIC-BPA-007 9.79 "Scanning the deck railing, Delaney could see no movement as he raised the pistol grip launcher, adjusting the length of burn. The timing in the heavy swell had to be carefully judged. As the boat rammed the steel plates, fabric ripping as it was dragged up against the rough barnacled side, he fired. With an almost lazy climb the solid fuel missile, grapple irons extending as it left the short barrel, reached its zenith and fell back with a clang, hooking on to the deck railing. Even as Delaney hauled the line tight, with his Uzi slung across his back, he began to walk up the steel wall. Lawton at the other end of the assault boat fired. His grapple connected and he began to follow. Before he reached the top, Delaney paused, and holding with his legs, unslung the Uzi and brought it to one-handed readiness. At eye level he scanned the deck. The red light from the nearly spent flare threw giant shadows; black, impenetrable, utterly  concealing a possible enemy. Lawton joined him, his own machine gun at the ready. Together they scaled the remaining rope, rolling over the railing and falling flat on to the deck with practisedease, short stubby muzzles of the Uzis weaving and probing the long narrow passage. Nothing moved. Lawton covered as Delaney raised himself, wriggling forward into the nearest pocket of shadow, as Forster and Silk came up like weird, black sea creatures that slithered silently over the rail and into the nearest cover of darkness. Grant brought up the rear, using his arms only to haul himself up the rope. No commands were necessary, the attack already planned. Delaney moved forward, keeping to the side of the superstructure, intent on the stairway leading to the next deck, and finally the bridge. Only Forster and Silk followed, Lawton staying to assist Nell bring up the extra combat kit that they would now recover from the assault boat. Grant guarded their rear — the work assigned to anyone disabled. They moved warily, scuttling forward, overlapping each other, black wraith-like phantoms moving as a single entity, its rhythm known to them as ‘house-laundering’— engaging the  enemy at close quarters. There were six decks to the level of the wheelhouse. In that time they saw no movement, no living or dead person, no sign of violence; nothing, but the ordered emptiness of a darkened and dead ship. ‘It's spooky,’ Forster said, finally breaking the silence. But nobody answered. They arrived at the sliding door entrance to the bridge. Silk flattened himself beside the steel door, Delaney and Forster priming stun grenades. The fuses were six second ones. After a count of three, soundlessly checked by Delaney with his arm, Silk heaved back on the door as they lobbed them in. There followed an intense double flash, the explosions sounding like thousand pound bombs. Anyone inside would be temporarily blinded, momentarily stunned, unless they were trained personnel and had taken precautions. But Silk was already inside, hunched down low, Uzi searching for targets. Delaney and Forster were close behind. In the cordite-reeking interior loomed dim and unfamiliar shapes. Silk moved very slowly, deliberately, pausing  with each step, like a stalking tiger. The others keened themselves for any sound, for any indication of anyone responding to Silk's movement — the clink of a grenade pin, the withering blast of a machine gun. Nothing happened. Silk moved again, outflanked a control console, nestling down beside it as Delaney took over the lead. Delaney was leaving the cover of a vent pipe when it happened. There was a scraping and a clink. The short burst from Silk's Uzi lit up the bridge in a flickering light, showing its emptiness as the cat bucked and disintegrated in a shower of red pieces. Even before its last twitch they sprang forward, securing the room. Silk guarded the far door. Delaney played a torch around. Everything was neat. There was no sign of any devastation or a struggle, except where the pool of light picked out the broken, gutted cat. ‘Try the lights,’ Delaney snapped. There was a clicking followed by Forster's voice. ‘No joy. Everything is shut down.’ That same pool of light picked out a half-smoked cigar on the edge of an ashtray, a partly consumed sandwich, and several mugs of cold  tea. To one side was an open paperback novel. ‘It's just as if they downed tools and pushed off,’ Forster remarked. ‘No sign of a struggle.’ Delaney, taking in the scene, nodded. ‘Right,’ he said briskly, ‘get the rest of our kit up here — both of you. And Gene…’ Forster paused in the doorway. ‘Watch it. We still don't know what it is we are up against, do we?’ Delaney waited in the darkness, listening to the wind moaning in the wireless rigging and battering on the window. The weather was certainly getting worse. They had only just managed to get on the vessel in time. As he gazed out, down the enormous length of the ship, he could just make out the dark outline against the lighter sea, and the rectangular shapes of the deck-covered containers. Would they find the answer down there, he thought, deep in the bowels of the ship? His own bowel felt uneasy in the eerie emptiness, emphasised by the abandoned accoutrements of the missing crew, all around him. It was like being the last man alive on earth. When the others returned, bringing the extra equipment, he took a field radio, stepped outside and began to transmit to the Hercules that was still circling around above them somewhere. Immediately he tuned the set in, interference was enormous. There could be no doubt that the source was within Titron itself. Delaney could hear the Hercules operator respond — nothing more. There was only one thing he could do. Every few seconds he transmitted the ‘successfully aboard’ code. HERON HERON HERON Nell Anderson looked up as Delaney entered. She was attending to Grant's leg. ‘He won't be very mobile for some time,’ she said. ‘It's a bad sprain.’ Grant handed him his personal transceiver to clip on to Delaney's webbing. ‘They won't work for the moment. Too much interference.’ In the captain's cabin behind the bridge he found the ship's log. It conveyed nothing out of the ordinary. It ended abruptly the day before the distress call. ‘Nothing there,’ he said, closing the book. Delaney turned aside, and was about to ask Forster if he'd found the cargo manifest, when Nell, who had been looking over his shoulder, spoke. ‘Doesn't it strike you as odd?’ Puzzled, he looked back at her. ‘What?’ She thumped the discarded log book with the back of her hand. ‘Titron doesn't appear to have been in port for over two years. Like a latter-day Flying Dutchman.’ Delaney took the book from her and scrutinised it more carefully. It was true. The ship had been refuelled and re-provisioned at sea by fleet auxiliaries. Nell spoke his thoughts out loud as their eyes met. ‘There must have been a reason for it, like not wanting anyone to know what was being carried aboard Titron.’ Delaney finally nailed it. ‘Because what was on board was too dangerous to be anywhere near land. Had to be kept thousands of miles out in the ocean.’"
FIC FIC-G01-021 8.84 "60 She rubbed a thin layer of Vaseline over her lips and smiled, satisfied with the extra lubrication. Zena Murray had seen on television that beauty queens used the trick so she figured it would work for her. After all, she had to do a lot of smiling in her business, too. Contestants in a beauty contest had only judges to impress with their looks and stance. Zena had many other, more trenchant critics to impress. The punters were always demanding. Jim Scott watched as she finished applying the vaseline, pacing the dressing room as she stood naked before him, slipping on a G-string and a suspender belt. ‘And you haven't seen or heard from Carol since last night?’ he said agitatedly. ‘Scotty, we work together, that's it,’ Zena told him, rolling one stocking up her leg. ‘She didn't stay with you?’ ‘There's hardly room in my place for me , let alone bloody guests,’ Zena told him. Scott sighed. ‘She's okay, I bet you,’ Zena said, trying to sound reassuring. She looked at Scott, something close to pity in her voice. ‘Look, Scotty, you shouldn't worry about her so much. She's got her own life to lead, you know.’ And you won't be part of it for much longer . ‘You'd be better off looking for someone else,’ she smiled, her attempts at light banter failing miserably. ‘I'm unattached, you know.’ ‘I don't want anyone else, Zena,’ he told her. She shrugged. ‘Just trying to help,’ she said. Help, or soften the blow .? Scott opened the door. ‘When she comes in, tell her I want to see her, will you?’ he said, then he was gone. Zena pulled on another stocking and heard his footsteps echoing away up the corridor. Scott returned to his office and sat at his desk, glancing at the phone, wondering if he should try calling Carol's flat again. He resisted the temptation, leaning back in his seat, running a hand across his forehead. A confusion of emotions tumbled through his mind: anger, concern, fear. He couldn't seem to settle on one that suited him. It was not knowing where she was that was so unsettling. Or who she was with? He pushed the thought to the back of his mind. She wouldn't do that to him. Would she? He got to his feet and crossed to the window of the office. Below the streets were alive with people, all of them bathed in the neon glow that seemed to fill the very air itself with multi-coloured energy. Who was she with? Scott gritted his teeth. There couldn't be anyone else. He would know. There would be signs he'd have spotted. He sucked in a deep breath. No. There was a rational explanation for all this and, when Carol arrived, he'd discover what it was. If she arrived. He returned to his desk and sat down. Even as he did there was a knock on the door and he was on his feet again instantly. The door opened. John Hitch walked in, smiling at Scott, who merely exhaled wearily. ‘Hello, Jim, I'm glad to see you too,’ Hitch said, still smiling. ‘Sorry, John,’ Scott said. ‘I was expecting someone else.’ The two men shook hands and Scott offered the other man a seat which he accepted and a drink which he declined. ‘Is Ray with you?’ Scott wanted to know. Hitch shook his head. ‘I'm allowed out on my own tonight, Jimmy boy,’ Hitch grinned. ‘This isn't a social call, is it, mate?’ Scott said. ‘No. Ray sent me. I've got a job for you.’ Scott looked puzzled. ‘Tomorrow night,’ Hitch continued. ‘We're going to  hit a shipment of coke that Ralph Connelly's bringing in.’ He laced his fingers on the desk top. ‘You're supposed to drive one of the getaway cars.’ ‘Are you fucking serious?’ Scott exclaimed. ‘That's not my line of work.’ ‘I know that. I was as surprised as you, but Ray Plummer wants you in on it.’ He sat back in his seat. ‘I'm just a messenger, Jim. I do as I'm told, and he told me to include you in this job.’ ‘Why?’ Hitch shrugged. ‘Fuck knows. Like I said, I'm just doing what I was told.’ Scott ran a hand through his hair, bewilderment on his face. ‘You'll be picked up from here tomorrow night at -twelve,’ Hitch told him. ‘You'll be briefed on what you've got to do. I don't know what else I can say.’ He looked almost apologetic. ‘I don't like this, John,’ Scott told him. ‘Maybe not, mate, but you've got no choice.’ Hitch got to his feet and crossed to the door. ‘You got a shooter?’ he asked. ‘Beretta 92S. Why?’ Hitch nodded. ‘Bring it.’"
FIC FIC-G01-030 8.87 "69 He was beginning to get cramp in his right leg. Jim Scott massaged his calf for a moment, then pushed open the driver's side door of the Lancia and clambered out. The chill night air hit him like a fist. He recoiled, but the iciness in the breeze freshened his skin and helped to dispel the lethargy he had been feeling sitting in the car. He walked around the vehicle a couple of times, stretching his legs, stopping by the bonnet to squat down on his knees. As he straightened up he heard the joints pop and winced. The river was silent. From where he stood. Scott could see nothing but the curling black tongue of water cutting through the centre of the city. He crossed the road, pausing on the kerb and looking back towards the Lancia. The two-way radio Hitch had been using was still on the passenger seat. Perhaps Scott should take it with him in case someone tried to make contact. Fuck it. They knew where he was if they wanted him. He strode across the road and headed towards the quayside, leaning against the black metal fencing that ran along the embankment. He gazed down river but could see nothing. Behind him a car passed and he turned to look at the occupants. It was a young couple, who both looked at him for a second before driving on. The girl was blonde. A little like Carol? He rested one foot on the fence and leant forward, hawking loudly, sending a projectile of sputum into the river below. Where the fuck was she? Why hadn't she called him? All he wanted to know was if she was all right. Just a phone call would satisfy him. Would it hell. He needed to see her, speak to her, touch her. He felt anger and concern in equal measures. It was the uncertainty that was so infuriating, not knowing where she was. His whole life had become a series of unanswered questions in the past few days. First Carol and now this. This? This fucking job? He asked himself again why they needed him here. He still could not begin to imagine why, as Hitch had told him, Ray Plummer had specifically asked for him to be included. He kicked irritably at the metal fence and then turned and headed back towards the car, hands dug deep into the pockets of his jacket. Behind him, the river flowed by. It took just over forty-five minutes to unload the crates (sixteen in all) from The Sandhopper to The Abbott . Hitch, Morton and McCann stood over the other three men while they transferred the precious cargo, guns trained on them at all times. ‘And there's twenty million quid's worth in there?’ Morton said quietly, watching as the tall man lowered the last crate into the hold. ‘Twenty million quid's worth of coke,’ Hitch said. ‘That's all of it,’ said the tall man, wiping perspiration from his forehead. Beside him, the youngest of the three was trying to pull a splinter from his palm. Hitch motioned them back onto The Sandhopper . ‘Thanks for your help, fellas,’ he said, smiling. Then, looking across at Morton, ‘Start the engine. Terry, we've finished.’ ‘You're making a fucking big mistake,’ said the second man, his teeth clenched in anger. ‘When Connelly finds out about this…’ The sentence was interrupted abruptly as Hitch fired. The first bullet hit the man in the chest, staving in the sternum, cracking two ribs and ripping through a lung. Gobbets of pinkish-grey matter exploded from the exit wound below the right shoulder blade. The man pitched backwards, blood spouting from the wound. ‘What the fuck…’ shouted McCann as he saw Hitch turn on the other two men. The younger of the two ran for the side of the boat, perhaps in an attempt to dive over the side. A last desperate attempt to escape into the murky waters. The first bullet hit him in the back, severing his spine. He crumpled to the deck, his sphincter muscle giving out. The soft sound of voiding filled the air as he rolled over in agony like a fish out of water. The tall man fared no better. Hitch shot him in the face, watching as he toppled  backwards, most of his bottom jaw blown off by the close-range blast. Hitch moved swiftly from one body to the other, firing another shot into the head of each man. Into the nape of the neck of the youngest, who was lying on his stomach with part of his spine exposed, the flesh and muscle ripped away by the 9mm bullet. Hitch jumped back aboard The Abbott and slapped Morton on the shoulder. ‘Get us away from here,’ he said sharply, and the other man guided the smaller boat away, allowing it to pick up speed. ‘What the hell did you kill them for?’ shouted McCann. ‘They saw our faces.’ Hitch said flatly. ‘They knew we were with Plummer.’ ‘That's bullshit,’ snapped McCann. ‘If word of this had got back to Connelly there'd be gang war,’ Hitch told him. ‘We couldn't have left them alive.’ ‘Bollocks,’ McCann roared. ‘You didn't have to kill them.’ Hitch grabbed him by the lapels, pulling him close. ‘And what the fuck would you have done with them, hot shot? Invited them out for a drink?’ Hitch snarled. He pushed his companion away. ‘We leave the boat to float there now. By the time somebody finds them there'll be nothing to link us to the killings.’ McCann sighed and banged his fist against the side of the boat. ‘Shit,’ he murmured. ‘Fucking shit.’ He let out a long breath then turned to look at Hitch. ‘I suppose you're right.’ Hitch nodded. Morton was already guiding the boat in towards the quay. Hitch moved closer to the prow. ‘What now?’ McCann wanted to know. ‘I'm getting off here. I've got to let Plummer know it went okay. You carry on down to Putney Bridge, get this lot unloaded. You know what to do with the boat.’ He looked at McCann then at Morton. ‘Sink it.’ Morton nodded. Hitch was about six feet from the edge of the pier when he jumped, landing with surprising agility. He brushed dust from his sleeve and headed towards the flight of stone steps that led up to the embankment. The boat was already chugging away towards Putney. Hitch smiled and crossed the road to the Lancia, pulling open the door and sliding into the passenger seat. ‘Let's go,’ he said. ‘I heard some shooting,’ Scott told him, starting the engine. ‘What was it?’ ‘Nothing for you to worry about, Scotty,’ Hitch told him. ‘Just get me to a phone, will you?’ Scott started the engine and drove off. Hitch fumbled inside his jacket and pulled the Beretta free. He passed it to Scott. ‘Take it,’ he said sharply. The driver did as he was instructed, slipping it back inside the holster, feeling the slight warmth in the metal. ‘Tell me what happened,’ he demanded. ‘This fucking gun has been fired.’ ‘I had to frighten one of them,’ Hitch lied. ‘Fired above his head.’ Scott looked across at his companion. ‘You better be telling me the truth,’ he said threateningly, ‘or I'll use the fucking thing on you.’ Hitch looked at him and saw the anger in Scott's eyes. He had no doubt at all that Scott meant what he said. He persisted with the lie, nevertheless. ‘I had to frighten them, Scotty, I told you,’ he said quietly. ‘I heard six fucking shots,’ Scott said. ‘Why so many?’ ‘Just drive,’ Hitch said. Scott pulled the car over to the kerb, his right hand slipping inside his jacket. He pulled the pistol free and shoved it against Hitch's cheek. ‘How many shots did you fire?’ he snarled. ‘Tell me or I'll blow your fucking head off.’ He thumbed back the hammer. ‘Six,’ Hitch said. He reached inside his jacket and pulled his own pistol free. ‘Here, take the mag out of my gun, replace it with the one from yours.’ Scott seemed satisfied by this and slipped the magazine free from his own pistol, jamming in the full one he'd taken from Hitch's Beretta. The two men glared at each other for a moment. ‘That temper of yours is going to get you into trouble one day, Scotty,’ Hitch told him. ‘You ever pull that on me again and I'll fucking kill you.’ ‘You'll have to be quicker than you were a minute ago, then,’ Scott hissed and pulled the car away from the kerb. ‘Just get me to a phone,’ Hitch said irritably. Scott drove on. ‘There.’ Hitch pointed to the pay phone on the corner of the street and Scott brought the Lancia to a halt, watching as his companion walked across to the phone, picked it up and dialled, feeding more money in. ‘Ray, it's me,’ said Hitch. ‘It's done. Yeah, everything. Well,nearly everything.’ He smiled. ‘Scott's going to drop me off. No, didn't need him.’ He listened for a  moment, glancing round at his companion in the car. ‘Right. I'll call you tomorrow.’ He replaced the receiver, scooped his change out of the slot and walked back towards the car, clambering into the passenger side. Scott drove on. Ten minutes later he dropped Hitch off close by Clapham Junction Station then drove away, heading home. The traffic was light at such an hour. He might make it back by four in the morning, once he'd dumped the car. Hitch watched the tail lights of the Lancia disappear and headed for the public telephones nearby. He fed more money into the machine, smiling as he dialled."
FIC FIC-G01-037 9.85 "75 John Hitch drained what was left in his wine glass and put it down, looking across the table at Carol Jackson, who held his gaze for a moment and then went on eating. Beside her, Ray Plummer was struggling to wind spaghetti around his fork but it kept falling back into the dish. Cursing, he began cutting it up, pushing the shorter strands onto his spoon. Les Gourmets was busy, to Plummer's relief. The trade in all his restaurants had been slack over the past couple of weeks, and he was glad to see so many lunchtime diners. The babble of conversation was punctuated by the chink of bottles against glasses. Hitch poured himself another glass of Chablis, raised his eyebrows at Carol expectantly and moved the bottle towards her, but she shook her head, covering her glass with one hand. As she did he saw the ring on the third finger of her left hand; the large diamond sparkled brightly. Fuck knows how much that cost, Hitch thought, glancing at the impressive stone. He afforded himself a quick glance at Plummer, who was still struggling with his spaghetti. The manager of the restaurant, a short Italian with sad eyes and a pinched face, emerged from the kitchen and  chatted briefly with Plummer about the improvement of business. Hitch kept his eyes on Carol; by this time, she was beginning to feel uneasy under his almost unwavering stare. The manager disappeared a moment later, leaving them alone again to finish their meal. ‘Dozy bloody wop,’ muttered Plummer. ‘He used to work for Ralph Connelly. Ran one of his clubs in Kensington.’ ‘If you don't like him, why did you employ him?’ Carol wanted to know. Plummer shrugged. ‘When I took over the club from Connelly I agreed to give old Giuseppe there a job,’ he explained. ‘Just part of the process, sweetheart.’ He smiled at Carol. ‘It's called diplomacy. We shafted Connelly when we took his shipment of coke but a gang war wouldn't have been any use to either of us. He knew he couldn't win one; I had too much money behind me. So we agreed to compromise with him on certain things, in return for him keeping his nose out of my business.’ ‘I still don't trust that cunt,’ said Hitch. ‘He could still try something.’ Plummer shook his head. ‘If he was going to do anything, he'd have done it months ago. You worry too much, John.’ ‘Maybe you're a little too settled, Ray,’ Hitch said challengingly. ‘You might get over-confident…’ Plummer glared at him. ‘Are you trying to tell me I've lost my bottle?’ he rasped. ‘I didn't say that,’ Hitch added hastily. ‘Then what the fuck are you saying?’ Hitch looked at Carol, then at his colleague. ‘Well, you and Carol, you're sort of settled now, aren't you?’ he said. ‘You've got enough money to keep you for the rest of your life. It must be easy to lose your grip. Without even realising it, that's all I'm saying. I'm thinking about you .’ ‘Your concern is touching, Johnny boy,’ chuckled Plummer, ‘But don't worry about me. Just because Carol's wearing that ring doesn't mean I'm ready to get out my fucking pipe and slippers, either.’ He eyed Hitch malevolently. ‘So if you've got any ideas…’ He allowed the sentence to trail off. ‘Leave it out, Ray,’ Hitch said indignantly, reaching for his glass of wine. He looked round at the other diners. Mostly businessmen. A few couples, laughing and joking, talking animatedly. Fucking yuppies, all of them, thought Hitch, glancing back across the table. She's got you where she wants you, you silly cunt, he thought, watching as Carol slipped one hand onto Plummer's thigh, stroking gently as he ate. Horny little slag. Carol looked at Hitch and smiled. A smile of triumph? He held her gaze, allowing his own eyes to drop to her breasts, which were pressing against the clinging material of her dress. He could see the outline of her nipples. Got him right where you want him, haven't you? She lifted her glass, the light striking the ring, reflecting off the diamond. To Carol it was a symbol of victory. A hard-earned trophy fought for and suffered for. She felt she deserved it. Sometimes she even felt something for Plummer. Sometimes. It wasn't love, that much she was sure of. Gratitude, perhaps. Appreciation that he had provided  her with the escape route she had so badly sought? She wasn't sure. What was more, she didn't care. She was here now. She was with him. She wore his ring. She shared his penthouse flat. She looked at Hitch and smiled thinly, wetting her lips slightly with the tip of her tongue. The gesture was provocative and he knew it. Little slag. Beneath the table, his fists were clenched."
FIC FIC-H9D-001 8.71 "THE NEW GENERATION Viola Machin, seated in her bay window, watched from under hooded lids the approach of her daughter-in-law through the wall gate and up the garden path. Her elder son's wife was a long-standing irritant, like an ill-perforated toilet roll. She'd never known a woman, she thought to herself, who dressed so conventionally, whose face was more boringly nondescript, whose hairdresser performed such miracles of dreariness. She's the most uninteresting person I know, she said to herself, with considerable satisfaction. ‘Hello, Mother,’ said Margaret Seymour-Strachey. ‘Hello, Margaret,’ said Viola with a sigh. She seemed bored already by the visit. ‘Desmond is parking the car,’ said Margaret brightly. ‘So I imagined,’ said Viola. She made no further efforts at conversation. She wondered why her daughter-in-law bothered to continue her visits. She had made her attitude clear enough to her, heaven knows, but here she was, still coming back every other Sunday, year after year, as welcome as the Irish potato blight. She's really pleased to see us, thought Margaret Seymour-Strachey, but she's too proud to show it, poor old thing. On the entry of her son Desmond, Viola Machin brightened up ostentatiously. He was not her favourite son, but he was something. Thank God she'd only had  sons. She always preferred men in the house. Poor old Hilda — lost out there, as in everything else! She bustled round, putting on kettles and opening tins of biscuits and cake. Desmond Seymour-Strachey sat, accepting the bustle, as was his wont. In his early forties, with a hawklike profile, he was good-looking enough, yet in a voracious, untrustworthy style that warned people off, and injured him in his business. He was something in insurance. ‘Not long to the big day now, Mother,’ he said. ‘Publication day?’ said Viola Machin, standing back to survey a groaning cake-stand. ‘No, not long. They've brought it forward a little, so that it comes out in the last week of April — after the newspaper pieces. Two and a half weeks to go.’ ‘Perhaps you could have a little party on the big day,’ said Margaret brightly. ‘I had thought,’ said Viola, splendidly aloof, ‘of having a large one.’ It was in fact the first time she had thought of such a thing, and it did not seem to be a very good idea, but nothing irritated her more than being addressed in that Listen With Mother voice (particularly as her daughter-in-law spoke to her children quite normally) and it goaded her to contrariness. ‘Wouldn't it tire you?’ said Desmond quickly. And getting no response from Viola, who continued fussing over the teapot, he added, more directly: ‘It would be silly to blue the profits before they've even begun to come in.’ ‘Yes,’ chimed in his wife, who had sworn to love, honour and echo, ‘save it all up into a nice little nest egg.’ Viola Machin, feeling herself once more subject to a process of diminution, said loftily: ‘It will not be a small nest egg.’ She kicked herself as soon as she had said it. She had a pretty shrewd idea that Desmond had only the haziest notion of how much could be expected from the various books, and she had intended to keep it that way. As soon as Desmond's bony nose sniffed money, trouble could be expected. He had left school at sixteen to make money. Failing that he had married money (little though one would think it, mused Viola, to look at her) and now that much of that was gone on an over-large house, over-large cars, and over-large meals, Desmond was back in the market-place, avid for a quick kill. To give him his due, he made no attempt to hide this consuming interest of his: it would have seemed pointless, for he assumed that everyone else was similarly obsessed, and would see through his attempts at concealment. Now that Viola had let the cat out of the bag, she felt she had no option but to come clean. ‘I expect to make a lot of money,’ she said coolly, sitting down to pour. Her manner said that this was a thing of great indifference to her, but that she was just setting the record straight. ‘With all this publicity, Jackson's is expecting The Factory Whistle to do very well. And they think the new one will be a best-seller. It should bring in a great deal of money.’ ‘He never made much out of them before,’ said Desmond, sceptically, but with hope. ‘Your stepfather was ahead of his time,’ said Viola, with a romantic sigh. ‘Anyway, they were published by Mattlock's, who had no more business sense than a rabbit. Thank goodness we're not in their hands any more. Jackson's has bought the rights, and Jackson's could make a Coptic dictionary into a best-seller if they tried. Things are going to be very different in the future, I assure you.’ She handed Desmond his tea, and allowed her daughter-in-law to fetch her own. Then she went on, with considerable pleasure and anticipation in her voice: ‘The American rights to the new one have been sold, and so have the English paperback rights — for a very large sum. The Times is putting one of the short stories into their Saturday Review. There is talk of a film of The Factory  Whistle, with Alan Bates, and they are going to read it on the BBC too. There will be a lot of money…’ She paused dramatically. ‘All of it, I shall keep control of. Do I make myself clear? I shall use it, or not use it, as I think fit.’ ‘Of course, Mother,’ said Desmond, smiling unpleasantly. ‘Naturally, Mother dear,’ said Margaret sweetly. ‘Nobody would think of trying to dictate to you.’ Desmond stirred his tea and ate a biscuit. There didn't seem anything to say: even Margaret was nonplussed, and the air of the room was musty with unspoken thoughts. And the unspoken thoughts were all about money. At last, just to hear his own voice, Desmond said: ‘Funny, I never could imagine Walter Machin writing books, let alone good ones.’ It was not a tactful remark. ‘You didn't know him,’ said his mother contemptuously. ‘I knew him well enough,’ said Desmond, on the defensive. ‘I was nearly ten when you married him, remember.’ ‘Ten!’ said Viola Machin. ‘I knew him better than I knew my own father, anyway.’ ‘Obviously, since you never saw your own father after the age of six. Except that— I gather — you have been renewing the acquaintanceship recently.’ ‘That's right,’ said Desmond, not apparently ashamed, but not pursuing the subject. ‘But old Walter, he was such a jolly soul-so bright, and loud, and down-to-earth, so much the life and soul of the party. Not at all my idea of a writer.’ ‘I believe Charles Dickens was generally considered a very lively companion,’ said Viola, at her most distant. She laid her cup on the table, and leaned back in her chair, her statuesque pose accentuated by the classic fawn dress and the dark green scarf around her throat. She closed her  eyes theatrically, and resembled nothing so much as a reigning prima donna who is being pestered by her producer to act. Margaret Seymour-Strachey, sensing the royal displeasure, hastened to undo the mischief. ‘Of course your mother is quite right,’ she said, with her cranked-up cheerfulness. ‘Writers come in all shapes and sizes. I've met lots at the Blackburn Literary Club. Some of them seemed really perfectly ordinary!’ ‘No doubt,’ said Viola, opening her eyes a fraction to peer malevolently from under the slits. ‘These days the world is full of perfectly ordinary writers. But Walter Machin was not ordinary though he was funny, and lively, and good company — as well as being a great and shamefully neglected novelist.’ ‘He was wonderful with his hands, too,’ said Desmond ingratiatingly. ‘Nothing was a problem to him, I remember. He could mend any broken toy, and make things too — I remember he made a great big rocking-horse for Hilary, and painted it in all sorts of marvellous colours. And he did wonderful things with my clockwork trains that I never thought of doing.’ ‘You're right, of course,’ said Viola, unfreezing a fraction. ‘He was the poet of work-that's what the man from the Sentinel called him. He was wonderful on things, on everyday smells and sounds, and what it felt like to work with your hands. He could make you feel machinery. D.H. Lawrence couldn't make you feel that, because he'd never been a worker. But Walter had, and anyone who has read the books can feel it.’ Viola Machin looked even more aristocratic than usual as she expatiated on Walter Machin as working-class novelist. ‘Yes, that's the sort of thing I remember about him,’ said Desmond, adopting sycophancy as the easiest way out. ‘And the time when he was ill I hardly remember at all.’ ‘And yet he was up there for nearly a year,’ said Viola, casting eyes heavenwards again, like Mr Stiggins speaking of rum. ‘And we'd only had a few months of marriage.’ ‘But those must be the months I remember so well,’ said Desmond. ‘Though of course there was also that long leave he had towards the end of the war.’ There was a doom-laden pause, and Desmond became conscious he had said the wrong thing again. Viola fixed him with her most commanding stare: ‘Much better not to mention that,’ she said. Desmond looked nonplussed: ‘Oh yes of course, if you… I suppose our Hilda might…’ ‘Exactly. She might be hurt. It might get into the papers, and then she'd be down here knocking on my door and screaming blue murder. No — better not give her any excuse to make that sort of trouble. Much better forget it altogether.’ ‘How is our Hilda?’ asked Margaret Seymour-Strachey. All the children called her ‘our Hilda’, though in fact Desmond and Margaret had not spoken to her more than once or twice in their lives. ‘Well, I believe,’ said Viola, with her usual loftiness when that name was mentioned, ‘enjoying her little part in the great events. I had to convey to her a slight warning, though…’ ‘A warning?’ ‘With so many reporters around, I thought she might be tempted to rake up old scores. She's a loose-tongued, prattling creature, like most women of her class. I decided it was best to avoid trouble, rather than face it when it comes. I will not consent to be portrayed in the press as a superannuated scarlet woman!’ Unseen by Viola Machin, something very close to a smile wafted over her daughter-in-law's face. ‘And did she — heed the warning?’ asked Desmond. ‘I have reason to believe she saw the sense of it,’ said Viola. ‘I don't think we need anticipate any nonsense from that quarter.’ ‘You don't think it might have been better to let her have her say out,’ suggested Desmond, ‘and get it off her chest? Instead of trying to silence her?’ ‘Silence her!’ said Viola Machin, her cheeks puffing with annoyance. ‘What an extraordinary expression! Whatever could make you think I wanted to silence Hilda Machin? Even if I did, I don't see how I could silence her. Do you, Desmond?’ There was a long silence. The Sunday visit, frosty from the beginning, now seemed positively to crackle. ‘I saw Father on Wednesday,’ said Desmond finally, desperate for something to say. ‘Indeed? And how was he looking?’ ‘Wonderfully fit. He is awfully well preserved.’ ‘He would be. He always took very good care of himself.’ ‘From the look of you, Mother,’ said Desmond ingratiatingly, ‘most people would say you were pretty good at that yourself.’ ‘It is natural for a woman to take good care of herself,’ said Viola Machin, superbly secure in her right to generalize about women. ‘In a man it is mere effeminacy. I have no desire to see Gerald playing the handsome patriarch.’ ‘What a pity, Mother. I was rather wondering if we might not arrange a meeting. He said himself he was very keen to see you again.’ ‘Really?’ said Viola, her eyebrows flying theatrically up, though not with any apparent pleasure. ‘Whatever car. have put that notion into his head? Perhaps he wants to propose to me again.’ ‘Goodness, Mother,’ said Margaret Seymour-Strachey, ‘what can have given you that idea?’ ‘There are precedents.’ Margaret Seymour-Strachey's conventional bourgeois soul seemed shocked by the notion. Her husband merely said: ‘He didn't say anything about that. He seemed very comfortable.’ The possible implications of this last remark struck Desmond himself as he was making it, and they were certainly not lost on Viola, who compressed her lips together grimly. It seemed time to go. In perfect unison, based on long marital experience and an infinitesimal twitch of the eyebrows, Desmond and Margaret Seymour-Strachey rose from their chairs and began making the ritual noises. ‘Well, Mother, we'll see you in a fortnight's time.’ ‘Perhaps then,’ said Viola, whose lips were still set in a Gladstonian expression, ‘you will find it possible to bring my grandchildren along for me to have a look at.’ Margaret Seymour-Strachey (who prided herself on being the perfect daughter-in-law) would do anything for her husband's mother except bring her children into overmuch contact with her. She said: ‘We'll have to see, won't we? They are such buy little things at the weekends. Now, is there anything we can do for you?’ ‘Not that I know of,’ said Viola ungraciously. ‘I'm not a complete cripple yet. In any case, I imagine Hilary will be round tonight. He's always willing to turn his hand to anything.’ Normally Desmond was pleased to hear that his brother was doing his share of what he privately called ‘oldie watching’, but tonight he merely said ‘Good’, with a preoccupied expression on his face, and made for the hall. At the front door, as she watched them go down the garden path, with their jolly waves and their toothpaste smiles, Viola shouted: ‘And if you see that father of yours again, you can tell him it won't do. It won't do at all. Nothing to be gained by our meeting. I wouldn't make him comfortable at all!’ Driving home in the car, Desmond and Margaret had a frank and open discussion on the subject of the books, the money, and brother Hilary. Knowing nothing about the likely sums involved, or the intentions of Viola's younger son, the discussion was inconclusive, but as he stopped his  car outside its magnificent, unpaid-for garage, Desmond said: ‘I think I'd better keep an eye on young Hilary.’ And Margaret said: ‘I'm going to find out what a bestseller might bring in. Just for interest's sake.’ They smiled at each other in perfect understanding. Later that same evening, Hilda Machin and her daughter were playing Scrabble by the window of Hilda's first-floor sitting-room, when the garden gate into the street opened and admitted a square, ruddy, grinning man of thirty-five or so, swinging in his large hand an unwrapped bottle of something. ‘Hilary too,’ said Hilda. ‘Madam's getting popular in her old age. Or is it the vultures gathering?’ ‘Hilary's not like that,’ said Rose, struggling with a handful of vowels, but watching him from the corner of her eye as he made his way nonchalantly up the path. Later in the evening the sound of loud laughter wafted up through the open window, and even snatches of a song. The evening visit of Hilary Seymour-Strachey seemed to have taken on a very different character to the afternoon one of his brother and sister-in-law. ‘Typical Hilary,’ said Rose, listening abstractedly. ‘He really is nice.’ Her mother looked up from her letters, and gazed hard at her daughter. Another great gust of delighted laughter came from downstairs. ‘Oh yes, there's a lot of Walter in young Hilary,’ said Hilda quietly. By the time her daughter caught the impact of the words, Hilda was intently laying her word out on the board."
FIC FIC-J10-004 9.81 "CHAPTER 4 ‘No problem?’ said Zeinab, outraged. ‘The girl is dead, isn't she?’ ‘We can't be sure of that,’ said Owen cautiously. ‘No? You think she jumped off the top of that boat and swam to the shore?’ ‘Well, in principle she could have done —’ ‘Egyptian girls,’ said Zeinab haughtily, ‘do not swim.’ Owen was beginning to wish he hadn't told her. ‘In any case,’ he said, ‘Narouz is wrong. Just because there isn't a body, that doesn't mean there couldn't be a case. A potential crime has been reported. The report itself is sufficient to trigger things. An investigation has been started and it will continue until, well, the file is closed. It has become a bureaucratic matter now.’ ‘There are times,’ said Zeinab, ‘when you sound boringly cold-blooded.’ ‘The investigation will continue,’ Owen contented himself with saying. ‘Oh, good.’ Zeinab brooded a while. Then she said, ‘It will continue, yes, but will it get anywhere?’ ‘We've only just started,’ said Owen defensively. ‘You haven't got very far yet,’ Zeinab pointed out. ‘It's a difficult case.’ ‘That is because you started in the wrong place. With the body, not with Leila.’ ‘We don't know anything about Leila yet.’ ‘That's just what I'm saying. You ought to find out about  her. What sort of girl she was, how she came to do something like this —’ ‘Something like what?’ asked Owen, exasperated. ‘It's not what she's done, it's what's been done to her.’ ‘How did she come to be on the dahabeeyah?’ demanded Zeinab. ‘That's not a thing a normal Egyptian girl would have done. Even I wouldn't have done a thing like that!’ ‘We'll try to find out. We arc trying to find out. Only —’ ‘What was the name of that play?’ demanded Zeinab, disregarding his patter. ‘The one Narouz met her at?’ ‘NewRoses in the Garden. Pretty dreadful, too, according to Narouz.’ ‘But I know that play,’ said Zeinab. ‘It's Gamal's latest. We received an invitation.’ ‘Did we?’ ‘Yes. You didn't go.’ Owen enjoyed Zeinab's artistic friends. And he liked Gamal, whose acquaintance he had first made when working on one of his earliest cases as Mamur Zapt. At the time Gamal had written a number of plays but none of them had yet actually been produced. Since then several had reached the boards. The audiences, though, had been confined to the especially perceptive. ‘It would have been the opening night,’ said Zeinab. ‘I couldn't go, so I went to the second night. You couldn't go either. You were down in Minya Province running after that gipsy girl.’ ‘No I wasn't!’ This was an old charge. Quite unjustified. ‘While I was left in Cairo. Alone,’ said Zeinab, unforgiving. ‘This is beside the point.’ ‘No it isn't. Because if you had not been down in Minya chasing that gipsy woman you would have been at the   theatre. And then you would have met Leila. So,’ said Zeinab, ‘it's all your fault.’ Owen was silenced for a moment. Then he recovered. ‘So it is. You're right. If I had not been chasing that gipsy woman I could have gone to the party and chased Leila.’ ‘You will not deflect me,’ said Zeinab, ‘with your perverse remarks. I intend to find out whether she was there that night and who Leila was.’ Mahmoud, adopting more orthodox procedures, was also trying to establish Leila's identity. ‘So,’ he was saying to the Prince's chauffeur as Owen arrived, ‘you picked the two girls up from the salon and took them to the river at Beni Suef?’ ‘If that's what they say, yes.’ ‘It's not what they say, it's what you say,’ said Mahmoud sternly. The man shrugged, confident in the power of the Prince to protect, at least against the Parquet. A confidence which Mahmoud had anticipated and which he had invited Owen along to undermine. ‘This is the Mamur Zapt,’ he said. ‘Be careful how you answer.’ The man flinched slightly. ‘I shall answer as I please,’ he said, but less boldly. Something of the Mamur Zapt's old aura still clung to the post. To it was added a certain unpredictability these days because of its British incumbency. ‘You picked the two girls up?’ Mahmoud repeated. ‘Yes.’ ‘That is better. And now you are speaking with your own voice. Let us keep it that way. You took them to the river at Beni Suef?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Good. And there you waited till the dahabeeyah came in. At which point you put the women on board. Yes?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘But,’ pursued Mahmoud, ‘there were three women, were there not?’ ‘If you say so.’ ‘I would like to hear you say so. With your own voice.’ ‘Three women, then,’ said the chauffeur. ‘So where did this other woman come from?’ The man hesitated. ‘Tell us the truth,’ said Owen, speaking for the first time. ‘And remember that we may already know it. Remember, too, that we do not have to ask you here. I may take you back to the Bab el Khalk and ask you.’ ‘I picked her up too,’ said the chauffeur. ‘Of course. And where did you pick her up? Not from the salon, was it?’ ‘No. I had picked her up first, before going to the salon. She was waiting for me.’ ‘And waiting for you where?’ ‘I was to pick her up by the Souk Al-Gadira.’ ‘By the Souk Al-Gadira? Did you not pick her up from a house?’ ‘No, effendi —’ the chauffeur was being polite now —‘the souk there is where four roads meet. The streets are narrow and twist and turn and it is not advisable to take a car up them. Not a car like this one.’ There was a note of reverence in the chauffeur's voice. All the time he talked he kept his hand on the bonnet, partly for reassurance — he was less confident than he seemed — and partly as a caress. ‘So where did you meet?’ ‘At the junction of the Sharia el Garb with the Sharia el Hakim. I was told she would be waiting for me.’ ‘Who told you?’ The chauffeur looked very unhappy. ‘Effendi,’ he whispered, ‘I — I do not think I should say.’ The Prince, then. ‘Had you been to the spot before?’ Eventually they brought him to admit that he had either collected the girl from or returned the girl to the spot on several occasions over the last two months. ‘And did you ever go with the girl to her house? Think before you speak.’ Never. The chauffeur swore on the Book. He had always delivered her to the same spot. Always. He had stayed in the car. She had never asked him to accompany her home. He would have been reluctant to accede if she had. Who knew what might befall the car if left unattended? ‘Effendi,’ said the chauffeur earnestly, ‘there are bad men abroad.’ Worse; there were small boys. It was clear that, for the chauffeur at least, cars had priority over women. The chauffeur, then, had no idea where the girl lived? He had not. He was prepared to swear it on the Book. Nevertheless, Owen thought he might be speaking the truth. Mahmoud tried one last way. Had the chauffeur ever picked up the Prince from the neighbourhood? Or delivered him to a house in that vicinity? He stopped the chauffeur wearily before he got to the Book. Owen went down to the souk himself. The man he was looking for, a Greek, was sitting at a table outside a cafe, deep in conversation with three Arabs. From time to time, almost absent-mindedly, he reached into his pocket and produced a sweet, which he gave to any small boy who happened to be near. There were, naturally, quite a lot of small boys near. The Greek was deep in a dramatic tale of misadventure. ‘And then, by God, it pulled out to miss a donkey and I looked, lo, and it was coming straight towards me! I threw myself against the wall and prayed. And God must have heard my prayers, for it passed by me leaving me unharmed.’ ‘God is great!’ said the rapt audience. ‘Unharmed,’ said the Greek, ‘but not untouched. For as  it passed, it reached out and caught my sleeve and rent it. And I stumbled and would have fallen had it not been for the wall.’ ‘God is indeed merciful!’ ‘He is indeed!’ agreed the Greek. ‘Such things ought not to be,’ said one of his hearers. ‘That is true. And do you know what I believe to be at the root of the problem?’ His listeners shook their heads. ‘Speed,’ declared the Greek. ‘That's what it is. People are trying to go too fast.’ ‘True. Oh, very true.’ ‘It is the curse of the age.’ ‘What is wrong with donkeys?’ asked one of the men. ‘That's what I say. God put man in the world. He put donkeys in the world. But he did not put cars!’ ‘That is true,’ said his hearers, impressed. They volunteered their own embroiderings of the theme. The Greek could not, however, put the incident out of his mind. ‘It was a mighty car,’ he said, ‘and painted green.’ ‘Green?’ said one of the small boys, all of whom had been following the conversation as closely as the men. ‘Yes. And that is not right, either. For green is the colour of the Prophet and —’ The small boy, however, was not interested. ‘I have seen a green car,’ he said. ‘ft comes down here.’ ‘What sort of car?’ The boy described it. ‘The very car!’ declared the Greek. He slipped the boy two large boiled sweets and turned to his friends across the table. ‘Be warned!’ he said. ‘Lest you, too, be crushed and defiled! Guard your footsteps! Look over your shoulder!’ Etcetera, etcetera. His hearers enjoyed every minute of it. Cairenes liked a good alarm. The Greek, satisfied with the effect of his story, rose from  his seat, shook hands all round and prepared to depart. At the last moment he caught sight of Owen, who had taken up position at an adjoining table, and raised hands to heaven. ‘My friend!’ he declared. ‘And I had not seen you!’ Owen rose to greet him and they embraced like long-lost brothers. The Greek was persuaded — needed no persuasion, really — to sit down. More coffee was called for. The Greek's friends at his previous table watched benignly; and the phalanx of small boys switched support. The Greek continued to feed them with sweets. And then, after he and Owen had been talking for some while, he crooked his finger and called over the boy who had seen ‘My friend has an interest in our car,’ he said. The small boy swelled with the pride of implied shared possession. ‘It is a good car,’ he said. ‘Sadly, though — and this is the way of the world as you will find out when you grow up — my friend is less interested in the car itself than in some of the people it carries. One in particular.’ He winked at the boy. ‘Did not the car, when it stopped here, pick up a fine young woman?’ ‘I don't know about fine,’ said the boy. ‘It picked up Leila.’ ‘There!’ said the Greek to Owen. ‘I knew it! And he even knows her name!’ ‘Leila Sekhmet,’ said the boy. ‘And she lives near here?’ ‘Just up the street.’ ‘Show me the house,’ said the Greek, ‘and if it should happen that on the way we meet a sweet-seller…’ It did so happen. The Greek purchased a bag of sweets, well, not so much a bag as a twist of newspaper, distributed some of the sweets among his retinue of small boys and gave the rest to his guide. ‘It may be that future conversation could benefit us both,’ he said. The boy led them up one of the dark streets to a place  where the houses were tall and thin and so closely packed together that door followed immediately upon door. He stopped outside one of these. ‘Leila lives here?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Who does the house belong to?’ ‘Mrs Rabaq.’ ‘And who is Mrs Rabaq?’ ‘Leila's aunt.’ The Greek knocked on the door. After some moments it was opened by an elderly woman servant. ‘Please announce me to Mrs Rabaq,’ said the Greek. ‘Tell her we come about Leila.’ The woman stood still. ‘Who are you?’ she said. ‘This is the Mamur Zapt,’ said the Greek, indicating Owen. The woman's eyes swept over him. ‘I shall not tell her that,’ she said. She stumped away. They heard her steps going up the stairs. It was a while before they returned. ‘She will see you.’ The woman hesitated. ‘She is very old,’ she said, ‘and no longer understands things clearly. But she will see you.’ The room was closely shuttered and very dark. The only light was from a dim kerosene lamp standing on a low table. There was a sofa in the middle of the room on which an old woman was sitting. She had pulled her veil right over her face so that they could not even see her eyes. ‘Leila is my niece,’ she said. ‘What has happened to her?’ She had spoken in Arabic and Owen replied in Arabic. He fell naturally into the courteous, familiar mode used to address the elderly. ‘We do not know that anything has happened to her, mother,’ he said. ‘But we fear.’ ‘I fear too,’ said the woman. ‘I always fear.’ ‘We fear that an accident may have befallen her.’ The woman drew her breath in sharply. Then she stood up. ‘I will go to her. Tell me where she is. I will go —’ She swayed and put out her hand. Owen caught her and eased her gently back on to the sofa. ‘When the time comes, mother,’ he said soothingly. ‘If it comes. But it has not come yet. At the moment it is just that she is missing.’ ‘She is always missing,’ said the old woman querulously. ‘It is not right. She comes and goes as she pleases. My sister's daughter. We were never like that. Our father would never have allowed —’ She put her hand to her head. ‘Leila!’ she said and burst into tears. The servant, who had followed them into the room, put her arms round her and comforted her. ‘It is time you went to bed,’ she said. She helped the old woman up and led her across the room. At the door the old woman shook herself free. ‘Wait!’ she said. ‘Who are these men, Khadija? Why are they here?’ ‘It is nothing, mother,’ said the servant. ‘Come!’ She led her out through the door. ‘Do not go,’ she said over her shoulder to Owen and the Greek. ‘I will come down shortly.’ They waited quietly. The furniture was old, the furnishings sparse. They heard the servant returning. She went on past the door of the room. When she came back it was with a tray, coffee-cups and sugar. ‘Be seated.’ She came back again, this time with a brazier and coffee-pot. She stirred the ashes and placed the coffee-pot in the middle. ‘That is proper,’ she said with satisfaction. ‘That is the way it used to be.’ She poured them some coffee. ‘So,’ she said to Owen, ‘you're the Mamur Zapt, are you?’ ‘That is so, mother.’ He addressed her in the same way as he had her mistress, with the deference due to age. ‘What has she done wrong?’ ‘Leila? I do not know that she has done anything wrong. Except, perhaps, that she has stayed out too late at night.’ ‘She has certainly done that. But does the Mamur Zapt interest himself in things like that?’ ‘I think she is dead. And the Mamur Zapt does interest himself in things like that.’ The woman had not bothered to pull her veil across her face. She stared at Owen with large, unblinking eyes. ‘How did she die?’ ‘I think she may have drowned.’ ‘Drowned? How could she have drowned?’ ‘She was on the river. In a dahabeeyah.’ ‘I do not understand. How could she have been on the river? In a dahabeeyah?’ ‘Did you know nothing of it?’ ‘Nothing.’ ‘Nor who she was with?’ The woman gave a little hard laugh. ‘It is that, is it? No,’ she said, ‘no. No, she never told me. And I thought it best not to ask.’ ‘You did not approve?’ ‘How could I ? It was wrong to leave her family in the first place, wrong, having come here to go on leading the life she did.’ ‘What sort of life was that?’ ‘When she was a child she was a pretty little thing. Her father doted on her. We all did. 1, her mother. The only child, although a girl child. Her father took her with us when we went to France. And that was a big mistake, for there she saw and was seen.’ Among the men she was seen by was a young man from  another rich Alexandrian family and when they all returned to Egypt he somehow succeeded in gaining access to her. ‘He said to her: ‘Let us be free, as the young in France are free.’ And she was thrilled by that, for she found it hard to come back to a woman's life in Egypt after tasting life in France. Before, she knew no better. Now, she wanted holiday all the time.’ The young man's intentions had been honourable and he had asked his father to obtain her as a bride. His father, however, had had other ideas. Perhaps Leila's family had not been quite good enough for him. Perhaps it was just that he had already made other plans. Marriages in middle-class Egyptian families were made by the father, usually without reference to the son or daughter, and sometimes without even reference to the mother. Anyway, the boy's 6ther had refused. Leila's father had somehow got to hear of it and in her case, of course, the consequences were worse. Her father, lax before, now kept her immured. She was not even allowed to receive female visitors. Leila had both pined and rebelled. Somehow she again made contact with the young man. And one night they had eloped. ‘What happened next I do not know,’ said the servant, ‘but a year later she came to our house here and threw herself into the mistress's arms and begged her to take her in. Of course she said yes. Leila was her sister's child. Besides, she had none of her own and Leila had always been a favourite. And I thought at first that it was good, because my mistress had lost her interest in life and I thought this might renew it.’ She lifted the pot, stirred the ashes and then replaced it. The action seemed to break her train of thought, for afterwards she did not resume speaking, seemed to forget she had been speaking and sat waiting passively. Owen realized suddenly that like her mistress she was old. ‘You thought that at first,’ he prompted gently, ‘but afterwards you changed your mind?’ She came back with a start. ‘Not at first. She was so glad to be with us and we were so glad to have her. The mistress fussed over her — still does — and they were like mother and daughter. And Leila needed a mother. But then —’ She broke off. ‘Then?’ Owen prompted softly. ‘The mistress became — as she is now. Leila nursed her tenderly. But as the months went by she became restless. She was a young woman now and needed more. She needed a man. She started to go out.’ ‘She had friends?’ ‘Yes. Some she had met — when she was with him. I do not know what sort of friends they were that they would let a young woman come to them on her own! But soon she was always with them.’ ‘Nights?’ ‘No,’ said the woman. ‘Well, once or twice, perhaps. She said she had been to the theatre and that afterwards they had talked late. I did not press. I did not want to know. The theatre!’ She shuddered. ‘What sort of place is that for a woman to go to? If that was the sort of friends they were —!’ ‘Did she tell you any of their names?’ ‘No.’ Owen thought. ‘I would like to see her room. Perhaps she kept names, addresses.’ The woman hesitated uncertainly. ‘Are you married?’ she asked suddenly. ‘Me? No.’ ‘It would not be proper.’ ‘How about him?’ said Owen, indicating the Greek. ‘He is married.’ The woman surveyed the Greek closely. ‘Yes,’ she said, ‘I can see that. How many wives have you got?’ she asked with interest. ‘One,’ said the Greek. ‘That is more than enough.’ The woman cackled. ‘She keeps you on a tight rein, does she? That is proper,’ she said approvingly. ‘Very well,’ she said, ‘I will show you her room.’ Owen, alone in the room, poured himself some more coffee. There was an old shira carpet on the wall, very faded, an old, full-length, incredibly elaborate mirror, some old pots, Persian boxes. No money in the house now, he thought, but money in the past. He wondered about Leila's family. Georgiades came back shaking his head. Owen stood up. ‘Thank you,’ he said to the old servant woman. ‘You have been very helpful. There is just one thing more: I feel I should tell Leila's parents. Can you give me their names and tell me where I might find them?’ The woman stood very still. ‘She is dead to them already,’ she said bitterly. ‘Why do you bring a dead body back from the grave?’ Since he was in the area, Owen decided he would go down to the river and take another look at the shoal on which Leila's body had come to rest. His way took him past the local police station. Sitting on the ground in front of it were the two constables who had delayed him at the dovecot during the arms search. They greeted him cheerfully. ‘Hello,’ they said. ‘Any nearer finding that body?’ ‘Yes,’ said Owen. ‘I'm nearer.’ ‘Good. Tell us when you find it.’ ‘Don't worry,’ said Owen. ‘I will.’ He would, too, he promised himself. He was sure they knew something, some trick that that idle, rascally District Chief had been up to. There had been something they'd said. What was it? And then he stopped in his tracks, turned and made his way in a quite different direction. He found the watchman asleep under a tree, his legs curled up under him as they had been when he had pantomimed the way he had found the body, his turban neatly parked beside him. Owen stirred him gently with his foot. The man's eyes opened. ‘Effendi!’ he said in alarm, scrambling to his feet. ‘I am sorry to disturb you, Abu,’ said Owen, ‘but there are things I would know.’ ‘I will help you if I can,’ the man said doubtfully, ‘but I have told you all I know.’ ‘Not quite all. Let us go back to the moment you found the body, the moment you realized that it was a body. What did you do?’ ‘I went to the Chief to report it.’ ‘This was at the police station, was it?’ ‘Yes, effendi.’ ‘Was he alone?’ ‘No, effendi. Fazal was with him. Fazal had just come in and they were talking. They were talking —’ Abu lowered his eyes bashfully —‘about you, effendi.’ ‘About me?’ ‘Yes, effendi. Fazal said that you had met up with the men and had started work. And the Chief said: ‘Already? Before God, they must have little work to do.’ That is what he said, effendi.’ ‘Did he?’ said Owen grimly. ‘It is all the same with these great people — this is what he said, effendi. They have nothing better to do than go down and make a nuisance of themselves to people who are peacefully going about their own affairs. That is what he said.’ ‘Really?’ ‘Yes. And then he turned on me and shouted: ‘And here is another! What have you brought me to spoil my day, Abu?’ And I told him, and he said: ‘What do I care about  bodies? Let it lie there.’ And Fazal said: ‘You had better not do that if the Mamur Zapt is about.’ And the Chief said: ‘That is true, Fazal.’ And he thought, and then he said: ‘I know what we will do, Fazal. You go and tell the Mamur Zapt that there is urgent business at the river. Let him see to it.’ And then he laughed and said: ‘This is the way to do it, Fazal. Let us get the great working for us for a change.’’ ‘Thank you,’ said Owen. ‘Very interesting.’ ‘That was good, wasn't it, effendi?’ said Abu happily. ‘To have you working for him and not the other way round.’ ‘Oh, very good. So Fazal went off to fetch me. And then what?’ ‘Then the Chief picked up the phone and said to me: ‘And while we are at it, let us get those other idle bastards off their backsides.’ Pardon, effendi, that is what he said.’ ‘Go on. Who did he phone?’ ‘The Parquet, I think. And one other. And then he said to me: ‘Push off, Abu! Get back to the river lest the Mamur Zapt come and find no one there.’ So I went.’ ‘What about Ibrahim? Was he sent with you?’ ‘Yes, effendi. The Chief put his head out of the office and called for him and said: ‘Go with Abu. There is a body. You know what to do.’ ‘Yes,’ said Ibrahim, ‘I know what to do.’ And so we went together.’ ‘That,’ said Owen, ‘is most interesting.’ ‘Is it, effendi?’ said Abu, greatly gratified. ‘Yes. But still puzzling. Tell me, Abu: you went to the river together?’ ‘Yes, effendi.’ ‘That is what I find puzzling. Are you sure?’ ‘Yes, effendi.’ ‘All the way? Together?’ ‘Yes, effendi. Well, Ibrahim asked me to call in at Mohammed Fingari's to get a package for him. And that was strange because Mohammed said: ‘What package is this?’ And I said —'  ‘OK, OK,’ said Owen. ‘I get the idea. You went in to get the package while Ibrahim went on to the river — was that it?’ ‘Yes, effendi.’ ‘So you joined him there?’ ‘Yes, effendi. And he chided me, saying: ‘Where have you been, Abu? What if the Mamur Zapt had come in your absence?’ And I said: ‘It is not my fault, Ibrahim. You —’’ ‘Thank you. Thank you. I understand. So in fact Ibrahim arrived at the river first?’ ‘Yes, effendi.’ ‘Alone?’ ‘Yes, effendi. Until I got there. Which wasn't long, effendi, really. I swear it. It was just that —’ ‘Thank you. You have told me what I wished to know.’ ‘I have?’ ‘Yes. And now we will go to the Chief.’ Abu fell in beside him. He was clearly, however, turning things over in his mind. ‘Effendi,’ he said diffidently. ‘Yes?’ ‘If I have said anything untoward, the Chief will beat me.’ ‘If what you have told me is true, it will be the Chief who is beaten.’ ‘So tell me, Ibrahim, what happened when you and Abu went down to the river?’ The constable scratched his head. ‘What happened? Nothing happened. When we got there, the body wasn't there. If it ever had been there.’ ‘You went to the river together?’ ‘Indeed.’ ‘All the way — together?’ ‘Yes. More or less.’ ‘You did not go on ahead?’ ‘No, effendi. Well, if I did, that was because Abu took so long. Yes, I remember, effendi.’ He turned to Owen, ‘I waited, but that foolish fellow took so long — having a cup of tea, no doubt— that I was worried lest you come and find the corpse unattended, so I hurried on.’ ‘Alone?’ ‘Well, yes, alone.’ ‘And what did you do when you came to the river?’ ‘To the river? Nothing. I waited for Abu. It was but a minute, effendi. And then you came.’ ‘You weren't there long?’ ‘No, effendi.’ ‘But long enough to fetch the pole?’ Ibrahim's jaw dropped. ‘Pole?’ he said. ‘That's what you use, isn't it? To push the bodies off? So that they float down to the next district and you don't have to report them?’ The Chief had gone pale. ‘That is correct, isn't it?’ Owen addressed him. ‘That is the usual practice, is it not?’ The Chief found it hard to speak. ‘Sometimes,’ he said at last. ‘Only this time it was a mistake. For you had already summoned me. And notified the Parquet. You did not mean it to happen this time. Only Ibrahim misunderstood you. ‘You know what to do,’ you said to him. And he thought he knew what that meant.’ The corporal shot the Chief an agonized glance. ‘So he got rid of Abu and hurried on ahead. And when he got to the river he took the pole — and he pushed the body off! ‘Effendi —’ ‘That is what happened, didn't it?’ ‘Effendi —’ ‘This time,’ said Owen, ‘you had better speak the truth.’ ‘Effendi,’ said Ibrahim desperately, ‘that is what would have happened if —’ ‘Yes?’ ‘If the body had been there!’"
NWS NWS-A1X-001 3.91 "Health: Lively young woman seeks normal life: Elaine Heath, who is severely paralysed, tells Cherrill Hicks of the daily constraints she faces By CHERRILL HICKS ELAINE HEATH likes pink eye glitter and a vodka and orange before lunch. She reads Lenin, Lawrence and supports CND. Elaine is also severely disabled by cerebral palsy: she can use neither her arms nor legs, and she can only communicate by making noises, or by operating an electric typewriter with her nose. In spite of her disability, Elaine has in the past led a remarkably active and normal life. She has been through a marriage, a divorce, and a serious love affair; learnt Russian, written regularly for a local paper and taught a young child disabled by a stroke to read again. But Elaine no longer has a close relationship to give her the support she needs. Without it, she has become a virtual prisoner in her own home; she is ruled by the clock and the hours worked by her local authority helpers. Unable to go away for weekends or holidays, she never goes out at night to dinner parties, discos or evening classes. Her life has become intolerable, she says, ever since she became a social services ‘project’. In the mornings Elaine cannot get up before 9am — which is when her care assistant starts work. In the afternoons, she must always be home at 4.30 — so that the carer can take her to the lavatory before leaving for the day. (Even her bladder has to be regulated, she points out.) In the early evening, almost as soon as she finishes her meal, it is time to have her make-up taken off and her nightdress put on — before the nurse leaves. Elaine is excited that a reporter from The Independent is visiting. She laughs, shouts, refuses to give her age and is impatient to explain her problems. It takes time and effort for her to do this: constantly tapping her nose on the typewriter is exhausting, but then so is making her noises understood. We manage, with the help of Sylvia, her care assistant. Elaine gets a lot more help than many disabled people, and some would say she is lucky not to be in residential care. She lives in a large, sunny and specially adapted local authority bungalow in Northampton: the walls of the living room are decorated with her paintings (done when she still had some use of her right hand) and her kitchen cupboard is covered with postcards, love letters from old boyfriends and local newspaper articles. Sylvia comes from nine to five each weekday, and nurses are on duty between six and 10 every evening and for a few hours at the weekend. But Elaine says that despite this help, she might as well be in an institution. Her life is a monotonous routine. As long as she is ‘fed and watered’, she writes, the local authority is satisfied: ‘It has forgotten about the quality of my life.’ Unlike other single women, Elaine cannot stay out late at night: she has to be home in time to be put to bed by a nurse. She can never go out and meet men; and, after two close relationships, the prospect of staying single depresses her. ‘I desperately want to love and be loved,’ she types with her nose. ‘I'm terrified of growing old alone. Life is for sharing.’ Sylvia is one of the few people who has learnt to interpret Elaine's noises. She has never cared for a disabled person before, but there is a natural love and empathy between them: she hugs Elaine a lot and they are very close. ‘My old mum,’ Elaine calls her. ‘I would describe Elaine as beautiful with sexy legs,’ jokes Sylvia. And, more seriously: ‘I try to do things the way she wants. Staff who have worked in the homes become institutionalised; they say this is the way we've always done it. But if you employ someone in your house, you want them to do it your way, not theirs.’ The nurses who come in the evenings and at weekends are from an agency -which can mean, for Elaine, a new face every night of the week. Every new nurse needs detailed instructions about how to care for her — down to details such as pulling her bra on properly and making sure she is dry before getting her dressed. ‘Please treat me normally. I'm not daft. My brain is perfectly unimpaired,’ writes Elaine at the end of her list. The nurses are nice, well-intentioned young girls who do their best. But because they have to leave by 10pm, all they have time for are the basic tasks, such as cooking dinner, feeding Elaine, taking off her make-up and getting her ready for bed. Many of them are not used to disabled people, and, being temporary, they rarely get to know her anyway. ‘Elaine can't talk and that can be very disconcerting for the nurses,’ says Sylvia. Elaine interrupts. She does not need nurses in uniform, she almost shouts: just because she is disabled, it does not mean she is medically ill. There is no conversation with the nurses, she says. ‘My day ends at five. The shutters come down.’ When they leave, Elaine has no professional support until Sylvia comes in the morning. But for the help of a friend who sleeps in the bungalow at night, and who can help her go to the toilet if she needs to, she says she would have to go into a home. Elaine went into a home last week when Sylvia was on holiday. She says she would rather die than do that again. She may not have any speech, but she has no problems in making her feelings clear: she wails at the memory. Sylvia translates her noises: ‘It was hell on earth.’ The home had set times for the toilet: 9am, 3pm, and 9pm. ‘They had their own routine,’ says Sylvia. Life hasn't always been so dull for Elaine: she has managed, in the past, to survive the same upheavals as many able-bodied people. Sent away to boarding school when she was six (she rarely sees her family now), she got three A- levels at college and shortly after got married: a mistake, she now realises, but she was pregnant at the time. She lost the baby and she and her husband divorced three years later. It was then that she met ‘the love of my life’: he answered an ad she placed in the local paper for someone to read to her. ‘He was a middle-aged guy who thought he was coming to read to a sweet old lady,’ she writes. They fell in love; eventually he moved in. ‘My life was a dream.’ The relationship ended after five years: her lover grew too tired to cope with caring for her. He lives in the same town and it still hurts her to see him. For a while Elaine was cared for by young volunteers who used to come and stay with her for a few months at a time. But the volunteers moved on — to college or jobs — and she found the change unsettling. In 1986 she contacted her local authority for help; it was then, she says, that her life changed for the worse. Northampton social services department says the problem is one of finding and hiring the right quality people. ‘Northampton is an expanding area and wages for care assistants cannot match those to be found in industry,’ says Bill Aitken, the department's operations manager. He is clearly doing his best to make Elaine's life more bearable, to create the schemes and find the care assistants with the commitment needed to befriend her, on the funds available. Elaine desperately wants to be free: free to fall in love, work hard and have fun. All she is asking for, she says, is to live the same kind of life as everyone else. This would only be possible if she had intensive 24-hour cover: if she could employ carers both night and day who could be flexible enough to adapt to her needs rather than vice versa. ‘Perhaps I am being selfish,’ she writes. ‘But my life as it is now isn't worth living. It's a living death. I've already experienced a full life and now it's been taken away.’ Elaine is an extraordinary woman: clever, lively and capable of leading a full life. But she is rapidly growing demoralised by her situation and is increasingly disinclined to do very much. She has even given up her beloved Russian, learnt painstakingly with the help of an old Cyrillic typewriter. ‘She laughs a lot. She seems like a very happy person,’ says Sylvia. ‘But it's false — it hides a lot of sadness.’"
NWS NWS-A1X-002 3.77 "Health: Faith, courage, will — and a cancer therapy: The Gerson technique ended her marriage and took over her life, but Renee Henry believes it works. Liz Hunt reports By LIZ HUNT RENEE HENRY remembers quite clearly when she decided that she was going to live. It was a warm, sunny afternoon four years ago, and she was lying on her back in the park feeling too weak to move. She could hear her three- year-old son Rufus laughing as he played on the swings nearby. Her other son, Barnes, just six months old, was asleep in the pram beside her. ‘The thought of not being there for them as they grew up was too much to bear,’ she said. ‘I had to get well.’ Renee Henry was a ‘rare bird’, according to her surgeon. At the age of 33 she had breast cancer. But in the months following the diagnosis, Mrs Henry found that it was not only a life-threatening disease that she had to contend with. Her decision to refuse orthodox medical treatment and follow an ‘alternative’ regime — the Gerson therapy — provoked outrage and hostility from her husband, her family and her friends. ‘At a time when I needed all possible support, I was left alone,’ said Mrs Henry. Like most people who are told they have cancer, Renee Henry was, at first, in shock. She didn't think to question the treatment her doctors advocated -as a research biochemist who had worked in the pharmaceutical industry for 10 years, the benefits of modern medicine had been instilled in her. She underwent a lumpectomy and then a course of radiotherapy, and was due to start drug treatment when she met another cancer patient. This woman was 37 years old, and she too had had a lumpectomy and radiotherapy four years earlier. She had taken drugs ever since, but the cancer had returned. ‘When I heard that I went straight into the toilet and threw up. She was just like me, she had been told that her prognosis was good and yet here she was four years later. I didn't want to live with cancer hanging over me. I walked out of the hospital and didn't go back.’ Mrs Henry found out all she could about alternative cancer treatments and dabbled in some of them. ‘At this time, I was living in a sort of Walter Mitty world. I had a husband who was pretending that I did not have cancer, and a mother who tried to inspire me by showing me pictures of Page Three girls under banner headlines of ‘How I conquered cancer’. They were both trying to persuade me to continue with the radiotherapy and drugs.’ Mrs Henry embarked on a course in herbal medicine and it was during this that she heard about the Gerson therapy. She learnt that it had been developed in the 1920s by a German physician, Dr Max Gerson. He had suffered severe migraine which did not respond to conventional treatment. He had experimented with various foods and found that by restricting his diet to one of fresh fruits and vegetables he could control his migraine. Some of Dr Gerson's patients — including those with TB — tried the diet. Their health improved and a cure was claimed in many cases. More patients with various illnesses were put on the diet, and good results were reported. Dr Gerson became convinced that the treatment helped the body to heal itself, regardless of the nature of the disease. This diet now forms the basis of the Gerson Cancer Therapy. It claims to eliminate toxins from the body, to restore a normal potassium and sodium balance in cells (which is thought to be disturbed in cancer patients), to boost liver function (also affected by the disease) and to reactivate certain enzymes. The more Renee Henry learnt about the therapy, the more she became convinced that it was right for her. The therapy is a full-time occupation. It involves taking 13 juices every hour. They are freshly prepared from organic fruit and vegetables and consist of four carrot and apple juices, four green leaf juices, four juices extracted from calves' liver and one orange juice. Oats, salads and baked potatoes form the basis of three daily meals. Caffeine enemas are given four hourly, as well as castor oil — orally or by enema — to aid detoxification. At this point, the strain on Renee Henry's marriage became too much, and what had been a troubled relationship crumbled. ‘The day my husband left was the day I started Gerson in earnest. I went to a shop that sold organic food and bought everything.’ That was the start of the two most demanding years of her life. She had to commit herself totally to the therapy, while looking after two young children. Large quantities of organic food were not easy to come by in Surrey. ‘At night I would wrap the children in blankets, put them in the car, and drive down to New Covent Garden to collect the fruit and vegetables.’ She suffered chronic diarrhoea and vomiting as, she says, her body started to detoxify itself. ‘It was like having a severe bout of food poisoning that never got better,’ she recalled. ‘I developed chronic asthma and eczema and cold sores. And all the time, I was working away until midnight preparing the juices.’ Three months into the therapy she began to suffer severe psychological traumas — she says she was in a state of constant terror. This is the point at which many patients give up the therapy, said Mrs Henry. But she underwent counselling, and also received support from Sheila McLean, a Gerson therapist and former nurse. Today, Renee Henry is convinced that she is cured and that the Gerson therapy is responsible. She acknowledges that such a claim cannot be substantiated because she also received orthodox medical treatment. She refuses to undergo any medical checks because she ‘has no need of further proof’. Mrs Henry's encounter with cancer has, not surprisingly, changed her life. Next week is Europe Against Cancer Week, and she and Sheila Mclean are launching a charity called the Karnak Charitable Trust. It aims to make more information about Gerson available, fund research projects, and eventually it hopes to set up a centre for people who want to try it, in combination with psychological counselling, according to Renee Henry. ‘In fighting cancer, the most critical point is when you decide that you are going to survive. You need a focus for that desire to live, so you pick a therapy, orthodox or alternative, and you use it. But the most important thing is to believe that you will survive.’"
NWS NWS-A7Y-006 4.37 "What future for Britain's handicapped youth? Michele Hanson examines the problems imposed by budget cuts and staff shortages, and looks at the need for long-term strategies. And in the light of the recent Beverley Lewis tragedy, Adrienne Baker puts the case for self-help groups to relieve the isolation and enormous pressure felt by the mothers of handicapped children A special kind of need THE 1970 Education Act opened a new world of opportunity for children with mental and physical handicaps. It declared them educable, took them out of their own homes and hospitals and brought them into full-time schooling. Bright new facilities and therapies were provided, plus enlightened teaching and special care. In 1970 in one London borough alone, Islington, nine severely or profoundly handicapped children were born. They have had the benefit of such an education and now it is over or about to end, together with almost all paramedical help. At 19 these young people — and hundreds like them all over the country — are likely to be going home and staying there. It means, as one parent said, ‘19 years of hard work down the drain’. Education is statutory, but once it is over such youngsters are legally entitled to nothing. The Disabled Persons Act 1986 recommends, but does not legislate, that local authorities should define need and provide for it. Adequate provision will probably not be made for Jonathan Rixon, one of the Islington children. He has Seckels Syndrome, a rare disease that stunts growth. He is microcephalic, blind, has severe curvature of the spine, scoliosis, no speech, cannot walk and weighs 3 ½ stone. His knees frequently dislocate and he has a painful hiatus hernia which makes him scream. His mother Stephanie holds him, rubs him, talks to him, kisses him, stretches his body out over her knee — anything to relieve his discomfort. She must also change, bathe, feed, exercise, occupy, entertain and shave him. ‘It's not hard work,’ she says, ‘just constant.’ When Jonathan leaves school next year, this will be the pattern of their life. Stephanie cannot duplicate the essential therapies and stimulation the school provides. ‘What will happen to his small world when it all stops?’ she asks. ‘He'll just have me.’ Doctors say Jonathan will have a normal life-span and she is worried for the future and what will happen to him after her death. There are community therapists, but not enough to go around. They are poorly paid, mainly young and female, have little chance of career progression and no incentive to remain in the profession. Those available will be busy rehabilitating stroke patients, who take priority. Fears that handicapped youngsters will deteriorate are well founded. Ian Squires, severely autistic, returned to Islington in 1986 from a residential school where he'd been happy. He waited months for a day centre place; when he got one it was unsuitable and he refused to go. He became very fearful of cars, buses and stairs, eventually shutting himself in his room, with the curtains drawn, for 14 months. He began banging his head against the wall, vomiting up his food, lost a great deal of weight and was eventually taken to hospital. Islington's provision is better than most, yet the Director of Social Services, John Rea Price, feels Islington has been penalised for attempting to carry out the Government's own directives on community care. Rate capping has meant that for every ‘profligate’ pound spent on such provision, £6 has been taken away. Islington cannot even benefit from the ‘dowry’ system (money paid by a health authority to a local authority for each patient returning to the community from hospital) because their people never went to hospital. Many local authorities have had their budgets cut by reductions in central government They've been given better education and higher expectations, but no future. grants and now have a far greater shortfall of places than Islington. A white paper is expected at the end of this month in response to the Griffiths Report, which recommended that authorities be given greater responsibility for the mentally handicapped. ‘Unless Griffiths funding comes quickly to the rescue,’ says Rea Price, ‘there is no hope of extra resources.’ A recent (and the first) report by the Social Services Inspectorate on day services for the mentally handicapped finds much to criticise. It admits that funds are needed for training and basic equipment, and finds that the principles of community care have often not been fully understood. Few middle management have direct experience of the service, need has not been quantified nor fed through to planners, very few local authorities have involved parents, let alone clients. Staff feel undervalued and lack any sense of direction, joint philosophies between health and local authorities are rare, there are no long-term strategies to solve the problems and many centres are overcrowded, offering only shared, part-time places. Centres for the physically handicapped have traditionally taken the elderly, and youngsters finding themselves there after leaving school may feel their adult lives have ended rather than just begun. Mencap's Day Services campaign indicates that the most desperate need is for the severely handicapped and those with behavioural difficulties. For those with more moderate disabilities there are YTS schemes, but these are generalised, not geared to individual needs. The handicapped may be a minority group but it's a vast one — the last count, 10 years ago, totalled six million people with identified disabilities. A hidden and forgotten problem rather than a small one. ‘We're fighting a losing battle,’ says Richard Tomlinson, headmaster of the Thomas Delarue School for young people with cerebral palsy. ‘It's not a cohesive group and has no political edge. To get money you've got to present an image of disability that reinforces rather than changes the stereotype — flaxen-haired moppets in callipers. If you actually show people in much greater need, young adults, they're not so attractive. They might dribble. We're articulate enough to fool ourselves that we're nice people, but there's a strong undercurrent to our thinking that encourages us to view people with a disability as lesser, and until we come to terms with that, we will never have a proper support system. At present the whole thing is on guilt money: ‘I'm glad it's not my kids. Here's a fiver.’' The present situation reinforces his ideas. ‘No social services or Government department will deny that everyone is of equal value,’ says Mencap, ‘but the services don't support that. Even if people are unattractive, aggressive, distorted, vomit and bite, they still have rights.’ Things are, of course, better than they were. In a few areas great progress is being made. In Herefordshire, education, health, social services and voluntary groups are working together on a Lifestyles Project which enables students leaving college to have a life of their own within the community. The Spastics Society has begun Alternative Lifestyles courses for disabled school leavers, ‘providing positive alternatives to paid employment and giving them the confidence to take charge of their own lives’. The Open University has begun a new course for people with learning difficulties. Hopefully such ideas will spread to the rest of the community, but for the majority of this year's school leavers it will be too late. They've been given a better education, a longer and healthier life and higher expectations, but no future. LACK of communication is one of the saddest aspects of having a mentally handicapped child. As a social worker, I met family after family and the isolation that having a ‘special’ child brings was a common theme. The burden inevitably fell mainly on the mothers and it seemed that their loneliness could at least be lessened if they had a regular opportunity to share their experiences. The group began with mothers responding to my invitation and deciding tentatively whether there was ‘anything in it’ for them. Several women felt too vulnerable or exposed to remain; another left dramatically, announcing that her anger would destroy the group. The beginning was also a time when I was asked if I, too, would soon let them down ‘like all the others’ and when being there was expressed for all by Janet: ‘I'm only here because my daughter is the way she is. I'd rather not be here.’ Or by Shirley, who cried soundlessly and then protested: ‘I'm not crying for myself; I'm crying for the others.’ Gradually trust developed and themes emerged: sadness, ‘A grief with no end’; anger, ‘Why did it happen to me?’; and frustration with the professionals who could not fully understand their plight. The subjective experiences of these mothers became the maintheme; for example, how rejected they felt by friends or neighbours who crossed the street, not knowing what to say. They talked of their husbands' preoccupation with work, of their normal children's too-early maturing, of integrated and special schools, and of eating — the hoped-for miracle diet for their child or, often, the consolation they found in food. These mothers had built a cocoon around themselves and their handicapped child which, while keeping away the hurtful comments, wrapped them in with their pain. Then, one week, the quietest woman in the group said: ‘This is the only place where I can afford to be honest,’ and somehow it seemed the healing process had begun. Leora personified the courage: I remember her trying to calm her screaming autistic son, taking him in her arms, rocking him, comforting him, until at last he became tranquil and quiet and she was left with his violence in her. THEY were brave women and often poetic. Zena, a sculptress, took on the responsibility of caring for her Down's Syndrome grand-daughter when the mother ‘upped and offed’. She described how she walked around for months ‘with a pain, almost a physical pain, in my heart’; of how she avoided friends and pulled her hat over her face if she met them in the street; of how, at last, she knew she must express her thousand emotions about her little grandchild in the way she knew best, in clay. And when she took this most precious creation to art school, the teacher said: ‘Zena, why didn't you tell us?’ Then she could cry and let people comfort her. Jean described a trip to the park. While she queued for coffee, her friend held the handicapped child and Jean ‘made believe she wasn't mine.’ The sadness came out week by week and we confronted it. Incredibly, there was laughter, too, and companionship. We gained energy from each other and I determined that this strength must be used creatively. Their frustration that they would always remain only a mummy could be challenged. We considered how much we, ourselves, hold on to an eternally-caring-for-others role. Stirrings of feminist vitality. I wanted to help these women to ‘find a voice’ and no longer to place their needs at the bottom of the list of priorities. Gradually we re-evaluated ourselves as women and looked at the way we had always put ourselves down. One member had described the work she does as ‘just a little job’. The rabbi's wife had insisted it was her role to attend to their epileptic daughter several times each night; her husband must sleep to be strong for the community. But there was change in the air: one woman began to study and others took their cue from her. I encouraged them to write. Together we compiled an article for publication. It was raw, frank and eventually it appeared in print. By now the time had come for me to hand back to these women responsibility to go it alone. I knew that telling them would be hard but nothing prepared me for their anger and grief during our final month together. ‘Was our sadness too much for you to bear?’ asked an Iranian woman. ‘I too, would like the luxury of resigning,’ asserted another. My leaving them was similar to their having to let go of their children. My task had been to help these women to realise their own strengths and to speak out for themselves with courage and dignity.

NWS NWS-AHC-040 3.85 "Grand opportunity for Lynch GRAND NATIONAL J A McGrath reports on an 11th-hour jockey switch for a strongly-fancied Aintree contenderBookmakers areprepared for £55mbetting spree By J A MCGRATH MARTIN LYNCH realised the wildest dream of every jump jockey when, at the 11th hour, he picked up the mount on strongly-fancied contender Cool Ground in today's Martell Grand National at Aintree. Lynch, who fell at the first fence on his only other Grand National ride in 1981, had looked likely to miss the race after Auntie Dot, one of his regular mounts, had been promised to Mark Dwyer, who finished third on her in last year's race. The jockey merry-go-round kept whirring at a fierce pace as Adrian Maguire, who rode Cool Ground to win the Gold Cup, joined the rapidly-growing casualty list at Liverpool after falling with Sibton Abbey in the Perrier Jouet Handicap Chase. His injuries forced him to give up the coveted mount on Cool Ground. Maguire sustained a shoulder injury and was concussed, so misses his first opportunity to ride in the big race. Trainer Toby Balding set about finding a replacement, and after consultation with Peter Bolton, owner of Cool Ground and of Whitcombe Manor Racing Stables, came up with Lynch, 33, originally from Co Meath but based in Britain. Lynch, who rode his first winner at Thurles, in Ireland, in 1977, lists his win in the Vincent O'Brien Gold Cup aboard Nick The Brief as his most important victory to date. His best season so far came when he rode 28 winners, and with 22 to his credit already this term, he is on course to better that total. Lynch, who fell on Barney Maclyvie at the first 11 years ago, said: ‘I have been told that a lot of good jockeys have fallen at the first fence in their first ride in the National and then gone on to win the race next time. I hope they are right.’ Balding has long held the opinion that Jimmy Frost should ride Cool Ground, but after the West Country rider was beaten on the gelding at Newcastle earlier in the season, Bolton plumped for Maguire. ‘I am very disappointed for Jimmy. He has had a terrible month,’ said Balding, referring to the fact that Frost has also lost the ride today on Morley Street, who attempts a hat-trick in the Martell Aintree Hurdle, with Richard Dunwoody aboard. ‘But it is the owner's view that Jimmy does not suit Cool Ground, and he says he prefers a jockey who sits still and allows the horse to take him along to his fences. After discussions, Martin Lynch's name came out on top of the list.’ Brendan Sheridan was another jockey forced to give up his National ride. He took a crashing fall from Ferromyn in the Heidsieck Dry Monopole Novice Hurdle and later felt very sore. Although passed fit by the doctor, Sheridan gave his National ride on Roc de Prince to fellow Irishman Charlie Swan. Richard Dunwoody, who rides Brown Windsor, was lucky not to join those on the sidelines after suffering three nasty falls yesterday. He finished the day battered and bruised but well enough to ride the strongly-fancied Brown Windsor. He fell from Gambling Royal, Calabrese and King Of The Lot, but had a success in the Mumm Melling Chase aboard the spectacular Remittance Man. Brown Windsor will be blinkered for the first time, a decision to which trainer Nicky Henderson gave long thought. ‘I've had sleepless nights but it's the biggest day of his life and he needs all the help he can get,’ he said. Jamie Osborne rode again yesterday despite giving up later rides on the first day and will be fit to partner Whats The Crack. Graham Bradley, who injured a finger on Thursday, is also fit to take his National mount on Rowlandsons Jewels. Anthony Tory, who misses the ride on Docklands Express, is believed to have pulled a muscle in the back of his neck or to have displaced some vertebrae. He is due to see a chiropractor tomorrow and is likely to undergo surgery. As a consequence of Peter Scudamore's switch to Docklands Express, Steve Smith Eccles, 36, who has had only three rides since returning from injury, was confirmed as the rider of Bonanza Boy, running in the National for the fourth successive year. John Upson, trainer of yesterday's first winner, River Bounty, is concerned about sick horses in his yard — which is not good news for those who have supported his Grand National runner Over The Road. ‘A lot of my horses have been sick,’ Upson declared. ‘Out of 32, I had six fit ones this morning. We are hoping for the best for Over The Road, who has shown no signs of suffering any virus at the moment.’ TobyBalding will have an interesting second-string in Romany King, who has reportedly been working well at Whitcombe. ‘He is fine at present,’ said Balding, who is running the gelding as an eight-year-old, being of the opinion that he will never be so well treated in the National by the handicapper again. Yesterday's many developments — including the confirmation of Scudamore's booking and the likelihood of drying ground — have prompted Coral's to cut Docklands Express, my selection, to 8–1 from 11–1 and he is their new favourite. The other bookmakers are expected to follow suit this morning. Cool Ground is now 10–1, having been as short as 6–1 favourite yesterday morning. He is joined by both Brown Windsor and Twin Oaks. The best-backed outsider is Henrietta Knight's Whats The Crack, now 20–1 from 40–1. Bookmakers estimate that 15 million people will wager more than £55million on the race, with any thoughts of the current recession being quickly forgotten."
NWS NWS-AHF-018 5.15 "Election 1992: Campaign: the good, the bad and the seldom seen By JONATHAN PETRE GOOD: The star of the 1992 election is Michael Heseltine. He has provided the only real glitz and glamour in what has seemed a decidedly lacklustre campaign. Chris Patten deserves an award for endurance as well as resilience in the face of adversity. He has faced the toughest election of any Tory chairman for 20 years, while spending the afternoons dashing to Bath to defend his own marginal seat against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge. A rehabilitated Norman Tebbit has been brought into the front line in an attempt to win back defecting C2s, the skilled workers and their families, who helped Mrs Thatcher win three elections. Douglas Hurd has proved a reassuring figure in a campaign that has at times seemed to lack confidence and direction. He had a key role in the ‘leadership’ theme — contrasting Tory experience in international affairs, particularly Europe, with the prospect of former CND supporter Neil Kinnock in Downing Street. His presence has forced Labour to keep his opposite number Gerald Kaufman off the TV screens as much as possible. Making the most of a walk-on role at the start of the campaign, Margaret Thatcher made many Tory candidates realise how much they missed her strong presence on the political stage. She loyally endorsed Mr Major and — despite a few barbs about borrowing too much — confounded predictions that she would rock the boat. She left a hole in the campaign when she departed this week for a pre-arranged lecture tour in the United States. BAD: The gloomy presence of Norman Lamont overshadowed the first week of the campaign. Has proved no match for his Labour shadow John Smith, who wrong-footed the Tories with his alternative Budget. By the time they woke up to the fact that many people would be only 2p a week better off, Smith had gained the headlines with the claim that eight out of 10 families gained. Lamont was given a lower profile for the second week — prompting a Neil Kinnock joke that he was only allowed out at night. William Waldegrave blotted his copybook during the ‘war of Jennifer's ear’, when he chaired a chaotic press conference on the National Health Service. His admission that Central Office had put a tabloid newspaper in touch with the consultant at the centre of the case was a spectacular own goal. SELDOM SEEN: With the economy and the recession at the heart of the election debate, the low profile of Peter Lilley has been a weakness. Labour has campaigned strongly on its £1 billion ‘recovery package’ while Mr Lilley, a firm believer in Thatcherite non-intervention, has had to rely on promises that recovery is just around the corner. Law and order should be one of the Tories' strongest cards, but record crime figures have tarnished their record. Kenneth Baker, replaced by Chris Patten as Tory chairman, has been on the outside of the campaign. He made an unfortunate slip when he was wheeled out for Thursday's law and order policy launch — conceding that Labour could win. John Gummer was not even on the Tory platform for a press conference to defend the Government's record on animal welfare. Frequently seen on the campaign trail — including Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire — he has not been part of Major's ‘A-team’ for the morning press conferences. Virginia Bottomley made a brief appearance at the chaotic ‘Jennifergate’ press conference, but Central Office has failed to make use of her reassuring presence as the gentler face of Toryism to help soothe public anxieties over the NHS reforms. George Jones LABOUR GOOD: Labour's campaign co-ordinator John Cunningham will take much of the credit for the projection of his party as putative government. One of the few senior front-benchers with experience of government, he has been keeping one eye on the national campaign, chairing almost all the party's London campaign press conferences, and another on his marginal Copeland constituency, travelling by hired plane to Cumbria every weekend. David Hill, the party's unflappable director of communications, has more than adequately filled the role performed by Peter Mandelson in 1987. A former adviser to Roy Hattersley, Mr Hill has been running Labour's highly effective press and broadcasting machine. The performance of the avuncular Shadow Chancellor John Smith has been the undoubted success of Labour's campaign. A stolid Scots barrister, he has been entrusted with holding the line of an economic policy which his opponents have found hard to lay a glove upon. Mr Smith has hardly put a foot wrong. Margaret Beckett, the other half of the Treasury team, is a stalwart of the press conference platform and the Labour politician most respected by the Conservatives, although she has not always inspired on the hustings. No one 's performance could be rated as BAD. MODERATE: Labour's Industry spokesman Gordon Brown has made strenuous efforts to shed his normally lugubrious demeanour, presumably on the orders of the party's image police. One of Labour's ‘A-team’, Mr Brown has appeared on every party election broadcast and on most political broadcasts in the run up to the campaign. But as a master of the ‘sound bite’ quote he has been surprisingly unconvincing in this campaign. SELDOM SEEN: The ‘Where is Gerald Kaufman’ jokes backfired on the Conservatives when Mr Chris Patten called for search parties to be sent out only five minutes after the Shadow Foreign secretary had appeared at Labour's morning conference. But he will have cause to resent his treatment by campaign organisers given Mr Kinnock's unequivocal pledge to appoint him Foreign Secretary in a Labour government. John Prescott, transport spokesman, has largely been frozen out of the national campaign, which is surprising given his adept performance on BBC's election call this week. Mr Prescott's capacity for saying what he thinks and his somewhat abrasive manner are evidently not qualities that are easily packaged. Philip Johnston LIBERAL GOOD: The strategy devised by Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, has been largely vindicated; despite the odd blip, the public has received a single consistent message. And Mr Ashdown has been projected in photo opportunities across Britain as the best leader the country will never have. BAD: The only serious wobble of the campaign followed the appearance of Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, on BBC television's Election Call programme when he appeared to contradict or amend party policy no fewer than four times in less than an hour. MODERATE: Treasury spokesman Alan Beith has had a high profile, though he must occasionally feel like a comma in the economy debate between Mr Lamont and Mr Smith. SELDOM SEEN: After the first week party president Charles Kennedy was noticeable by his absence, raising the cry in the Ashdown battlebus: ‘Who shot President Kennedy?’ He was subsequently given a few walk-on parts."
NWS NWS-CBE-167 4.4 "Their final happy moments Bob Graham at Sodwana Bay, Zululand THE warm ocean cascades with a deafening roar on to fine, white sand. The South African sun burns down from a cloudless sky. Here, in this almost-deserted paradise, British tourist Julie Godwin posed and laughed, as her best friend Elizabeth Over snapped away with the camera. Taking souvenir pictures neither of them would ever live to see. Within hours of taking these photographs, Elizabeth was dead. So was Julie. Both hacked to pieces with 3ft-long panga cane-cutting knives. Then their killers dumped the bodies into the Indian Ocean, hoping they would be swept out to sea and eaten by sharks. But the bodies were seen, floating on the waves. On the beach was the crashed, blood-spattered white Isuzu truck that Elizabeth had borrowed from her fisherman boyfriend, Cuan Cronje, 32. In the truck, among the women's belongings, was the camera. And in the camera, when police eventually got round to checking, were 17 pictures of the last hours of their lives. Among them, the photos on these pages, published with the permission of the victims' families. Most of the pictures were taken in the Sodwana Bay area. It is a stretch of coast that 30-year-old Elizabeth, from St Albans, Herts, working in Durban, had come to love for its wildlife. Here, on a nine-mile reef just off the coast, boyfriend Cuan had taught Elizabeth to scuba-dive. And when Julie, also 30, came for a visit — leaving husband Tim, 32, to look after 22-month-old Sophie back home in Northampton — Elizabeth was longing to introduce her friend to the beauties of Sodwana Bay. Their last, idyllic day on earth had started at magnificent Lake Sabaya, six miles inland from the ocean. The friends laughed and squealed with delight as they took a short boat trip to see the crocodiles and hippos that live on the lake. In one photo, small groups of hippo huddle in mid-lake. At the water's edge, a crocodile is lurking. In the trees are monkeys, a pack of bandit mongoose and — right on a treetop — a large African fish eagle. From the lake, the trippers drove the white Isuzu to Sodwana Bay. To the perfect, shifting sands where they planned to sunbathe and then camp overnight. They had not come unprepared. The friends joked about the amount of luggage Julie wanted to take. ‘She had enough clothes for a month, never mind a few days,’ said one of Elizabeth's friends, who helped them get ready for the trip. ‘Julie had packed every conceivable item, from a packet of ginger-nut biscuits to a canister of CS gas, for protection.’ On the rough drive over dunes to the beach, Elizabeth stopped the truck and took a picture of the path through the trees. Little realising it was their road to Eternity. Down on the beach, marvelling all over again at the sheer sweep of it, Elizabeth took a series of picture-postcard shots. Of sand, surf and sea stretching for mile after mile after mile into the blue haze. Soon after lunch, as they sheltered from the blazing heat, Julie stretched out on a towel and blanket. She covered her body with a multi-coloured cotton tunic. Elizabeth crept closer to snap a close-range shot of her friend's sand-flecked face. Julie, surprised, burst out laughing. And Elizabeth snapped her again. Soon afterwards, the killers pounced. Julie, it is believed, tried to run for it, back along that treelined path Elizabeth had snapped. Elizabeth attempted to escape in the Isuzu, but crashed as her attacker hacked at her through the window. The pictures Elizabeth took that day have become more than just snaps of a holiday that turned to horror. They have become part of a stinging indictment of the way the South African police, blase about murder in a brutal society, have been handling this investigation. Elizabeth's last film reveals vital clues overlooked by clumsy Clouseau-class coppers who had already wiped out other vital evidence. At first, they claimed that the only items missing from the murder scene were about £400 in cash and two car-tyre pumps. A close look at the pictures reveals that Julie's colourful, distinctive top had vanished. And though the photos show that Julie, too, carried a camera — dangling round her neck — that had also disappeared. ‘We made several errors,’ a detective admitted yesterday. But, police say, they have now taken charge of the film, as part of an intense investigation. A single red rose bobbed gently on the ocean waves at Sodwana Bay yesterday. A bittersweet tribute to Elizabeth. Further along the lonely beach, bunches of flowers marked the spot where she and Julie were murdered, eight days agao. The flowers were part of a sad pilgrimage by the victims' relatives. Elizabeth's older brother, Richard, 34, had come from Somerset to see the place where his ‘little sister’ died — and to join in a defiant swim from the murder beach. Julie's younger brother, Marcus Stuttard, had also made the 6,000-mile journey. ‘I wanted to show the people who did this terrible thing that we are defiant,’ he said.’ Julie's grieving husband and baby Sophie were represented by her father Derek. There, too, was bearded Afrikaaner Cuan who had won Elizabeth's heart, and become engaged to her only weeks ago. The four men stripped to their swimming-trunks and walked out into the ocean surf. A strange, sad commemoration of the murders that ruined paradise."
NWS NWS-CH3-103 3.97 "WHY I'VE HAD TO THROW AWAY THAT PHOTO GAZZA sheds more tears for England I cry each time I see the video… ‘I thought the memories might help me. They made it worse’ ‘Being with England has made me realise what I have missed’ NIGEL CLARKE PAUL GASCOIGNE revealed yesterday why he still sheds tears for his beloved England. The man who wept during England's World Cup semi-final with Germany two years ago, now cannot bear to watch himself in the white shirt of his country. And he admits he cries when he sees film of the glory days in Italy when Gazza was ready to become the best footballer in the world. That was before his shattering injury that has taken 16 months off his career. ‘I just can't watch myself,’ he said in Santander yesterday where he has joined up with the England team to watch tonight's match against Spain. ‘I have had to throw the videos away. In those dark days when I was recovering from my knee injury I'd play a video of an England match and upset myself all over again. ‘I have watched David Platt's last-minute winner in the World Cup match against Belgium, and a big lump came in my throat. ‘I thought a few reminiscences might help me. It didn't. Just made it worse. I just wanted to go out and smash a door down. Jokes ‘I will watch the game against Spain because I am not playing. It will be great just to be with the lads again. ‘I have missed it all so much. English voices, the general banter, jokes, comradeship and team spirit. ‘Yes, I have been lonely. I can't wait for the next get-together, and the thought of pulling on that old white shirt again excites me. ‘When I've played a few games for Lazio, when I'm ready and the boss says I am fit to return, I will bring the whole family to Wembley to watch me again. ‘I don't think I have much else to prove…other than that I want to be the best player in the world. ‘My knee is fine. There is no doubt in my mind that I can be the player I was before I got injured. ‘I don't think about my knee. All I know is that I want to give everything I have for England again.’ Gazza, now with Lazio of Rome after his £5.5 million transfer from Tottenham, expects his first match to be against Spurs on September 23. By then he should have fully recovered from the injured right thigh muscle that has delayed his eagerly awaited debut in Italian football. All being well, that should be at home to Genoa the following week. He went on: ‘I am fit. I can run around a pitch 25 times, no problem. I don't know what a beer looks like. ‘I don't think about what the first tackle is going to be like, unless of course it comes from Stuart Pearce! Or the first twist or turn. ‘It will mean so much just to play again. ‘I watched the European championship finals on television but I got down again, disappointed because I wasn't there. ‘But I kept in touch with Graham Taylor and the boys. ‘I involved myself by phoning the hotel to find out from the boss what was going on. ‘I knew I would never be fit to play, but I wanted to be part of it still. ‘I won't put myself forward for England until I have successfully played for Lazio. That would be wrong.’ Taylor has already pencilled in Gazza to play his first match for England in the World Cup qualifier against Norway next month. Gazza added: ‘Going back to Wembley is very much on my mind.’ Talent It was there that he was hurt so badly, rupturing knee ligaments in Spurs' FA Cup final win over Nottingham Forest in May last year. He said: ‘I will think about the thousands who will be watching and how I want to prove people wrong.’ There have been many doubts that Gazza couldn't make a come-back at club level or even contemplate straddling the international scene again with the outrageous talent that made him a folk hero. He said: ‘I came to Italy for something different. To try something new. ‘Of course I still miss the Football League, the chance to get stuck in. You can't do that in Italy without getting booked. ‘But I just love football. I like training and enjoy working out twice a day.’ But Gazza admits he missed Lazio's 3-3 draw with Sampdoria on Sunday that kicked off the Italian season. ‘Where were you?’ he was asked. ‘Did you go shopping?’ ‘No,’ he grinned. ‘I was at home, looking to make babies.’ Gazza is slowly but surely learning the Italian language, making it work for him. He said: ‘There was a dog barking outside my house. It kept on and on. ‘I shouted at it in English but it kept on. ‘So I went through my phrase-book to search for something like ‘Shut up’. ‘I yelled out ‘Silencio, bastardo’. There was immediate silence.’ The old grin is back on his face. That old confident strut and swagger has returned. He said: ‘I am nearly there, so nearly fit, so close. ‘It's been a long time and I am not going to rush it. Pleased ‘Being with the English lads again has made me realise just what I have been without. ‘They were all so pleased to see me. Nobody went on about my injury — just asked me how I was getting along in Italy.’ Gazza cannot wait to be one of them again. And you cannot help keeping your fingers crossed for him. THE ANGUISH OF DEFEAT ENGLAND'S World Cup exit was a sad occasion for Gazza but he's desperately keen to pull on that old white shirt again.

NWS NWS-CH3-463 3.24 "BLISTERED! Brave Beefy's in agony on walk of hell But there's still time for fun CHRISTINE GARBUTT IAN BOTHAM shouted in pain yesterday as walked down the hills to Dartmouth. On the sixth day of his latest charity walk, the mighty Botham's legs were killing him. ‘This has been the most savage start of any of the walks I've done,’ panted Beefy, as he walked backwards downhill to relieve the strain in his calves. ‘It's beautiful scenery, but the hills of Cornwall and Devon are torture.’ As the Big Man marched into Dartmouth at his amazingly fast pace of 4.3 miles an hour, the hundreds lining the roadside would have no idea of the agony he was in — nor would Botham dream of telling them. To him pain is just another challenge. The crowds waved and cheered him on, the boats bobbing up and down in the estuary. And money poured into the coffers. Through sponsorship and money collected by the roadside, more than £40,000 has already been raised for leukaemia research. Out of Dartmouth and up the Alp-like hills again towards Paignton, king-of-the-road Beefy started running. ‘Come on,’ he ordered his troops. ‘Pain is fun.’ Gruelling Then, calling for his ‘Orangeand’, known to the faithful as orange and tequila, Botham raced ahead. Chris Lander, the Daily Mirror's cricket writer and the only man to have marched every step of the way with Beefy on his walks, is amazed at how Ian carries on the torturous pace. ‘It's gruelling,’ says Lander, 51. ‘But Ian keeps us all going by his sheer determination. Yet I've never heard him cry out in pain before.’ Botham has been in pain since the fourth day of this 546-mile hike from Land's End to Margate, with a deep-seated blister on his achilles tendon. ‘It's the first time I've ever been able to persuade Beefy to stop for treatment,’ says Dave ‘Rooster’Roberts, the new England cricket team physio who is looking after the walkers. ‘I patched him up in record time by the roadside. It was a bit like a pit stop in a Grand Prix race.’ Roberts also revealed that Ian's knees are swollen, and a large blister is developing under his big toe. ‘I wouldn't be in his shoes,’ he says. ‘Not with 16 days to go. That man is a hero.’ Beefy is a hero to the thousands that turn out to see him through rain and shine as he marches down the south coast. An elderly lady couldn't stop crying as the Big Man paced through her small Devonshire village. ‘I had to see him. I had to see him and wave him on,’ she sobbed, opening the contents of her purse into the collector's tin. ‘I nursed my husband for five years with leukaemia. He died last week. Please God the money raised will help find a cure.’ A mobile home, known as the Tardis, goes in front of the walkers to offer food and drink at strategic places. Ian rarely eats, preferring chocolate milk shakes, water, and his favourite tipple when pain dictates. Ian's mother-in-law, Mrs Jan Waller, is in charge of catering for the four walkers and 17 back-up crew. Proud A five-year-old boy called in, asking Mrs. Waller for a drink. He'd managed to walk a mile behind Botham and was very proud of himself. But his mother was crying. ‘Why are you crying?’ asked the kid. The mother wiped her eyes and, when the lad was out of earshot, she revealed her son was a victim of the disease. ‘It's two years now and you would never guess,’ she admitted. ‘Without funds being raised he wouldn't have stood a chance. Now we are hoping he will fully recover.’ That is all Botham wants to hear. He's vowed to carry on walking ‘until we've licked the disease.’ Yet the toll on his 36-year-old body is beginning to show. His wife Kathy, who organised the walk, admits that Ian goes to hell and back on the walks. ‘But he won't admit it,’ she says. ‘And when I see him hobbling in at night, I am very proud of him.’ Kids gather at the end of each day, hoping Ian will sign their autograph books and cricket bats. Yet that is one hurdle their hero can't manage. His fingers are too swollen to hold a pen. After a long, hot soak, and wearing flip-flops to get the air to his tired feet, Beefy is back in action at the hotel, urging on his troops to make merry. ‘We need fun,’ he says. ‘To keep us going.’ Part of the fun yesterday was when Lander doused the walking hero with a bucket of sea water. Botham's pals were in stitches, but Lander was warned: ‘You'll go in the sea or an appropriate river before we get to Margate.’ Yesterday Botham marched along the Paignton seafront clocking the incredible time of six hours and 12 minutes over the 26.4 miles. He has backed himself at 16-1 to complete the marathon haul to Margate in 130 hours, and he is on course to win. Today he will set off from Paignton to Topsham, a 27.7-mile walk that will mean pounding the roads non-stop for more than eight hours. It could be Botham's biggest challenge so far — the hills are crippling. Bird in the hand TEST umpire Dickie Bird joins Ian Botham in Devon on his charity walk. It's a great laugh for Dickie but Beefy's in agony. FEET FIRST IT'S medication time for Ian Botham, under the skilful hands of Dave Roberts, the new physio to the England cricket team. Ian's knees are swollen and a large blister is developing under his big toe. But he'll be striding on."
NWS NWS-K2E-016 4.44 "‘I would give anything to know how he died and when.’ A mother's agony goes on 20 years after her son's death By STEPHANIE BELL THE AGONY of what happened to her son is as acute for Joan McDermott today as it was 20 years ago. Not knowing exactly WHEN Brian died, HOW much he suffered and WHO killed him is torture for her. There is not a day goes by that Joan does not think of her youngest child. ‘He would have been 30 now,’ she says. ‘He always wanted to be a detective when he grew up. ‘I often wonder if he would have fulfilled his dream. If he would be married now and have children. Shouting ‘But I can't picture him any other way than the little boy he was on that last day I saw him.’ Joan remembers that last morning at home with Brian as if it were yesterday. ‘I was starting to make the Sunday dinner and Brian said he was going out to play in the park. ‘I gave off to him about not brushing his hair. I can still remember standing brushing his hair and then shouting after him not to be long because his dinner would soon be ready.’ Searches What happened to Brian when he left home that day remains a mystery. His father and brothers joined police and Army in exhaustive searches of the nearby Ormeau park and river. In the week that followed before the mutilated remains of his body were found Joan lost two stone in weight. She said: ‘I couldn't eat or sleep that week. I just kept thinking who had my son? Where was he?’ It was on September 9 that a soldier on foot patrol along the Annadale Embankment pulled a sack from the River Lagan. Joan recalled what happened: ‘Apparently the soldier opened the bag and something fell out and he thought it was a paw and that somebody had thrown a dog into the river. ‘He said he did not think it was human. When he opened the bag completely he realised it was a human being. Forensic ‘I heard rumours in the street that a child's body had been found in the river and I asked the police. ‘They said they didn't think it was Brian but asked if forensic could come to take some prints from his toys and school books. ‘When they told me the body had been mutilated and burnt I didn't think it was Brian. I thought no one could do that to my youngster, and I put it out of my mind.’ The arrival of the police to her Well Street home a short time later started the nightmare which continues for Joan even today. ‘The police didn't have to tell me, I knew immediately. I was hysterical. I just couldn't understand how or why anyone would do that to my Brian. ‘He was a lovely child, a typical boy although he was fairly shy and quiet. Apparently he was unrecognisable. ‘The hand of the arm that was not hacked off was clenched and his thumb tucked inside,’ she said. ‘That's why the skin on his thumb did not burn and they were able to get the print. ‘When Brian used to watch horror movies with us and he was scared that's how he clenched his hands. He must have been really frightened when he died.’ Brian's body was so badly mutilated and charred that the pathologists could not determine the exact cause or time of death. This has added to Joan's torment over the years, along with the fact that his vicious killer or killers have not been found. ‘I don't know if he was strangled, shot or stabbed. I don't know if he was sexually assaulted and maybe died of shock. ‘It kills me to think of what he might have suffered. I would give anything to know how he died and when. ‘I don't even know if he was killed that Sunday or if he was tortured before he was murdered. He could have been crying for his mummy. Conscience ‘I pray that before I die I will know. There had to be more than one person involved. ‘Maybe one of them did not want to be involved but kept quiet because of fear. ‘Maybe now after 20 years that person may want to relieve his or her conscience and help put me and my husband out of our misery by coming forward. ‘If anyone knows anything that could help and has kept quiet for any reason, I would beg them to please come forward now.’ 20.0 LEFT: The last picture ever taken of Brian, in his scout's uniform.

NWS NWS-K4S-095 5.52 "PROPERTY analysts at UBS Philips & Drew set a puzzle last year. ‘When is a rental level not a rental level?’ they asked. Answering their own question they replied: ‘Almost always’. ‘It has been remarkable, bearing in mind the massive oversupply of office and retail space, that we have continued to hear of unexpectedly high rents being achieved,’ said the analysts. But behind the headline numbers lurked the truth, disguised in a veil of what the property market calls confidentiality clauses and what others call secret deals. ‘Property deals, unlike those in the stock market have no transparency, if required. Not only are they not transparent, a property deal can be struck subject to just about anything,’ said UBS. More bluntly they, and many in the market, were objecting to the prices paid by tenants to landlords for their shop units and offices being kept secret from the market. Secret sales of property were also subject to the same lambasting. The objection is that secrecy makes it very difficult to assess the value of a deal and therefore to judge the true state of the market. More worryingly, confidentially clauses are being used to falsely maintain capital values. And when rent reviews are due it can be almost impossible to assess what tenants should be paying. Unfortunately most agents are more than willing to bow to pressure from landlords and tenants who insist that confidentiality clauses are inserted into any deal, no matter how small. As an example, the property agent Sanderson Townend & Gilbert in Newcastle recently sent out details to the press of a regional letting. The agent said it had sold a commercial garage in Middlesbrough to a named company. Aside from its geographical location and the name of the other agent involved few other details were included. Certainly not price or purchaser. Paul Stevenson of the agent said: ‘The buyer did not want its identity revealing.’ Maybe not. But the bald statement that a garage has been sold in Middlesbrough is neither a news story, nor of any help to agents working in the market who need to know such details. To those operating in the specialist property press such lack of detail is intolerable. Trade magazine Estates Times will not print the details of deals unless the property's address, size, rent or price involved and size of any premium paid are included. And in a recent hard-hitting editorial its editor Lee Mallett said: ‘What is most disconcerting…is the apparent unwillingness…of leading figures in the property industry to acknowledge the distortions that are arising because of the suppression of information.’ Creditably a handful of influential figures are speaking out against the cult of confidentiality. Most notable amongst these is John Ritblat, the urbane chairman of developer British Land. He has called for the compulsory registration of all property transactions in an attempt to stop the use of secret deals. In a newsletter published by his agency Conrad Ritblatt he said: ‘We must move towards compulsory registration of investment deals, lettings,mortgages and all transactions in land.’ Ritblat would like to see all such information logged with the Land Registry. ‘Those who scoff that this cannot be done should look to the United States. In their most liquid markets New York and Los Angeles, for instance the Real Estate Data Inc publication will give you comprehensive details of ownership, values and rents on a street-by-street basis.’ The eponymous retail agent Clive Lewis has also added his voice to Ritblat's. In his midsummer retail report last year he said confidentiality clauses were ‘falsely conceived protectionism’. ‘Such clauses succeed in frustrating the free flow of information so essential for accurate valuation at review.’ His report also noted that in order to obtain information some valuers have subpoenaed surveyors bound by confidentiality clauses to appear in arbitration hearings. Equally notable figures will spring to the defence of the secret deal, however. John Parry, managing director of developer Hammerson, was reported as saying: ‘If a landlord or tenant wants a deal to be confidential, then they should be allowed to. ‘It is an integral part of British law. A lot of tenants don't want their competitors to know their cost base, particularly retailers. ‘The clauses probably have been misused or overused as a tool. The trouble is you don't know where to draw the line.’ But UBS does. ‘We are aware that part of a substantial City office building was recently announced as having been let at £40 per sq ft,’ said the property analysts. ‘There was the ubiquitous confidentiality clause which we understand was to hide a two year rent free period. ‘Broken back over the five years to the first rent review, the true rent equates to just £24 per sq ft 40pc less than actually reported.’ This lead the analysts to estimate that all reported headline deals are probably around 10 to 20pc above the true market. The property market should be following UBS's lead and saying deals reported at up to 20pc above their true value is precisely where to draw the line."
