HOC HOC-AV 4.2 " I went to a school in Bahrain where as a Christian, I got three hours of instruction in that religion every week. At the same time, the Muslims in our class were separated and instructed in their religion in a classroom next door. As there were only a handful of Hindus in my year, they got a free period. We were well integrated as a class and learnt a lot about each others' religions/cultures through everyday interaction. During morning assembly, a common prayer was said to a universal ""God"". The atheists could opt to stand silent.      Faith schools are normally of a better standard. Shouldn't all standards be improved, not by dividing society further but by including everyone and raising standards for all.      Whilst multi-faith schools would be an ideal scenario, it may not prove to alter the current situation at all. In France state schools are secular and therefore there is no discrimination on the grounds of faith.      Addressing the quality of education and ensuring that those from immigrant communities are offered the same opportunities as their Caucasian peers will ensure long term solutions to the ghetto-isation - or lack of choice.      I went to a faith school but it was hardly representative of the local community as we were bussed in from miles around.      I find it impossible to believe the government will even consider making more of them. They DO succeed in keeping communities apart. Besides, apart from compulsory prayers every morning, I can't remember learning anything of any note about the faith of the school outside the curriculum.      As yesterday's reports into last summer's riots indicate, religious segregation has become a serious source of social instability in the UK. Faith schools segregate communities along religious lines and are therefore a significant contributing factor. Britain needs a constitution ensuring that the State and ALL of its institutions are secularised as quickly as possible, or the present social divisions will become unbreachable chasms. Religion - whether Christian or Muslim or other - should be confined to the private sphere and neither endorsed nor sponsored by the State.      Faith schools are a bad idea. They only make society more divided. Their superior performance academically usually comes from the fact that they can select the pupils they take and they often have more resources to use on them too.      No matter what school, there will still be exclusions from the morning assembly, no matter how neutral or short the prayer part is. The problem is the parents and elders insisting that their children are different and better than the norm that causes the friction. Just take a look at Northern Ireland - if we took away the religious label, would the fighting go away also?      I think it is important that ALL children should enjoy a rich mix of education, including religion. How else can they make informed unbiased choices as they grow up? But learning about the full spectrum of religions is not going to solve the problem - we must remember that the whole structure of British society is based around Christian beliefs, holidays and behaviour. Therefore a total re-think is needed to value and honour religious celebrations from all religions, not just Christianity.      I think many folk are being too harsh on single faith schools. At my comprehensive school people of no faith at all were happy to abuse a person for being different in any way. I don't think religion itself is the problem in Northern Ireland; the quarrel is not about religion, it is about territory and government. Religion is just a label thugs get hold of.     I went to a single faith school and far from being segregated from other communities and religions, we were encouraged to learn about them. RE lessons covered Judaism, Sikhism, Islam and involved talks from people of other religions as well as visits to mosques etc.     A school should reflect the local community - there's nothing wrong with that - it just another way of saying that kids go to their local school. The problems arise when kids are taught that their community is in some fundamental way better than others and this, in effect, is what single faith schools do, since by promoting one faith they are implicitly saying that other faiths are inferior. Schools should teach facts and one religion's fact is another religion's heresy.      Faith schools aren't just a problem, they're an abomination. If parent's wish their children to be instructed in their own particular faith, it should be in addition to a normal education, not instead of it.      It's a bit odd that David Blunkett is calling on communities to integrate, and yet his government is, at the same time, planning more segregation. We need only look at Northern Ireland to see where it leads...      Faith schools are only a problem when the faith being taught is not tolerant of other religions. I believe that if the UK is going to be a true multicultural society then there is very strong reasons to ban single faith schools and get the kids mixing. What their parents teach them in their own time is their own business, but a stable mixed society is everyone's business       Faith schools are by their nature divisive. In a mixed school children can see that their classmates are different, but they don't see anything is wrong with that. Accepting children should grow into accepting adults. "
HOC HOC-DT 4.44 " What really frightens me is the paranoia that has swept through many countries and the answer: increased security, and the increasing liberties for intelligence and security services and police, uncontrollable by the public. Since when has the demand for clear proof as to who is behind these attacks, become an expression of unpatriotic behaviour? Yes, I feel threatened, not so much by the attacks as by the direction the western world is taking.      Our armed forces are sent to a far off land to possibly die for a nation that amongst other things, funded the IRA so that they could kill the same soldiers that now stand side by side with Americans. I felt threatened when America refused to sign the Kyoto agreement. I felt threatened when I saw Americans welcoming the terrorist, Gerry Adams with open arms. I felt threatened the day democracy died in the USA and George Bush cheated his way to power.... and now we may all be wiped out by a war that can neither be lost or won by anyone. Do I feel threatened? To be honest I feel ashamed.      No less safe than before the air raids. It's business as usual for the ever-vigilant Londoner.      I just want to thank Great Britain for supporting the United States through all of this, and especially for being by our side during the strikes yesterday. I feel for the 300 citizens your country lost just as I feel for those lost in my own and around the world. I wish everyone in this campaign the best of luck. Thank you!      I in no way feel threatened by recent occurrences. I refuse to allow terrorist evil effect the way I go about my daily schedule. If we let this oppress us then the war is already lost. There are fears raised daily in the media, and if I were to heed them all I would lead a very poor quality of life.      Having lived with IRA terrorism all my life, this new level of threat is only a quantitative change and I'm not sure how big a change it is. The change occurred when the planes hit the WTC. At least we know in Britain that the correct response is to carry on regardless. I feel sorry for Americans: for them it is a qualitative shift and, I imagine, a terrifying one.      I work in Canary Wharf Tower and since 11th September, feel very afraid. My wife is very worried and I feel so powerless. Now after the strikes, I think an attack on the UK is imminent, hence I have decided to leave my job and work nearer to home.      I feel as safe as I always did - statistically I'm still much more likely to die in an accident involving a domestic appliance than I am of dying as a result of terrorist action.      All I know is that my friends and I haven't consumed tap water or non-tinned food since September 11 and many others are doing the same. Will the government tell us if we are poisoned? I for one am very frightened and haven't had a good night's sleep in weeks.      Blair and Bush have now made the UK a target for terrorism - the whole of the British race is now under threat at home and abroad. It's only a matter of time before something happens.      I come from the UK where I grew up listening to my parents' tales of living through the Blitz. I've lived through two major IRA bombing campaigns in London and was a block away from the Old Bailey when it was hit by a car bomb. Here, people are not used to living with that kind of fear. Already we see signs of panic. Last night the Emmys were cancelled, with the stars running for cover, like the pampered cowards they are. We know who the true STARS in the US are. They are Rudy Guiliani and his troops - the NY fire-fighters, police, paramedics and rescue workers who risked their lives on September 11th. Those who survived are now gearing up for the next onslaught. Yes we're apprehensive, but will we give in? NEVER!      Maybe I'm a sitting duck, but unless 'the war' escalates internationally I feel perfectly safe. To Jo from Liverpool who thinks she's at risk of being poisoned, and to Adam who's apprehensive about flying to Corfu, I say stop being so prissy. Those who were in the Blitz, or those being bombed in Afghanistan right now, they know what real fear is and they are being braver than you.      Whilst article 51 of the UN charter states that proportionate measures may be taken in self defence, no one has even suggested that the Taleban are directly responsible for the attacks of September 11th, therefore action against their infrastructure and people are unjustified and illegal, even by the United States, more so by Britian who has not even been attacked. Worse is the fact that this attack (in effect an act of war against the Afghan regime) means that any Afghan retaliation is not only legal, but justified, which leaves all of us in a very nasty situation.      Given the size of the Al-Qaeda group and the number of other extremist groups, everyone should feel nervous. Any attacks are going to be hard and will affect everyone. These attacks will not distinguish between religions, colour or origins. I believe American arrogance finally got the better of them on Sunday when patience would have served them better.      I am due to fly to Corfu this evening. In light of the events of 11 September and the retaliatory strikes last night I definitely feel a little more apprehensive than I would if none of these events had taken place. However I firmly believe in and support the measured response of Mr Bush and Mr Blair, and reiterate the important point that while counter attacks are of course dangerous, if we do nothing in response to crush the terrorists and those who support them, the danger is significantly higher. I have great faith in the UK security services and while I will of course be anxious about flying today, I will not let the terrorists disrupt my plans.      We are all apprehensive of a possible attack on our own soil because we have no idea in what direction that threat may come from. There has been talk of bombs, hijackings, nuclear threat and biological warfare. Who knows how (or more accurately IF) a revenge attack will come? We must overcome those fears and show the terrorists that they have not won in their plight to disrupt our lives.      Should we not take action because of the fear of the backlash? Surely that would be true cowardice. The fanatics like those who flew the four planes into buildings would not stop if we do nothing would they? Sitting on our hands saying ""Tut tut how terrible"" would be an invitation for more death and mayhem. Let's behave like adults and take responsibility for ourselves and our actions, even if they are unpleasant, for us or others.      Yes I do feel more threatened since the current air strikes because it is like hitting a hornets' nest with a sledgehammer. More people are going to be inclined to stand up against the allies, particularly the US, because they are clearly going to be bombing civilians. If they want to bring the guilty to justice this is not going to be done in the air but by sending a covert SAS team in to take out the responsible people. There are better ways to handle the situation than the current wave of air strikes.      All of us here are a bit edgy, watching the skies for stray aircraft. Quite honestly the country would never have felt this way under Mrs Thatcher. When she was Prime Minister we felt strong as a military power and hence we were not scared. Blair inspires no such confidence in me!      I'd feel more threatened if there was no action against the terrorists, because this is probably the last chance we will get to wipe them out. What weapons will they have access to in twenty years time if we do nothing now, and what evilly crafted 'spectaculars' will they be capable of? Then it really WOULD be time to worry!      Can I just point out to Jo, Liverpool, that she's handing victory squarely to terrorists everywhere. They've made her and her friends' lives a misery. I'm sure that would make Mr. Bin Laden very happy.       Release of information by the BBC that submarines currently on exercise in Oman were used to launch cruise missiles has certainly not increased the expatriate sense of security here in Oman. This sort of irresponsible journalism may turn on the news-geeks who wallow in military detail, but is more likely to create news by focussing attention on Brits. It is only marginally more ethical than journalists paying kids on the streets of Belfast to throw stones at security forces on 'quiet' news days. Thank you Mr. BBC. "
HOC HOC-FZ 5.31 " The accused should not be named unless found to be guilty. Being accused of rape ruins one's reputation, and could be a powerful weapon if wielded by someone who for one reason or another (ie politics) wants another's named to be forever sullied.      I am horrified at the harshness of some of the comments here and about this whole ""naming and shaming"" business that seems to be so popular. What really needs to be addressed is people's attitudes! As a civilised nation of the 21st century, the UK needs to try to move away from a lynch mob mentality and old-fashioned clich?s - because this is what could make it necessary to protect a potential criminal from his/her own neighbours. And what about the victim - what kind of mentality does he/she encounter in court? Are we not still thinking in terms of ""she was wearing a short skirt, she was asking for it""?      I was charged with raping 3 females. Although I was PROVEN innocent and it was established that these 3 females had conspired together against me and that they had a history of accusing innocent men who got on the wrong side of them, my name was dragged through the muck. I was locked up and was, to say the least, a very unpopular person. I am sick of the people who say that even an acquitted man is probably guilty. The animals who make these false allegations should receive the same sentence as their victims would have got!      Daz Nottle asks how we would feel if our daughter had been raped and her name was bandied around by the press, but equally the thought of a son or brother being falsely accused and suffering the inevitable repercussions is no less horrific.      I think a couple of guys have said it all. The ""innocent until proven guilty"" principle should always prevail simply because of the stigma attached. As some have already said, after someone is cleared of the charges, the story is no longer newsworthy but the stigma remains. Why can't we publicise both or keep both anonymous?      What about the situation where a woman has been attacked randomly by a total stranger? If the accuser was named, the attacker may well discover her address and attack again.      Why not withhold the names of all defendants, whether they are acquitted or not? Publishing them only serves to punish their families who have committed no crime. As for naming and shaming, surely it is for the courts to decide what punishment is suitable, not the newspapers or their readers.      There seems to be some presumption here that the minute a woman alleges a rape that the police run around to the accused's door and arrest him. As the victim of an attempted rape, I speak from experience in saying that that is simply not the case. I literally had to ""convince"" them that the incident had occurred and that I was not lying. Would I have reported the crime if my face/name had been splashed across the papers? Almost certainly not. Would I have reported it if there was a chance they couldn't convict someone, which would result in my identity being exposed as a suggested solution by some people here? Again, no. If they had charged someone with it, should they have been named? Yes, as it would possibly have persuaded other victims to come forward.      There will always be innocent people who are wrongly accused of this crime, but how many more guilty go free because of lack of evidence which could come from other victims coming forward after identifying the accused?      I don't think that because the Hamiltons have been more vocal in this case we should dismiss the case of the prosecution. If your daughter had been raped, would you encourage her to stand up in front of the world's media and say she was raped? There has only been one party that has spoken to the media. There is no more emotive subject than the abuse of a person's child, but the fact that the only media coverage has been about the Hamiltons' innocence, and how banana-like they have been, disappoints me.      While I have little sympathy for the Hamiltons, I find it very wrong that they should be so publicly accused while the accuser remains anonymous. The accuser, if found to be lying, should be named and prosecuted. I believe this should apply to anyone who deliberately and falsely accuses another of a crime.      What purpose does naming have? None apart from allowing everyone to presume the man is guilty. I for one would always consider someone charged with rape as a 'sex case' - even if they were found not guilty of the crime. It is too easy for females to cry rape and destroy a life. How would changing this law allow guilty men to go free?      This whole story has been constructed by the Hamiltons so that they can get some money by suing someone and acquire some public sympathy. However on the matter of confidentiality of suspects, it would be difficult to get witnesses to come forward if they did not know what the suspect loked like.      The only truly anonymous winners in this situation are the members of the press who make money from inflating accusations and deliberate character assassination. I think such reporters should have their private lives made public. Then the nation's hate could be redirected towards the ringleaders.      I think it really is awful that innocent people can be named as rapists. One front page can ruin a reputation of an innocent person. Both parties should have anonymity until the outcome of the trial.      A friend (a father of two young children) had a false accusation of rape levelled against him. He had a cast iron alibi and the case was thrown out almost immediately. He still had to suffer the stigma of being ""the rapist that got off"" because people chose to believe the media and the old theory that ""there is no smoke without fire"" - utter rubbish. He was victimised and ostracised. Six months later he killed himself because he couldn't cope. Do you think that would have happened if the accusations had been left anonymous until such point as guilt was proven?      What we have now is an affront to natural justice. Protect the identity of both accuser and accused or make both public. Anonymity may help real victims come forward and that is a thoroughly good thing but naming accused who are innocent until proven guilty is a charter for those who may seek, for malicious reasons, to blacken someone's name. Even if they withdraw the complaint or it is thrown out of court some mud may stick. Justice first, knee-jerk political correctness a long way second!      I can't believe that there could possibly be any sound reason for the disclosure of a person's identity before conviction of any crime. The media has proved time and time again that it has no sense of social responsibility in such matters. The public has a right to know? Not until proven guilty.      There have been a number of cases of false accusations of rape over the last few years where the accuser was found to have no case. As the student from King's College London found out, it can ruin your reputation nevertheless. As was reported in New Scientist recently, women have been shown to reinterpret their memories, for instance after a relationship has ended. Unless there is firm evidence, every case of this sort should be thrown out. The Hamiltons should sue this woman for libel and ruin her if she is found to be making up these allegations.      The accused should never be named in any investigation. That should be a basic right in the modern world.      The reason why the accuser is allowed anonymity while the accused is not is because of the extreme difficulty of getting victims to come forward. It is often only if a few women with very similar stories come forward that a conviction can be obtained. Rape is unlike other crimes. In England there is only a 10% conviction rate. Rapists are rarely convicted and those who are have usually committed the crime dozens of times before they are caught. That is why the law should stay the same.      Why should the man be named and not the woman? It should be both named or neither. If the man only is to be named and he is proved innocent, then the woman's name and photograph should be splashed all over the media, so that she will get the same stigma the man will get.      Both parties should remain anonymous. If both remained anonymous, we would not know anything about this case at this point. The Hamiltons would still have what was left of their reputations intact, the accuser would not have been investigated by the press and had her background splashed across the newspapers, and we wouldn't have to waste time debating something that is completely obvious from the start.      You are innocent until proven guilty! Therefore, both parties should have the right to remain anonymous. We should play it straight. Let's not forget who the victim is!      Whilst the naming of suspects might bring forward others who have been attacked by the alleged perpetrator, it only serves to add bias to the guilt of the suspect. My husband was accused of raping our former next-door neighbour. It transpired that she alleged the rape after my husband found her stealing money from us after babysitting. The case never reached the courts because the girl admitted she'd fabricated the story so she wouldn't get into trouble herself. However, this was after my husband had been named in the local newspaper for being arrested for the alleged offence. To this day he is still labelled as a rapist and a pervert by some who believe that his accusation was in some way a precursor to being found guilty, whereas the girl has never been mentioned since. She did not even get charged for wasting police time!!      In 1986 at a big, particularly vicious, serial rape case in south London the identity of the accused WAS kept secret until he had been found guilty, at which time his name was published. I can remember this because my wife and I had known the accused, and when his name was published it gave us a big shock, to say the least. Anonymity of both the accused and the accuser should exist in all criminal cases until a verdict of guilty is returned.      I strongly feel that the accused should remain anonymous unless they are proven to be guilty of the charge. I myself at the age of 19 (10 years ago) was accused by a young lady of the same age of raping her, I most certainly did not commit the said crime. I also spent numerous months in quite a few bail hostels and in one a policeman had told a fellow resident what ""I was in for"" - you can imagine the response I received. And after an intensive 2-week trial at the Old Bailey I was unanimously acquitted. However my name had been headline news during the trial, I subsequently left the country 1 month after being acquitted and have never lived in the UK since. It's becoming more and more apparent these days that many of the accused were indeed innocent, but by then it's already too late as their names have been irreversibly tarnished.      A small percentage of rape cases bought to court end up with a guilty verdict. Because of the nature of the crime (in particular 'date rapes' and the nature of consent) and because of how rape cases are historically dealt with, a guilty verdict is often hard to come to. Should we 'name and shame' the traumatised women who bring the cases?      So the law protecting the identity of rape suspects was changed in the mid eighties - wasn't Neil Hamilton a member of the government that made the change? Strange how these things come home to roost in later years. Also, how can they sue the police for doing what they're supposed to do - investigate an allegation that has been made!      Not only should the defendant's name be protected but a formal definition of rape should be created. If a woman agrees to sex but changes her mind near the climax, should he be charged with rape?      The law states that you are innocent until proven guilty. By revealing the names of the accused, they are judged and found guilty by the media and the public before charges are even brought against them. Anonymity should be given, both to the accuser and the accused but not only for rape charges, for any serious crime. It should become the norm. How can they have a fair trial if they have already been convicted by the whole world?      The Hamiltons' aggressive and publicity seeking response to the situation has eroded any sense of sympathy for their plight. Because they are famous and in reality still well off, are they to be excluded from the proper process of the law. The perceived attitude, especially from Christine, is that they are above the law. The police deserve credit for not ducking the issue. This case makes no grounds for changing the confidentiality rules.      One of the most dangerous clich?s in the English language is ""There's no smoke without fire"". It is simply not true. People are often accused of crimes they didn't commit, whether due to malice on the part of the accuser, prejudice or laziness on the part of the police, or simple bad luck and mistakes. If this were not the case, we could dispense with the whole court system, and punish suspects immediately. I've never understood what public interest is served by publicising accusations of crime when nothing has been proved. This should apply to any crime - the only difference with rape is that the stigma is greater.      I have been telling friends for years that anonymity should be granted to both parties in these sort of cases, until guilt is proved. However I feel that the accuser should only be named in certain cases where it has been proved that she deliberately lied. It seems unfair to name someone that has been raped by an unknown attacker just because the police caught the wrong person.      Justice not only needs to be done but also seen to be done. If you are convinced of your allegations as a victim there should be no reason why you should be granted anonymity. Let both victim and accused be named as a rule and the court make rulings in special cases.      Never mind the accused, what about the victim? Yesterday's paper told stories of how she's a sexual fantasist who has cried rape before. That may be so, and it may be relevant: but why should an accuser's ""previous form"" be public knowledge, when the defendant's history is painstakingly hidden from the jury, regardless of its relevance?      In 1991 my brother was accused of a rape dating back to 1977, yet he was seriously injured in a crash just before the alleged incident happened, making it impossible for him to be the culprit. The police didn't bother checking his story and he was charged; the local press published his name and address. They didn't make such a big story of it when he was released without charge however, and he had to leave our town because of the problems the accusation lead to. Meanwhile the incompetence of the police, the press and the alleged victim go unpunished. But if the laws are changed, will fewer real victims come forward without fear of recrimination which anonymity provides?      In a democracy it is right that all arrests and detentions and the manner that police conduct their investigations should be as transparent and open as possible. It is the responsibility of the media and individuals to respect the rule of law and the principle of innocent until proven guilty, for good or for bad. It is what is ""newsworthy"" and the strength of libel and slander legislation that should be the real issues here.      If you are going to name people suspected of rape then you should name the accuser as well.      As a male who was raped at the age of 11, I think it's a good idea. It leaves even less chance that anyone could find the identity of the victim. In addition, what if we're talking about a child rape here and the accused is acquitted in the court? The brush he's tarred with doesn't go away, people still suspect him. The court might have found him innocent, but his community might not necessarily have found him innocent.      While I see the fairness of not naming the alleged attacker, there is also the point that the attacker may have committed other rapes - it gives his/her other victims the chance to come forward when the attacker's name is published, as this is usually their pattern of violence/ behaviour.      As a private investigator who handles a lot of criminal defence work, I am conflicted about this issue. On one hand, I wish our state governments would institute some sort of privacy protection for the accused. On the other hand, much of my work involves finding public information of a negative nature. Looking at the big picture, the majority of my clients are convicted because they did commit the crime. Only a small percentage of innocent people are wrongly convicted, but in every instance their reputations are ruined. The question rises to one of the greater good, and I think that a transparent judicial system has to take precedence over individual interests.      There are several differences between rape and a lot of other crimes. 1) Between consenting parties it is a lawful act but without consent it becomes illegal. This cannot be said of murder. 2) It is a crime committed against the complaining party, which opens the possibility of vindictive accusation. Neither can this be said of murder. 3) ""Illicit"" sexual relations are something that a lot of people indulge in and society tolerates. However most of the people who do indulge in it would like very much to keep this a secret. This does not apply to murder. For these reasons allegations of rape should be treated more discreetly than other criminal investigations. If there are other crimes which fulfil these criteria then they should also have the same treatment.      The comments from women seem far less positive than those from men. Would women prefer the mooted Home Office lie detector test for people reporting rape, or would they prefer that both parties are kept confidential until all of the facts are known and tested? I think that the lie detector test would push the reporting of sex crime back years in terms of people having the confidence to come forward. I do not believe that maintaining confidentiality would do the same. As for parity with other crimes, short of murder what other crimes result in instant imprisonment without bail on the word of a yet to be investigated accusation.      I'm afraid that today it is necessary that suspects be kept anonymous until they are convicted. This should also be the case with various other crimes where the suspect is likely to suffer due to local press and the local population blaming them instantly. The person is innocent until proven guilty!      Not only should the accused be anonymous, but should the allegations be proven to be invented, then the accuser should be named and prosecuted for wasting police time and slander/libel. Much as I dislike the Hamiltions, I do feel that they have been victimised in this case.      If the alleged victim of ANY crime is given the privilege of remaining anonymous then the alleged perpetrator should be given that same right irrespective of the crime. Mud sticks no matter what the outcome.      I am British, but currently live in Sweden. Here the press are not allowed to reveal the name of the accused in any crime. I suppose that makes life awkward for the tabloids, but it certainly helps fair trials and fair treatment of the innocent. I would like to see it introduced at home in the UK too.      All involved should remain anonymous. I have grave doubts about the Hamilton story considering the victim went to a renowned publicist before the police and then told the whole story to the newspapers thus endangering her own story. If both accuser and accused have their identities protected until the outcome it would stop dangerously case-damaging media coverage as we now have. Once someone is named, even if they are not guilty, their life is ruined. In some countries not only does the accused face a death sentence if found guilty of rape, but the accuser, if found to be making a false accusation, also faces the same sentence. Makes you think doesn't it?      The subject of anonymity is a very difficult one to call. In some circumstances it is right for the suspect's name to be released as was in the case of that serial rapist that was a tour rep in Spain. Soon as his name was released the other frightened victims of his came forward.      However in the case of the Hamilton's then does it really serve any purpose except for maybe taint a jury's perspective. I think it must be a case of anonymity in all cases but the police can ask the court for special dispensation after producing clear and justifiable reasons for this. If a court then decides to name the suspect then the alleged victim should also be named. This would give the police the chance to gather more evidence in the serial rapist scenario but would protect the innocent from false accusations. After the event I believe that the loser of the case should be named and shamed whether that's the accuser or the accused.      I was working alone in the office with a female on Sunday. She pointed out that it was not legal for us to be in there alone (I don't know if that's true or not), but we got talking about it. Purely hypothetically, she could say I did anything and I'd have no way to disprove it. Lack of DNA or any other real evidence etc could ""possibly"" clear me, but what an individual would have to go through to get to that stage and even if cleared by a court, there is still the stigma of ever having been accused of that type of offence plus those who would never believe that nothing ever happened. The ""guilty until proven innocent"" scenario is definitely the case.      There is no smoke without fire. Besides if you shield the accused then it would be more difficult to gather facts and uncover the truth. We have cases of those who murder and cannot be charged because the witnesses withdraw.      It is terrible in cases when the accused is actually innocent but in this imperfect world one needs to take that risk. It is advisable to protect the victim's identity in rape. All other incidents can be forgotten but the stigma against a rape victim lingers on.      The accused in all crimes should remain anonymous until they are found guilty. Imagine having to face work colleagues etc after being charged with rape! You know you are innocent but your name has been splashed all over the papers. How will female colleagues and friends react to being left alone with you? Even when the not guilty verdict is given a lot of people will not be sure because the British justice system has so many holes - we all know that guilty people walk free all the time. There will always be comments made behind your back etc and it is almost guaranteed that your career will be affected. All because someone falsely accused you of a crime      Yes - it should be! Rape is not a crime in Robin's opinion, one of my colleagues - it's only a psychological disorder! I also think so. Hence, the person even if he/she committed rape, his/her identity should not be disclosed to society. It can create a negative impact on them. Furthermore, there should be moral prejudice towards him/her and moral support too.      I believe a large part of the problem with lies with criminal justice system which cannot outright declare a suspects innocence of the alleged crime. We have two verdicts, guilty and not guilty. You are found to be not guilty when the prosecution has failed to show within reasonable doubt that you committed a crime. This has a very different tone to that of innocence as it still seems to imply guilt of the accused to some degree, just that the police or prosecution didn't do a good enough job. Declarations of not guilty and innocent are not, in my mind and I dare say most others, equivalent.      If a victim of rape knows her attacker then the courts are assisting the safety of the public by naming a known suspect. Hence the public are wary of getting into potentially dangerous situations with that individual.      Unfortunately in the Hamilton's situation they seem to have a cast iron alibi, in which case the police deserve to get sued for false arrest because they didn't have the sense to check their facts before making the arrest. In cases like these the not guilty should be fully compensated for lost reputation with no financial ceiling.      This should apply to all crimes - it might prevent the media affecting the outcome... which would make a refreshing change.      Rape is seen as an extremely odious crime, and the ""stigma"" of a 'not guilty' rape verdict is far harder to shake off than the ""stigma"" of a 'not guilty' verdict for, say, criminal damage.      The victim deserves to have her/his identity shielded but in that case so does the alleged attacker.      Yes, and for a lot of other crimes too. Anyone who believes that tripe about innocent until proven guilty has obviously never been near a court in their lives. Not only do the authorities treat you as guilty until proven innocent, but so does the average man in the street who happens to hear you are up in court for something.      The Hamilton's might get some public sympathy now. It seems immoral that there name can be thrown around the front pages before charges have been brought, let alone a guilty verdict!      If a woman is proved to have lied about being raped, then I hope they are exposed as the liars that they are.      It makes you wonder why the Thatcher government reversed the law. What was in their thinking?      It is alleged that the Hamiltons were present during the alleged rape - not the perpetrators of the crime. In this case the accuser and the alleged rapist (a 60-year-old man) have not been identified to the public, thus anonymity has been preserved in the public domain.      It is unfair that the accuser never has their name made public while the accused is tried by the media even before a jury throws out the allegations. I see two variations that are far more fair:      1- Neither party is named regardless of the outcome.      2- The accused is named if found guilty. If found not guilty the accuser is named.      With either of these scenarios the spectre of a false accusation of a very serious crime should haunt far fewer innocent people.      With the all-pervasive nature of news coverage today, how can anyone expect a fair trial when it becomes ever more difficult to find a jury that hasn't been influenced by media coverage in a case such as this? No, of course we don't want anyone suspected of a serious crime free to continue with their spree but what purpose does it serve to publish identities in the national press at such an early stage of a case?      That the Hamilton's have a poor reputation in the media is one thing but does that mean they have no right to be ""presumed innocent until proven guilty""?      People accused of rape shouldn't be protected anymore than those accused of other crimes. Those accused of murder are not given special treatment. Being wrongly accused of a crime is hard, irrespective of whether it is rape, murder, theft, there is still a stigma attached to you, your family etc.      Not only fair but long overdue and I hope it will become the norm here as well. The stigma of a rape accusation lingers long after an acquittal - unless you're a Kennedy, of course.      This is obviously a very emotive issue and so it should be. The justice system in the UK as here in the USA is built upon Innocent until proven guilty, why then are ""suspects"" subjected to trial by media, as in the Hamilton scenario.      If the ""victim"" is granted anonymity, then such rules should apply to the ""suspect"" also. After the trial then definitely the outcome should be proclaimed, but the stigma of even being charged is enough to ruin peoples lives, should these charges then be found to be false, this never seems to be newsworthy. It seems that it takes a lifetime to build a reputation and one sentence to ruin it.      The problem I have here is one of consistency. It's inconsistent that one party should be named and the other should not. That's unequal treatment and can hardly be seen as fair.      I think the issue is with the way these cases are dealt with in the media, there are hundreds if not thousands of rape allegations and subsequent cases every year. They only get national attention if they are particularly horrific or if someone in the public eye is involved, this case has shown the tabloid press in its worst light.      I don't think the law should be changed but I do think the media should be forced to exercise discretion and report on sensitive cases responsibly.      Of course the law should be changed. Anonymity works successfully with minors and other sensitive cases. Plus we wouldn't have had the undoubted pleasure of Christine Hamilton's patronising smiling ego fuelled face for the last few days.      Seems a fair point. It's a despicable crime and if a guilty verdict comes in then by all means shout the name from the rooftops. But there are always people who would assume the defendant was guilty even after an innocent verdict and the accused and their families will have had to put up with months of press intrusion. If the alleged victim is entitled to anonymity then why not the alleged attacker?      Would this apply to all crimes or just rape? With any crime if you're found not guilty the stigma still remains      Defendants in almost all crimes should remain anonymous until proven guilty. The only exceptions should be where the defendant has a history of convictions for similar or more serious offences, and so does not have a reputation to tarnish. The current situation has given rise to a lot of blackmail here in Canada and in other countries; the accuser remains anonymous, while the accused has his reputation trashed. The accuser can go from victim to victim with impunity. In Canada, the accuser's name remains anonymous even when false accusations are made. "
HOC HOC-HY 3.9 " This is disgraceful. Has no one heard of plagiarism? The whole point of sitting an exam is so that the candidate is examined on his/her knowledge of the subject. If the students already know what they'll be tested on, then its not an exam...it's cheating pure and simple.      I recently took the paper, and it was definitely one of the most difficult they have set - all my friends agreed with me. Therefore, those who cheated gained an extra advantage. Since they will have done well, the grade boundaries will have gone up and those of us who are honest will get a lower grade, despite writing the same information. So it should certainly have been stopped.      I took the P2 exam on Thursday in Hong Kong. None of us knew it had been leaked until later on. It's all very well to say that a back up paper should have been used but how would they have got it to people like me in Hong Kong? The exam boards find it hard enough to send the first paper to us on time and all correct - believe me, they mess up enough!      The exam should have been cancelled due to the leak. Now the pupils who deserve an A will be left behind and the less deserving ones will succeed. The paper should have been postponed for 2-3 days to allow the examiners to write a new one. I am surprised that the board doesn't have a backup paper, which could have been used in case of a leak. I hope other pupils agree with me.      I think this incident is a sign of negligence by Edexcel in not taking the right steps in securing the paper from being leaked. I personally feel, that taking the predicted grade as a decider whether one should fail or not, does not make sense. Many candidates from my school failed in their mocks A- levels, so their predicted grade should be an E, but during that period me and my colleagues have spent hours during weekdays and weekends with teachers to sort our problems out. We therefore don't want to be named as failures because of hard work.      I was one of the students who sat the Pure Maths P2 paper yesterday. In my opinion, I think the exam should have been postponed and new questions set for another date. The exam board, Edexcel, has said that they will compare the results with predicted grades. But how fair is that? There will be students who are sitting between a A and B grade and if a student managed to buy the paper, he will get that A grade, even though without the paper he would have only got a B grade. But it wouldn't look obvious and suspicious to the examiners. How are they going to ever find out?     This year's results will certainly not be a 100% reflection on the abilities of certain students and this is most unfair to those of us who have worked very hard for the Pure Maths exam.      I took this exam and found it a tough ride - I have worked extremely hard and makes me extremely mad that Edexcel didn't have adequate security. A back-up paper should have been sent straight away! It's called an exam for a reason - those who cheated are only cheating themselves and have achieved nothing at all! and Edexcel should keep all students updated with news on whether any convictions have been made but I don't see how they are going to catch cheats.      I believe that it is quite unfair for the exam to have gone ahead. Although I did not face too much difficulty in the paper, I thought a lot of my friends found it hard and it really is unfair on them. Some people with too much money will be able to attain a good grade while my friends, who worked hard, will not do too well. On top of that, the grades are set by a curve, and the students who cheated will help raise that curve, which could significantly affect all the grades, even mine. It was very careless of the authorities to not have better security and I really think that this exam should be cancelled to be fair to all. As for the cheats, I sincerely hope that they lose later on in life. I have no sympathy for them, and I'm sure very few people will.      I'm not sure what difference it makes. After all, exams are just memory tests and all students, regardless of whether or not they've got prior knowledge of the questions, still have to understand and recall their study material. They may have been given the questions, but they still have to work out the answers for themselves.      It's easy to say that the exam should be re-run, but this would leave students having to revise this material a second time, taking time away from their other subjects, and they would have one fewer AS result to show to prospective universities when applications start in the Christmas term.      When I was at school I was predicted C, D, D/E for my A-levels. When I sat my exams I eventually got A, B, B. I never cheated, I just studied hard. I know that you can do badly in mocks but still shine in the real thing, and I feel that a number of students who will do the same as I did will now have to suffer scrutiny and self doubt rather than appreciate the praise they deserve for the hard work that they do. Sadly this is very much a case of a few bad apples spoiling the barrel.      If this exam is cancelled then we may as well cancel every other exam in the UK. Even when I was at college some 19 years ago it was common knowledge that exam papers could be purchased (though I never did), so sure have a review of the security procedures but no system will be 100% safe and exam papers will always be leaked because there is dirty money to be made.      Of course this exam shouldn't have gone ahead, at least not in the original form. The examination boards should ALWAYS have back-up papers. However the fact is that some students go into this exam with a big advantage over others, which is clearly not right. There is little chance they will catch all, if any, of the cheats as in every exam some people do a lot better than predicted. It does however go to show the pressure kids are under for exam results if they are willing to pay 400 quid for the paper!      Of course the exam should have been stopped and rescheduled. Genuine hard working students wouldn't mind so long as they are examined on an even fair playing field. The cheats are not just cheating other students in maths but possibly out of university places also.      No it shouldn't have gone ahead. The same should be said of an exam at one of my children's schools, where there was a clash and one half took the exam before lunch, the other half after lunch. The first group were meant to be isolated, but no-one had told them this, they were hungry and so went to get food. They met up with the second group and told them what was on the exam paper, thus compromising the exam. The school have not even bothered to inform the examination board of this event. There is so much emphasis placed on these exams that this will continue to happen. The people due to take the exam should now have to take the resit option in January next year.      No security system is infallible, especially when human beings are involved. I am surprised that this has not happened sooner given the importance of exam results in securing university places and jobs. However, if it leads to the abandonment of the AS exam, then some good will have come from this. I hope that students who are proved to have cheated are failed, but suspicion will not be enough for such a penalty.      I took the exam this morning and found it extremely difficult. I don't think that it is fair that other candidates should have this advantage, and in my view, the exam should have been postponed for a short while, whilst the examiners re-write a new paper! I feel cheated, to have been at this disadvantage to other candidates especially as the exam was so hard! I am anxious to hear what other pupils, and the examiners have to say about this matter.      As long as the student shows how the answer was derived, how do you show someone has cheated? This was a pure maths paper and it will be very difficult to show cheating. People who do well this time, but have not done well throughout the year should not be automatically cancelled but given every opportunity to prove their innocence. How will this affect students mentally in the next year as they go on to finish their A-levels?      I work in a school and it worries me that Edexcel have said they will fail students whose final grade is significantly better than their estimated result. I have had personal experience of students who have achieved final grades 2 or 3 grades higher than their estimated grades. Not because they have cheated, but because they have realised, following disappointing results on their mock exams (on which most estimated grades are based), that they need to WORK to do well - and work they have. Does the decision of Edexcel mean that students who have made this effort will be accused of cheating and fail?      What annoys me about this is that if a student is suspected of cheating (i.e., if they do better than their expected results) they fail. This is wrong. What happens if a student did badly on their mock exam, but has spent the time in between to work hard, revise well and achieve a good grade, but then get told they cheated and fail the whole exam? How are they going to prove that they did not cheat? I did badly on my mock A-Levels, but did well on my real A-Levels - I did not cheat, I just worked hard towards the end.      The paper should not have gone ahead because it isn't fair on the rest of the students. As an A-level maths student, I feel cheated by the fact other students had seen the paper before me. Having extra time to think about the questions makes such a difference. I can't see how the method that the board will employ to identify those who cheated will work. Those who have been predicted grades lower than what they achieve may have improved since the predictions were made, and those who were predicted high grades in the first place won't be identified. A back up paper should definitely have been used as this episode shows people can cheat and get away with it.      I think that had I been sitting this exam I would have refused to sit the paper, because any effort I made to improve upon my predicted grade would have been seen as evidence of cheating, probably the easiest solution would have been to give all students their predicted grade, dependent on the teachers recommendation. Also, it is very possible that thousands of students saw the paper, 19 hours is plenty of time for someone to email the questions anywhere in the world, so the problem could be much worse than currently claimed.      This just about sums up the disaster Curriculum 2000 has been. Especially EDEXCEL who have systematically mismanaged not only the AS levels but also the new AVCE (old advanced GNVQs)      I sat the exam in question this morning, along with many other people at my college who were all aware of the incident. From the past two years of A Level exams it's quite obvious that Edexcel and other boards normally take extreme care with the security of the exams. Today's paper leak was a very unfortunate lapse of security, and clearly the breach needs to be addressed immediately. However I think some suggestions that the exam should have been cancelled or a backup be used would not be welcome by a vast majority of hard-working students and teachers who are already faced with an admin nightmare with the new AS levels.      Today, people are discussing the leak of an AS exam. As a 15 year-old student, taking GCSEs this year, I'm not surprised there has been an event like this. Every teenager who is affected by exams will be able to tell you that the pressure they are under is immense, and has been for the duration of their courses. The extreme amount of on-going coursework these days, results in stress for months on end. Students are so worried about exams, they are making themselves ill, and some are obviously resorting to measures such as cheating. I think the UK Education System needs drastic re-thinking, before our teenagers give up on it all together.      As it appears there was no replacement paper available, cancelling the exam would have unfairly impacted the vast majority of students without prior access to the script. Honest students are going to find the exam no more difficult than they would have previously. One may hope that the scrutiny of this gaff may improve security in future. The exam board should have had contingency plans to deal with the paper being released in this fashion. That it has not, and is scrambling to regain a sense of control reflects very badly on them.      This exam should not of gone ahead. It is most unfair on students who did not have an opportunity to look at the paper. The students who saw the exam before sitting it would of been able to focus revision specifically on the questions given and receive help from text books and piers. The results from this paper must not be counted and a date for a re-take should be set.      As exams officer in a large comprehensive I am appalled that such an occurrence should happen! However, this is a modular paper and therefore for the aggregation of an award for A and A/S marks for the other modules are added. Obviously students who do very well on the 'stolen' paper and less well on any unseens should be investigated and their papers cancelled. Students are warned about cheating. I cannot imagine how this paper got into the public domain in advance of the examination.      Thirty-three years ago when I was preparing for GCE ""O"" and ""A"" levels the tutors would often set questions copied from examination papers held over from previous years. It is small wonder that when we did the real exam that they were a hybrid of previous exam questions, even if at times the wording was slightly altered yet meaning the same as the original. The amount of difference this insight made was minimal as the results were based on how well the student understood the subject of the question, not on how much of a ""sneak preview"" that was had of the set paper.     As long as the student shows how the problem was worked out, how are the exam authorities going to know that the student has cheated? They should use a substitute exam paper if they suspect foul play. Looks like a case of profits come before standards.      I am just amazed that this has not happened before. Perhaps it has and this is just the first time it has been discovered. I am concerned that the exam board are going to suspect that pupils whose exam grades are much better than their predicted scores have seen the leaked paper. It might put many students off trying to do well. In every exam I have taken my grades have been significantly better than the grades I was given in class and in fact I got a grade 1 in Physics at ""O"" level when my teacher expected me to fail. Yet I never cheated once.      I cannot believe that there was not a second paper which could have been issued. We are trying to educate our children to compete in the world of business and industry, but those charged with the responsibility of organising this process do not seem able to organise a party in a brewery.      Leaked exam papers? Students who do better than predicted to receive failing grade due to suspicion of cheating? Is this really the UK and not some pathetic Banana Republic? I have been teaching for 30 years in a public school with final Government ""A level"" exams. The actions taken by Edexcel are more reprehensible than those of the students who stole the exams and may be cheating.      So how do they decide who cheated? And given the seven deadly sins among the flaws of a human character, anyone in that situation would try to cheat, if not blatantly do so. Unfortunately, during my A-levels, exam security was pretty good, so I failed to cheat. Modern exams or not, there always has been cheating, and there always will be. Whether they get found out is another matter.      Unfortunately it would have been too late to cancel it, but the fact that the paper has been leaked will cast a big shadow over anybody who gets an A. There will always be that slight suspicion that it may not be deserved.      I am very surprised that the examination authorities do not have back-up papers to use in such emergencies as this; especially easy in the case of a Maths exam, where a simple change of the numbers could throw would-be cheats. I assume this is another one of those logistic problems where they printed off the exam papers a year ago and so can't change them. Hopefully this will spur them into taking some preventative action for the next time this occurs.      It depends. Is this exam being taken by thousands of students across the country? If so, then 80 potential cheats do not warrant the time and money required to recall the papers and set new questions.      In my senior classes many students spend many hours reviewing, studying and writing answers to sample exam questions from old exams that are in the public domain. Their final exam mark may be much higher than previous practice exams, and for good reason! Perhaps Edexel should continue their bizarre logic and fire teachers whose students score much lower on the A-levels than they did on their mock A-levels. Has the UK abandoned the belief in law that a person is innocent until proven guilty. Have the people at Edexcel given any consideration to the psychological stress placed on all students who write these exams? ""Blimey, I hope I don't do too well on this maths exam, I might fail!""      I took the paper and it was indeed quite tough compared to recent P2 papers. I believe that even the top maths students are likely to agree with me. The thing I would hate to see happen is the grade boundaries being raised just because the 100 or so students who saw the paper did much better and so shifted the average upwards. It would be very unfair to us, the honest students.      Is this the tip of the iceberg? The fraud was only detected because a student took an actual paper to a private tutor, virtually guaranteeing detection. How many other exams have been compromised? Exam boards do not take this sort of thing seriously enough. Until about 11 years ago some exam papers were not even stored in sealed plastic envelopes. They were kept in sealed brown envelopes, the exam boards must have known that such envelopes could be easily tampered with but took ages to change over to sealed plastic envelopes.      Sounds like a very small percentage of the participants may have an advantage, but to reschedule the whole thing would have been madness. It shows our obsession with grades and what pressure it puts students under. If more than 10% of the students ever use pure maths again in their adult life I will be surprised.      It would have been totally unfair to cancel the exam. Exam timetables are set out to try and offer students a chance to revise for subjects in an organised way. Cancelling the exam and re-scheduling it for a few weeks later would have been a complete mess. You can bet however that next year there will be at least one ""reserve"" paper for each exam. As an aside which idiot outsourced the examination system? That's just asking for trouble! "
HOC HOC-IZ 5.47 " There's nothing wrong with deregulation. After all, California's system was actually modelled on the UK, since our market seemed to work really well. But they didn't implement it properly, hence the mess. Ultimately, a lightly regulated market works best.      While everybody is focusing on the woes in California, few realise that privatisation has worked. In my state, Pennsylvania, it has resulted in lower electric costs with no disruption in service. The difference is that the state government does not decree what the prices should be. Also, a number of new environmentally sound power plants are being proposed and constructed in my local area.      I personally am amazed at the number of people who don't understand a fairly simple concept. If at the beginning of 1990, there are a fixed number of power plants, and a given number of people using power from those power plants, and ten years later, you double the population, and encourage development of ""clean"" industries (high-tech), consuming ever more power, while at the same time, legislating environmental regulations effectively prohibiting new power plants from coming on to the electrical grid. How can someone be shocked and surprised when eventually there's a power shortage? It's truly is incomprehensible to me.      As somebody who has experienced recently the benefits of a ""free market"" approach to power let me offer some points to ponder. The military isn't open to competitive bidding, neither is the Police force. The bottom line is that, like in the UK with its recent shambles involving water, railways and utilities the California experience shows us one thing. Pay me now or pay me later. You can believe that everything can be a market - but when it comes to such important things as Power, it's just a facade. I'm not a bleeding heart liberal to use the local term. But basically California is reaping what it sowed. The politicians should take the blame but of course they're busy drafting emergency legislation that ultimately requires funds from State taxes. This no doubt exceeds any ""savings"" from deregulation in the first place. We're moving to Seattle!      At the office where I work and the stores I visit I see the efforts to save electricity and there is concern. However it is hard for us to understand the 'Notice of Application for a rate increase' which I received in the mail. Residential increases of 33% for this year and a 76% increase by 2003. It is hard not to point fingers at corporate greed, particularly as our taxes are being used to bail out the utilities. I hope I can hit the send button before I get axed by a rolling cut!      Deregulation was not the cause of the problem as much as it was the fault of the California public to demand cheap energy but at the same time not to allow enough generating sources to be constructed to keep of with the demand for energy. Blame the environmentalists and the politicians who went along with them. You can't generate more power than you have generating plants to produce it.      I am not a socialist, communist, Marxist or any other form of collectivist. However, I believe that industries that provide either life supporting services (utilities) or strategically important functions (e.g. railways) should be under state control. I now await the flood of tort claims that will swamp the California legal system for the next decade.      The problems in California stem not from privatisation itself but from the application of the wrong kind of market model. California started rather later in the game than the UK and sort to apply the model that had been applied here, which had been proved to work. What they didn't allow for was the differing structure of the industry and the difficulty of constructing desperately needed generation capacity with strict environmental constraints and local opposition.      There are certainly parallels with Railtrack here. Back in the 1980s there was the attitude that Private meant efficient - Public meant inefficient. Management in private industry was better because it was driven by profit. This has since been proved to be a fallacy. Good management practices depend largely on recruiting the right staff and getting them to work within a clear set of objectives.      Seems in this case that that the regulations have not been revised properly and there was not enough state control to prevent a crisis. Under public ownership, there would have been a lesser chance of this happening.      As far as I understand from previous BBC Online reports, the perilous state of the Californian power suppliers has occurred because demand for power has outstripped supply, causing an increase in wholesale prices. Regulators have prevented the electricity companies from passing these price increases on to consumers. It seems to me that this 'crisis' has been created by too much regulation, rather than by too little. I also worry that consumers are being artificially insulated from the consequences of their unbridled energy use - both on prices and on the environment.      As many of the previous commentators have correctly pointed out, the problems in California reflect the contradictory ambitions of the California government and its industry/public. As a government you cannot simultaneously free up a wholesale market whilst price capping the retail market in a clumsy and short-sighted attempt to deliver a much trumpeted (and politically popular) reduction in prices. Likewise, the California public/industry cannot continue to increase their demand for power without either increasing supply (held in check by environmental concerns) or paying a higher price to ration that demand. The problem is one of contradictory ambitions not deregulation.      The current fad for the free market amongst government and intellectual circles has been going on since the 1970s, when the post-war boom ended and the oil shocks occurred. It saw the end of the post-war settlement between the capitalist class and the workers of the industrialised world.      Now the world's rulers face a backlash from the workers and a possible economic crisis (so much for the 'new paradigm'). Capitalism will either enter a new period of reform in order to avert a revolutionary situation or face a potential full-scale revolt!      I for one will be standing at the barricades in full solidarity with the international working class!      Deregulation is such a ""third way"" sort of thing - a better phase would be ""an opt out of blame way""...after all, as the old saying goes, ""team work is essential, as it allows you to blame somebody else when things go wrong"". It applies for any service that needs management, whether it be rail, gas, electricity or even internet service providers...      The benefits of privatisation, such as increased efficiency and innovation, come through competition on the open market. This makes sense as long as there are strict controls on prices and safety on essential supplies, such as water, gas and electricity. The government should always have the power to prevent the likes of what has happened in California - the benefits of deregulation must be balanced with the possible dangers.      Things, which are national assets and essential components of a country's infrastructure, should be neither privatised nor deregulated. While we would not want them to be needlessly inefficient, we should not privatise them with the expectation of making profit out of them: we have them because the cost of NOT having them is unacceptable. They should not be deregulated because society's well-being depends on them and therefore they need to be tightly controlled. I would apply these principles to education, health, energy supply, and transport, the armed forces, the law, and the police.      As I understand it, the problems in California are not due to de-regulation, but ill-judged regulation. By putting a cap on the amount it is possible for the electricity supplier to charge whilst allowing the electricity generator to charge an un-capped market rate the supplier has been forced to operate at a loss, leading to the current situation. De-regulation and privatisation can and does work in some industries, but if heavy-handed government regulation of a private industry is seen to be required it begs the question of whether that industry should be in the private sector in the first place.      If it is a typical monopoly situation providing life and limb support to the people it should be publicly owned.      Privatisation of industries to make them efficient is great, but a side effect is that they start to try and make profits. In the case of transportation, it is critical that they should only be allowed to make profits once safety is guaranteed. The various rail crashes in the UK should at least have taught us that.      Deregulation is running away with us as governments seek to reduce taxes. A short term fix has become a long term nightmare in many cases.      All this nationalisation nostalgia in the UK at the moment is sickening. Anybody who has fond memories of the old British Rail and British Telecom is in a vanishing small minority!      Maybe I'm naive, but if it is possible to run a business AND make dividends for shareholders, then surely it is possible to run the same business without the dividend and reduce the price to the consumer.Hence the essential utilities and services (power, water and transport) should be non-profit making state enterprises, with the management having the power to manage effectively within the parameters set by the government.      It is completely immoral for a goverment to create private monopolies or cartels. All essential services should be under state control, BUT unlike in the past they should be run, as near possible, like private businesses. ie. with accountability, a business plan and continuous investment. These services include, power, water and transport.      When I want to bankrupt a company I will firstly, force it to purchase its product on the free market and then secondly, force it to sell the same product at a fixed price. Then I will simply wait. As the resulting collapse looms, I will cover my tracks by coaching the media that this is ""de-regulation"". Being apparently not very bright, nor inquisitive, the media can be relied upon to believe this, and also to avoid the small morsel of intellectual probing necessary to see that the disaster is actually the result of the new regulations.      Great, just lump anything not under government control as ""deregulated"" and think you understand something. What the State of California did with electric production and distribution can be called many things, but deregulated really shouldn't be one of them.      Having lived in the UK and gauged the attitude of many British people (as a foreigner who came here thinking it was a good place to build a tech business, in retrospect, I should have gone to the US) I've realised that affection for all things state in this country is one of the reasons it is in decline. In the UK today, people oppose privatisation because it pulls away the comfy government tax-funded handout. Rail privatisation in the UK failed because in the typically meddlesome mentality of pro-excessive government types, they chose to chop it all up instead of selling it all as one single chunk.      The free market works better than anything else in the long run, deregulation hasn't gone far enough if you ask me, more deregulation, more globalisation, more capitalism is what the world needs. Wealth creation, not regulation, is what will help us beat poverty and its effects.      If you limit the price that a utility company can charge the consumer whilst enabling it to have no control over the company's costs you force the company to sell at a loss. So you get reduced investment in the industry if the problem is minor, or else drive the company into liquidation if the disparity is severe. The Californian crisis is a direct result of inappropriate regulation for which the politicians should bear the blame. However, as usual, they have passed the buck and done a spin-doctoring job to make out that the utility companies are to blame. To judge from many of the comments below, they have done that very successfully. "
HOC HOC-JL 4.8 " The Kursk must be raised at least to make sure that future Russian generations will not have a burden of raising it. This time will come anyway, so better to do it now. The sailors must be properly buried - it is time to become more civilised.      The Kursk should be raised in order to discover the full circumstances to this disaster. I must however disagree as to raising it in order to recover the bodies. The sea is a very fitting place, as a grave, for a sailor.      Given it will only become more dangerous with time due to corrosion, I think there is a duty to remove this dangerous wreck from the sea (along with several others) as soon as possible. It should be done using the combined expertise of joint international effort.      I feel the submarine should be made safe by removing all of the radioactive material, but the men should stay buried at sea as befits naval personnel who die in service.      The Kursk should be raised if Russians want to keep their dignity and reputation. Those servicemen who died should be given patriotic burial by the Russians. These are men and women who died in the line of duty for the safety of the rest of Russia.      As an ex-submariner, I think the sea makes an appropriate burial location for seamen whose ships sink beneath them. If the concern is for the radioactivity in the reactor, then perhaps other nuclear submarines which have sunk, including the USS Threasher and USS Scorpion, should be considered.      Has anyone asked the kin of the victims? If it is their wish, raise the Kursk and do it now while the summer lasts.      Raising the Kursk may well be a costly and dangerous operation. The Kursk should be raised if only to secure the nuclear weapons on board and make sure the reactor core has not been damaged or exposed in any way. If left where she lies now, then the ecological consequences in years to come due to possible radioactive discharge into the sea will be catastrophic. It is time to put cost aside as a minor consideration and make sure we do the right thing.      Why do people feel that a sunken ship is so disrespectful as a final resting-place? It was good enough for Vikings, and burial at sea is a tradition amongst many naval forces. The only reason for disturbing the wreck is to prevent pollution, or to gain safety information which will prevent further tragedies. Dragging the bodies of professional sailors from the deep to bury on land is no sign of respect.      These experimental supersonic torpedoes are why there was an explosion. And they are also why Russia was so reluctant to accept salvage and rescue assistance. The technology used to be top secret, as it will completely alter submarine warfare. It will also defeat Bush's missile shield system. But it's no longer secret. You can read about it in 'Scientific American.'      If they raise the Kursk, what then? How will they dispose of the radioactive material? Simply raising it from the seabed is not enough... they need to have a long term plan for it. Plus the relatives need to have some physical, tangible monument to their lost men, somewhere to go and to mourn.      The brave sailors of the Kursk died in the performance of their duties. Burial at sea with your ship is not a dishonourable end for a naval sailor. Let them lie where they are.      If they don't raise it, they will have to commit to guarding the wreckage from foreign intelligence agencies forever. There's just too much to be learned from a modern Russian submarine in a few hundred feet of water. It has not been mentioned much in the media, but more than likely there are nuclear missiles on board with state-of-the-art guidance systems.      It is evident the Kursk should be raised. I have two reasons: 1 The nuclear stuff on board can destroy large parts of the sea forever (the former USSR and the US too are guilty in many other cases of the same and even larger danger.) 2 If the submarine is raised, it can be a symbol that shows not only the Russian people, but also the whole world, that such military material and messages are needless and a clear sign of the ultimate decadence of our highly technologised and industrialised world. Put that next to the fact that in 50 years we will succeed in destroying 50% of today's living species...)      As the wife of a serving submariner, this topic is uncomfortably close to home, and not an easy question to answer. The relevant authorities should work quickly to finally end the speculation about what will happen to the bodies of the submariners involved. The continuing media attention and uncertainty about what will happen is merely prolonging the agony of the families in Russia.      Russia should raise the Kursk for two reasons: 1) Eliminate the chance of a radioactive leakage that could be devastating for everybody 2) Give the Russian sailors back the dignity. However, I believe the operation should be carried out jointly by Russia and International authorities to avoid any further disasters.      The crewmembers of the Kursk were, like all other workers throughout the world, doing their best to perform their jobs properly and earn their wages accordingly. They didn't set out to be heroes and are the victims of just another workplace accident. Their bodies are therefore entitled to be returned to their families. Their employer should, like all other employers throughout the world, be obligated to spare no expense in doing so.      With its two 190MW reactors, the Kursk cannot stay at the seabed in one of the most important fishing areas in northern Europe. So far, no radioactive leakage is measured from the submarine. Considering lifting the Kursk we should hurry, but not rush. We can wait another year without risking radioactive leakages. Most likely, we cannot wait 10 years. Another important question to be answered is of course what to do with the submarine after it's lifted. The plan is to take it into the naval yard between Murmansk and Severomorsk. That does not solve the problem, only moves it. Therefore, the lifting plan should also involve a plan for a proper decommissioning of Kursk's two reactors.      It will be hard, risky, dangerous and expensive... But necessary! The sea isn't a trashcan!      It should be raised, preferably under international supervision, in order to recover the nuclear material and to establish once and for all the cause of the sinking so that it is not repeated, maybe in a less remote location. Lessons could also be learned which will improve the chances of rescuing sailors trapped in similar circumstances in the future.      The Kursk must be raised. Think of the nuclear reactors that it has on board. Think of the problems there will be in the future about radioactivity. For next generation this will be a very big problem. We must think now.      It is my opinion that the feelings of the bereaved relatives must be taken into account and, if it is possible to remove only the radioactive material, then the bodies of the submariners should be left in peace. However, if this is not possible and the only safe method of removal is to raise the entire submarine, then the environmental considerations MUST take precedence.      The Kursk should be raised as it will give a chance for the families of the dead seamen to give them a proper burial instead of leaving them in the cold dark water.      The Kursk is obviously an environmental disaster waiting to happen. It must be raised despite opposition from some of the families involved. Yet, after seeing botched Russian attempts to save the crew, I hope this venture will receive the full international backing it needs.      I think by now Russia should be thinking of raising the Kursk from the ocean. This should also sound a warning to our leaders that a nation is supreme because of its men and not its military exploits.      I do not know (like most other people) what state the main body of the submarine is in, but I do realise that the easiest and least dangerous way to raise the reactor will probably be whilst it remains in the submarine. It sounds harsh, but I therefore feel that the bodies of the seamen are somewhat of a lesser priority than the making safe of a nuclear reactor that will stay radioactive for a number of centuries - long after the submarine itself will have rusted to pieces.      The German battleship Blucher sunk in Oslofjord in World War II. Leaks of diesel 50 years later led to a substantial and dangerous operation to drain what remained. The Kursk is storing-up a similar, only worse, fate for future generations. Better to attempt the nuclear recovery now whilst information is available and the vessels structural integrity is intact. The needs of the relatives are also important. This may help them come to terms with their grief. Ideally the reactor and grave could be separated and the grave left alone, but this is unlikely. Better to plan how to deal with the bodies, and comfort the relatives as part of the operation.      Definitely the Kursk should be raised. A submarine is not a suitable tomb for human bodies and it is the right of every human, military or civilian to a dignified resting place. These men gave their lives for their country, the least Russia can do is put their souls to rest.      Ever since man ventured from the shore he has had to live with the possibility that he might never make it back. This is particularly true for the sailors in every navy in every period of time in the world's history. Submariners more than any other have had to live with the frightening reality that death under the waves would at best be quick and sudden, at the worst, slow and terrifying. These men knew the risks they had to take in order for them to do their jobs, and despite the dangers went to sea to serve their country. It is only fitting that men of this calibre, courage and tenacity should have the sea as their shroud. They are in gallant company. Do what can be done to contain any radioactivity, but let the men lie in peace.      The Kursk must be raised. We cannot afford to leave nuclear reactors, along with their sordid contents, rotting on the bottom of the ocean ready to mutate the DNA of any creature that swims past. Look at all the deformities and disease caused by the Chernobyl incident. Being out of sight under the sea does not make these evil substances any less harmful!      The Kursk should definitely be raised. It's only in 100 metres of water which isn't very deep. The environmental considerations should come first - not to mention finding out exactly what happened. This accident could provide us with knowledge for the future, making a second accident an impossibility.      While my heart goes out to the families of those poor sailors who died, I'm sure they would be the first to agree that there is no point in bringing up the bodies of their loved ones if others may die as a result. If, and only if, it is going to be 100% safe to bring up this submarine, should it be done. But the relatives of the dead should be asked first whether they want this to happen, or whether they would rather mourn them where they are.      It depends purely on the dangers in involved in such an operation versus the dangers of doing nothing and letting the waste leak out and contaminate the sea. While I have sympathy for the families of those who lost their sons on the sub, I am sure every soldier that enters any kind of army is aware of the risk to life and limb this implies, and Putin was wise not to interrupt the rescue effort with his personal presence      I doubt very much whether the decision to raise the submarine has anything to do with giving those who perished a proper funeral. The one and only reason to raise it should be due to radioactive contamination concerns. As for establishing once and for all the real cause of the accident, I doubt whether a visual inspection on the surface will change any minds. From all accounts, the front of the sub was devastated. Those Russian officials who still want to perpetuate the collision or old mine theory will still stand their ground. Just like the Egypt Air disaster, it doesn't matter what the evidence shows; these people have their interests to protect.      The Kursk should be raised in order to find out how and why it sank. Both the recovery and subsequent investigations should be performed by a multinational team to prevent anybody from tampering with the evidence.      It should be raised and the dead bodies given a decent mass grave and the Kursk taken as national monument.      Recovery of the bodies of the crew is not a sufficient reason for raising the Kursk -- the hundreds of ships that went down during the Second World War (many of them in shallow water) were not raised for that purpose either, nor, more recently, was the ferry Estonia which sank in the Baltic. If recovery of the reactor separately is sufficient to prevent environmental harm and is possible, then that should certainly be done. On the other hand I hardly doubt that the Russian Navy already knows exactly what caused the Kursk to sink.      There have been many comments about giving the dead a 'proper burial'. No one has actually asked the relatives of those that died if they want their bodies raised. Many will now have said their final goodbyes from a boat above a watery grave. If they want bodies brought up then fine, however, whilst the nuclear material needs to be rendered safe in some way, the families of those that died should have some say as to what happens to the bodies of their relatives. If this means that the whole submarine can be raised, great. If it means that the warheads and reactors only are salvaged, then that is what should be done.      Governments should stop riding roughshod over the feelings of the people and relatives of those that have lost their lives for their country. Equally, who are we in the Western world to tell the Russians what to do? they are a civilised country and can come to their own decisions as to what is the correct thing to do within their culture.      If it isn't raised, the environmental impact will be massive. However, to risk raising a hull weakened by two explosions could be even worse. The safest thing for all would be to make the reactors safe and no more.      Too many questions lie unanswered over the wreck of the Kursk. By raising the ship, perhaps we may be able to establish what happened to her and her crew, and how to prevent it happening again. When the complex issue of nuclear material lying on the ocean bed also comes into the equation, I don't think we can afford to let the Kursk lie. Any attempts to raise her should be executed and funded by the UN, so the truth is known and the cost not borne by a country with financial difficulties.      The Kursk should be raised not only to clarify the circumstances of its sinking but also to give the seamen who died a befitting burial. The Russian nation should be given the opportunity to honour these men posthumously. They died a horrific death, they do not deserve eternal imprisonment on the seabed.      What about the risks of leaving the submarine alone at the bottom of the sea? As the submarine corrodes it will inevitably leak radioactive waste into the ocean. It will eventually have to be dealt with. Raising it now, while complicated, will be no less complicated when the sub needs to be removed in the future and is in worst condition than it is now.      Our Russian allies should raise the Kursk, only if such action is the consensus of those families who lost loved ones.      The fact almost never mentioned is that the Kursk had on board nuclear-tipped warheads and torpedoes, which Command of the Northern Fleet desperately tried to deny. It is them that cause more danger than the plutonium on the submarine's reactor.      The question is do we raise it now while the hull is in reasonable sound condition or wait until the radio activity leaks causing a barren sea in which nobody can work. An alternative may be to encapsulate it in concrete and wait for technology to advance. Either way at some point those reactors must be raised.      I think only the radioactive material and arms should be salvaged from the Kursk. No doubt this would cost a lot less than salvaging the whole submarine and it reduce the risk to near by Norway.      Despite a complete lack of evidence to the contrary, senior Russian Admirals continue to suggest that the Kursk may have sunk after collision with a Western vessel. If raising the Kursk for all to see finally lays that theory to rest, then it is definitely worth it -- because it will force the Russian Navy to consider its own responsibility in the accident and its aftermath.      There would obviously be an ongoing risk of contamination in the future if the site weren't cleaned up now. Also it is necessary to find out exactly what happened in order to reduce the chance of another incident in the future. When there is an air crash at sea, all possible material is recovered for investigation. The same principle should be applied here.      Where's the respect for those young sailors who were allowed to die in horrific conditions? Raise the Kursk.      The Kursk should be raised purely so the families of those who died can lay their dead to rest. The Russian government is obviously only thinking of the money.      The Kursk submarine has a nuclear reactor on board. I presume that it is full of radioactive material, plutonium, which is a very dangerous substance. Has anybody considered the future costs and other implications of not raising the sub?      The Kursk cannot be left as it is anyway, because the radioactive material will be more dangerous in the long run. But wouldn't it be safer if those materials simply removed by divers?      I can understand the victim's families wanting to have their loved ones returned to them for proper burial and since Russia is financing this venture I see nothing wrong in that. But I am a little wary in regards to whether or not this is a health hazard and if there are not sufficient guarantees it might be better to wait until an international body of experts examines the feasibility of such an undertaking first.      NO NO NO - let these souls rest in peace. It will certainly not help the relatives to raise this wreck and it will not help the men who have the task either. I know someone who assisted in raising a sub nearly 20 years ago and he still has nightmares about it! All that and the cost and risk to more lives is just not worth it. Leave it buried at sea!!      There is no ship in existence which can raise the Kursk to the surface. The Kursk weighs over 5000 tons. The USA once attempted to raise a Russian submarine with the Glomar Explorer. The attempt failed. There is simply no technology at present which can safely snatch 5000 tons of waterlogged steel from the ocean floor.      Only the nuclear part should be raised. The bodies should be left there and it should be marked as a sea grave. As long as we are respectful of the dead we can still give them some dignity and take away the nuclear waste.      The Russians are the least qualified to raise the Kursk, or even to say if it should be.      I have worked for the company that will raise the Kursk. If T.J. Cassidy knew anything about it, the raising companies are American and Dutch. The Norwegian government are the ones who have requested and partially funded the recovery.      Raising the Kursk submarine is a bad idea for many reasons. It is a very risky operation that could ultimately see salvage workers and the environment in the Barents Sea area destroyed. It will cost a backbreaking amount of money, for an ailing Russian economy, that could better use this money to keep accidents such as the K-141 disaster from occurring again. Many of the families who lost their loved ones on August 12, 2000, wish their men to remain buried at sea. It would be heartbreaking to see them further upset by an already extremely painful incident.      Furthermore, the Russians will probably omit the infamous torpedo room compartment from this recovery mission. Without compartment I, it is unlikely that new answers can be provided as to what really caused this accident in the first place.      Whilst it was a tragic incident, which left many questions unanswered, is it really our place to make decisions for the Russians? They've had people in space and have the technological know-how to do many things which the UK can't. Let them decide for themselves. How would we appreciate it if the Russians told us how to solve the foot-and-mouth crisis? "
HOC HOC-JY 4.6 " When government policies are targeted towards particular sections of the community (eg the minimum income guarantee for pensioners, combating benefit fraud etc.), it seems a sensible use of resources to advertise to make people aware of their rights and responsibilities. Otherwise, the government gets criticised for not telling people what they're entitled to or, in the case of benefit fraud, not entitled to. So, it seems, whatever the government does it's in the wrong!!      I am appalled at the amount of money the Government has spent on advertising so far this year. Just think what that money could have achieved for the people of this country if it was given to local authorities instead.      Yes I whole-heartedly endorse the significant rise in advertising by the Labour Party. The issue however is that the advertising should highlight the political, economic, cultural and moral ineptitude of the present 'government' and not the endless spin and deceit which is sadly all Labour is able to provide in substance and quantity.      There should be no TV advertising by political parties as it is a waste of money. Door-to-door canvassing in the streets and party political broadcasts are quite sufficient I think. Sixty million pounds could build a hospital, fill it with life saving machines and staff to work them. It's scandalous!      It's a complete waste of money, which could be better spent elsewhere. But this Government just insists on wasting money, at every opportunity (remember the DOME)      I think that the Government can do a better job of recruiting nurses, teachers, social workers, police by investing in those services. Running an advertising campaign to make people feel better about jobs they already have won't solve anything. The Government should not squander precious taxpayer money on spin; it should invest it in the future of Britain.      Either you're condemned for poor take-up of government initiatives, or you're condemned for promoting them.      Would the public forget about politics without advertisment? I don't think so, especially if one considers the present situation in the countryside. Ads don't help to solve these problems but I think they are necessary because it helps many people to get at least the slightest idea why to vote for a certain candidate. The poster had a nice colour! Cynical? True!      The amount of taxpayer's money they've spent on advertising is insane, I can understand advertising campaigns for recruiting more nurses and police officers. But advertising that just boosts Labour's media profile is just a blatant waste of money on something that doesn't serve any useful purpose for the country. If Labour want to boost their media profile, then let them pay for it from their own bank accounts and not the taxpayers.      This is yet another example of the cynical nature of this Government. Everybody here agrees on one thing. This money could have been spent on the services themselves. Good work would bring good publicity. This is just blatant pre-election campaigning, but disguised (badly). Not that the Tories or Lib Dems wouldn't have done it, had they thought of it when in power!      I applaud the government for attempting to inform people of their rights. However, as someone who has recently become a father for the first time and who had to jump through the Chancellor's many hoops, I can confirm that the money could be saved by having fewer daft initiatives and simplifying the tax system. For instance, how many of you know that the Working Families' Tax Credit and the Children's Tax are different things applied for on different forms to different departments? That's why they have to advertise so heavily.      The reality is that the media industry demands sound bites and advertising campaigns, otherwise it largely ignores issues. The government - of whatever party - has to resort to mass advertising to inform its electorate of new policies and initiatives. If too little money is spent governments are accused of hiding policies and trying to save money, and if they spend adequately are then open to accusations of wasting taxpayers cash. Once again, an issue gets between the policy and the people. We are side-tracked into concerns over how the policy is delivered, rather than the policy itself. Democracy suffers in the process.      Most of the adverts are SO dreadful, I can only assume the advertising industry see the UK government as a cash cow waiting to be milked. There are enough adverts littering our streets and stealing the time we have for our own thoughts - the government should cut advertising down to the smallest possible amount. Just tell us when the elections are, so we can boot the lot of you out!      I know that in Australia, at least, much of government advertising is grossly overdone. I know I speak for many when I say all we want is the facts - what we need to know presented simply, intelligently and to the point...      These figures showing that Tony Blair's government is now the biggest advertiser in the country are far from surprising. After all, New Labour has always been about spin over substance. One has to feel some sympathy for the junior minister and sacrificial lamb wheeled out by Millbank to claim that the rise in spending before a likely election was a coincidence. This government is very good at spending taxpayers' money and these new figures simply reaffirm that Labour is all mouth and no delivery.      I do not think it is a waste of money. If #60million is supposed to have been spent, that amounts to #1 per person in this country. The government is promoting the stakeholder pension and most people do think that saving for retirement is important. It is also well known that for example there are huge numbers of pensioners (about 200,000) who are entitled to income support) but do not claim it. The government is also helping the tourist industry at the international level.      I wouldn't mind so much if the adverts were constructive - as it is, the only election-related ones I've seen have been the standard, playground-style ""my party's better than yours"" cobblers which does nothing apart from show politicians up as the childish morons most of them are. Still, since the Tories hit the world with ""Labour's not working"", adverts don't have to rely on policies any more. After all, politics doesn't either.      I don't think the advertisements are really saying 'We'll do this if you vote for us' or 'we have been successful in doing this so vote for us', therefore it isn't fair to criticise the government for peddling propaganda. In actual fact they are being honest (for a refreshing change!) in saying that the public services are on a sticky wicket in terms of recruitment quotas, which may not cause a positive association anyway. Police colleges are filling up, and families are able to increase their income through entitled, but non-claimed benefits, so it should be considered as money well spent.      Put simply, if we want to recruit police, teachers and nurses then we need to advertise for them. As the biggest employer in the country, is it not probable that the government should have the biggest recruitment drive and therefore the biggest advertising spend? What would be the alternative - not advertise and then get criticised for not recruiting enough? And of course advertising spending is twice as much as last year - there are many more recruitment drives and more benefits that can be claimed, all of which were set out in previous budgets. There is nothing short-term or electioneering in this; the advertising will help recruit the very people we want - police, teachers, nurses. People who complain about the lack of these professionals should welcome the advertising spend.      I thought that the government had just spent about 500 million pounds on a website to advertise vacancies such as this. Instead of wasting money on advertising and Internet sites, why don't they make the jobs worth having in the first place?      On one side of the coin, it can only be a good thing that saturation advertising from Whitehall lets people know about benefits, registering to vote, the census and so on. If this helps people to realise what they can apply for, get and benefit from, great (if they could just get those forms so that you don't get fed up half way through a tree of paper for the sake of #20 a month......) On the other side of said coin, it is horrifying that they need to spend that much. Where does the money go for it to cost that much, and could this money not be used to help a few schools and hospitals?      I think the money is truly well spent. After all how would we know that the Government is doing a good job unless it tells us!      I think that government ads are a waste of time, particularly where the general election is concerned. I think that they should advertise themselves positively, for example highlighting their achievements since 1997, instead of trying to destroy the Conservatives with their ""Economic Disaster 2"" advertisement.      It is complete hypocrisy for any Tory - or Tory supporter - to criticise New Labour for ""ludicrous"" amounts spent on advertising. Millions were spent to proudly advertise the fact that the Conservatives were to sell off assets that were the property of the taxpayer. Remember the milkman delivering all the bottles of water a household would need? Or ""Tell Sid"" ad nauseam? Or perhaps any Tory would like to justify the adverts currently appearing on billboards near you criticising New Labour for the mess the last government left them in? Let's face it, any advert claiming ""You paid the tax, so where are the trains?"" when the Tories privatised the rail network really IS ludicrous.      I would rather see the money spent on advertising being put back into society in form of aid to pensioners, NHS staff housing, better medical equipment and free higher education at university level. I find it sickening to watch the government spends millions of pounds of our money on public slanging matches with the opposing party. It's sickening to think that #60 million has been spent in the last 3 months alone. The money should be given back to the people in the form of better transport, education, health services etc.      This issue has little to do with the particular government in place and more to do with people being so politically apathetic. Political parties need to advertise so that people are mobilised into voting, instead of not even bothering to turn out on election days. Many people in this country do not deserve their democracy because they can't even be bothered to take part as active citizens.      This government knows exactly what it is doing when it comes to the media. To claim that the increase in spending is a ""coincidence"" is another example of the Government treating us like idiots. Its all spin, spin, spin - last minute hype to make it look like they are doing something.      Why do the government need to advertise to encourage families to claim the new children's tax credit? Is it that it's so complicated that the people it's aimed at don't understand it?      As has so often been mentioned, this Government is obsessed with appearances and style. At one end, you have the spinning that is orchestrated by the likes of Peter Mandelson and Alistair Campbell, but this particular spending, whilst admittedly being very high, is to make people take up state relief and benefits being offered to them, and to recruit people into state services. I agree with the PM on this one. After all, high profile campaigns to recruit police officers and teachers appear - at long last - to be paying off.      The waste of taxpayers' millions on advertising is pretty bad coming from a government that boasted it would improve health and education. (There's a primary school near my home where kids are taught in huts that were built at the end of WW2 designed to be only temporary housing.      Watching the level of this Government's advertising can only be a good thing. When I see a poster saying how great the NHS is I know they've made a shambles of it. When I see a poster reminding me to fill in my census form I recall how much money is being spent on a glorified electoral roll. The campaign about stakeholder pensions never lets me forget how badly this Government screwed that up as well. It's great - I don't need to do anything except look at posters to find out where the Government is struggling to achieve anything.      It appears that the Conservatives are upset at valid attempts to inform poor people of their benefits and to attract people to jobs in the infrastructure that the Tory government ran down and their press ridiculed. Is this because the benefits that have been advertised would be scrapped and the new people recruited by the adverts would have to be sacked by a Hague government to pay for its planned tax cuts?      Surely it is not coincidence that the surge in advertising comes just before a possible election in June. Another scheme to muddy the waters to get Joe Public to forget the Millennium Dome waste of monies, muddy the waters to let Joe Public forget the screw-up the Ministry of Agriculture made of the foot-and-mouth disease and next the vote catcher of giving money in trust to new born babies for their future education. I've got a good idea, lets introduce FREE education for our future generation. But that's probably too radical for this money wasting egotistical Government. P.S. How much of the tax-payers money has been paid to the UNELECTED ministers, and spin doctors?      #60 million! That's almost as much as three days' continued membership of the EU!      Whilst the Conservative Party were in government Mr Blair's judgement, and that of his colleagues, was that taxpayers money spent on advertising was a disgrace and merely Party political propaganda. It is good to know Mr Blair is so flexible in his thinking - and on so many issues.      If the political parties did anything worthwhile they would not need to advertise, like any good product word of mouth and would be enough. Apart from the fact that there are a million better places to spend #60 million.      Public information can be very useful for informing the public about new policies, referendums, etc. But when the Government is using huge sums of money simply as election propaganda, this is a waste of taxpayers money.      This Government seems more biased towards presentation than to delivery, so it is not surprising that near an election, advertisements ostensibly promoting public services dramatically increase. As with any product with glossy packaging, satisfaction can only be assured by the contents; as far as this Government is concerned I feel very disappointed and annoyed with their over-reliance on hype.      I believe the police training colleges are now just about full, which vindicates at least some of the expenditure doesn't it? Perhaps the critics would rather there were perpetual staff shortages in the public services simply because they don't really believe in them.      Yes, it's a waste of taxpayers' money. If the government wants to encourage more recruitment of teachers, nurses and police then surely it should stop undermining their activities at every opportunity. Perhaps the government could start by keeping some of its previous election promises on education, the NHS and crime.      If it has to advertise so heavily in order to attract people to the state-run professions then there is something wrong with the way those professions are being run. Being a teacher, a nurse, a fireman or some other socially useful thing always seems attractive to children - but then they don't usually try to match pay packets to mortgages! If the employment conditions and the remuneration package were sufficient less advertising would be needed.      It appears that Tony Blair has changed his policy of country before party - clearly Labour party advertising seems to be more important than saving the tourism industry.      Would it not make more long-term economic sense to invest the same #60m in better conditions & facilities for teachers, nurses and the police? Then the media would provide all the advertising free of charge.      Is anyone claiming that these are ""vote Labour"" posters? I suppose some may claim that they highlight what the government has been working on this (and every) year of their term and are therefore political. Well, the civil service has been implementing these policies. Does that make them political? Of course not.      Perhaps a few common misconceptions should be cleared. None of this advertising is directly spent on party political purposes; the Central Office of Information strictly maintains impartiality in this respect. Furthermore, if you consider that most government projects consist of huge sums and can be highly complex, then the advertising spend compares well with private industry.      Most of the adverts I've seen don't seem to be advertising the Labour party at all. I think it is a coincidence, though I think it's good that we question it. We should have an independent board to make sure such accusations can be dismissed or investigated.      As the Government admits, most of the money has been spent advertising for more police, nurses and teachers who all say their main problem is the cost of housing. Why is this money not being spent on tackling the root of the problem - providing more homes so that prices become affordable once more?      I am happy for them to spend money on public information campaigns such as 'speed kills'. For example, we need a campaign to reassure drivers that it's not compulsory to overtake cyclists.      #60m on flaunting their own image! This is scandalous how many operations or police on the street would this have paid for? Spin doctors gone mad, this could only account for it.      Whilst I agree that the sudden increase in spending does look a little suspicious I also believe that a government must be allowed to communicate with its people as long as political content is not included and is confined to party political broadcasts.      Fantastic! The Government appears to have had a huge advertising campaign that has completely passed me by! Under these circumstances it seems to be a complete waste of money. But the money could have been spent on many different things which would in the end have resulted in far more positive advertising. All parties are the same, they are all to blame for encouraging the mud-slinging environment.      Sixty million pounds is absolutely obscene. This is twice the amount of the largest corporate advertiser in the UK! Of course, this figure is only for the last three months, so by the end of the year it should be #240M. This could have been an extra #5.7M for each police force in the country. This Government needs to more accountable due to their cavalier manner in how they spend our money. Its time they bowed their heads in shame and left office, we can't afford any more of their amateur bungling. "
HOC HOC-KD 4.77 " When offices have the Internet and someone is looking something up for work, it is almost impossible not to be sidetracked by something interesting. As long as work is still getting done, to dwell on this issue too much would be bad for morale. And if it was totally banned, this website would probably have half the comments on it that it currently does.      If you don't want to be a jobless dinosaur - do the job well and use the Internet together.      I am writing this whilst at work, though as my company is an online journal and I work late, the Internet connection is constant and there is no bandwidth restriction. Regardless of this though, I think employers should allow their staff to surf as long as it does not impair their work. In many cases sitting in front of a screen WITHOUT an Internet break is probably more detrimental to an employee's performance.      If I couldn't monitor my shares via the Internet at work then I would have to leave work, as I would lose too much money. It doesn't have any effect on my productivity, but it would have an enormous effect if I were unable to access the web.      When you are at work, your time isn't yours - it's the company's. Surfing the net, goofing off, not doing the work - that's stealing time and is a form of theft. Unless surfing the net is in your job description, it shouldn't be done while on the job. I don't think many employers pay employees to surf the net.      If BT et al speeded up the roll-out of affordable broadband for home users, then perhaps workers wouldn't be so inclined to use the high-capacity corporate networks. Once you get used to always-on connections at work, downloading big files and using high-graphics websites over a stroppy 56k modem at home loses a lot of its charm.      While I agree that Internet access should be available to all, what many people seem to miss is the potentially huge cost associated with providing an Internet connection to employees. Would you let your boss come to your house and use your home Internet connection for work purposes?      I work for the Dig Media dept. for a large company. We have an always-on connection, and sometimes I can be led astray on to the net. However I see it as much better than having the company spend more money on net training when it can be done at quiet points during the day, free to the worker. I also think it goes against the principal of the net - it's meant to serve as a network of information, one which I find invaluable. Those MD's who ban net access and find it 'bad' should look into the future of business and serve their employees.      I work in Customer Service for a very large UK company. I feel it's okay to use the Internet at work as long as it doesn't interfere with the work. I surf the net in between calls. There is usually, on quiet days, a good 5-10 minute gap in between calls. So, as long as no harm is done, then carry on. I think it's rubbish that I can't go on to most chat rooms though, due to Firewalls, that's the only thing that gets me.      I surf, I get my job done - and I do my job well.      Three hours? I spend whole days surfing the net. I'm a temp working for a large telecoms company and I feel that as long as my work gets done (which it does) then there's no problem. It keeps me coming in day in day out, otherwise I would have left my boring, mundane job ages ago! However my boss may see things differently.........      I think it's fair enough to do it if it's there, but certainly not abusing it for over an hour. Most good companies won't mind, But if you push it, then that's a different story.      Workers here and around the world have survived for generations without the Internet in the workplace. It is, without a doubt, a valuable business tool but if it is used for anything other than work, the worker is getting paid for nothing, and that can't be good.      Where else I can surf?      Whether surfing the internet during work hours is a problem depends on the person. I observe my co-workers and the majority of them are reasonable in the way they surf the web. However there are a few (me being one of them) who continually abuse the privilege. My company knows exactly what sites everyone visits and how long we are at these sites. I found this out when they showed me a printout of my online activity and told me to try and stay on task. It was very effective and since then I been a very good boy.      I couldn't agree more on saving money on training. Let's not forget the fact that many people walk around the office and chat. In my opinion, as long as you're done with your assignment, I don't see a problem with surfing the web for personal use during office hours. If strict internet usage is imposed, what about stretching your legs and arms? Chewing gum? Going to the watercooler? Glancing around to relax your eyes?      Does anyone read a newspaper during the lunchhour? How many times a day do you go to get a cuppa? And for the nicotine addicts, how many minutes do you spend attached to a 'fag' each day? The Internet is a vast resource of information, and if used sensibly - and legally - it should not be an issue, and certainly it won't use up the sort of time that the above activities might. The legal aspect does need to be considered though, since too many companies do not have any kind of content filtering to stop the 'porn' and 'gaming' sites. Preventing 'unnecessary' downloading would also help, and since a lot of companies use 'permanent on' leased lines at a flat rental per annum, where's the cost?      I am an engineer for a large Telecoms company and have the privilege of being connected all the time but this does not give me the right to use the Internet for anything other than work related items. Why should an employer allow otherwise? Anyway the company policy is quite clear and anyone found doing so is risking his or her job. As a nation, we might work the longest hours, but it sounds as though some of us only 'work' for half that time!      Would I, as a Director, allow my staff to surf the web for several hours each day? Certainly not. For the same reason that I would not allow them to read magazines or newspapers for several hours a day. Use of the Internet should be considered the same as any other distraction. Lunchtimes and breaks are when we read newspapers and magazines. Lunchtimes and breaks are when we surf the net.      As a student I get free access 24 hrs a day at super-fast speeds in my room. While revising I also surf but believe this helps me concentrate. Like someone in the Gym, you need quick breaks so that when you are working you are totally focussed. It also helps workers to educate and inform themselves about important issues such as this. Perhaps, then, only sites like this one should be allowed or would that be a dose of big brother too far? Finally, for a lot of people work is their only access, or only fast access, to the net so workers often need it.      Well, I'm at work right now and I use the Internet more than I do tasks ... fight the power!!!!!      No I don't think it's O.K. to surf when you're being paid to do something else. But then people pop out for a cigarette at every oportunity, and I've never seen anyone clocking off to do that. I don't work with computers, I don't smoke - maybe I'm just too smug for words, but at least I'm not cheating my employer.      I am on the phones for most of the day and have a target number of calls to make. It is only possible to do this for so long without taking a break and rather than leaving the desk, every 10 or so calls I go for a surf on the net. I don't see a problem with this. We all do it. Just some are more open than others!!      Surfing on the net, I think it is not a problem. If you perform well at work, accessing the net during working time is permitted. It is only a way to get some pleasure in a boring job.      Well I do admit that I use net from my office, but this has not ever raised a smallest of dissent on the part of my boss. This is because it is a kind of de-stresser to me and I am more efficient if I get this kind of flexibility at my workplace.      I currently work for BT, and have the luxury of the internet being connected all day long from my work station, I would say it is a very big distraction at times though. I myself think that it can be both useful and a distraction though      A boss often views his employees use of resources, based on his own, if he mainly surfs for pleasure he is unlikely to recognise the work potential. Valuable information is abundant on the net. It takes practice to extract it efficiently.      I'm beginning to understand why computers don't deliver expected improvements in productivity.      As a specialist in Internet security systems, it is my view all company security and network usage policies should be enforced by implementation of relevant security products. It is not right to let them surf what they wish and then fire them for misconduct, which is effectively entrapment.      Well I'm reading this article so I suppose I am surfing on company time. However half the office take cigarette breaks every 30 mins so I really don't feel too bad!      The only people who care overly about staff using the Net for personal surfing are bad managers and the media as part of their continual ""oh isn't the Internet awful"" campaign.      Web surfing for personal pleasure helps to relieve the stress of the working environment. I personally think it should not be classed as an addiction, what with more and more of business being conducted by the WWW. Employers should view web browsing as getting web trained staff for free.      Being close to the Internet in Asia for a number of years and currently having the dubious honour of being a corporate Internet access administrator I find no problems with staff using the internet for personal use. When there is over-utilisation of the resource then I do take action but more job functions are benefiting from information shared on the Internet. Staff using the resource for personal use has the benefit of providing free training for when they have to use the same resources for business. When a person is interested in a particular topic then it enhances the experience and builds confidence in using a resource that for many people is still very new. After all, Windows Solitaire did teach people new to computers how to use a mouse!      I surf at work for around 5 hours a day. The company doesn't seem to mind - as it is an ISP, it is virtually impossible to stop. They have restrictions about what we can look at, ie not pornography/nazi web sites, but essentially it is unlimited access.      The Internet gives us a good source of information and often helps in my IT related job. Being able to surf also stops insanity setting in for people who are stuck at their desk for 8 hours a day!      The Internet is good for moral, it also allows the employees to view the outside world form their desktops. I believe as long as the employee is in the office and not restricted, he/she will always be productive      Isn't the debate already over? If employers really felt that Internet use was damaging their productivity, then they would start censuring employees. If it becomes a problem for employers, you can be sure that they will take action to resolve it. The very fact that you don't hear about firings for reading the news on the net is proof that employers are not particularly concerned.      The problem is that so many people do not really understand how the Internet works. There is nothing more infuriating than trying to access the Internet for work-related matters and waiting ages for the pages to load because some idiots in the next office are taking up unnecessary bandwidth with gossip and joke sites (particularly those with the funny pictures that invariably find themselves in everyone's inbox within 20 minutes). The company I work for has a strict Internet usage policy. They do not pay us good money to do what WE want to do. Accessing sites such as Hotmail is completely banned where I work, as the virus protection on such web mail sites is virtually non-existent. Also, the sites you are accessing can see who has been logging on to their site, and it does not look good for your company if numerous people from the same office are spending hours a day on shopping channels.      I work in a call centre and when it's a bit quiet and there are long gaps between calls then I don't see anything wrong with surfing the net. Smokers are ""allowed"" to have ""fag breaks"" so non-smokers should be able to surf the net as an alternative during quiet periods. We have a large corporate intranet so there's plenty of company information that we look at; however I can't see anything wrong with wanting to catch up on the latest news via the web between calls.      Occasionally I bring work home where I am better able to concentrate and my productivity is better. I am sure that I am not alone - spending good surf time doing work - but I have never been threatened with disciplinary action for it.      Who is paying for all the lost time and call costs? Eventually it is passed on to us all as consumers so it's not fair for the honourable non-surfers.      Being a director of an IT company, I often monitor my staff for use of e-mail and Internet access. The thing that a lot of people don't seem to understand is how expensive training courses are to teach people about the Internet. A few of my staff that do non-IT jobs didn't know much at all about the Internet until they started surfing during quiet times of the day. I have not had to pay hundreds of pounds to train them, they have done it themselves. As long as they don't download applications that could cause security risks, they are free to look at whatever sites (non-porn) that they like. It has saved me money rather than cost me money! My advice...Let people use it if they have nothing else to do as long as they show restraint and treat the web like any other perk. Use it sensibly and use it to learn.      I don't think it is a crime at all to surf the net at work. The fact of the matter is they can't keep us busy long enough not to surf the net.      I think that as long as our duties are done, some distraction during work is OK. Don't be obsessive about cost of private surfing paid by your company. Next step would be to pay for water and electricity used to make our coffee at work. If work is really very demanding, one will never have time to surf the net or smoke outside.      As long as I'm turning in quality work, on time, to specification and generally keeping my company's customers happy, what does my boss have to complain about?      Internet access should be kept to a minimum during office hours - should be allowed during breaks and possibly before and after the working day. Obviously the content should not be inappropriate. One point is that major companies pay for Internet access as a one-off fee for the whole year (leased lines); therefore it doesn't cost them extra for personal e-mail/internet traffic.      I'd love to comment, but my office has just cracked down on frivolous Internet use, and I may have to get off at any seco      I have the best of both worlds because I work for an ISP in the Tech Support dept. That means I am on the Internet for 8 hrs per day minimum on a T3 (40MB/Sec) Internet connection. That doesn't mean it's a breeze and we spend all day trawling around web sites. Staff will get reprimanded at work for abusing time ""on line"" and installing software on local PC's that are unrelated to our job requirements.      Obviously I surf the web at work. As an Englishman working in Australia, I've found that they're a lot more relaxed about it over here than anywhere I've worked in England. The attitude here seems to be more sensible; as long as the work gets done on time, and no illegal or porn sites are accessed, then there's no problem. At home in England access to the Internet was treated as a big deal and any use of the Internet was a sackable offence at many places, which only makes people do it more whenever they get the chance, rather than being free to wait to surf the net when they get some spare time.      Unless the surfing time itself cost an employer a fee charged by the ISP, the fact that employees spend some working time online is not a real concern. Staff performance should be based on results. Don't treat employees like factory workers, whose performance is based on man-hours, and continuous work.      Surfing at work over a permanent connection can be both a waste of your employer's time (not money) and a valuable tool for business. At the end of the day, if an employer can't trust their employees to get on with their work as well, why employ them in the first place? A lot of fuss over nothing.      Surfing is like having a cigarette, having a chat, making a phone call - in other words a small mental break. With the human concentration span reportedly a mere 30 minutes, we have to give in and say we are not robots.      As the company's Materials Manager, if I did not surf the net, I would not fix a quarter of the equipment we have. It is the best tool ever invented for materials and logistic people. It is also good to read the news and relax whilst at the ever demanding computer.      I am from the school of thought that, as long as the work gets done by the end of the day, or the deadlines are met, employees should be rewarded with a little surfing time. This not only relieves stress, but also generates a more relaxing atmosphere in the workplace. I am a scientist and although the Internet is an invaluable resource to us, there are plenty of boring incubation times, which are thankfully filled with Internet browsing.      If you find your employees spending too much time surfing the web, this may indicate that your company needs to substantially revamp its policy and procedure. Limiting employee web surfing is a quick fix which may be only marginally successful.      Maybe I do spend 3 hours a week surfing, but I don't record that as billable time, and I always do at least as much as I need to get done each day. It's just a shame that many people spend more time on the insular pastime of surfing rather than talking to workmates!      I don't see the issue about surfing in company time being equivalent to ""stealing"" resources, in the way that personal telephone calls might be. As far as I am aware (hope nobody corrects me) my organisation's systems are connected to the server all the time, as we use news headline services, and other automatically updated web systems constantly. I am connected to the web 12 hours a day, it's always on in the background. Nobody seems to mind. It makes no difference to cost if I'm surfing for business or pleasure!      Sure I surf the net. However, I know what my responsibilities are at the end of the day. I am accountable. It's called time management.      As we are on permanent cable connection - it doesn't cost the company any money at all - the manager actually thinks its quite funny as 2 of us here at work always catch up on the English soccer scores!!!! Poms abroad you see.     It is my own company and, yes, a small portion of the day is used for personal 'surfing'. It only matters 'to get the job done', so it is alright.      Internet use on employer's time is similar to taking and making personal phone calls. Why is it not frowned upon in the same way?      I generally try to stay way ahead of my deadlines in order to ""earn"" a little quality Internet time. That sounds fair to me. As long as your productivity stays high, and you are at your desk/phone, it seems like everyone wins. It has to be better than taking a smoking break outside or wandering around the halls gossiping with co-workers.      I see nothing wrong in surfing the net whilst at work. If you were to be facing a computer screen every hour of every work day of the week, what a dull job it would be, with no time to relax or take a break...      Can anyone show me a person that is 100% effective at work 100% of the time? The only way anyone will learn how to really effectively use the internet is to practise as often as possible, and you can only do this if you are genuinely interested in what you are searching for.      Surfing the net doesn't always mean wasting/idling time. It sometimes leads to gaining more information which might be useful for future. There are always other means by which people kill/waste time while at work like gossiping, smoking, reading magazines, playing indoor games for short and frequent intervals, long lunch hours etc etc. So why should anyone complain about surfing the net. I would say, as long as one does the job on time, one can do anything within the company policy to idle away one's time.      Yes, I use the Net during work time - it's about the only perk we have left after the company stripped away all the other perks we came here for originally. If I couldn't surf to relieve the intense boredom, I'd go insane!!!      If your business has a dedicated Internet line, then the connection would be there anyway and might as well be used, if it is not distracting you from doing what you are paid for. In the case of a dial-up line, in America it wouldn't make any difference because our Internet access is unmetered. In the case of Britain with its stupid, archaic ways of charging for telephone calls and Internet access, of course you are wasting your boss's resources. And you should definitely not send personal notes on the company's carrier pigeons either!      Surfing the web, occasional personal telephone calls, refreshment breaks (yes, both smoking and beverages types) are all excellent motivators for my staff. If you believe your staff should be chained to their desks and heavily monitored, then you'll have a high staff turnover and continually be training new blood. Good luck!      This week I must have spent a least 9 hours surfing the web whilst at work - 3 hours a day rather than 3 a week. I have no qualms about doing this and none of my managers seem worried. If there is no work to do then why not spend the time in this way?      I'm sure that using the Internet at work has reduced the suicide rate of bored temps throughout the world!! Believe me, I work on a help desk and between 9am and 5.30pm I receive about five enquiries, as we are very quiet at the moment. I have a choice of sitting staring at a blank screen all day and going mad or catching up on the news/gossip on websites such as this!! Hurrah for the Internet for keeping me sane.      I believe using the Internet at work does relieve stress and boredom. I am also a smoker and there does not seem to be any resistance to going out for a puff. At our place you sometimes can end up waiting in the queue for a coffee for 20mins.      Who is paying for the Internet access time? Internet access for private purposes cannot be considered a 'perk of the job' but, like brief telephone calls, a privilege given by employers and, therefore, should only be used with permission - even at lunchtimes, or before/after the working day.      For the last seven years I have specialised in IT security. Much of my time is spent blocking and monitoring inappropriate Internet access. The thing that amazes me is that most employees think that they 'get away with it'. They don't! Every access is recorded on proxy logs, unencrypted e-mail can be read, telnet sessions can be logged in clear text, file downloads are monitored. As a rule, we only deal with the really bad stuff but users should be aware that every incidence of inappropriate activity is logged somewhere. These people fool no one but themselves. They are just waiting to be fired.      Surfing at work for pleasure isn't OK. People tend to surf to sites and download things that could provide serious security breaches to their organisation as well as wasting company time. Would you sit and read a magazine at your desk for 3 hours plus a week and think it was OK? Even worse if it was a magazine your firm had bought for you? Web access is a tool to do your job and not a right or privilege.      Surfing at work shouldn't be a disciplinary matter any more than browsing through a magazine at your desk. There should be a difference between checking something on the internet, such as train times, cinemas etc and idle surfing. Although, admittedly, the former can turn into the latter.      I find myself surfing for pleasure most days at work - but being a web developer it's all in the name of research!      My average surfing time might be around 3 hours a week, but my average unpaid overtime is definitely greater than that! If employers can't keep their staff interested and motivated then they should look at their working practices - clamping down on facilities will only reduce staff motivation. There are all sorts of things that people do for a break, and who's to say that smoking a cigarette or drinking a cup of coffee is more productive than, say, maintaining a knowledge of current affairs by reading a news website!      I am a designer, and some of my work goes on the Internet. So I have to surf at work, to make sure the company website is working and there are no broken links. I am, in fact, surrounded by three computers, two of which are connected to the Internet, and I need to surf to check out other websites to see what our competitors are doing.      Of course it's wrong to surf the web on the boss's time. I am a boss and my office has a policy that says EXCESSIVE use of the internet, or use for inappropriate and illicit purposes, is prohibited. To me, it's like the telephone. Of course there are times when personal phone calls are necessary and acceptable. But when it becomes excessive, or interferes with job performance, it becomes cause for termination.      I agree with Richard 100% that smokers waste as much, if not more time than we surfers. At least if my supervisor is looking for me, I'm at my desk, and not outside or who knows where having a smoke. However, I usually limit my surfing time to my lunch hour, or before I begin work.      As a director of an IT company, I do spend a lot of time surfing the web for work purposes. While we do give our employees full broadband internet access, we do expect them to use it as a business tool during business hours. Surfing for personal reasons during lunch and coffee breaks is fine, but porn is a definite no-no.      It's very dependent upon circumstances. I would never do so if I had urgent work to do. However, on the other hand, if you're twiddling your thumbs, or doing non-urgent, dull or repetitive work, an occasional 5 minute surf is a good way of relieving the boredom and returning to the job at hand with a refreshed mind. A good manager will recognise this, but also watch out for people at risk of developing obsessive habits.      What's wrong with a bit of web-surfing at work every now and then? After all, we need something to help us through the dreary working day!      I surf on company time, and I don't think it's a problem. I put in, on average, 30% more time every year than I'm actually paid for. During busy periods I don't surf for personal gain (by this I mean checking out online stores, a few non-business news sites, etc). When things ease up, I'll spend maybe half an hour a day surfing for my own use. As long as my job has priority and I don't surf any offensive sites (porn, racist, sexist, etc) I can't see why anyone would be upset.      Well, I am very good at using computers so I can finish my work faster than my colleagues. So, I create free time for me and therefore use it the way I want it; surfing the net. If that is on my boss' time there's nothing I can do about it. The same way I use technology for my work I use it for fun as well.      I, as I'm sure most people do, access the web for research connected to work anyway, so what's wrong with opening another window and browsing the BBC/ Guardian/ Marks and Spencer sites whilst waiting for your 'work' pages to load??      How do you think I'm able to send you this?      The organisation I work for more or less expects staff to surf. Obviously certain sites are inaccessible but provided we surf in our own time (like lunch breaks and perhaps before 9am) they don't mind.      Surf the net until you go cross-eyed, but do keep up with your work. Otherwise the management will get unhappy with the workers.      What about all the smokers who continually go out for a puff during the day? Surely they waste just as much if not more time than us surfers. Organisations should set out clear policies to their employees about Net usage.      Of course we surf in works time, most of the Talking Points responses arrive during working hours I bet.      Yes I go on the internet during work hours but it is in order to stay sane, in my work I have to wait around for long periods of time and the internet is a release.      In order to better serve the needs of my clients at any given time of the day, I'm changing my email address to rebecca.southwel talkingpoint.com!      Surfing the web at work is seen, like email, as a perk of the job by many workers. Not only is it a good source of genuine help and information to supplement your work, but I find it also reduces stress. I feel that things like looking at the odd shopping site, catching up on the latest news, or having a laugh at a funny site should be allowed, especially during lunch breaks. I believe a sensible approach to the internet by employers and employees alike can prove quite productive. "
HOC HOC-MJ 4.98 " I think there should be a Holocaust Memorial Day. The reason, I support such a proposal, is that I think the Holocaust was an extreme example of what human originated technology combined with a sinister ideology may lead to. All the blessings of contemporary technological progress have a dark side. In the hands of the wrong people it may lead to a very efficient way of industrial killing. The current economic situation may lull us into a quiet sleep. The power of countries could however shift and multinational companies may determine our way of life more and more without putting human wealth first. Holocaust Memorial Day may keep people keen on their freedom and on the fallibility of pure technological thinking. As soon as human victims are labelled as abstract elements in a process it is time to wake up.      The awfulness of a nation that could produce Goethe also producing Auschwitz deserves remembering - no one is immune from bigotry, and that is a lesson well-learnt. I worry, however, that memorialising it this way will sanitise it. Remembrance Day was supposed to be about bringing home the awfulness of war, and instead annually turns into a military parade and a day out for the Establishment that is anything but. It is not what the victims of genocide deserve.      It seems odd that we should have memorial to people killed by the Germans, and not to those Africans, Indians and Irish killed by the British empire. Remembering others' misdeeds strikes me as a cost-free exercise in political correctness.      Genocide unfortunately seems to be a recurring phenomenon. I believe the Holocaust is a prime example and should never be forgotten, but to say that it is unique, either in it's ideological impetus or it's numbers, is quite false. This century has seen several ideologically motivated genocides: Armenia, Ukraine, Cambodia and Rwanda. As for sheer numbers, the USSR's State-sponsored famine in the Ukraine claimed 11 million lives (1922-23 and 1931-33), and should not be forgotten either.      For these reasons, I believe that the Holocaust Memorial Day can only benefit by including other cases, and will help understand how such things could have happened in the past, and hopefully how it can be prevented in the future.      I don't think one day a year is enough to remember those killed by the Nazis. Instead, modern history should be taught in schools instead of the woeful lack of history teaching highlighted in a recent report and mentioned by one correspondent. I think a Holocaust memorial day is trite and does not remember all casualties of war. Instead we should have a day to remember for all the fallen soldiers and innocent civilians from all armed conflicts, maybe call it ""Peace Day"".      It is right to remember such a dreadful event as the Holocaust and the terrible suffering of the Jews and other victims of it. However, such emphasis has been placed on that particular aspect of the war, that it has largely obscured the death and suffering of a vast number (estimates vary up to 100 million) of others in that war, let alone the dreadful events outside it. Because of that distortion, I believe a special day with the name given, perpetuates an unjust neglect of other victims, and therefore do not support the day as conceived.      Of course a Holocaust Day is necessary. As someone who has barely any family remaining, thanks to the Nazis, I think it is vital to learn the lessons of the past so that we can stop atrocities happening now. Closing our eyes to genocide and torture is not a passive ""omission"" to act - it is an active decision not to get involved. Now is the time to unify against hatred and intolerance, be it racism, sexism or homophobia.      As repugnant as the mass murder carried out by Nazi Germany was, why should there be a Holocaust day that does not mention the many millions more who died under Stalin?      I think that the UK has taken a bold move to commemorate all the victims of the Holocaust. However I would like to say that I am a bit alarmed at some of the responses I have read, in particular the one from Armenia. Are we in some sort of competition as to who suffered more? If it wasn't for world Jewry not allowing the world to forget about the Holocaust we wouldn't have the heightened awareness that we do now!      Focusing on the Holocaust will make us believe that the Nazi genocide was unique when in fact genocide is common in human history. We should have a Genocide Memorial day to remind us of how easily civilisation can be replaced by savagery.      Whilst there is no doubt that one day can never be sufficient to acknowledge the atrocities of the Holocaust, perhaps it can do some good. What is needed to avoid such events recurring is an understanding of the inherent problems of prejudice and racism. Whilst a memorial day cannot substitute the education needed to highlight these problems in society, surely it cannot do anything but good.      There is already Remembrance Sunday, and we each have (or not) our own way to acknowledge those who have died because of systematic persecution by another group. That is enough. How many children in Tel Aviv are taught about the Blitz? How many children in Tokyo learn about the Rape of Nanking? Why don't we learn it - because, sadly there are many other genocides going on and they all matter. We have Remembrance Day in Britain. Having another one and calling it Holocaust or any other day is divisive and, I believe, clearly acknowledges the importance and tragedy of some people's suffering over others, and we can make of that what we will.      The uniqueness of the Holocaust is not, as some of these messages imply, to do with numbers. If it was about numbers then we would have to put the crime of the forced Diaspora of Africans higher on the list, likewise the huge slaughter of the Chinese by the Japanese, the Stalinist slaughters in the Soviet Union or the Nazi slaughter of Soviet citizens. These numbers were each in turn much more that the ""6 million"".      What is unique about the Jewish and Gypsy genocides are to do with the intention that was in the mind of the Nazis and the methods that were used. The point is the Nazis stopped simply shooting and killing Jews and Gypsies. They created carefully designed chambers to do it in. But, and this is vital, this horror and terror should never never detract from the terrible massacres, slaughters and genocides conducted by human beings before, during and after that time, wherever and by whoever, including Jews themselves in Israel and neighbouring territories.      Yes, of course we should remember the Holocaust and all the other genocides that have, to our eternal shame, taken place. Such dreadful atrocities must never be allowed to happen again, and yes, young people should be made aware of what human beings are capable of doing to each other. All it takes for history to keep repeating itself, is good people standing by, pretending it is not happening, saying nothing, doing nothing. We must learn from the past and be united in our determination that nowhere in the world must such evil be tolerated.      I think this day is very important, not only for Jews but for everyone, no matter what age, race or religion they are. After visiting family in England last year I was shocked at how little schools teach about the Holocaust and how little people know about it and why it happened. We should make sure that it will never be forgotten and that we try to teach and educate about crimes against humanities as much as possible, because obviously, we haven't learnt a lesson.      The Holocaust was a European genocide carried out systematically due to an ""ideology"" instead of moments of temporary rage or emotions. The modern world is still obsessed with ""logic"" and ""categorisation"" and continues to de-humanise groups of people. I think it's appropriate for England to commemorate this day since this genocide is so close to home and needs to be a reminder of the evils to come in the form of ""ideology""      November 11th is the day to commemorate all dead of all wars. I see no necessity in creating another ""day"" - it would merely dilute the objectives.      The fact that Tony Blair's government specifically only focuses on the Jewish Holocaust, a very dark and sad chapter in human history in itself, and does not include other genocides and crimes against humanity such as the Armenian genocide, the Cambodian genocide, Rwanda, Bosnia and number of others is wrong.      We should really be worried about the conditions that make a genocide possible, not about the race, ethnic group, or number of the victims. Any group can become a victim, and you cannot argue that one person is more significant than another. But of course there are always pressure groups which want to use these details as political ammunition.      I would rather say:- Britain having a Holocaust Day is very much necessary as there have been many other genocides since. But I think also that the Holocaust of the Jews was a special one: it is our Holocaust, it happened inside the western culture because we were not able to accept differences inside our own countries. I am afraid we have not learnt yet.      Even with atrocities continuing throughout the modern world, to forgot those who have gone before denies their importance. How will future generations learn if we 'forget' the past? Even one day a year can raise our awareness and lead to a greater understanding and perhaps a catalyst for change.      Sadly, history tends to view the Holocaust as the genocide of the European Jews caused by Hitler. But a Holocaust is a massive slaughter. So many other people from different countries have been slaughtered and no one has a memorial day for it. Stalin killed more people than Hitler did, and no one seems to care. No one seems to have a Holocaust memorial for what he did.      If such a day is to be truly unifying in its commemoration of man's inhumanity to man, it shouldn't be specific to race or creed. No one people has ever held a monopoly on suffering. Why start now?      A memorial day for Holocaust victims is a decent thing to do and I see no reason not to have it. Hitler killed more than six million Jews, more than any other genocide in the history of the world.      Watching and commemorating are not enough. Hard work is called for, study and self-examination are required. The perpetrators, whoever they were or are and the victims whoever they were and are, are just like us. It is a time for reflection on our own capacity for brutality, seeing others as not fully human. The Holocaust and all genocides are a comment on all of us. We must think deeply and try to learn.      Holocaust Day represents many atrocities. It reminds us of the effect of uncontrolled racism, the problems of political extremists and finally the lack of world conscience.      In my opinion, a Genocide Day should be held to remember all of the victims of genocide, in every country.      Of course, such a memorial day is a good thing. We must never let our children nor our children's children blind themselves to the horror that humanity is capable of. In order to prevent the mistakes of the future we must learn from the mistakes of the past. Such events have no place in a civilised world and must be stopped      As one of the few GCSE History students I feel quite strongly that an awareness of the mistakes that have been made in the past is vital.      Unfortunately, history is no longer a compulsory subject at GCSE level. The result of a recent survey showed that 4% of pupils thought Adolf Hitler was the British Prime Minister during World War Two. Those who do not know history end up repeating it.      There have been dozens of holocausts before and since Hitler's but the we must commemorate this one because that's when the world as a whole finally began wake up to its own capacity for evil.      I think that it's very important to remember the Holocaust. In my opinion, Britain has been a bit slow in deciding to commemorate the people who suffered in such a horrific way. Germany has been doing this for a few years now so that children understand what happened in their own country because of one dictator.      Although, I think on balance I'd prefer a Genocide Day to a Holocaust Day (or even no ""Day"" at all), it is hard to deny the uniqueness of the Holocaust. Its singularity is that, at least in Europe, no other genocidal campaign eradicated such a high proportion of individuals belonging to a cultural group.      Yes I do believe it is a good thing. So many days are commemorated, so why be so blind and forget about the biggest catastrophe ever to have occurred? Just because it didn't take place in this country doesn't mean that we are free from prejudice and racism. Racism is alive, it is not a thing of the past and we should do all we can to remind ourselves how dangerous and wrong it is.      No one can devalue the sheer horror and tragedy of the Holocaust. The saddest thing of all is that the world at large seems to have learned nothing.      Will the memorial of the genocide in the Second World War recognise the 3 million Poles, vagrants, gypsies and everyone else who didn't fit into the Aryan vision of purity, that were murdered in the concentration camps? Or indeed the 20,000 Polish officers murdered at Katyn by the Russians.      I don't know if 6m people were killed in Rwanda or Cambodia, but certainly the scale of the Holocaust defies the imagination. As well as being remembered for itself, it is also a symbol for other examples of genocide. None of these atrocities should ever be forgotten and as the generation that lived through the war dies, we must ensure future generations do not forget either.      Such a day is important to remember what should never have been, and make people aware of what should never come again.      This is typical of New Labour. They try and present things nicely, provide a sop to one group of people while totally ignoring the identical plight of another group. Addressing the horrors of genocide in general needs so much more than what amounts to a day of hand wringing.      Maybe if we have an official Memorial Day, it will help provide impetus to STOP atrocities continuing around the globe!      Britain having a Holocaust Day is unnecessary as there have been many other genocides since.      I don't think one day a year is enough to remember those killed by the Nazis. Instead, modern history should be taught in schools instead of the woeful lack of history teaching highlighted in a recent report and mentioned by one correspondent.      The memorial is, I think, a good idea. Whilst it is of course true that genocide continues to happen around the world, it is important to reinforce the message that these dreadful deeds are a direct consequence of racial hatred. An annual reminder at least provides a focus for what can be held up as a known example that is well recorded.      I agree that we should learn from the past and particularly from the Holocaust, but a day such as this is only a cosmetic change. Each individual must determine that they will not give way on issues of racism or other forms of hate, and this requires much more than naming a ""day"".      Why has it taken so long to create this day in the UK? If this had been an annual event before today, young people may have grown up more politically and racially aware and perhaps this could have lead to less racism and ignorance. Now schools should be encouraged to follow up and ensure that 20th century world history, becomes a mainstream subject at high school. It is not that racism wasn't around before, but 20th century history being so recent, might just broaden young minds through its relevance. Besides there are enough examples of genocide in 20th century to learn about and, more importantly, to learn from.      As an amateur historian, it is my experience that very little happens today that doesn't have its roots in the past. History should be a compulsory subject for children, that they may, hopefully, learn from the past. A greater awareness may make such specific days of remembrance unnecessary. "
HOC HOC-MM 4.72 " Companies can now patent DNA sequences (obtained from tissue samples) and cures based on them. I would like to know who would get the benefit from such patents. I would suggest a share of the proceeds should go to the NHS and to the patient.      I wonder why the hospital didn't consult the parents, which on the surface of it seems the decent thing to do. Could it be that the hospital didn't think it was doing anything unusual? Maybe the practice of using human tissue in this way is more widespread than we think.      I don't think I would object to tissue like this, that would normally be removed, being used for research but I would object strongly to not being informed. I respect the medical profession but they do not know best in this matter and should at the very least consult the parents.      Everything that doctors and surgeons do, is to help ordinary people like you and me. Keep that in mind when hurling accusations around. If these people wanted to make a few sleazy quid, they would have probably chosen a different profession - politics, perhaps?      The question we need to ask is - at what point do our bodies and those of our children no longer belong to us - but to the NHS? I lost a child 10 years ago and would have been so happy to be able to donate her organs had they been usable due to the illness she had - but questions were asked and honest answers given. If this organ taking is ""no big thing"" then why wasn't anybody told? It seems so underhand because everybody was kept in the dark - yet, had parents been told then there would not have been this problem and confidence in the NHS would not have been shaken. The doctors should try communicating with the patients or parents of patients instead of assuming they have the unquestionable rights.      This country is caught in the grasp of a hangover of ridiculous Christian morals, including the principle of the inviolability of the body. There is of course a good case for having a consent based system, but the debate should not be carried out in the shadow of the outcry it unreasonably causes.      Everything that doctors and surgeons do, is to help ordinary people like you and me. Keep that in mind when hurling accusations around. If these people wanted to make a few sleazy quid, they would have probably chosen a different profession - politics, perhaps?      What people don't know can't hurt them, and in this case it would have been better not to let the truth out. No one was lied to - they were simply not told the full facts, and who can blame staff from keeping such sensitive information secret. The fact is that organs and tissues went to very legitimate research projects, which seems to justify the their use, just as the donation of an organ to a living person. The practice helped to gain some positive benefit out of the tragedy of a child's death, which can only be a good thing.      No matter what organs had been taken ,whether or not they were of any use,parent's consent should always be gained in such matters!      They should ask for consent. I would imagine that it would usually be given if the donation was expained as being for medical research. The problem is that I, and I think others, no longer trust doctor's motives. Could they be selling these organs? Was the removal really necessary? After the mix up with organs from dead babies I think that doctors need to tread carefully.      It doesn't take 5 minutes to read the NHS consent form, believe me, I've read them a few times. They are clear and to the point, in fact they have the a diamond award for good English!      Hype over nothing - the real scandal would be not re-using waste for research. And can the NHS afford for surgeons to spend the time explaining everything in detail?      When our health minister says the Alder Hey report is the most shocking thing he has ever read, and his comments reported on Holocaust Day, i just wonder where the media and government gets its sense of proportion.      I am a doctor and at least 1 morning out of 3, when my radio alarm wakes me up I hear yet another story about how insensitive, uncaring, greedy etc. my profession is. No wonder so many of my colleagues are on antidepressants and/or considering early retirement.      I don't think anyone really has a basis for objection to the practice of using ""spare parts"" for research, but who do the parts belong to. The person, the family, the hospital or the government? If the ""parts"" are to be donated to research then I do feel the person, or the family should at least be consulted if only to give the NHS some credibility which it rather lacks at the moment!      Lets face it, the hospital should have asked for consent to remove the glands or any other part of the patient's body. There is no reason why they haven't done this! That is not an excuse just to say that ""We have used patients organs for donations"", 90% of parents/close relatives do not mind for this to be done, so why not inform them and give them a choice.     The sickest part of all this are the people who will sue for compensation. I bet none of the money sued for will go to help medical research. Money cannot compensate for a dead child any one who pursues this needs to look at their own ethics.      Why is there no statutory right for the patient or patient's representatives to know everything about their treatment? As it is, if you don't ask the right question directly, you won't necessarily get the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth. Without an obligation to release all relevant information in a set format, doctors will resort to protecting their own backsides in the event of something going wrong, or because they have taken a decision without full consent. In this case, an unwritten hospital and even NHS policy appears to have gone uncommunicated, and probably would have remained so had the previous misdeeds by Alder Hey hospital not been uncovered.      Surgeons should not overlook conflict of laws. One quarter of the world is Muslim and does not permit cremation.      I don't think this is about parents objecting to the donation of their deceased children's organs towards research. I think we are missing the point. As it has already been established, it is of no loss to the deceased child to have the ""gland"" in question removed. On the other hand, it would be of great use to the laboratory that is trying to utilise it for a good cause. I think what this is really about is parents feeling violated that they are not being consulted. These are their children we are talking about. it doesn't matter whether these glands are of use to the deceased children or not and neither is this about the fact that they get $5 for the ""organ"". I think if parents were consulted, they would not object. It is all about the right approach and not getting things done through the back alley.      What does this exercise by the parents actually prove or achieve? These continuing attacks on legitimate research only fill the pockets of cynical lawyers, and damage the ability of researchers to work effectively for all our good. I lost a child from cardiac problems. There was a post-mortem followed by a cremation. I asked no questions, and I was told no lies. If the pathologist used any tissue from my child, then so be it. She did not require it - she was already dead. The parents should be attacking the solicitors, for keeping the pain going.      I carry a donor card and have done since I was of age to do so. I think that after anyone has passed on, if any part of their body could be used to save or enhance the life of another human being, surely that is a great gift and a worthy purpose?      I have every sympathy with the families of children at Alder Hey but I have just heard all doctors described as arrogant and incapable of communicating by an MP on BBC 1 breakfast news discussion. This makes me very angry. My husband, a consultant anaesthetist and director of an Intensive Care unit has dedicated his life to caring for the sick. In reality this has meant my bringing up our children virtually as a one-parent family while he works long hours treating the critically ill. Frequently he comes home late into the evening because he has been spending time with the relatives of his patients helping them to understand what is happening to their loved one. Regularly he is phoned during the night for advice or to find a bed for a new admission. He is not in any way unusual in his commitment.      I totally approve of withdrawing organs. Parents should not be so selfish, don't they realise that research carried out on these organs could save other children's lives? Here in Brazil, you have to state specifically that you are not a potential organ donor otherwise you are automatically consenting to having any organ removed on death, which I think is correct.      It is not right to take a child's organs without the permission of the parent or guardian. It is not right but, I do think that more parents should allow organs to be donated for research or to other needy children.      I fail to see why children are any different to any other human being. Pathologists have been removing organs and tissue and not returning them to the body of the deceased for hundreds of years. If there is an autopsy then shouldn't the organ be returned to the body, whether it is an adult or child, unless the patient or their representative said otherwise.      Parents have a fundamental right to know if anything is done to their Child, regardless of the ""medical Validity"" of what the doctor is doing. Parents are the Guardians of their children and must be kept aware of anything that is done to them. In a day and age where life has had its value reduced almost daily someone has to make a stance for those less able to make decisions for themselves, so leave our children alone and only do that which has been agreed with the parents      I have two sons and both of them have been to hospital. When they were being treated we did not worry so much (although we did worry!) since we had been informed what would be going on, what risks the treatment would have and so on. I don't know how worried we would have been had we not been told anything. We are responsible for our young ones and everyone dealing with our sons should consult us. If teachers (that's what my job is) are asked about their methods and controlled, why should doctors have the right to fail to give information?      If surgeons took the time to explain the procedure in full, and the named nurse, who is supposed to be the patients advocate, asked the questions that parents in distress may not know to ask, then there might not be this problem      I believe the true issue here is that the parents had little or no information on what was going on. I, as a parent would have no objections to such a procedure as long as I had all the facts explained to me.      We humans have some rather odd notions about the sanctity of our bodies, based largely on medieval superstition. Given the chronic shortage of organs for transplants and the need for human tissue to replace animals wherever possible in research, I sometimes think this kind of procedure should be mandatory.      I understand that the hospital received #5 for each of the thymus glands. Given the cost of the surgeon's (and the rest of the theatre staff's) time, it hardly seems to be an organ ""trade"".      Yes times have changed and parents should be consulted. However to demonise the medical profession for what has been accepted practice for many years is wrong. Tonsils, adenoids, appendix have all been removed and I suspect the majority consigned to the incinerator. How much better that use is made of them.      All the doctors I know work tirelessly to cure ills, ease suffering and prolong life. Given the government, media and public willingness to slander, accuse and criticise doctors, I sometimes wonder if they deserve this level of dedication.      This is a completely separate issue to that of keeping dead children's organs. This is a piece of tissue, not an organ - ordinarily it would be burnt, but the hospital have found a way of putting it to good use while receiving a small (but much needed) donation to the cardiac unit. I really don't think that anyone would object to this practise if they were asked but maybe there should be some sort of consent needed.      We seem completely unable to consider the needs of other unfortunate patients who might benefit from (i) an organ donation (ii) later analysis of an organ to aid future research. What a selfish society we do seem to have become.      A dead child is a dead child. They don't become 'more dead' by having no thymus gland (or any other organ). Healthy organs should be removed from dead patients as a matter of course, since they will invariably benefit someone else. Critics should put themselves in the place of patients needing kidneys, eye parts or whatever.      Surely another mountain out of a molehill situation? It is important to have perspective on this issue. Yes, it can be upsetting for parents to learn that a 'part' of their child was given away without consent but we need to be aware that it was surgical waste and not a vital organ. The medical profession deserves some credit in being able to use what was deemed waste into research with the possibility of saving other lives.      While I agree that valuable research can be done using human tissue that is to be discarded, parents' feelings must always be considered when these decisions are taken. It is always tragic when a child is ill or dies and we must never do anything to make such a terrible situation worse.      How small-minded can you get to even think of denying to others the potentially life-saving benefits that can come from this constructive recycling of tissue? I am saddened that people could be so selfish.      I really can't see what all the fuss is about. The tissue would normally have been discarded by the hospital. Why not use it for much-needed research ?      The real issue is one of ownership. Who owns said 'surgical waste'?      The gland is no longer needed by the patient but it can be put to good use by society. This is not a story. Come on... think about it.      Being a child who had a heart operation when they might have taken out the gland, I would be glad if they used it instead of just burning it!      In the case of the dead children's organs being removed without parental consent I completely understand why such a fuss is being made. But in the case of the hospital exchanging a gland which is removed during surgery, and which is therefore no longer of any use to the patient, why should they not exchange it for funds? In the long run they are helping future patients. And in a health service which is stretched for funding and resources what is the problem? Maybe these things should be put in perspective, rather than being used in a witch hunt.      I believe that as long as the hospital is ethical and does everything above board, I don't see why this is an issue. However, having said that, can we trust the hospital to be such?      I was scandalised to hear the news of organ trading! This is my understanding of what I have heard. Doctors trying to help sick babies removed an apparently useless gland in order to operate more effectively. Rather than throw the tissues away, they passed them to a research company which could use the tissues in their search for ways of helping people suffering from cancer. The research company gave a donation to the hospital to cover expenses. What wicked people! To top it all, when faced with parents concerned about their real, loved, sick babies, they did not spend the time insensitively discussing every technical detail. How can we ever trust doctors again?      Doctors need to do a better job of telling the parents of patients exactly what is going on. In a time of crisis, most parents don't get the chance to read a consent form in detail, and so may have no idea that a body part would be used for research. I bet that most wouldn't object to this practice as long as they were properly informed that it would occur. However, they deserve right to be asked.      It might be worthwhile to point out with the recent hysteria and terrorism of a few deluded individuals, where are future scientific and health developments going to come from if we shouldn't use animals or discarded human tissue? What are the much-vaunted alternatives? The public want and should get more information about these issues. As the health service is so stretched that most doctors don't have time to discuss the medical issues with the patient, I don't think we can expect them to have time to discuss the details of possible uses for discarded human tissues. This is a public service our Government should provide.      How come the Minister responsible is blaming others when he is in charge?      The parents should ALWAYS be kept informed about such issues. The fact that these tissues are routinely discarded is immaterial - medical staff should seek parents' or guardians' consent when removing any organ.      Let's not forget that on the consent form it does state that tissue removed may be used for research. The parents did consent even if they didn't read the small print. As for selling it, the NHS needs money and if they can raise it from pharmaceutical companies who are willing to pay for what is technically waste - go for it!      Never mind whether it should have asked for their consent, why did it NOT ask for their consent? It should have done this purely out of courtesy even if there are no medical or ethical guidelines to enforce such a procedure.     Why should anyone object to a hospital in the poor cash-starved NHS making some much-needed funds by selling something which would have otherwise been incinerated? I really don't see what the fuss is about. Some emotionally vulnerable and ill-informed people seem to have been whipped up to a storm of fury by the media looking for yet another anti-NHS story.      Let's hope they don't start removing perfectly healthy organs unnecessarily, just so they can sell them...      Do we really want to know everything that might happen to a dead body? For example, the procedures used in post mortems and funeral parlours? Do we really want to prevent the experts from examining body tissue to discover why our loved ones were ill or died, and then using that information to prevent it happening again. And do we really want to impede medical research done on body parts of no use or value? I think the key thing here is whether the doctors treat both living and dead people with respect. It is possible to do that and study body parts for medical advances. We should stop making life any harder for these professionals      This is simply ludicrous. The tissue was waste tissue. It was being removed anyway. No one profited. And hey, some good use came of it in terms of future treatment for others. I think we should congratulate Alder Hey on their efforts and ingenuity. Alan Milburn should take a few deep breathes and calm down as there is simply no point in stoking up an outrage over this.      Is the argument regarding the use of the tissue or the fact that the hospital received donations? As the tissue was normally discarded, at a cost to the hospital, I can see no problem with using it for research.      Whatever can be done to help others should be done wherever possible. Some parents are unable to accept that their child is unable to be saved. They should be thankful for the medical staff for, at least, trying to prevent their death and doing so in the most humane way. To then attack them for using otherwise useless organs shows where their real considerations lie.      When a close relative of mine died I was only too glad to have his body used for research (i.e an autopsy was carried out). Whether this was done with my consent or not, as long as he was dead, how can any sane person object? Hospital staff are working under an increasingly intolerable burden, not only of work load but of inadequate funding and a hostile public who demand cures for everything as their right. Without them we'd all suffer. With them, we all can benefit. And yes, mistakes are occasionally made and bad decisions will be taken. Who can claim not to?      As with before taking anything it is always polite to ask first. With remains or minors the parents or guardians should be asked first. "
JOC JOC-12B-09O 5.07 "I do not agree with ID12059's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. Of course it is a serious problem that Mr. Abe resigned from president because he had a disease. However, according to William Saroyan, a man of ability can learn a lot from failures. This statement apply to Mr. Yoshida. After he resigned from president, he had been president again. Eventually, he took Japanese independence back. He learned a lot from failures. This example will apply to Mr. Abe. I believe that he will do good job. I hope Japanese people believe that too.  I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout, not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required.  Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11. They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call ""abenomics"". I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and South. We must compare territorial problem with east asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation, and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own.  Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-defense Forces to be National Defense Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time.  I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr. Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.  Abe lost election six years ago. I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do. But this time, he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted.  Recently, the relationship between Japan and China is getting worse. Moreover, Japanese economy falls into deflation. Japan is under crisis now. I expect a lot from Abe in terms of improving Japanese recession.  I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.  I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems.  I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields. "
JOC JOC-13B-07O 5.05 "Nelson Mandela is great. Because he fought for resolve the racial discrimination. To solve racial stereotype is difficult. It is thanks to people like him that racial problem is getting less. We have to keep the freedom and equality which is they got. I would like to express my condolences and thank to him.  In studying history, almost every character keeps its own position based on his benefit, especially during a war. But Nelson Mandela was not. Though he declared to separate non-white from white and began to suppress non-white, he changed his mind and declared non-white's right. He cleaned his sin up in the name of peace. I was moved by his story.  Mr. Biden said one thing to one side and something different to another. As a result, he completely failed in lowering tensions in the East Asia. Recently, the tension in this region has risen because of territorial problems. China (and Taiwan), South Korea and Japan are very eager to gain territorial rights over the islands in the East China Sea in order to protect their national interests in terms of defense, fishery, and natural resources as well. I hope that all these countries should cooperate to avoid armed conflicts and find a point of compromise. Regarding the US, it should stop too much intervention than is necessary not to change the status quo. Japanese government shouldn't rely on the US, since its purpose is just to increase its influence in Asia.  Relationships between Asian countries are too complicated so it is very difficult task for Mr Biden, America to deal with it. Visiting a lot of countries in Asia and making conversations with each top was great action itself, however, America is now a little bit losing its credit from the world so those visits did not influence enough so far. Each Asian country must think good relationship with America is necessary so America should keep in touch with Asian countries like Japan, China or Korea.  It is true that state secret law is important if we think of national defense, smooth cooperation with other countries. But, although there were a lot of disputes about the law, its content is still ambiguous, and it might be used arbitrarily at the expense of people's right for freedom. I think that clear explanation and definition of it should be made for the sake of people. Or we will not be able to control our nation.  I think the statement that this law has danger isn't wrong. But this law is necessary. These days, information is very important. Leak of the secret information make our country be in danger. In addition, Japan will lose the reliance of other country. So a nation must have the law to prohibit bureaucracy from leaking secret information. Off course, we must supervise the government for some people not abuse it. We should not only criticize but also support the government.  I agree with you in that information is important and should be protected so as not to be leaked. But even so, the contents of this law is very vague, which enables the government to use quite a few kinds of information arbitrarily. To support the government, the situation is necessary where it is supervised in order not to abuse the law. But for now, I do not have any confidence in the government because of its attitude. If the government do not change, I will not stand by it.  The reason why I disagree with this is I have the opposite opinion to this. I think this law will not infringe the freedom of expression. Already, government employees are limited to what they are going to say. Thus there would be no change even if the law would be set up.  I disagree with this opinion. Of course, this law cause controversies. National information need to be protected. Whether secret of a nation is protected or not can decide the fate of a nation. So this law is necessary and helpful.  I think I'm against to make the law. Because the government shouldn't hide any information to citizens. And if they enforce the law, it might invade free expression. Free expression plays the important role of democracy. So I disagree to his opinion.  I disagree with this opinion. I think that we must protect our right of freedom of expression, so I think we should make such a film tell us truth. Then, we should watch such things to know the original state and we must solve problems of it.  Certainly, the government has to protect secrets, which need to defend the country. However, just because the government would deal with secret information, it doesn't follow that the authorities can ignore our rights to know.  I think a great deal of human rights than freedom of expression. However, I have a second thought that politician should have capacity that can take a certain amount of criticism.  I think that this is very difficult problem. Japanese government's informations should be protected. It is said that Japanese information leak easily. We cannot get the foreign countries' informations easily. If Japanese informations leak, Japanese people expose them to danger. Therefore Japanese government should protect the informations. However it is important that the nation know about one's country's information. Japanese people have the right to know. No person shall be denied the right to know. Japanese government should keep the balance of law.  I agree with you. The balance of law is very important. The Japanese government has duty to protect the Japanese nation, so this bill is effective from the point of view that it defends against exposing them to danger. However, the government should protect nation's right to know, too. It is difficult to keep the balance, so I think the first step which the government should do is explaining this bill more deeply to nation.  It is important to get understanding of Japanese people. But it is not easy as everyone says. "
JOC JOC-14A-03N 5.79 "When I read this article for the first time, I forgot myself in anger. Of course it is true that criminals should be punished by legal means, but they don't have to be in more agony than they have to atone for the crime they committed. I think the development of medical science should be used to ease humans' pains. We have to think more seriously about this problem because this problem is a matter of all people in the world. I suppose we should respect more for the rights of criminals and make better use of medical science to make all people happy.  The way the US execute criminals is as same as cruel torture. This execution is against the principle of the constitutional states. The principle says Criminals are punished because they disturb their societies' peace and order. Therefore punishments including death penalty are not carried out in order to inflict pains on prisoners. The us are needed to carry out the death sentences in safer and less grotesque way. In the way, I was surprised that condemned criminals are killed by drugs in the US. In Japan condemned criminals are hanged. I think it is interesting in the way of death penalties.  I was feeling keenly that killing by chemicals is a pretty cruel thing. I disagree with killing animals in pharmaceuticals. I have a dog, so it is unbearable that animals are sent to the health center by having discarded by owner and would be killed eventually, using such as gas or injection. Lethal injection, which exists as one of executions, I was well understood that the death-row prisoner writhed in agony pain and dead by reading this article. I think it is terrible that the process which a lethal injection had failed and the prisoner dead. However, I think that it's inevitable that the wrongdoer was suffering from lethal injections when we put ourselves in the victim's place.  Capital punishment is, in principle, done as a warning of other would-be criminals, and I think that the nation's attitude to treat criminals according to the weight of their crimes cannot be criticized. However, too much cruelness make the nation's reputation and confidence lost. I think that the current way the US carry out the execution is so humane that it should adopt new and more humane way of the penalty.  I cannot believe that the drug of using animals uses humans to execute capital punishment. This is because the injection may fail to work. The way of executing should use more humane and less prone to error. However, I think it is natural that a criminal feel the pain as the injured. Capital punishments need for criminal to atone for what he did. Using three drugs is more dangerous than using one drug. Therefore, if they use three drugs, they succeed in injecting absolutely. We should consider carefully about it.  When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished. It is true that criminals are should be punished. But a false charge may always happen and recovery does not attach it after a capital punishment. Therefore, I think that the capital punishment itself should be abolished, before considering the method of a death penalty.  When I read the article, first I think people who should be executed capital punishment take a pain is proper thing. But, every criminal is person, so they have human right. And when they are suffering from drugs , some executioner also suffering from their groaning. Their stress is so terrible. Just considering the two side , I think one drug to carry out lethal injections are better than three drugs caused acute pain. But, using some drugs and executing people are last method. So before we think what kind of drug we use, we should take it more seriously about the fact that we kill the person however he committed murder.  The story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is very horrible for me. No matter how terrible crime he committed, he has human right. I think the way of execution should be decided by criminals.  I think that the death penalty should be abolished. Why do we need death penalty? People who back death penalty are very illogical. First, killing people is very cruel especially execute someone by lethal injection. Second, life imprisonment has deterrent against crime in common with death penalty. In conclusion, there is no necessity to carry out death penalty.  When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised at Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett. I knew that very cruel thing such as this execution was carried out actually for the first time by reading this article and I felt a sadness and a fear. The three drug method just causes a person too much pain, hurts people's feeling and gives people emptiness. I think this is a too cruel torture and no one come to be happy by it.  This news made me sad. In the first place, there is still a discussion about morality of capital punishment. Because death penalty might violate human rights. In the way, Amnesty International is doing anti death penalty activity. In addition to this conflict, the matters about cruel torture may infringe on human rights more and more. Even if men who are punished are heinous criminal , they are human. So as long as the human rights are protected in constitution, they should be treated as honorable person. Thus if we agree with death penalty, we should activate the discussion about the way criminal are punished.  When I read this article, I was very surprised and shocked. At the same time, I felt this was a very serious problem. Although I don't have enough knowledge of drug, I thought we all have to try something we can do to solve the problem because this is very important matter for all of us. I think execution by the three drug method is too strict for people however bad the criminal is. Therefore, I feel we should reconsider this kind of penalty seriously. Furthermore, I thought that I have to learn about law harder and harder in the university and I want to have more knowledge about execution.  When I read this article, I was surprised very much. It is surely that the person who committed a crime receives a punishment. However, using three-drug method is too terrible. All over the world, capital punishment exists today. But, because a prisoner has human rights, not the death penalty, I think that the we should give different punishment. In any case, we learn about a law seriously and should think it.  When I read this article, I felt that I was fierce. The Clayton rocket of Oklahoma has human rights as one human being, too. Therefore, in this matter, I think that it was an opportunity to change a thought about the death penalty. Presence and the human rights of the death penalty are very difficult problems. However, the death penalty such as the torture cannot be necessary.  I didn't realize capital punishment was unbearable pain. Although Clayton rocket committed an inadmissible crime, the way he was killed is too cruel. We should think again about capital punishment. Because modern medicine and technology are developing, we can introduce better way of death. I don't think the death penalty should be abolished, but administration of justice need execute it after considering human rights.  When I read this article, I was very surprised with that the official had allowed to use the untested drug. Although I don't think we should abolish the capital punishment, we must recognize prisoners as human. They have some rights as we have. So, we take care of them humanly. Some people say ""They are in prison because they killed someone or used drugs. So, it is quite natural that their rights are ignored. ""Although I can understand what they say and I have the same feeling somewhere in my mind, I think they are totally wrong. As long as we live, every of us should be recognized as a member of a society I was surprised to hear that, in the United States, it ie allowed to execute death row inmates with drugs, in the first place. In Japan, drugs aren't used in execution. I wonder why the US take that way, and why they use drugs that banned from using to euthanize animals. To me, it sounds like humans are inferior to other animals. It is true that humans isn't superior to other animals in any way and that it is important to treasure them. However, humans are valuable, too. We should confirm that and reconsider the system of executing in the US.  When I read this article, I was really surprised. Clayton Lockett killed people and raped women. So, he must make up his crimes. However, he has human rights, and no one can deprive of his human rights. The accident is too cruel treatment for him. I think that the US should stop using drugs to execute death sentences, because cruel accident like this must never happen again.  I don't agree with execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals. Certainly, criminals have to suffer punishments and victims desire it. However, punishments with illegal drugs go against humanity. We should take a serious view of humanity and think how they can correct errors.  I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned. I am in favor of death penalty. Because some situation should do death penalty. But I think if they do death penalty, it must be quickly and it must not be painful. So, I think some chemicals used to execute death row should be banned.  After reading this article, I felt that the execution of Clayton Lockett was so cruel that I cannot agree with using the three drug method. He was very guilty , however, this execution like torture had an ethical problem. So I suggest that we should not use that drug.  I think this article is issue of natural right which a condemned criminal has. I disagree with using lethal injection. Because, we must not treat life lightly, even so, it is a condemned criminal's life. I have two reasons. First, if the drug fails to work properly, he die with suffering. Drug lethal injections have a high risk. Second, this drug may be smuggled over. For the reasons, I disagree with using lethal injections.  When I was read this article, I was surprised that it is allowed to use drugs for execution in the US despite the fact that this way can cause acute pain and lead to grotesque scenes. I think it is unnecessary for people who commit crimes to give pain. I know it is natural that the criminals commit crimes, they should be punished. However they have human rights, we have to make allowance for them. I think execution using drugs should be abolished because of such reasons.  I think people who committed sins need to be punished in any way. But it is nothing to say that they are ""people"" as same as us so we have to consider their fundamental human rights. Especially capital punishment is a disputable point. In my opinion, I don't disagree with capital punishment. This institution could restrain brutal crime. However, we must more care about the way. We mustn't occur the worst case , terrible process which a lethal injection fails.  When I read this article, I can't believe this execution about using drugs. I had thought that using drugs are banned all over the world. However, I can't agree drugs uses lawfully in some situation. In order to solve this problem, I hope drugs would disappear in the world.  I thought it a good way that we use a drug to kill a criminal, but I changed my mind. I think it a bad way. it is because it is cruel for us to use a drug. Rather than killing people immediately, using a drug makes people feel pain before their dead. It is true that using a drug does away with making persons kill a criminal with their hands such as push a button to kill a criminal. But using a drug makes them see a situation that a criminal feels pain. It makes persons uncomfortable, and they go mad, if they see the situation too much. For the reason, I think that we should not use a drug to kill a criminal.  Recently, capital punishment is greatly debated. The point is usually its morality , whether to do away with. At any rate, we should hold human life in high esteem. Even death-row inmates are human, so their rights should be respected. Therefore, I think that employment of capital punishment should be sedate and easy for them.  I think using the drug administered to the death penalty is a bad thing because Mr. Dennis and Rocket died given the suffering and punishment beyond their crime, and pain. I think that this is not good ethically. There are two reasons. First, the most of effect of current drag is uncertain. Second supposing medicinal medication goes wrong, The family who are looking will be a lot of shocked. The right explanation is given before using. But given the science and technology of today, we should refrain from the use of the drag for death penalty.  There are a lot of comments that say""It is morally bad to execute people by using drug cocktail""I presume that this theme is very interesting. In my opinion, I think so too. It is true that an offender should be punished , but that should not be capital punishment by using drugs. That measure would give them more pain than what they did. But I think capital punishment is needed. Because, I think that capital punishments deter crime. So we have to change the way to execute.  When I read this article, I had mixed feelings. I think euthanasia is not necessarily bad, cause we should have the right to chose our ends (I don't approve of the idea entirely, thought). But, If we make the choice by drugs, we have to examine many times before using them. We cannot examine it with people, so we will use animals. It is the same thing for death penalty by drugs. We have to avoid the problem like Clayton Lockett. However, we should think about the right of animals at the same time. It is the so difficult matter.  When I read this article, I was surprised and shocked. Of course, Clayton Lockett must be punished for the crime of killing people. However I think that he shouldn't be executed in a way that ignores human rights. He is a human too. Should he have died struggling? But If I were a relative of the victim, I wouldn't say the same things.  I was shocked to hear the news. A criminal is also a human being, so his life should have been treated more carefully. This is not my opinion, but from Christian point of view, it is said equality under god. Also, in this accident, lethal injection was untested. So to speak, he was a testing bench. Even though he was a condemned criminal, his life was only one time and I thought his last should have been calmness.  When I read the article, it made me surprise and I felt so sad. Before reading the article, I was for execution by using drug, because in terms of criminal's human rights, I thought this method seemed to be better than shooting or hanging. However, considering the terrible case, I changed my mind. Using drug is no less cruel than shooting or hanging. Apart from the problem whether or not we should abolish death penalty, we have to reconsider the method of execution.  Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs because I thought the criminals could die in piece and with no pain by this method. However, my feeling toward it had totally changed. It can be as cruel as other methods such as hanging. Most of us the Japanese are for with the idea of capital punishment, but maybe we should reconsider whether we should adopt it or not.  At first I think it is a humane way to execute inmates with drugs. But as I read this article, I noticed that there is a possibility of being cruel and precarious. Though Clayton Lockett is a criminal, his human right should be defended, I think.  I think using drug like lethal injections for execution is humanitarian, but this situation is not. Actually It is sure that Clayton Lockett committed serious crime. No matter haw he is brutal criminal, he is a human and has human rights. And it should be defended.  I think this news shows how indifferent to other's life we are . I agree with execute inmates with drugs if a condemned criminal can die without pain. However, in fact, we treat their life carelessly. We should improve our consciousness about other human's life.  Before reading this article , I thought that using drug for execute criminals is good in terms of human right. However, after reading it , I came to think that we should stop execute or find other ways to execute . Of course, criminals are bad and punished, but they also have human rights . we should respect them for protecting our human rights It's surprising for me to be different between way of execute in US and EU. But I'm convinced that it's natural to be different. For many things are different around the world. But I think Clayton's matter is crucial. He killed a girl so it's natural for him to be stated death penalty. I think he wasn't have to dead suffering. So we should work out a way of execute.  I felt sorry for Clayton Lockett when I read this news. It is true that the crime that he committed is too cruel. However, nobody had the rights to give him unjust heavy pain in this country governed by law. I am for capital punishments, but I believe that we can respect for the criminals to some extent when he is executed.  The famous artist was arrested by drug possession yesterday. i often hear the news caught in drug possession I have the experience which actually refused the drug. It takes courage to refuse a drug. However, it is an important thing In order to keep its own body and the future. . .  I felt sad to read this news and remembered the Nazis. I think the execution of Clayton Lockett is impossible because it infringe his humanity. He killed people, indeed, but it doesn't mean losing his humanity. What I was most surprised at is that officials have allowed this execution. Criminal law of U. S is different from that of Japan, but I think humanity should be saved in all countries. So the death penalty must be abolished.  I agree your opinion. As I thought it is cruel thing that killing condemned criminals using three chemicals. But I also there is no help for it because the criminal constituted that much serious crime. We should consider how to execute in order not to be too terrible while we incorporate and opinion from a point of jurisprudence view.  I agree with your opinion. We should think carefully about using some drugs, because it cause acute pain and deprive criminals' human rights easily.  I don't agree with you. I can't take forever to decide a way to die. This decision is very cruel. The death penalty should be abolished completely. It is the best way to protect of human right.  I agree with you. The most basic human rights are treated apart from careers, characters and so on. I think that they are absolute and must be secured for every humans all over the world.  I don't agree with you. I think it is necessary for a criminal like him to execute. This is because if there is no capital punishment, a criminal will increase. And you said his life was only one time, but it's unfair that he isn't executed instead of having murdered. However he shouldn't be killed like a torture since he has human rights and it's against ethic. This idea is the same as you.  I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed.  I agree with your opinion. We should use science for human's benefit even if the receiver is criminal.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish death penalty. Life can't return after death. miss judgment may occur.  I do not agree with you. I don't think that the countries governed by law should allow criminals to decide the way of execution. The way of execution should not change by feelings of criminals.  I agree with you. Of course, criminals should be punished in some way. but that shouldn't be capital punishment. Capital punishment has a lot of fault. For example, If we execute someone by accident, we can't resuscitate him or her. So we have to abolish the practice of capital punishment.  I agree with your opinion. I think human right is equal. Execution is not right for dignity I agree with her opinion because I think she understands the danger of drug.  First, I was very very surprised at this news. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. I think EU should export drugs for capital punishment to the U. S because the death penalty is legal in the U. S and drugs from EU are necessary for smooth execution. By doing so , the U. S don't need to use the three drug method but can use the one-drug method and as a result, smooth execution will be realized, I think.  I agree with this comment. There are many different points around the world. For example, food, clothes, greeting, courtesy, and so on. This is a matter of course, but there is one thing to be common to all, importance of human life. No matter how different their culture is, human life should be treated carefully.  The medical law is not organized very well. The situation is very similar in Japan. American should obey the law. Also, they should confirm the existence and importance of the medical law. But the problem is there is not unified code. I think the code is necessary in this modern society. In this code, they should establish the rights of those who is performed medical treatments and even those who is imposed death penalties by drugs. By this code , although it is innovative and lawyers and jurists don't claim the code is legitimated, people can change the relationship between those who perform and those who is performed fundamentally.  When I read this article, I was really surprised. Before reading this article, I am completely agree with the idea of the death penalty with drugs. Now, however, I think the death penalty must be abolished.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. I think capital punishment is necessary. But using three drugs is not humane. They are criminals, truly. However, they are humans too. So we should think better of it.  Death penalties should be banned quickly. In Japan capital punishments have been executed for a long time. As the opinion of the minority, They think because constitution in Japan says ""The infliction of torture by any public officer and cruel punishments are absolutely forbidden"", putting somebody to death should be stopped. In this article, person which passed death sentence was treated badly. I think it can't be the doing of a man in his senses.  I disagree with you. Because an alternative penalty of capital punishment must be a life sentence. But people don't bear living in a prison whole life. And most of death penalties result in prisoners being overwhelmed and become crazy. So we certainly respect the rights of life of people, by abolishing death penalty, also we violate the personal rights. Therefore, I think we mustn't abolish death penalty. And we introduce a life sentence. And prisoners can choose which sentence should be executed. It is related to not only the criminal law the medical law, such as the problem of euthanasia.  I almost agree with you. Capital punishment should be abolished. Present science technology and court system are insufficient for performing a death penalty. But, we must not forget that death punishment becomes a deterrent of a big crime at the present time.  I think we should not say easily that death penalty is bad or it should be baned. It is because death penalty work as prevention not to commit a felony which sentence a person to death. It is sure that people must respect one's freedom to live. However, ie there is no death penalty, terrible accident would increase. So I think death penalty is better than increasing a lot of terrible crime.  I was surprised that America uses chemicals to do executions and sometimes they lead grotesque scenes. Japan has hanging for death penalty and these ways of capital punishment are both cruel, so I think that we must think more kind way of death penalty.  When I heard this news, I was very surprised. It may be true that Clayton Lockett suffered much more than when he was killed by drugs smoothly. Japan has death penalty too. We should consider about this problem.  I think so, too. Although they killed men, they have human rights. So we should respect their human rights. We should make a low which they can respect ones.  I think it is important to adopt new and more humane way of the penalty, but finally we should aim at the society which don't have any death penalty.  I think so too, because if there is no death penalty, terrible crime may increase. However, I think it isn't best execution. So, we need to reconsider the method of execution.  When I read this article. I was so sad and we should not occur such thing. Death penalty must be banned quickly from all over the world. That is because it is not compensation.  I don't agree with you. I think that death penalty is needed to all over the world.  I agree with you. I think we have little knowledge of drugs. So we should learn about drugs. If we do so, drugs won't be used carelessly.  Death penalty may not be compensation and rights of criminals condemned to death may not be respected, but criminals did victims harm very much. Criminals robbed victims of rights-to-life and made many people sad. So I think Death penalty is needed.  I have a counterargument in your opinion. It approves of your opinion of the first half. I thought that this incident was shocking. However, I think that your idea of ""deciding a punishment by the person's crime"" is not good. The weight of people's life is not compared. The weight of a punishment is not compared strictly, either. A punishment should not be changed with criminal importance, but a death penalty with medicine should be abolished. I assert abolition of capital punishment.  We must explore the way of euthanasia for a death penalty. Condemned criminals are cruel but I think we do not need to let them feel pain when they die.  I strongly disagree with your opinion. It is because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it were a murder. So I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment.  I agree with you. I think execution using drugs which have been prohibited in the euthanizing animals is not good.  I think death penalty should be abolished and I fear drug being used to punish criminals. I feel using drug to kill animals will lead to using drug to kill criminals some day.  I think so too.  I think the story about the execution of Clayton Lockett is so horrible and cruel . To be sure , he committed crime but he is one person and he has human rights . So this news shocked me .  I think death penalty should not be abolished but I think using drug to kill animals is bad thing too .  I am opposed his opinion. Although he asserts the abolition of capital punishment. If a convict says why a death penalty is used, I will be because the crime of only that was committed and will think how it is that asserts only the protection of human rights.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we should abolish the capital punishment. I also have heard the death penalty costs a large sum of money. I think it is not necessary to spend much money on the death penalty. I think that anyone who perpetrates a crime should be treated one of the human beings.  I strongly disagree with your opinion. I do not think that we should abolish capital punishment because without capital punishment, the weight of a crime will be lighter even if it is a murder. I think it is strange. So, I do not think that we must abolish capital punishment.  I also believe that the death penalty should be banned. Everyone, even murderers, has human right. Even the court shouldn't let anyone die even they committed something terrible.  I agree with your opinion. I think human rights are all same. Execution is not right for punishment.  I think that capital punishment is culture. People will be rewarded if he commit the crime which should be carried out death. Seeing historically, the death penalty existed from ancient times considerably. Japanese people think that we should not stop capital punishment for the reason other countries do not accept a death penalty. we should have an opportunity to discuss on humane grounds.  I agree with you, but I think Death Penalty is absolutely wrong way to punish criminals, because I believe no one has the right to kill a person, even a government. So, Any method to execute criminals should be allowed I strongly disagree with you. I believe capital punishment should be abolished as soon as possible, because everyone has the fundamental human right and no one should not invade the right. "
JOC JOC-14A-09N 5.23 "I was very surprised to know that wearing the clothes of the opposite sex is also considered a homosexual act in the teachings of Islam. I knew that homosexuality is prohibited in Islam, but Islam has really tough precepts to make such provisions. However, Islam permeates in Dubai, and it is deeply rooted in people's lives. So foreigners entering such countries had better act with knowing the culture when they visit there and being careful for taboo of the region like 'when in Rome, do as the Romans do'. I also think there maybe a way that Muslims turn a blind eye to actions of foreigners. I understand that considering the difference of values  of religious is hard again.  Maybe, I think that I 'll be surprised a little to see a man who is wearing women's clothing. However, I was surprised to know that there are people who were facing deportation by cross-dressing more than it. I noticed that I don't know and understand well that there are so many ways of thinking, customs and senses of values in the world. There are many people who don't believe in a specific religion strongly in Japan and so I don't, so it is difficult to understand for us. In Islam, I think we should consider the feeling of Muslims particularly.  When I read this article, I was really surprised at the fact that two Filipinos were arrested in UAE because they wore women's clothing. In Japan, men can wear women's clothing, because Japan attach the greatest importance to freedom of thought. However, men are not allowed to wear women's clothing, because UAE attach the greatest importance to their culture. Like this, there are differences in way of thinking between countries. We must learn about foreign countries, and understand them.  I did not know cross-dressing was bad in some area, before I read this article. This is because for Japanese that behavior is not a matter. There are many various kinds of culture in the world, so of course there is one which we cannot expect. The world has globalized and this fact will improve our chances of meeting foreigners. In this situation, we should understand what is good or what is bad in the area in order not to be in trouble and hurt their feelings. We should obey the policy of the country,  When I read this article, I could not why they were dressed like a woman. However they have wore women's outfit since they were a child. So it is difficult for us to make not them not to wear it. Moreover if they wear that clothes, it will not affect us any way. Therefore I would like to suggest that the government should allow them to do so. But a different country probably has a different culture. That is why we also should not do such a unusual behavior in order not to get involved in trouble.  Consideration was lacking although Filipinos were pitiful. It is not bad to wear clothes freely. It is his freedom. However, various culture and religion are all over the world, and there is a fixed concept. Probably, because the consciousness of sex role was strong in UAE, the tailors were arrested. The tailor of the Philippines should have known how he is seen in a strange land.  When I this article, I felt this problem was so difficult. Religious problems in foreign country are always difficult to understand for Japanese. The cause this case happened is similar to the case in Sri Lanka. Both matters happened because of the difference of religious idea. Since the environment in childhood, culture and nationality are different, we can't judge which side is right. However I felt a little sympathy with the two Filipinos arrested for cross-dressing.  This is very interesting article. Today, there are many countries which recognize politically men to behave like women. Its also for women. In such country a man can marry another men. However this article shows that some countries force people to behave as their sex. I think this difference come from the people attitude. In other words, people in some countries recognize things like the article showing as character, some other not. My attitude is former, and I think everyone should have the same idea.  I think our understood about ""gender free"" caused this news. In recent years, there is the voice of the people for ""gender free"" all over the world. It means that we should ban the discrimination by gender difference. And now in Japan, whenever we turn on the TV, ""okama"" appears. Like this, ""gender free"" looks like on the road to be understood. But I don't think so. Because they are usually humiliated by others. I think "" gender free"" means not gender equality but individual equality. We should admit individual difference, for example the man wearing woman's clothes. I hope people can make decisions and do what to like without deporting all over the world.  I think that this incident is very difficult because of personal freedom and cultures which each country has. Personal freedom may be very important right for every people but culture is the thing that must be respected. I think people need to discuss this problem and understand each other in the globalized world.  This article is more surprising than that about tattoos for me. I can understand a Buddha tattoo hurts someone's religious feeling, but men wearing women's clothing don't seem to hurt others' feeling. I can't understand why Dubai Police arrested them.  There is many accidents like this in the world. Actually, if I see the people who is cross-dressing, I will be a little surprised. And I was also surprised that there is a culture that deport cross-dressing people. But I think the reaction like me is not common in the world. People in other countries usually believe a religion and there is many religions in the world. This means that there is many idea, sense of value, feelings, customs. But we Japanese do not believe religion strictly. I think because of this, we can't understand problem like this article. Nowadays Japan is more globalized and opportunities to experience other customs is increased. So we should learn more about this problem and become to be able to understand them.  I was surprised that they were arrested for cross-dressing. The news confused me. It is because that this action do not affect the local people. I can understand the action I knew in the previous class was not good for the local people. Therefore, religion problem is very difficult for people all over the world. I think it is important to understand for other country which has other culture deeply. If we can do this, religion problems improve little by little. In the future, we consider what we should do for resolving religion problems.  When I read this news, I recognized the world and a Japanese difference again. In Japan we can't be caught because the clothes are personal freedom, but there are many countries regulated like this news in the world. I think that the difference in religion and culture greatly affects it. However, a way of thinking of ""the gender-free"" is insisted on now in world many countries. I think that who may wear what kind of clothes if I say along the flow of time. Of course difficult one understands our way of thinking and their way of thinking in different one.  When I read this article, I was surprised that people were arrested just because they wore cross-dressing. Today, there is problem about same sex marry or lover. I think same sex marry and lover could be allowed, because it isn't dangerous for other people who object to it, and if countries or governments don't allow this, it means that they take those freedom. However it isn't easy to solve this problem, because there are difference of culture, religion and so on. Maybe we must respect each country's culture.  I was surprised to read this news. It is difficult to understand this problem because they are unconcerned about religion. In Japan, we can easily see a man who is wearing women's clothing because there is the freedom of expression. However, there are some countries which ban it by culture and religion. There are different cultures , religions and customs in the world. We should respect them. When we visit foreign country, We must keep in mind the words ; "" When in Rome do as the Romans do. "" I think that two men should not be deported if they do not know the fact that cross-dressing is a taboo. It is true that they have freedom of expression. However, their cross-dressing insulted people in UAE. There are considerable taboos all around the world. It is not going too far to say that we have to be familiar with all the taboos. However, they should have understood taboos in a country in which they live. We cannot criticize the law of UAE because cross-dressing is permitted in Japan. We have to give careful consideration to each countries' conditions.  I was surprised that there is a country deporting men for cross-dressing. Although the deport deprives them of freedom certainly, Dubai has taboos in their own way which we Japanese can't understand, so I can't say it's bad necessarily. However, I think the right of freedom should be protected globally. Gender problem won't be solved in the future. What we have to do is understand various thought of countries.  Before reading this article, I have never heard this news so this surprised me very much. The fact that there is a country where people could be arrested for cross-dressing was unacceptable for me because I support the idea that we can wear whatever we like. According to this this article, the United Arab Emirates took strict action and deported the two men, however, they may have not known the cross-dressing was taboo there. I think such action was too severe to make them know the country's taboo. In Japan, a lot of people are polytheist and don't have enough knowledge about the religion. However, we are in a global society now and the number of those who travel foreign countries will be increasing. visitors will need to pay more attention to what they should perform before trip. Anyway, it is true that this kind of news has given rise to considerable concern all over the world.  A gender identity disorder consider a kind of an illness. So these men's behavior is not blamed easily. When I look man like these, I think he is strange men or I am frightened. The reason why they wear that cross-dressing is not they want to be hate by people. The reason is they like these dresses as we choose favorite closes. If people wear any dresses, there is no problem. That is personal liberty, however, there are rules of each community. In the country , their behavior see bad. So people obey the rule at the public and the community. If they can't bear, they go to other community where there behavior are allowed . The problem about personal dignity and obeying a rule as a member of society is so difficult. It is so important that we learn and understand rules of each community in order not to occur these troubles.  Because I had not heard such a story, I was surprised to read this article. What I was surprised at in particular is that they were jailed. In Japan, there is the man who disguised himself as a woman, but those people are not arrested and are not jailed for only a reason to disguise itself as a woman. Surely, I watched the man who disguised himself as a woman and have not felt good. But, It is personal freedom to wear one's favorite clothes, and I think that it is terrible to be imprisoned by the reason of cross-dressing he personal freedom should be respected to the maximum even if there was any religious reason or political reason.  Because I had not heard such a story, I was surprised to read this article. What I was surprised at in particular is that they were jailed. In Japan, there is the man who disguised himself as a woman, but those people are not arrested and are not jailed for only a reason to disguise itself as a woman. Surely, I watched the man who disguised himself as a woman and have not felt good. But, It is personal freedom to wear one's favorite clothes, and I think that it is terrible to be imprisoned by the reason of cross-dressing. The personal freedom should be respected to the maximum even if there was any religious reason or political reason.  In Japan, cross-dressing people used to be looked with a jaundiced eye. But now, I think the prejudice gradually tone down. That's because many of the Japanese does not stick around religious rules. It has its ups and downs. On another front, In the country attaching importance to religious rules, it seems to be difficult to establish harmony of religion and new culture.  Two years ago, my friend's father worked in Dubai, and my friend also have been to Dubai. I did not know that Dubai is strict about fashions, so I really wanted to go there. However, when I read this article, I was so surprised to the fact that people were arrested because of their feminine like fashions and came to hesitate to go there. I have lived in Japan and France, and I have traveled in many other countries, but I have not felt any culture shock, so I didn't think about the culture or laws of countries to which I want to go. I should study them when I travel abroad next time.  In my opinion, cross-dressing is less controversial than religious issues because it never insult others' rights and profits. So I think Dubai's decision that deport two Filipinos is too strict. However, there are many people who feel displeasure when they see cross-dressing. Two Filipinos should have do cross-dressing an inconspicuous place.  I personally think that everybody should be able to wear any clothes they wanted to because fashion is a way to express oneself and it can be a part of identity. Of course, it is necessary and important not to disturb other's feelings because of the difference of the culture, however, it basically should depend on the people's will to decide which to wear.  When I saw this news, I felt the world and a Japanese difference again. I think that it is very important to understand for other country which has other culture deeply, It is because deferent country have deferent culture. If we could care about this, religion problems would improve a lot. I think we should respect individual difference and throw the bias. I hope we could make more decisions without deporting the world.  I felt a bit disappointed to see that there still are some authorities whose values do not allow the freedom of the sexual orientation and sexual attribution. I think that, in the flow of globalization, which spreads universal thoughts and makes the same social systems common all over the world , their hardline attitude will be old-fashioned and will not be able to catch up with current situation. In fact, in other students' comment, almost all the comments they made supports the thought that people should be free to wear what they want, which represents that it is time for ""out of date"" authorities to change minds.  When I read this article, I was surprised at the fact that two Filipinos were arrested in UAE because they wore women's clothing. In the country, religion is deeply rooted people's lives. I think that , in the globalization, we should not have a prejudiced view toward other people's gender.  The Arab countries seem to be too strict to public morals because of passionate faith to Islam. I think if a man wears a woman's shirt and a bra and has make-up, unless he is not dangerous, we may overlook that. And Dubai is very international country now, so restricting of too severe Islam can obstruct more and more development of this country, I think.  I think it wrong for them to arrest people who are wearing a woman's clothes, only because they are wearing clothing of opposite sex. It is because I think it free for people to wear whatever clothes. Clothes are important as people's expression. If the clothes we wear are limited, we cannot express ourselves. For this reason, I think it uncommon that they are wearing clothes of opposite sex.  Before I read this article, I didn't know that cross-dressing is a taboo in Muslim, and at the same time, I was very surprise that what is trifle in Japan is regarded as the violation of the law in some countries. Today, thanks to the globalization, we can see many foreign people in Japan, so it is very important to know the culture or value of other countries, otherwise we may hurt their feelings or may not make good relationship with them.  I think that it is an interesting story. First, I surprised that foreign people do cross dressing because I thought that the cross dressing is only Japanese culture before I read this news. Second, in Filipinos, such people who do cross dressing are objects of arrest. I want to care about foreign culture more.  I cannot show what we should do to solve this problem. On the one hand, every one has human rights. Therefore, homosexual persons should be guaranteed to live their wanted life. On the other hand, in Dubai, homosexuality has been prohibited strictly. Of course, it is impossible to restrain love by low. However, if other countries or organizations suppose the UAE withdraw the suppression of homosexuality, bigger disputes will occur When I read this news, I was surprised. I can't understand why homosexuals act as such. However, people have the right to have a creed. Other people should not restrict their creed. I didn't know dressing as a women is an illegal act. Japan have that people who dress as a women. I sensed that the world was very wide. I want to know other countries' cultures.  I think this kind of problem is so complicated, because it is relevant to gender, religion, difference between countries and so on. I have always been shocked at the articles like this. In this article, two Filipinos were arrested by UAE, because they wore women's clothing. I have two points that I want to claim. First, we should be more careful when we touch the different culture of other cultures. I think ""not knowing"" is the most dangerous. Second, we should also have tolerant mind. Understanding different cultures is so difficult, but it is important that we think individual freedom of cultures.  I was surprised that there is a country deporting men for wearing the clothes of the opposite sex. And it is also considered a homosexual act in the teachings of Islam. I hope to the world will become more comfortable to live for all people.  I think we reach the time to accept such people whose bodies are male but their identities are women, and vice versa. Of course I know there are Muslims and Catholics those who do not accept homosexuality. But as biology have progressed, we realize people's bodies and minds are sometimes not completely match. But it is doubtful that the God almighty or Allah judges them ugly existences and orders us to prejudice such minority. What is different from Jew's thought, the God of Muslims and Catholics are very kind and loves us even we are imperfect. (of course sometimes we bring his superior's anger. ). And this is important, because we are all imperfect and different individuals, we have different imperfect factors. Some people have gender imperfections. This thought should be shared all people who are stereotype everythings. And kindness of him, we will abstract the thought homosexuality. We can live as we want. And arabic countries should abolish old fashioned criminal penalty immediately.  I thought that cultures problems among countries are difficult. Previously I read the article that one British woman had arrested in Sri Lanka for her blasphemy. Like this, I understood the religion problem is very complex. I have been to Dubai and Saudi Arabia twice. There is a strict Muslim code of behavior. Even I as a foreigner had to put on Islamic coat. Even Adults are banned to drink alcohol. There are many more strict regulations there. I was surprised how rigid the Islamic religion is. So when I read this news , I was not surprised at this news so much. Because I have already known this is the Islam. But in general even if one man wears woman's clothes , he would not be arrested. Thus the religion problems is so complicated and we had better not intervene thoughtlessly.  If i meets with the culture different from Japan, I will be surprised not a little. This news is also one of them. When I goes into the store of fast fashion, it overflows with the goods of a unisex design and is on the contrary. If eyes are shone well, it will be the spectacle of Japan being sufficient and seeing. It may be the culture very naturally accepted now when the difference between men and women in an occupation or a way of life is being lost.  People should know the proverb ""When in Rome do as the Romans. "" In the globalized world, we need to respect other cultures. That's why we should follow the local ideas. However, we also have to care about foreign cultures. People can respect each other. We can make concessions.  I think that protecting the dignity of the individual is very important. Each person also have each tastes. I think I will not be able to endure If we receives interference by the Government to personal preference. This article makes me aware of what is free, I thought.  I know there are some ""new half ""s in Philippines and the culture of dressing as as woman may not be strange and regarded as one expression. However, UAE is the nation of Islam, so their strange appearance and action might be judged improper. In my opinion, it is natural that we have various thoughts respectively but we should consider whether it's OK to express or not depending on the situation.  I believe we have rights to choose what clothes we wear so the government should not force them not to wear women's clothes.  This news is very shocking for me, because I've never heard people who are arrested because of their fashion style in modern world. I thought, in modern world, our view of gender is considerably liberal and matured, also in Philippines (of course I know this is stereotype, though. . . ) . And I think we should do so. However, this news broke such my hope, so I was very disappointed. I strongly hope that our way of thinking about gender will be matured over the world as soon as possible.  Many Japanese people may think that to deportation them is too strict action against wearing women's clothes. In Japan, it is not odd for men to wear women's clothes and many people practice no religion. On the other hand, in Muslim countries, they have a strict protect about Islam. So, it is not easy to say that in Muslim countries, people can wear whatever they like and are allowed to do transsexualism when religious and ethnic problem is related. To avoid such a accident, we should investigate other country's culture before visiting or living in them. However, I think that the best thing is that all country get tolerant of sex and culture.  When I read the article, I remembered a famous saying, ""When in Rome do as the Romans do. "" Certainly everyone has the freedom of choice and it doesn't ban to wear clothes like opposite sex. From the viewpoint of today's trends, intolerance of person's appearance is regarded as nonsense. However, if many people feel unhappy when they see someone's unusual clothes against their religions, the one should abstain from having the clothes. When in UAE do as the Arabs do. I think it is the first rule when we visit foreign country, which have different cultures from ours.  I think we can't criticize this accident of deportation wholly, because there are a lot of customs and a lot kind of common sense. If we, Japanese criticize this punishment, then we deny the customs which has taken over for a long time in Dubai. It is too subjective view what is called prejudice. Thus, we should make every effort to see the other tradition in order to aim the eye without a biased viewpoint even impossible.  I haven't known that cross-dressing is regarded as a bad manner in some countries before I read this article. I think it is difficult for Japanese people to understand this incident because there are various religions in Japan and we don't believe some peculiar religion deeply. However, recently Japan is becoming more and more globalized rapidly , so Japanese people may meet different culture more often. That's why Japanese people have to understand the feelings of people, who have different religion, culture, race, and history. I suppose Japanese people should make efforts to figure out the tradition of other country without preconception.  I understand that we should respect each individual will. However, forcing certain thoughts is one of the acts of disrespecting others dignities. For the people of UAE, cross-dressing is under taboo. We also ought to respect their culture.  I respect and foster cultural diversity. I think that it is ensured the freedom of clothes in every place. But, we can't force to understand that. The unique culture isn't easy to change. So, we should be tolerant of various views and develop a spirit of mutual understanding. We shouldn't think exclusively in terms of the other culture. I want to have a heart as big as all outdoors.  Reading this article, I was a little bit disappointed. In my opinion this is the infringement of the fundamental human right. Whatever they wear, eat , do, the administrative machinery of a state should not ban them as long as they may not harm other's right. On one hand , I can understand that the culture has its own value and rule;On the other hand I presume that it should not collide with the one's values.  I do not think so, because I think the proverb ""Do in Rome as the Romans do. "" is really reasonable. If we visit foreign countries, we should understand their culture and custom. Every convention and view of religion should be respected.  There is such a topic while globalization advances, and the culture of various countries fuses. However, as for us, there are many illegal things just because of legality in one's country in other countries. After all it is important to follow the law of one's country. However, it cannot be said that I think about culture in all like that. It is difficult, but it seems to be important to recognize each other.  I agree with his opinion. There are many cultures in this world, and there are many people who have a different way of thinking from us. So, we have to respect each other to get along with foreign people.  I understand you. I think it is free for people to wear clothing of opposite sex. So we should not discriminate the persons.  When I read this article, I was surprised because it is forbidden that man wear woman's clothes in Islam. But culture should be allowed even if we can't understand the culture. We must respect it.  I was very surprised to know that story. I think that there are people like that. In conclusion, cultural difference cause this problem. We should make communication all over the world. Therefore we can at least know foreign countries. In addition we should reconsider our culture.  We must respect foreign cultures. When we visit a foreign country, we should learn this country's culture.  I think we should respect foreign values.  When I read this article, I was also very surprised. The reason is that I didn't know the taboo that wearing the clothes of the opposite sex was considered a homosexual act in the teaching of islam. In Japan, the number of Muslim may be small so a lot of Japanese don't have enough knowledge about religion. However, we live in a global society and more and more people will have chances to go abroad. As my classmate says, I also find it very important to learn from the words, "" when in Rome, do as the Romans do. "" We should pay attention to several difference of each culture. "
JOC JOC-14A-10N 5.39 "I think that capital punishment should be banned in Japan. Capital punishment has led to abuse of human rights. We should be skeptical about the necessity of death penalty. Why don't we innovate a way to life imprisonment? Death penalty deterrence is the same as life imprisonment. Life imprisonment has adequate deterrent force against crimes.  A medicine injection that lead to acute pain should not be used for a death penalty and the death penalty should be abolished. Blame to using a medicine for a death penalty is carried out in the US whole country. This blame has prone to become strong. There are many methods of a death penalty. For example, Japan is hanging and China is shooting. Of course, there is no good method. It is because it altogether ignores human light. A death penalty causes important problems other than punishment. Therefore, you should abolish a lethal injection and the death penalty.  In my opinion, we shouldn't abolish the death penalty , but we should argue the way of it. Today, many people say ""We don't need the death punishment. "" Its true that there are some ethical problem in the death penalty, however it doesn't conclude that we abolish it. We have to recognize that the death penalty have become prevention. I think we should invite the way of punishment which cut the hurt as much as possible.  I think we should make death penalty banned. In my opinion, We can't pay our life as consideration the victim for our even terrible mistake. Instead of the executive, We should make the non-capital punishment more heavy.  Capital punishment using injection is very fearful. I will never commit a crime in the US.  I think lethal injection should not be practiced. Somebody who inject chemical medicine into the condemned criminal will suffer under a heavy mental burden and he have to see the execution though. I think hanging in Japan is a cruel, but the mental burden will not be on executor so much than lethal injection because executors don't know who pressed the button to execute. I think that's the death penalty is cruel, but it should be devised so that emotional distress won't be given to both executor and prisoner if the execution are practiced.  I think that Japan should abolish the capital punishment. Besides with the medicine if is executed; all the more. I think that it contradicts it on the other to get rid of the life of the person by the death penalty in an instant while conveying importance of the life. However, we may not forgive the person who committed a crime. Thus, I think that Japan should think about the punishment for the death penalty newly.  I would like to suggest that the capital punishment should be prohibited in US. Even if the way to execute becomes more humane, it will be ignoring the human rights, Especially, in executing with those drugs, there are possibilities that the capital punishment becomes so gruesome like Clayton Lockett's case. Moreover executioners have a lot of mental burden when they carry out the death sentence. Therefore we should abolish the death penalty in US and also in Japan.  I think the death penalty is necessary to atone for the sins which is can not be allowed to do. However, we should discuss the way of execution. I think that we must treat people who have committed a felony as the same people. It is difficult because of having a prejudice of criminals. However, I think it is natural that criminals feel the pain what they had done. Therefore, we have to consider how to execute the death penalty from now. Considering the death penalty is important to consider the right to humans.  I think that all country should abolish the capital punishment. In the US when a condemned criminal is put to death executed , a lethal injection is used. This execution with pain infringes on a person's rights. Moreover , I have heard death penalty costs a large sum of money. I think it is not necessary to execute to spend money which people pay. Therefore we should abolish the capital punishment and I suppose life imprisonment.  When I read this news, I felt it is ironical because those who are in opposition to execution made death penalty regime more barbarous. I think that criminals pay for their crimes by death. The states should take criminals' human rights into execution. When death penalty is carried out, a lot of people including the family of a criminal groan inwardly. I go into the feelings of people who are against capital punishment. However, we have to have capital punishment regime as the deterrent.  I think it was good action for the European Union to sustain European campaign to stop these drugs for executions because this has led to a massive drug shortage in the U. S. As death penalty opponents say, we should consider how terrible such punishment is and find a new way to make criminals feel sorry for what they did. There will be needed to punish them, however, I think capital punishment cannot lead to peaceful settlement but terrible consequences. When the drug fails to work properly, both executioners and prisoners would experience the torture. Nowadays, there are being a lot of discussions about the death penalty issue and I think this is very severe problem. Although it is difficult to decide whether we stop such punishment promptly, it is the most important thing that each people reconsiders what the human right is like.  I think capital punishment should be abolished, but sometime there is crime that criminal have to atone by death. So the way of execution like lethal injection should be considered seriously. In lethal injection, there is someone who inject medicine into criminal's body. This means that he excite criminal. Because of this, he may be suffer from mental damage that ""I killed criminal"". But in Japan, hanging execution, there are three people who push the button to execute. So they three don't know who executed criminal. It is clear that there is less mental damage than execution by lethal injection. Capital punishment is not good, but for the situations we need it, we have to consider about way of execution with less mental damage for executioner and protecting criminal's human rights.  I don't sure whether countries should ban capital punishment or not. It is sure that a culprit who kill people or commit a gruesome crime have to be carried out a heavy punishment, but it isn't sure that even if a culprit was punished death penalty, victim's family may not be satisfied. However, even if there is no capital punishment, gruesome troubles will increase. My individual opinion is we may admit capital punishment, because it is effective not to increase terrible crimes.  When I read the title, I couldn't understand what is the meaning. I suppose some actions of abolished the system of capital punishment is good. So I think people should oppose the punishment in order to save criminal's human rights. But this title indicated my ideas are not right. So I considered this problem from the different point of view. I can't understand the reason why capital punishment is carried out. I think the way to punish the people is no use, because a criminal have no chance that he understand that is bad thing and reflect on his action. I have a question that criminal is forgiven or the problems are resolved by punishment. I think we should teach what is bad thing and what is good thing is important for a criminal and a society. So I think capital punishment should be abolished. When I read this article, I suppose we should think about looking for the way not to punish but to mend a criminal's mind and action.  When I read this article, I was so surprised to know that the lethal injection used in executions are not used by physicians in the US. I think capital punishments are not necessary in any countries. However, if my family or my friend were to be the victim, I might think that executions are necessary. I think the best way to pay regard to victims and death penalty's opponents' opinions is executing without lethal injections.  I think capital punishment should be abolished. Although it's important to impose a penalty for criminals in order to repeat and increase crimes, the penalty is pointless if he or she doesn't live. The criminal should atone for an offense by action. If capital punishment is executed, the crime isn't forgiven. And from the point of human right, it's concerned with ethical problem that criminal die suffering from acute pain. Thus, we should abolish capital punishment.  Recently, the death penalty is seemed to be barbaric or illegal. However, it is demanded by the family of victim of a murder case. I think that if I were in a position of them, I may hurt or kill the murder by myself. To prevent such a situation, the capital punishment should not be abolished. Of course, a support to anesthesiology physicians and executioners is important. If the national government or state give a big support to them mentally and financially, they may not opposite to the execution.  I think it is very difficult problem because the more death penalty opponents are gained, the more lethal injection occur. We should stop lethal injection from its origin, for example, stop manufacturing drugs. Also I think we should finally abolish death penalty because it cause a chain of hatred. It is important to support criminals return to the society and never they commit a crime.  When I saw this article, I felt it is ironical, because those who are in opposition to execution made death penalty regime more barbarous. I think that the capital punishment should be prohibited all over the world. It is because it is not necessary to use. We should think about how to execute the death penalty. Careering about the death penalty is important to think about the human rights.  I think that it is very difficult problem because the more death penalty opponents are gained, the more lethal injection occur. We should stop lethal injection from its origin, for example, stop manufacturing drugs. But, I cannot decide whether the government should abolish death penalty or not. It is very difficult problem. So we should consider the problem.  It is surely important that the execution method is humanitarian. Because a criminal has the human rights tentatively. However, I am against insisting on the abolition of capital punishment only for a reason that ""the execution method is non-humanitarian. "" We must think about the substitute plan for it well if we abolish the death penalty. This is because they are the criminals who committed a crime and were sentenced to death although they have their own human rights.  there are death penalty problems we have difficulties in solving. In the problems, most important, the drugs we use when we execute people who crime give them suffering, and we should think weather people who crime have rights or not. In America, three drugs was probably used in death penalty. But I think states should use only one drug to carry out lethal injections due to human rights concerns. We also should think better of death penalty.  I was surprised at the fact that death penalty is under such complicate situation. I personally think capital punishment itself is not violating the human rights, and there are some benefits to conduct it. For example it can be a deterrent and prevent criminals from commit a clime. However, death penalty under the such condition seriously undermine human rights. Even criminals should be able to die in piece with feeling regret that they commit the clime.  Abolition of the death penalty is a difficult problem. the numbers of countries of the abolition of the death penalty are increasing more and more, it is also prohibited in EU in the this article. As a result, the lack of drug protocol for the death penalty has spread to the United States. To live as one of the human rights is important, there is a need to consider the death penalty from a humanitarian standpoint. , Including the problem of drug protocol.  I know that capital punishment should be abolished for protecting criminal's human rights and even if the punishment is implemented, the way should be taken account of ethical aspect. But, I think that if I were on the place of victim's family, I couldn't think dispassionately like that. Besides, about the way of condemned death, it remains the question""although crimeless people are killed by atrocious way, the criminal should be executed by easy way"".  When we look at the world, there are many countries that adopt death penalty, and many people say that we should find a better and more humane way to execute prisoners or should abolish it. Certainly whether we adopt death penalty or not is a controversial issue. However, before we talk about it, what we have to do is to face the reality that there are crimes that deserve death penalty, and find ways to decrease them. If we can succeed in it, it is sure that a better society will come.  Capital punishment using lethal injection should be abolished. It cause the horrific situation, in other words, we may give the prisoners the pain that is more painful than the deed he did. It isn't humanitarian. We humans only have the intelligence, so we can improve the situation. In my opinion, It is true that the criminals should be punished in some way, but it should not be painful. This is so difficult problem that we take a long time to consider the solution.  Thanks to Oklahomas botched execution, it is clear that drug punishment is outdated. This is because it seems impossible to create drug injection system that is more humane. As writer says, pharmaceutical firms decline to supply the most efficacious lethal injection drugs. Moreover, today, human and animal experimentations have been limited. Therefore, we cannot make more humane lethal drugs. The writer proposes death penalty opponents should re-consider their act. However, i suggest the 32 states of USA which have capital punishment should re-consider their present lethal punishment system. They should decide two choices , one is developing more humane executions, and the other is abolishing their lethal punishment systems.  The problem of capital punishment is very difficult. Some countries banned it. In Japan opponents insist that Japan should follow other countries. In my opinion, capital punishment should not be abolished. But the way of execution must not be inhumane. For example, government must not use them to test new drugs.  I think that capital punishment should be banned, because there is a risk of wrong execution. Instead of it we need to build system of treat of criminals.  I was surprised when I read the headline of this article, because there are shocking words""Death penalty opponents are making capital punishment more gruesome. "" At First, I can't understand it. It seems whether capital punishment should be abolished or not consists complicated things I have ever expected. In my opinion, capital punishment should be abolished, because as long as it exists, the true peace will never come. It is true that capital punishment restrains the crime, but we should reconsider what is proper punishment.  I was shocked reading this news , and also surprised that we do not know who is actually performing which part of any one lethal injection. The fact that the reason lethal injection has become more gruesome and violent is at least partly a result of opposition to the death penalty is contradict and deplorable.  A death penalty problem becomes the center of attention frequently even in Japan. Japan has introduced capital punishment. The same may be said also of South Korea and China, neighboring countries. I think that capital punishment is culture. People will be rewarded if he commit the crime which should be carried out death. Seeing historically, the death penalty existed from ancient times considerably. Japanese people think that we should not stop capital punishment for the reason other countries do not accept a death penalty. we should have an opportunity to discuss on humane grounds.  When I read this article, I think that capital punishment should be abolished in Japan. Killed person can't come back to life, so false charge must not happen. But a judgment is person, so a mistake certainly occurs. In addition, murder is prohibited by law in Japan , but the state is carrying out homicide formally. I think that this is inconsistent. From the above thing, I think that the capital punishment should be abolished.  I agree the capital punishment but I think injections are not good ideas. I suggest the hanging. Americans or Europeans hate the hanging. But it is much easier and less pains than injections.  I don't think death penalty should be abolished because I'm sorry about bereaved families when I think about their feelings. If death penalty are abolished death rows will survive and be given the time that they think their action over, but people who was killed by them will never revive. This contradiction must not be allowed.  The right and wrong for the death penalty has been a huge issue since the death penalty had started. There has been countless opinions for the pros and cons for the death penalty and the way to carry it out. If the method of killing the criminal is too harsh or cruel, it definitely violates human rights. However, as they say, ""An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth"" , the criminal did something that deserves getting the death penalty. These two opinions clash with each other very often. I believe that although the criminal did commit a crime that was equal to being sentenced to death, it is morally and ethically wrong to torture the criminal like this. We should all think more about what method is truly right for the death penalty and whether we should abolish it or not.  I disagree with the idea of banning the death penalty. This is because the capital punishment has deterrence power . Indeed, if we abolished the death penalty , crimes may happen more .  To me, banning the death penalty seem too idealistic. Of course it harms human rights in a way, but without it, how can we punish malicious criminals? Jailing them forever can be one solution, but I think it has some bad aspects, such as costs that is necessary to run prisons and the fear that we may not be able to control horrible criminals with punishments that ""respects human rights"". In fact, the Republic of the Maldives, which had banned the capital punishment, recently adopted it again because there were many prisoners and they became almost out of control. My point is that we should discuss this problem more and more deeply, and take as much time as possible. Prior to the decision, we should consider pros and cons about the embargo of the execution.  I think that death penalty should be abolished. Some says that it would be deterrent. Criminals who are about to commit crimes would stop doing that because they scare the capital punishment. However I should abolish this system. Firstly, the right of human is not protected. People should not be killed by someone and can live freely even if they are criminals. Secondly, it would be cruel if innocent men would judged to charge death penalty mistakenly. It is false charge. This charge break someone's live and make acquaintances of the man sad. In conclusion, death penalty should be abolished.  I also oppose execution of inmates who have committed heavy crimes because it violates human rights. We should make effort to abolish capital punishment, but it is very difficult. This is because this problem is related to ethical problem. Moreover, there are not more effective ways of punishment than capital punishment. So, it is more important to find effective way of punishment than to claim that capital punishment must be abolished. IN the USA and Europe, they use lethal injection to execute criminals on death row . It is said to be humane comparatively but, as Oklahoma execution of Clayton Lockett, terrible things sometimes happen. If execution continues, there must not be such a things.  Many people are for death penalty, and many people are against death penalty. This issue is so controversial that everyone has their opinion. Perhaps, this argument will not end. But, I think death penalty should not be abolished. Certainly, capital punishment is cruel for the criminals. Someone would think death penalty violates human dignity and rights, and no one have the right to deprive criminals of their lives, even a major power. However, it is obvious that capital punishment is a deterrent to crime. If authorities do away with death penalty, crime rate would increase rapidly and the public peace would be disturbed. That's why I'm for death penalty.  In Japan, death penalty is adopted. It is the truth that the death penalty is useful for Japan now. The existence of it is deterrent of felonies. If it came to be abolished, the number of crimes may increase rapidly. However, I don't agree to death penalty. I have heard newses about false charges recently. People who served many years in prison on a false charge were robbed their precious life time and it never return to them. Possibly people who are innocent are condemned to death. I'm frightened at that it occur actually.  I am interested in whether capital punishment is abolished, so I read this article more earnestly than the other article. To be honest, I think that capital punishment should be abolished . However we may have to think the way for criminals to atone for their sin, if the capital punishment were abolished. I suppose we should give the criminals the chance to understand what his action reflected on and what the bad thing is. We have to get the criminals back on the right track again , not punish them, and that will contribute greatly to everyone in order to form the safe society.  In terms of human rights ( in other words, in principle), I agree with you in every aspect. But in reality, we are short of money to realize the ideal way to treat criminals that does not harm their rights. If we abolish the capital punishment, we cannot deny that something will happen that makes our society out of control.  I strongly agree with your opinion. To discuss about death penalty is very difficult, but it is very important. I think death penalty should be allowed, because if there us no lethal penalty, cruel crime may increase. However, how to exact have to be discussed carefully. It is because, it is related to people's right to live. So, I agree with that we have to think about how to execute carefully.  I don't agree with you. I think death penalty is necessary for us. It is because death is very heavy punishment, so it is suitable for people's judgment who commit a heavy crime. And I can't imagine the substitution.  I disagree with your opinion. This is because we have not become a victim, we insist when we should abolish the death penalty, but think that a feeling not to be able to permit stays even if it is the death penalty when it is really to a victim. In addition, the criminal ordered the death penalty causes a serious crime. The imprisonment for life is one of the heavy penalties, but surely thinks that after all it is different from the death penalty in heaviness by the imprisonment for life. Therefore the system of the death penalty thinks that it is necessary to consider the thought of the left bereaved. Of course it is not a meaning beginning newly in the abolished country now.  When I read this article, I can't understand well about ""the real culprit in the death of Clayton Lockett "". Why does the real culprit that killed him in the gruesome way become the opposition to the death penalty? I think it doesn't make sense. If the result of opposition to the death penalty leads to the conclusion that lethal injection has become more violent in recent years, they do not continue insisting that no capital punishment system will ever be tolerated, should work with those who demand executions in order to create a system that is more humane in the right now.  I don't agree with you. Certainly, victim's emotional request for a harsh penalty must be appreciated. So, I can understand your logic. But, that wouldn't be solving the problem. When the criminal person is executed, the families of victims can't recover from grief maybe. I think that the victims is dissatisfied regardless of the sentence. Thus, overriding problem is not so much victim's emotional but protection of human rights.  I don't agree with your opinion. I think death penalty should be abolished. There are many people committed a serious crime that they should atone with their death. Besides, if death penalty were abolished, could the family of the victim accept the decision? When I think their feelings, I can't say it should be abolished.  I disagree with your opinion. I think we should have death penalty. It is because in some case, we need this penalty. If some people killed someone, I think judge death penalty is the best way.  I think the capital punishment system is necessary but once we adopt that system, we should execute the punishment as smoothly as we can and mustn't cause the accident like the case of Clayton Lockett. Taking into account the feeling of the family of the victim, the death penalty is quite valid and is deterrent which discourage the occurrence of atrocious case.  The problem of death penalty is not a simple problem. Death penalty is definitely cruel, but the cruelness of death penalty is holding down the number of crimes. So, the number of crimes will be increase if death penalty is abolished. We have to consider carefully about this problem.  Opinions are divided as to whether the death penalty should be abolished or retained. Whichever one is chosen, the most importance thing is treating human life equally and carefully. However, from the point of view of victim, death penalty may be a reasonable sanction. As stated above, we could not come to the conclusion of this discussion easily. I think Japan has a strong feeling of protection of victims and death penalty will continue.  I think that you should not abolish the death penalty as my opinion. Probably I think that it is the heaviest punishment. I think that it becomes the deterrent by there being such a punishment. However, we must think about human rights. We must be very careful on carrying out punishment. We may become a criminal if we do not carry it out after having regarded human rights as the death penalty well.  I disagree your opinion. Death penalty is definitely cruel. However, the cruelness of death penalty is holding down the number of crime. We must not decide promptly that death penalty should be abolished.  I strongly disagree with you. If criminals are punished death penalty, bereaved families cannot be happy. Moreover criminals also have parents so we have to consider such people. Therefore I suggest that capital punishment should be abolished.  I disagree with your idea. Capital punishment is needed for Japan. Capital punishments limit the crime. We should not forget this fact. We need to think about our laws with our ideas not foreign ideas.  I don't think so. The way of punishment should be more humane, not abolish the capital punishment. It is said that there are a given number of crimes in spite of the presence or absence of capital punishment and weigh of perpetrator's life is the same weigh of victim's one. However perpetrators owe weigh of responsibility. I think it is compelling to teach criminals the weigh of life. But we must be careful about false accusation.  As I said my opinion on the same article, we should not abolish the capital punishment right away. Moreover, as she said, the death penalty still play an important role on preventing people from murder. We should think of this problem not emotionally but logically.  I don not agree with you. Life imprisonment takes a lot of cost, we do not want pay our money for people who have committed grave crimes. Instead adopt this idea, we had better make a better way to punish crimes.  I disagree with your opinion. I think the capital punishment is needed. I think the capital punishment should be improved.  I think death penalty should be abolished all over the world. Of course, I was against using lethal injection. Because we shouldn't be killed any person by any means. And I believe even brutal criminals can become a good persons. So we should give a chances to them.  I think death penalty should be abolished all over the world. Of course, I'm against using lethal injection. Because we shouldn't be killed any person by any means. And I believe even brutal criminals can become good persons. So we should give chances to them.  I think that capital punishment is crucial but should be banned. Murders lose other's life. Although they have human rights, they should be punished.  The death penalty is one of the most controversial matter we have today. But if we abolish the death penalty, what is the prisoners going to be? They would be imposed a life sentence. But I know the prisoners in French lose their mind. Yes, it is true that death penalty is violation of the rights of life, but it is also true that life sentence is the violation of human dignity and inner thought. So we have to stop thinking life sentence is a perfect penalty. Therefore we should think carefully abolishing death penalty.  I disagree with your opinion. I think capital punishment should remain in Japan.  I strongly agree with your opinion. Capital punishment should not be abolished. Your opinion is right, and capital punishment is a strong deterrent to crime.  I disagree with you because I think death penalty should be abolished. And there are some reasons. First, I think the death penalty doesn't play a part as prevention. In practice, there isn't difference on a number of crimes between the countries that have death penalty and the countries that don't have it. And it includes many ethical problem. So I think it should be abolished. But if it can't be abolished, I agree to your opinion, ""I think we should invite the way of punishment which cut the hurt as much as possible. "".  I disagree with you. I think death penalty don't abuse of human rights. Criminals condemned to death did cruel crime. Their deed did many people harm and made many people sad. So I disagree with you. All the country should need the capital punishment because execution is the only way to save the victim and their family.  I think we should abolish death penalty because the most important right of human is right of living and criminals have chance to live correctly again.  I agree with you. I think your opinion is to the point. Explanation make your argument clear.  From the point of victims, I can't help saying that their feeling are never cured and the best way to mild it is the give serious sentence to criminals. Although it sounds like I saying it from emotion, how can we cure victims feeling without punishing criminals. It is necessary to consider the criminals' rights, however it's coming after considering the victims In my opinion, the capital punishment is different from just killing people. Criminals just ask for what they did, and it couldn't be rejected. Although criminals are man and they have right, they robed it of others. I know the word I'm going to say isn't right and many people criticize me but I say the people who robed someone's right deserves being punished. Moreover, the punishment serves as the prevention of crime. So we should have the kind of prevention. "
JOC JOC-14A-11N 5.54 "I think it is impossible to establish privacy laws and regulations which benefit all of us. everybody has made mistakes. In addition, every one has bad memories and want others not to find the matters. Of course it is important to reconsider past faults. We should reconsider past faults in order not to fail again. However, there is a difference between individual reflection on our own faults and open them to the public. If there are articles about somebody's fault on the website, the person has a possibility that he has been ridiculed and insulted even after the person died.  Although this is an important problem which is opposed to freedom of the press, what should be considered in the first place is public interest. At first, it was Google which seethed with anger at the ruling. But after all ""the right forgotten"" was accepted and Google started making to clear of data. However, it is doubtful which rights -- the freedom of a report or the right to be forgotten-- excel. Don't burden only search engine with responsibility. The most important thing is whether they bring people's benefit or not.  The right to be forgotten seems to be more important than the right to know. It is true that private information on the internet is just noise for many people. However someone might be interested in the information, and spread it. It's the matter. We have to pay attention to our privacy because it's unexpectable that what happens on the internet.  The development of the Internet does life very usefully, but thinks that we must not forget that such a problem may come out either. The problem of the privacy is very difficult and is not the thing which can be easily solved. It is important to ""the forgotten right"" finished in a topic this time, but thinks that it is difficult to make a standard. But I think that it was a chance that it is thought by having got nervous in a topic like this time. In this way, I think that it is very important that I guarantee the right that is necessary or important for people.  I found this kind of matter very difficult because it is hard to make ruling to balance between privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we are able to use the Internet whenever or wherever we like, and this made our daily lives convenient. At the same time, however, we see a threat to several problems. We often hear that there are a lot of Internet risks such as computer viruses or addictive games. The news of hacking of the Internet Explorer stolen bank, credit card details became well-known. In this news, debt was information which Gonzalez wanted to forget so I think it is true that he seethed with anger at search engines. However, all of us have to understand that many people all over the world can see the website and be more sensitive about ""privacy"" as users.  The Internet system is essential for the people when we do something in the present lives. Certainly, I often use the Internet in the study. I am not damaged the Internet problems. However, I cannot predict when I am damaged. It is difficult problem because it is ambiguous how far we are able to publish individual informations. When I read this article, I try to pay attention to being involved such a problem.  We could not live everyday life without the Internet. The Internet is very useful to communicate with a lot of people all around the world. At the same time, it is accompanied by danger. Our privacy may be invaded. We are given the freedom of expression that support democracy. However, I think the government should make a ruling that protect privacy. On the other hand, i am worried the day may come when people will be controlled by technology and lose their individuality.  It is difficult to make up a well-balanced idea between personal privacy and public right of access to information. The Internet is useful for many people. And the search engine is also useful for us. If the system is abolished , many people loss the convenient system. Who will get benefit on the case. I agree the article said that the winner is a criminal and convicted person. Because their worse information are erased . That is good news for them. But all information are erased, if people want, people rob the right and ways to know a lot of information. So When the information is erased, we discuss and consider whether the information is important for public and people. If that is Important information for public and people, that is left on the Internet . Although the way to erase take many times, the problem is so important for ours life and right that we should take as much time as we are satisfied. And we should hold the balance between privacy and the right to know .  Whenever it comes to individual privacy data , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted. It is true that you can find much information through the internet easily and instantly. But this also means that people who want to disturb you can access to information about you. at this time, your privacy data would not be erased once it flowed out on the internet. In other words, your privacy data continues to live permanently. It is too dangerous to use the internet. Thus , ""right to be forgotten"" should be admitted.  As the Internet has developed, there are also developing many problem with it. We have access to huge information, and whatever the information is they will never be deleted without we doing so. In other words, the information updated to the Internet is never lost naturally. We can't help saying that now is the time that people do never forget the something on the Internet. Also, we have to consider the way to protect personal right.  In modern times, Internet influence a lot all of the world. The right of privacy also is suffered from the many information of people. However, Internet system is very useful in our life, so we can't stop using it. Most important thing when we use it is see through the correct information. If we can do it, It help us know , watch and hear various data. I want to pay attention to incorrect information.  I think that this kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. These days, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. At the same time, however, we have a possibility of some risks of Internet. For example, computer viruses, addictive games or hacking of the Internet and so on. We should consider the right way of using Internet.  This is very important problem for us, particularly the young. Today, everyone who has a computer or cellphone can use Internet, and it is very convenient for us to search something. Internet give people convenient environment. However, Internet has also dangerous side. In this article, it said individual privacy is faced danger. These days a lot of people use SNS, for example Facebook and twitter. Those SNS are very interesting for us, but we have to take care how to use, or we may faced problem as in this article. So, I think what we can do now is to use Internet and SNS carefully.  The Internet is very convenient, but is really dangerous. People may be unconscious, but, for example, it leads to a leak of the personal information even to put one's photograph of the face on the profile image of SNS. Besides people of the world can see the public records - even if it is convenient or inconvenient for oneself. If records that the contents are not good for the person are left semipermanently, affecting that is bad in the later life of the person may be inevitable. Therefore I think that ""right to be forgotten"" is necessary.  Today we can get any information from the internet, and communicate with people all around the world any time. It is so convenient. But it also mean we have possibility of getting many risks like viruses, bad informations having bad influences and privacy problems etc. . We don't know when and how damaged such a problems. So it is important that we are putting our lives at risk every time whenever we are using internet.  Privacy is an important right for people. Freedom of the press and the right to know might be a thing can be in conflict with privacy. However, once such information is spread to people, it is not possible to erase it. I think that there is a great obligation for a company with a large social impact, such as Google to the protection of privacy. , I want you to be so. I thought it was because it is society that many people use the Internet, we also must become more sensitive.  Your opinion is interesting. Indeed, the majority of people have no interest in the privacy of others. However, there are people who are not a little interested. I felt it's privacy in order to guard against such people.  Nowadays, we cannot think of the world without Internet. We can search various information like personal history from Internet. However, when we do so, we always face the problem. If we support one's privacy and people can just erase whatever they want, it means others miss the opportunities to know about them. And if we support the idea that people have the right to know and people can't delete the information they want others not to know on Internet, the person may miss the chance to start over. As I mentioned above, this problem isn't easy to be solved, but we should always consider what is the best approach to it.  I personally think that right to know is more important than the right to be forgotten. When we are trying to find employment, the companies won't be able to know what kind if person we are without the right to know. We should rethink the importance of the right to know.  Today, there are so many information on the Internet and we have probability that we leak our personal informations. However, we can't live without Internet anymore. It is energetic in various aspect of our lives. It is important to repress leaking our personal informations ourselves, before make law or regulation which protect our privacy.  These days, we can't live our daily life without information on the Internet. There are a lot of useful information, but we don't know whether it is true or not. It is said that especially Japanese people have less media literacy than those of other countries in the world. We should have critical judgment when we use the Internet. Also, we should be more careful when we provide the Internet with information, especially that of privacy.  This is very difficult problem. Today, information spread over the world through Internet in an instant. So we must be careful to send our own information. We may have a trouble. If we can remove the links, it is helpful. However, we have freedom of speech. Some people can overuse the right to be forgot. I want to pay attention to this topic in the future I think the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know. Because of the development of the Internet, it becomes easy to search a lot of information. However it means that everyone can find someone's privacy data, so it can cause a trouble. If I write careless comments on the Internet, I will involve with trouble. Therefore I think the right to be forgotten is important.  This kind of matter is very difficult because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. As the Internet has developed, our life is more convenient. However we also have possibility of getting many risks. So we have to reconsider the use of Internet.  Today, we can have enormous information thorough Internet. It is so convenient and it make our life affluent. However, various problems arise naturally over information. For instance, the privacy rights of the individual and the public's right to know should be protected for us. However, in the fact, balancing the two perfectly is impossible. Information on Internet is sometimes makes us happy, also sometimes hurt us. I think it is important that we judge what is useful, safe correct information. We must not depend on Internet, must get along with it.  I don't forget the day when Prime Minister Abe rammed the ""right to know. "" It is because his act which shakes democracy deserves blame. The problems of privacy surround our every day. We could not go out outside, if a line called privacy is not drawn. But, this ""right to know"" is not a right for someone to try to get to know us. this is the right we know about what the government is performing. As for me, having been deprived of the right is very sad. I may also forget this some day. But, I thought that I will continue studying since i don't forget it.  There are two rights, ""right to know"" and ""right to be forgotten"" in this news. If we don't have the former, we won't be able to watch mass medias and officials as citizen. And I think it also embodies human's reflection about war. So we must not lose it. On the other hand, if we don't have the latter, we'll be burdened with our gloomy past. And I think those who has brilliant past are also burdened. So we must not lose both of them. But they cannot live together. Right should be used correctly, I think. Before we insist on our right, we need to confirm whether we understand how to use right or not.  To be sure , we have rights to know. However , we should keep others privacy because no one want to be known everything about myself .  I think that right to know is very important, so the government and media should reveal informations as possible as they can. Certainly, it is important that any information circulate because the information might be harmful for anyone. However, people had better know many informations that will not have a risk for society and people's living. Search engines and government should choose good informations to opening to the public.  I think this kind of issue is very difficult. It is because it is hard to make regulation about privacy and freedom of expression. Nowadays, we can use the Internet whenever or wherever, and this make our lives convenient and rich. I think we should do now is to use Internet carefully.  I cannot say my opinion about this problem clearly because this problem is beyond me! I do not want to let strangers look into my privacy data or to lose the freedom of expression. The former is personal threat and the latter is national threat. If anything, the latter is more terrible, in my opinion. It is difficult to balance protecting privacy with freedom expression. But as this article says that search engines are the tools that allow users to make sense of the vast quantity of information on the Internet and find what they are looking for, I think this problem is good in that it made us meditate what privacy is like and what freedom expression is like . This problem is up to us, so we should be more interested in this and understand them.  I think we should draw the line between the extent of opening our privacy. I don't want to share my privacy information to my stranger on the Internet, on the other hand, I want to share my information to my friends. The companies of social networking must respect their consumer's criterion. Thus, I think privacy must have priority over the right of expression on the Internet.  I thought that the right to forget is good idea because If I found my personal information or my embarrassing photos on the Internet, I would be unpleasant. With the right to forget, I can erase them quickly and can avoid more troubles. In this information-oriented society, the right to forget will be more and more needed.  Today, the Internet is so essential for us that we can't live our daily life without it. And the progress of the Internet is striking and remarkable. However, we are facing a lot of serious issues as the Internet system was progressed. The biggest issue is a ""privacy"" issue, which are mentioned in the article. It is said that ""A wonder lasts nine days"", but once an article was updated to the Internet, we can't delete it perfectly and it would not disappear permanently. That's because the Internet connects us all over the world and if we use search engine like google or Yahoo!, we can find almost all information from a huge data bank. There's no escape. Therefore, in order to protect ""the right to be forgotten"", we (or governments) should do something before it is too late.  I think it is difficult to solve this problem because if we regard the privacy as important, we may slight the freedom of expression and if we regard the freedom of expression, we may slight the privacy. That's why we have to consider the balance between the privacy and the freedom of expression when we argue this problem. Nowadays we couldn't live our daily lives without the Internet , so this problem is very important for everyone. In addition, there are a lot of crime and fraud on the Internet. I suppose we have to consider more seriously about this problem and think how we should use the Internet over more once.  This article's point is surely plausible. But I am afraid that advocating ""the right to know"" more than ""the right to be forgotten"" ends up harming the human dignity. It might be an important theory to keep information about people who committed a crime in the past to enhance social collective awareness. But in practice, a great deal of information that exists on the Internet is not always about criminals. That is, there is a lot of personal information about ordinary and innocent people, a part of which might be used by someone for crime. Does our society really need information about such people? In other words, does it make our awareness about ""social security"" higher?I think it does not. It is almost impossible to deny ""the right to be forgotten"", when you think about people whose personal information happened to be online. Of course, we can't live a day without information technology like the Internet. But even so, a clear protection for privacy is necessary.  I agree with your opinion. I think it is difficult for them to keep the balance between personal privacy and public right access to information. The Internet is used all over the world, and much information spreads. Therefore management of the information is difficult, and it is a fact to have the possibility that the personal information leaks out. I am the same as the opinion of this person and think that it is necessary to argue to find a better method to keep the balance.  The present age is risk society. In global Internet society, leaked information can't stop diffusing. We should use the Internet from an understanding of that. Certainly, "" the right to be forgotten"" is usability. But, I believe freedom of expression should be absolute in democratic government. By reason of that, first, we understand the risk involved with Internet society. It is the most rational attitude, I think.  I agree with you. It may make more sense for someone to understand the Internet's risk. ""Right to be forgotten"" is of limited effectiveness for privacy. We should avoid excessive expectations. It is rational way of thinking.  I think ""the right to know ""should be more respected than ""the right to be forgotten"". To begin with, the major role of mass media such as, TV newspaper internet site etc, is surveillance of the authority . If ""the right to be forgotten""were so esteemed, the role of mass media as the observation would be feeble. If it were not for the surveillance, politicians would behave at their own sweet will. To begin with, in democratic society, the person who create the country is the citizen. To create a country, they need a tremendous amounts of information. For , without information, they don't know what to do. So to create sound democratic society, we should value ""the right to know"".  When I read the article ""Google agrees to forget"", I commented that I think privacy should be respected and individuals should be able to erase data that they no longer wish to be in public. Of course, I still think protecting individuals' privacy is important. However, I realized that if it was admitted legally to erase information on the Internet, individuals, companies and so on may erase their past indiscretions and conceal something wrong for them. I don't think it isn't good that the weak of information increasingly come not to be able to access to important information.  The world has been small recently and the Internet has been used all around the world. We can get every kind of information easily, for example social, political, cultural and of course personal. Thinking of this situation, it is needless to say that there is danger. In order to avoid risk, some action is taken, I hope.  I think that there are always conflicts between opponents and defendants as long as laws are to defend one's right . For example, if laws would be set up to defend ""Hate Speech"", it faces the problem that it might be against the right to free of expression. Like this conflict, this problem have similar conflict. If laws would be made to regulate the right to forget, it would be against people's right to know. Thus it is only natural that when some has advantage the other has disadvantage. We should consider both sides as much as possible.  I disagree with this opinion. In this opinion, we should protect our personal right even if we cannot have the right to know. So when we think only about the personal right, we are to neglect the right to know everything that we wanna know. When we judge the matter about politics, politicians and economy, a lot of information need.  In the present age, we became able to change much information by the Internet in a shorter time. It is what you should be pleased with very much and thinks that it is that life becomes rich that the world becomes convenient. However, I include much risk. The damage by the Internet increases. I feel that we should use the Internet after having understood it enough. More world may become convenient, but attention is more necessary from now on.  I think the right to be forgotten is necessary to some extent because our shameful information on the Internet may exert a harmful influence on our career or daily lives. However as this article says, we have to reconsider the way to protect people. Overprotection of the privacy may lead the restriction on our right to know . Government of each country should play a key role in a work to reconsider who is really in trouble and what help they really need and balance our 2 rights, right to know and right to be forgotten.  I agree with you. In fact, we cannot do anything without using the Internet. An advance of the Internet helps us to live in comfortable, but it will be possible to cause troubles such as an infringement of privacy. I think privacy is more important than the right to know. However, this problem is difficult, so we have to think about it prudently.  Your opinion is interesting. I can understand what you think. The right to know is required, when we search something in detail. However, I think in terms of danger of the Internet, we must protect own privacy, so the right to be forgotten is more important than the right to know.  I think the right to be forgotten is necessary for us, because we have to protect our privacy information by ourselves. The Internet is very useful and we can search everything we want to know. So, there is a danger that someone gets our privacy information through the Internet. Therefore, we need the right to be forgotten to protect us from the danger.  I think ""right to be forgotten"" is needed in this information society. This is because it is easy to make our some information reveal on internet. However if the law which admits ""right to be forgotten"" is made , we will have two problems. One is that we cannot learn from our mistakes because our fault can be erased and we can forget something bad. The other is that we cannot use certain public information to set insurance rate. There will be no evidence which guarantees us. So eventually, we have to manage our information by ourselves until the law which makes us protect is made.  I think these kind of punishments is needed. My teacher in elementary school was arrested a couple years ago and you can still search for him on the Internet. There is no privacy on the Internet. This is the serious problem but controlling information is close to surprising the freedom of speech. Therefore we have to control our information by ourselves.  The Internet has both good aspects and bad aspects. One of good aspects is we can find out what we want to know speedily. On the other hand, bad aspects are, for example, that we are put at risk that we may be known our private data unwillingly. I think the latter aspects are more important because they are sometimes related to our life. We can stoke somebody by using the Internet. To protect people, I think it is necessary to emphasize more on right to be forgotten than on right to know.  I think this problem can not be concluded simply. Because in private information, right to be forgotten should be admitted. While, public one should not be erased. However, distinguishing private information clear from public one is very difficult, so blanketing right to be forgotten is difficult in realistic decision. All we have to do is being careful when we write in Internet site.  Internet is essential for modern people. Internet is the base of our life and has the influence for the world. I think that perfect protection of privacy is impossible thing by the existence of internet at present. The important thing is how not to our information to the internet. You had better give up deleting our information thoroughly.  I think it is very difficult problem to resolve because we want both freedom of expression and privacy. However, to keep this balance is very difficult, so I think we should make some efforts to protect us by ourselves partly. For example, we should understand literacy of the Internet surely before we use the Internet. If needed, it is nice idea that schools teach their students it because the Internet must be the main tool for us to get the information in the future. We shouldn't think it is natural that our rights are protected.  I think privacy problems cannot be solved. It is because privacy problems is relevant to the right to know. If privacy is protected, the right to know is not protected and if the right to know is protected, privacy is not protected. In order to solve this problems, we should define that how much privacy should be protected and the right to know should be protected.  I disagree with your comment because I think we shouldn't leave the responsibility completely to the government. Maybe we cannot avoid the world where people use the Internet to get the information in the future. So we shouldn't think it is terrible but should think how we can use it well. For that, each of us should understand the literacy of the Internet surely and protect us by ourselves as well as the government do for us.  I disagree with your opinion. I think we cannot compare right to know with privacy.  It is very difficult to define a difference between privacy and freedom. So we must think this problem more severely. I know the man was blamed on Internet , and this comment has been remaining.  As I wrote before, I think Americans do not understand what freedom of speech is and how it works. Freedom of speech is one of the way of exercise the right of resistance under natural law. And we make use of it, when the government oppress our fundamental rights, life liberty and poverty. But in this case, whose natural rights or constitutional rights are violated by the government? there is no violation. But the right of privacy is the matter of the relationship between individuals, not between subject or people and government. So in this case the privacy must be the top priority.  I agree to your opinion. I was never involved such a internet problem too. But internet is very important for us. So we need to understand how to use it correctly and pay attention not to being involved such a problem.  The internet is certainly convenient, but it is very dangerous. I think privacy is important. Although there is an aspect that privacy invade free speech, we should protect privacy in order to guard individual information.  Privacy and right to know are very important for us. So this problem is difficult to solve. In my opinion, right to be forgotten is needed because privacy is related to trust. "
JOC JOC-14A-12N 4.89 "When I read this article at first, I thought that it is unbelievable and horrific that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. But, thinking more deeply, I realized that this situation is no ""old-fashioned"" at all. We know that globalization has enabled us to communicate with people all over the world, every nation to ""connect"" with each other in terms of culture, economy, politics, social systems. But we often overlooked the fact that it has made a mechanism where rich countries force poor countries to produce things at very low cost. In such mechanism, it is very natural that poor countries are driven to using people as a cheap labor (and such people are likely to be those captivate or criminals). What we can do is to understand that globalization has pros and cons. we cannot be blind to bad aspects it has. And this news is one of the such aspects.  I was shocked very much. I have to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor to save them. However it's difficult for me to check the suppliers of what I buy, so I don't know what I should do.  Japan needs to think not only of overseas but also of a domestic forced laborer. Japan is estimated as Tier 2. It is because Japan is an international hub of human trafficking and child pornography. Moreover, the foreigner of the illegal stay is working in a horrific condition. Since TVPA is the report of study which the United States decided independently, it is not necessarily exact. Of course, Japan government, retailers, and supermarket chain must take action, in order to save people who be held against their will in Thailand or Qatar, etc. However, Japanese people must not ignore a domestic labor problem.  When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic and Egyptian bondage continued being left. I think that this is one of the problems that we should think about all over the world. Globalization advances in the developed country and becomes convenient with various aspects, but , on the other hand, it is surely a fact that such a thing is yet up in an invisible place. I think that it is to be wrong to treat the person of the underdeveloped country as a slave because a developed country holds down production cost and think that it is that anyone knows it. However, it is reality to have to work under such situation because life enters them. Therefore the people of the developed country pay its attention to such a bad aspect well and think that we should make an effort to be improved for them.  It is bad for companies in developed countries to take mean advantage of migrants' poverty. Human trafficking and slavery make light of human rights. Companies in a developed country often build a factory in order to reduce labor costs. It is no exaggeration to say they take advantage of poverty. Companies have to give employees fitting compensation for their labors. On the other hand, companies have to seek profit. A capitalistic economy caused this problem.  When I first read this article, I was very shocked and surprised to know the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions. We can get various food produced all over the world and such globalization made our lives more convenient. On the other hand, we have to try to change the situation for slave labors as soon as possible. The human trafficking is terrible thing and I feel very sorry for those who got degrading treatment. We often hear the commercials that say consumers can buy things at cheap prices, but such global retailers might cause more and more slave workers! I think companies in Thailand and Qatar are likely to focus on reducing the cost and seethed with anger at the Qatari government's attitude that they did not respond to a request for comment about the issue. This kind of news might have great effect on buying and I think we have to make better environment which allows workers to live as ""human beings"".  Reading this article, I was very shocked and was surprised the harrowing situation. It is not too much to say that this is the age of capitalism. So, on one hand i can understand the thoughts of the managers;on the other hand , in terms of humanitarian, I cannot tolerate their attitude toward the slavers. Like us, they are humans . We humans can only think of others with the kindly heart. And they all have the human right. So, to solve these problems, we have to turn our eyes on them no matter how terrible it may be.  Many people say "" the situation is horrible"", however, we must recognize that we have forced to make the situation. We have wanted low price products and forced producers to do so. We should blame not only producers, but also ourselves. Protecting the human right is very important, of course, however we should start from recognizing our responsibility. And I think the best way to protect people like written in this article is that the international organization like WHO enact laws legislate against labor force.  I was very shocked reading this news. I actually feel there are a lot of people who is used as a slave. Foods we have every day relate many slaves. A government should make strict law to top of the company which force them work under terrible condition.  I was surprised and shocked, as reading this article. Because I didn't imagine that slavery is still left . People who forced working conditions like slavery are too bad to live. I suppose these companies are going to hold down price of products, so they introduced slavery. But it is wrong to introduce slavery. I read the working condition of slaves, I think we should make a company cease to forced working under bad conditions as soon as possible. If companies want to cut cost of employees, they should think not to force migrant workers into work in the bad condition but to come up with other way to cut another point of cost. Although many countries know the news, the problem don't solve. I suppose that they should struggle to solve the problem in cooperation with each other. And we should tell the fact to many people in order to oppose to the company which introduce the slavery. Moreover governments make a strict rule of working condition to save human right. The economy and government are connected with other countries. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should tackle this important problem to solve , thinking as our problem.  I was surprised at the true that there is a terrible situation of forced workers. I cannot understand the manager's attitude toward the slavery. However, it is also a problem for us. The people of developed countries have to take action to resolve such a problem. I think that developed countries treat the people of underdeveloped countries as a slavery in order to they holds down production cost. We must treat the people all over the world as human beings. I have a strong desire that when we spend equally comes.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very shocked and surprised at the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions like as slaves. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should consider the solution strategy of this problem and make world wonderful.  I was surprised at the fact that there were still people who worked in a severe condition. I think every workers should be treated equally. In Japan, we do not attach great importance to slavery, because we never have such forced labor and we think we have nothing to do with this. However, nations have become globalized and we should take part in this problem positively. Appealing importance of human life is one of the best ways, I think.  I was surprised that there is still labor slave and terrible work condition cause dead people. I think government should protect people who are working too match. Although it isn't easy to improve the working condition, government have to do something. How about make law about work, for example, make minimum wages rule or regulate work time. I think those law will improve working condition a little.  I felt that it was really terrible to know the severe actual situation and working conditions of the forced labor and the forced prostitution. And I was surprised how human rights are ignored so much today of the 21st century. In order to defeat such situation, it is important to remove faulty consciousness and corruption of the government, and we consumers choose the product consciously and what kind of non-humanitarian thing is performed in the world.  When I read this article, I was shocked that there are still situations that people are force to work with no payment all over the world. People have the right to live equally and no one can deny it. To cope with this problem, what we can do is to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor when we are shopping. I also think that consumers should bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business as this article said.  I was surprised that there are still forced workers treated terrible conditions like slave. In Japan such a situation is unbelievable. But may be there is some responsibility for us. because We have wanted products with low price and forced producers to do so. Before considering about this problem, we should realize our responsibilities.  We the Japanese basically enjoy our peaceful life, so we tend to think there is no human trafficking or slavery any more. However, there still are such kind of things outside Japan. Everyone has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. We the Japanese should take an active part in spreading such thoughts all over the world.  I think it is nice idea to make human trafficking watch list. However, watch list is able to have only limited effect on the whole world. Then, I hit on two solutions to help labor victims improve their statuses. First solution is to establish the international watchmen and lawyers institution who specialize in labor problem. This institution in non Government Organization. The institution help the unethical business victims win labor disputes and labor trials Moreover, the institution encourage employees and labor slaves to set up their labor union. Therefore, it is easier for workers to demand employers and parent companies make better labor environments. Second solution is to organize small and medium sizes businesses which have more ethical and secure systems. This businesses will be supported by related big companies. Then, The companies try achieving economical superiority over the companies run by trafficking and unethical labor. For example, Improving quality and reducing cost by eliminating the waste of transportation help them attract more consumer. If they accomplish to have the better status in wholesale market than unethical companies, slave work has been abolished perfectly. However my suggestions seems hard to carry out. First of all, it is not clear who and which organization pay much money to begin the two propositions. Consequently, it is important to keep watch countries where trafficking businesses thrive, and to reconsider the more efficient and ethical way to help labor slaves liberate from unethical companies.  I had known that many people're forced to work in inferior condition in developing countries , but I knew how cruel the working condition is at first when I read this article. I think TIP report is playing a significant role in the movement of anti-trafficking , but it is not enough to eliminate slavery and trafficking issues perfectly because it is impossible for TIP to investigate the worst working condition in each country. I suppose that trafficking issues is one of the most important problems we have to think consciously because we tend to miss this problem behind a lot of serious problem such as an environmental problem and the North-South problem.  I have regarded the human trafficking as old habit. However it is not old habit any longer, it is ongoing problem we are now facing. I was shocked and also felt ashamed of not knowing the fact. We, especially the Japanese live in the affluent society. However, the social background of this is so serious. We always tend to forget that the food we easily get may be produced by modern-day slavery who work everyday at low costs. We should think of the two aspects and consider what we can do for them.  I was surprised that there were many people who worked as slaves in the terrible conditions. We, Japanese, do not know this fact and will have no chance to know because they are not interested in such problems. For Japanese, even if the working conditions are more and more worse, they have nothing to do with this fact. At first, we should have concern about it in order to solve. We must not turn our eyes away this problem.  People in developing countries are not aware of this situation. We have regarded human rights as one of the important things that we should respect. But we have always made sure of these rights between people and the government sometimes as conflict. But from now on, we have to protect the rights of other countries' people through border lines. However, especially Japanese have never introduced slavery. For example, in man'yoshu, the oldest the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, there are poetries of the emperor and those of homeless, too. So we have respect the human dignity of people who are in bat economical situations. Therefore other countries' people stand completely different backgrounds. So we, including me, may not understand how hard labor who are held by someone because of they are poor or sometimes not having citizenships. I think there is two solutions to make the situation of Thai's labor better. We should import Thai's goods more. This may seen as the way promoting bad situations more, but without enough monetary base. They cannot mend payments of all the jobs in Thai. And we should also introduce our industry to Thai. By doing so, we can create the job with much payment and good working environments. Japanese as the same Asian people will be the key.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. This news is unbelievable. I thought trafficking was a thing of the past. As I didn't know the fact, many people don't know it and consume them. We must not overlook it. We must know it and make it known to many people. Consumers also promote such problem. Consumers should know the fact and change their actions.  When I read this article, I was very shocked and surprised that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. I think We should help to improve the situation.  I think the ranking according to countries' willingness and efforts to combat trafficking and slavery is good for stop human trafficking, but it should contain the actual situation which slaves in. We should know their job in fishing boats is so rigorous. Also, in Japan, we should know our eating is supported by slaves and make effort to stop human trafficking.  This news was read and I was shocked very much. But I regarded me as shameful. It is because I cannot stop continuing receiving the benefit of globalization simultaneously We have the tendency to see only the good field of globalization. The foolishness is made to notice the slavery issue of Qatar. I think that it is a subject of us who live in advanced nations to help the workers who work under an unusual situation across a country. there were slaves in the back side where goods are enjoyable with budget prices . It is necessary to consider what we should do for stopping this negative chain.  When I read this article, I was shocked very much. We cannot check the situation of the work like the slave. However, I should be able to cause some action. I do not know what I should do now, but do not begin when I do not think. I may cause a big change if I begin it because it is small.  I was surprised that human trafficking is present still. I am the opposite to human rights violations. However, political issues are involved in this problem. I strongly believe these issues and must be solved worldwide. I hope that such problems are resolved quickly.  Slaves are still used . This fact shocked me and made me feel sad. We should abolish these slave systems.  Reading this article , I was surprised at the horrific situation and was indignant at it. In terms of the managers and the chief executive, I can understand that they have to cut their worker's wage, but from the opposite point of view, that is, in terms of humanitarian, we cannot tolerate the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the ""murder"". To save them from that situation, we should understand the situation fundamentally and have to address it over a long period of time I think the circumstance is very cruel and bad thing. Forced labor damages people's dignity and human rights. The action should be censured more and people have to consider the forced labor problem. Why has substantial slavery lost even present time? We should treat the serious problem while taking account of the condition and human rights.  Reading Supermarkets tied to slave labor in shrimp industry and this article, I was very surprised that in the world, there are a lot of people treated as slavery and I do not that fact in detail. Before reading this article, I thought that now few people are treated so, but in fact , such a bad environment still remains. We must try to save them and know some of what we buy and use are at the cost of their lives. Moreover, governments should make place where these people can tell a lot of people that what happens in their working place. and The mass media have to report it more on a large scale.  I agree with the opinion that not only producers but also ourselves like consumers have responsibility.  I was so surprised and hurt my heart to see the article. Some of our daily foods are based on slave labor. What is wores, the environment of slave labor is so terrible. I think what we can do as consumer is to stop buying the commodities which use slave labor to make it.  The boycott will make the company which use slave labor reexamine their system and improve the condition of worker, as not slaver.  When I read the article, I was very shocked because I can't believe there are many forced workers for no pay, and under threat of extreme violence. In almost all nations in the world, the fundamental human rights are respected, and in many cases, this sentence is clearly written on their own constitutions. In other word, we take it for granted that we should respected human rights and human dignity. However, according to the article, human rights are ignored openly. In order to protect the creed of ""respect for fundamental human rights"", authorities, like UN, should take measures against the issue.  I agree with your opinion. What is needed is that we have two points of view-one is of executives and capitalists, and the other is of workers who are even now in that horrific situation! When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic continued being left. Everyone in the world should has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. I think we should take movement like such thoughts all over the world.  In an increasingly globalized world, we take a high toll on poor people unthinkingly. We must face up to stark reality. We must take steps in order to solve. I'm going to buy nationally produced products. And, Japanese government should remonstrate in an emphatic manner.  I have never thought about human trafficking problems until I read this article. The point I sympathized most is that consumers should also bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business. Without our attempts, this problems can't be solved forever. From now on, I also make sure the goods I buy are free from forced labor.  I was shocked and ashamed that I hadn't knew the fact that the eating habits of the Japanese is based on slave labor. I think that the Japanese Government should help Thailand and Qatar and any other nations which have human trafficking and slave labor problems to improve these problems. Japanese have responsibility for it because we are reaping the benefits from these nations.  When I read this article at first, I was shocked and surprised. Because in the world I have thought that human trafficking do not exist and this matter is the ancient problem . In addition to this, this problem is caused by the fact advanced countries are racking the developing countries. People in the developing countries are forced to work at lows wages. We usually use the product which is good for the cheap price. It owes to the people at low wages. Thus we in advanced countries should think about this matter seriously.  I think so, too. I was also shocked and surprised when I read this article. Slavery should be disappeared. This problem happened in the country far from Japan. However, we must not pretend not to see but think together and take some action.  I agree with this opinion strongly. It is because this human trafficking problem in developing countries is connected with Japan deeply. However most Japanese don't know about this problem. This is the most worst thing. I think ignoring is the most shameful thing. We should have interests for more things especially connecting our surroundings.  I disagree with this opinion. I think that we must consider about forced labor. Of course, the system called the slave is prohibited. However, people of the world understand that the slave is so bad system, such situation does not happen. We have to consider more.  It is unmistakable fact that slave labor in Thailand and Qatar is inhumane and bad and we buyer of the products which are made by slave laborers are responsible for this problem. However, I think it is little strange that the U. S solely interfere in the problem of Thailand and Qatar aggressively. In the case like this, non national organization should play a key role. If one strong country interfere, the problem is likely to be controlled to be profitable for that country and not to be solved for a long time.  When I knew the fact there are the people who work as slaves, I couldn't believe the fact. We have to abolish slavery. However, it is impossible to solve this problem by individual effort. So, I think we need International cooperation to solve this problem. I believe that the good idea to solve this problem will come out if the people all over the world consider carefully and discuss about this problem. I wish slavery will disappear from this world.  I was shocked when I read this article. I do not know that slaves are forced to work in Thailand and Qatar until I read this. In Japan, our rights to work with our intentions are protected. Other countries people are the same human beings as Japanese. So they also have human rights like that. Therefore I think these slavery in Thailand, Qatar and other countries must be prohibited and abolished. Moreover in order to eliminate it, we have to look for the way to do so and continue to make every effort.  I strongly agree with you. I also think we have responsibilities for it and should realize and consider. What we can do first is not to buy products made by slaves.  In the 21st century, all peoples should be given the fundamental human rights. We must respect the human rights. So shall we stop buying the products made by slaves? A boycott! We should show our opinion by action. And we will stress the owners.  When I read this article, I was so surprised and feel that I'm happy in that I was born in Japan. Japan is so peaceful, freedom, and rich country than other countries. If I were to born in a foreign country which is developing, I might be a slave. Now I know that I'm happy, I should do something to poor people.  I didn't think the world working situation is so terrible. This is not domestic problem but global problem. It's necessary for all the countries of the world to cooperate in slave labor conditions.  I think it is great advance that developed countries come to concern the condition of developing countries' people. The thing that developed countries should do next is to resolve the condition of them and protect their rights. I hope that these problem will resolve in the future.  When I read the article first I was very shocked, and I thought we, every Japanese people should know the fact. Because, for example, our clothes especially "" ""fast fashion"" made in these countries. Now it is natural for us to buy ordinary clothes at a very low price, but almost all of us don't know where and how they are made. I don't think we have to avoid buying them, but we should know the fact and move to improve their environment. I think it is our responsibility.  I strongly agree with your comments, because I also think in the world there is a mechanism that rich countries force poor countries in a lot of terms. I think appealing this mechanism is natural, but we must not overlook it. We, living in ""rich"" countries have some responsibility to improve the situation by thinking human rights and morality deeply.  I think it is so problematic for us to use the system of forced labor. We should do away with the system. In order to do so, we think better of the modern world system. In Japan, there is not the system of forced labor, but in the world there is still the system. we should dispense with the system.  I agree with your opinion. I think the modern condition should be improved.  When I read this article, I was shocked that forced labor is remaining at this peaceful age. We must abolish this shameless labor system, so we should buy thing free from slave labor.  I was very surprised at the fact there are still slave labor in many countries. So we must make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor. But to tell the truth, we can't tell goods to buy from them not to buy. It cannot be helped that we want to buy cheaper, after all we maybe buy the former. So I'm sorry but the slave labor must remain.  I am impressed by this line: Slavery rips and tears at the fabric of the rule of the law. We constructed solid idea for human rights as far, but slavery destroy this idea. Slavery don't give benefit all the countries. Slavery should be banned.  I strongly agree with you. I also think that appealing importance of human life is one of the best way. We should think about human rights to live in the world.  I wish all slaves would be released. My heart aches for their suffering.  Wonderful consideration ! I'm impressed with your comment to globalization.  Above all, I was surprised that there are slave labors forced to work on agriculture or fishery for no pay in this world. Also, I was more surprised that there are human trafficking market in the current situation. I do not want to work for no pay and be have dealings on human trafficking market. I should be deeply grateful to my circumferent environmental and must to think about slave labor to save them from unfair working.  I don't agree with this opinion. Of course it is important for us to criticize such an action, but that's not enough to solve this problem perfectly. I suppose we have to make more effort to solve this problem, for example, not to buy the trafficking commodity and contribute some money to them. "
JOC JOC-14B-08N 5.36 "Since I had the image that Canada was safe, this incident surprised me. I am regret that the criminal who is key person of this incident has died. The same incident may occur in Japan. I think that Japan does not have a sense of crisis of terrorism. By getting to know this incident, the Japan house should also strengthen the watch to terrorism.  Attacks such as religious terrorist shootings gives a terrible impact on our society and people's lives . I think think that 's a very big blow that the important figures of the terrorists had killed without catching. I think that many countries need to raise the level of the terrorist measures and Japan also do not think it is someone else's business.  I think that this news surprised a Japanese. This is because Canada has not a dangerous image such as the Middle East. I also thought that Canada was a safe country. However, this image completely changed by this incident. At the same time, Japan came to have to think about terrorism seriously, too. The standby alert for other countries such as North Korea may be surely set. But, I think that Japan must raise the level of the terrorist about from the specific thought group except the country.  I was surprised at this news so much. I have been to Canada once. When I visited there, I thought how quiet place here is and how peace Canada is. Thus this news about gunman astonished me so much. In addition to that, I think we could understand the seriousness of ISIS. ISIS problems will expand more and more. Other countries like USA, UK, Japan and so on should take some measures.  In this article, there are two interesting point. At first, how many people believe that Canada is safe place. I can deny this strongly. It is because Canada allows people to have their own guns although the system is so strict. Moreover Canada is next to the US In such a society, we always have to watch out the danger. Second, Canada isn't like his next country. If this kind of thing happened in his next country, he should return to his enemy soon and essentially. However, he didn't do such thing. I think his next country have to learn his attitude.  I agree with your opinion. I also thought Canada is the safety and peaceful country. It is necessary for Canada to identify why this terrorism happened and to keep people from taking such cruel action again. Then, Japan has the possibility to occur horrific terrorism. Now Japan has strict rules about gun, so gun fight hardly takes place in Japan. However, terrorist might attack people by harmful chemical weapon as Aum Shinrikyo. We have to settle many problem existing Japan to prevent terrorism.  I was very surprised to read this article, because I did not have an image which Canada is involved in terrorism. Even a country which is safe, we cannot know when the country will be involved in International issues. Not to cause matter like this, many country include Japan have to tackle this problem.  Though I think Canada is peaceful country, you must be surprised at this article from your experience. Your opinion is persuasive enough. I wish this diplomatic issue can be solve as possible.  When I read this article, I was really surprised because I thought Canada was as safe as Japan. However the terrible terrorism has occurred in Canada, so I think it is possible to happen such as a terrorism in Japan. So far, the terrorism seldom occur because there is a strict gun control in Japan, so that it is difficult for Japanese to image about it. If the incident happens, they will not correspond with it. In order to correspond with it, we must know this news and whenever the terrorism happens. Government should solve this problem in cooperation with other countries.  When I heard about this news, I was very surprised at it because I have imagined that Canada was a peaceful country. Also, this news indicate that Islamic State is a menace to world peace. All the country should cooperate with and control IS's menace.  I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised to read this article. Attacks such as religious terrorist were threat to us because these attacks point to people who are only general citizen. We have to take measures as soon as in Japan.  I totally agree with you. I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised too.  I agree with you. In truth, Japan is safe compared with other country. But we should be alert every time as you say, because there isn't complete safe zone all over the world.  I was so surprised and scared because I had an image that Canada is peaceful place and there were no terrorists. "" There will have no heaven. "" I got strong impression from this speech. We, all the countries should fight with Islamic's menace. "
JOC JOC-14B-12N 5.28 "As for this news about South Korean ferry, I know very well because we learned about this in spring semester in this class. Therefore, I was interested in this news when I found the headline. While reading this article, I was becoming angry to remember the detail of the news and how bad the captain's action was. I think the worst of his behavior was he himself could be alive although he didn't try to pay attention to his passengers and save their lives. If I were the protesters' position, I would want him to compensate his fault by death penalty. According this article, I knew the fact that the crew member steering the ship at the time of the accident was relatively new to the job and did not have the skills and experience required. This is very terrible situation and I think this kind of thing was caused by the government. There should be more and more strict rules because this would affect the people's lives, the most precious thing. In the trial in Gwangju, the captain said he was not in a normal state of mind when the incident occurred, however, I think this statement was not appropriate considering his responsibility. I also think the owner of the company and billionaire business Yoo Byung-Eun didn't have the responsibility toward the action, and he shouldn't have disappeared and died. To avoid this kind of thing happening again, all people whose jobs could have influence on lives should reconsider about how to behave.  Your opinion is very good and I in part agree with it. I think this accident was caused not only by the captain and the government, but also by other crews in the ship and the company executives. The terrible situation is due to both the government's loose regulation and the company's corrupt management system (that is the executive's fault). Prosecutors should not blame only on him. Those involved in the accident are all responsible for it. In addition to reconsidering how to behave responsibly at an individual scale, I want all the companies in the world to check whether their safe systems is valid or not.  I think the prosecution is too severe. What problem the death penalty solves? Does the prosecution pander to the lowest public opinion? The Korean judiciary should aim for discovery of the truth. Role of the judiciary is not to give the judgment which the nation hopes. If this goes on, South Korean hurt confidence in the justice system. I wish the judgment is given following the law.  When I heard this news, I thought it is very difficult problem. If I were one of families who lost their sons or daughters, I would be more angry. Thus I can understand people are angry like that. However, it is difficult to judge this accident. Of course the captain had fault but the ship had defective, too. Thus I thought this court in November has long time to judge.  This article is related to spring class, and I am interested in clue's responsibilities. This terrible accident is brought about by them. I think that although the captain of the ship did not have adequate action to passengers, the ship company which entrust the man who cannot do that as the captain may also be blamed on. As many people wish clues take a lot of punishment in the court, in the future not to repeat cruel accident proper judgements will be desired.  When I read this article, I grew impatient that the truth of this incident is not clear. I think that a captain of this ferry has hidden the truth yet. If my family has been involved in this incident, I would have gotten angry with the crew. However, this incident has not been clear yet. Therefore, it is very difficult to judge this incident. The trial cannot sentenced the defendant without positive evidence. I think that employees of transportation must not forget to have a responsibility of lives of passengers. I hope that a incident like this do not occur anymore.  I think it is necessary to ask for South Korean ferry captain, Lee Joon-Seok, to be sentenced to death. This is because he had escaped the ship without any efforts to rescue passengers and claimed the lives of a lot of young people. Moreover it will make incidents like this not occurred that prosecutors seek death penalty for him.  We read about this news in spring class. So I remember about this problem. I think the captain of ferry, Lee Joon-Seok, is lacking in a sense of responsibility. He should rescue the passengers before he leave the ferry, but he didn't. In addition, he tell a lie. It is very guilty. So, I think it is appropriate sentence.  As soon as I knew , I came outrage for Lee. Many lives are lost by his survive. I think he should guarantee passengers safety. So he should be sentenced death penalty.  I think the captain must be received a death sentence too. The captain was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. As a result, about 300 people were killed in the accident. therefore, he killed a lot people. So, I agree with prosecutor.  I do not think so. This news is simple. Ship accident was all captain's fault. I did not understand why he abandoned many passengers. The care of the passengers is a really important task for captain. He should not be permitted, I think.  The captain of the ship shouldn't be executed. But the he should make maximum compensation. His crime is very big. But the responsibility against which he couldn't take a measure at all at an accident isn't only his. For example the interest of the government which should make a system and the people who should audit. . . Everything lacked is a problem. The length of the ship should be the linchpin to improve future's marine accident as a person who experienced of a cruel and regrettable event. That's the compensation he should take.  The captain did shocking deed. His deed result to kill and pain many people and their family. I think It deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty. He did not do anything that must be done in this situation. There is no room for commiserating.  I think you are right. A captain of a ship have a responsibility to make sure the passengers' safety and security. But he betrayed them. The only man who can control the ship was the captain. So e evasion of his responsibility. Therefore it is natural that many Koreans think he deserves death penalty.  It is very difficult problem whether sentence should be heavy or light. In this case, ferry's captain didn't help passengers, but he escape from ferry first. I think it is very guilty action, because captain should help passengers first. If he had helped people, there would haven't much the dead. So, I think this sentence is appropriate.  Prosecutors seek death penalty for South Korean ferry captain. I think South Korean ferry captain should be death penalty. His crime which killed many people is very serious. His deed was not excused. And the owner of the company Yoo Byung-Eun disappeared after the disaster and was later found dead. His deed was also excused.  I agree with you. I think he deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty too. there is no room for him to run away.  I think Captain Lee made a serious mistake because more than 300 passengers were died in this tragedy. However, we should think carefully about death sentence. All the importance of the life is equal, among the captain and passengers. It is most important that the captain renounce his former sins and never cause such a disastrous accident.  I agree that the only man who can control the ship was the captain. However, he got rid of a passenger, and the action lead passengers to death. The feeling of bereaved will be unbearable other than the death penalty.  I think so, too. The captain should atone for his sin to work. Death sentence won't make anything. "
JOC JOC-14B-16O 5.24 "I think New Zealand had better to change the flag because the flag doesn't contain their native inhabitant's symbol, and it lacks originality. I want New Zealand to make a decision quickly.  I agree with Mr. Key's opinion. I also think that it is important to express independence because the national flag symbolizes the image of the nation. Furthermore, through changing the flag, the nation will unite more strongly. So I'd like New Zealanders to agree with it.  I think this problem is not easy and there are many problems. One of the problems is the relationship between the UK. These problem are not unified problems but pluralistic problems I thought why so many countries' flags are designed like the U. K. Now, I understand the reason. And I think they should have new flag. Flag is statue and identity of each country. So, they should remove symbol of colony.  I was surprised at this news, but I know the country which change the national flag. For example, Kingdom of Lesotho changed it in 2006. The national flag express the nationalism, so changing it equal changing the nationalism. I want to be careful.  First I was surprised to read this news. Because they can change the flag. I think that flag is a state's symbol emblem. So government should respect the people's will. Everyone can understand the result.  When I read this news , I was surprised and had an idea. I think that New Zealand should remove the Union Flag from their flag because the Union Flag looks like the former British colonies ' proof .  I think the flag expresses the history of each country, therefore the changing the flag has the important meaning for New Zealand. So, people in New Zealand have to consider its meaning of their symbol.  I think to change the national flag has more demerits than merits. If the national flag change, it takes really long time to recognize that is the New Zealand's, and young people cannot feel the its history or background from the flag. These are the reason why I think this way.  I am surprised at this news because I never heard the country change its national flag but I think it is nature movement. It passed long time since New Zealand became independent and enough time to develop New Zealander's own identity.  I want to be going to pay attention other the British Commonwealth countries movement. I have interest it.  I agree with your opinion. I think almost people of New Zealand want to have their nationality. But now, the New Zealand flag include the Union flag. Therefore it does not seem to express a truly independent nation. So I have an idea same as you which people should decide to change their national flag.  I agree to national flag change plan of the key prime minister. The reason is because proof to be an independent nation and the characteristic of the native are not included in a current New Zealand national flag. However, it will be a problem how you raise the popularity of the national flag after having changed it because the New Zealand is recognized to people of the world widely by a current national flag.  Surely historic significance and background should be put to a national flag. However, it is not necessary to express the history that a New Zealander was ruled by the U. K. to the national flag which is a national symbol in the present age. I think that I should express a characteristic and the pride of the New Zealand native to a national flag than such a history.  Actually, I'm very interested in this issue because I experienced short-term overseas study in New Zealand when I was high school student. Indeed, it is difficult to change the flag because it is used as a symbol of New Zealand for a long time, so some people have attachment to this flag. But I think it is great idea using a silver fern on the flag, because the silver fern is a symbol of All Blacks that is very popular rugby team in New Zealand. I'm so looking forward to the result of this discussion.  In the case of New Zealand, I think they shouldn't change the design of the national flag. The nation was once one of the British colonies until 20 century, and if the flag shows its history, they should keep it with them since it makes sense a lot to them.  I knew that in New Zealand a problem in that whether or not to turn the national flag is happening for the first time to read the news. Since changing the national flag gives a great influence both within and outside New Zealand, I think New Zealand people should be judged its problem after they thought it deeply.  I am opposed to your opinion. Why New Zealand's young people have to learn to New Zealand's history and historical background from the New Zealand flag? I think they can learn them with something other than the national flag, such as class at school and books about New Zealand. Since the flag's a thing to represent the country, I think it is better that it changes to fit the situation of the country.  I agree with your opinion. I think the New Zealand should show that it is an independent country all over the world taking advantage of this opportunity.  I agree with your idea. National Flag represents The country's background, so New Zealand's people have to think about it carefully. Japan once changed flag design. It is because former one shows the wrong symbol of Japan.  I think that Australian flag should not change. Australian people might be angry, but it is true that today flag spreads all over the world, and the world doesn't concern it so much. I think that if they changed, we would be confused.  I've never experienced ""colonies"". So, I don't have any idea whether New Zealand should change their flag in order to show their independent from UK or not. But I should think of them in their position. . .  If most of New Zealanders would like to change the design of the flag, it should be changed. However, some of them think do not forget the history that people fought and died under that flag during the war. When I consider that, I thought people in New Zealand have to talk more about this problem. "
ACA ACA-B2K-002 8.71 "THE SZEKERES CLASS OF VACUUM SOLUTIONS The first exact solution to be published which describes a collision between plane waves was in fact that of Szekeres (1970). This describes the collision of plane gravitational waves with step wavefronts. The solution discussed in Chapter 3, which describes the collision between impulsive gravitational waves, was published a little later by Khan and Penrose (1971). Following this, a substantial paper in which the subject is analysed in detail was produced by Szekeres (1972). This paper includes a derivation of the field equations in the form given in Chapter 6, a general class of exact solutions which includes the two mentioned above as special cases, and a discussion of the singularities that arise. The purpose of this chapter is to discuss the properties of this general class of solutions. The solution in region IV The vacuum field equations appropriate to region IV of the colliding plane wave problem may be taken here in the form of equations (6.22a-f). These are second order differential equations for the four metric functions . Equation (6.22a) may immediately be integrated as in (6.24) to give  (9.1) where  and  are arbitrary decreasing functions which, according to the appropriate boundary conditions (7.3), are required to satisfy  and . In the Szekeres class of solutions, the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization. In these solutions therefore  (9.2) and the main equations (6.22d, e) reduce to the single equation  (9.3) For this, Szekeres has obtained the solution  (9.4) which contains two arbitrary constants k 1 and k 2 . The expression (9.4) may also be written in the alternative form  (9.5) With this expression for V , the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (9.6) where c is a constant. As anticipated in the discussion in Section 7.2, it may be observed that this expression contains the necessary multiples of  and  that are required to cancel the effects of the unbounded term on the boundary. If the leading terms in the expansions for f and g are  (9.7) where , then e -M is continuous across the boundaries if ,(9.8) It may thus be observed that the constants k 1 and k 2 are restricted to the range satisfying  (9.9) It is also appropriate to choose  (9.10) to achieve the usual flat metric (3.6) in region I. When evaluating the components of the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to introduce the new function  (9.11) With this, it can be seen that  (9.12) and the non-zero Weyl tensor components are . (9.13) In his paper, Szekeres chooses  and  (9.14) exactly. In this case, the terms  and  in (9.6) exactly cancel the term , and M is given by  (9.15) This form is still completely general since it has, in effect, simply used the coordinate freedom (6.7). However, it is sometimes convenient to retain this freedom, so this restriction will not be made in the following section. It may now be pointed out that, with the restriction (9.14), the above solution includes the Khan-Penrose (1971) solution for colliding impulsive waves when . It also includes the Szekeres (1970) solution for colliding step waves when . The approaching waves Having obtained an exact solution in region IV, the question now is to find the initial conditions which give rise to it. In fact, it is quite simple to use the method described in Section 7.2 to extend any solution in region IV back into regions II, III and I. We obtain the corresponding solutions in regions II and III simply by replacing g by ½ and f by ½ alternately. In this section we will concentrate on region II, and put . The equivalent solution in region III can be obtained from this by replacing f by g , and by interchanging u and v . Using the suggested method, it can be seen that the solution in region II must have the line element  (9.16) where, retaining the coordinate freedom in u ,(9.17) In order to interpret this solution as a plane wave, it is appropriate to transform the metric to the Brinkmann form  (9.18) by putting  (9.19) The wave profile in equation (9.18) now takes either of the forms  (9.20) or  (9.21) Particular cases in which  and  are illustrated in Figure 9.1 for . Figure 9. l Some wave profiles for the approaching waves in the Szekeres solution with . The wavefront is unbounded if . It contains a step if , and is smooth if . All profiles become unbounded as u approaches 1. It may be recalled from (4.5) that . Thus, it can be clearly seen that the approaching gravitational wave in region II is an impulsive wave if , has an unbounded wavefront if , has a step wavefront if , has a continuous wavefront if , and has a smooth wavefront if . It may also be observed that, if , is monotonically increasing. The singularity structure In this family of solutions, there is always a scalar polynomial curvature singularity in region IV on the surface on which . This can be seen by computing the scalar invariant given here by  (9.22) Using (9.6) and (9.13), I can be seen to be unbounded when  for all values of k 1 and k 2 in the required range (9.9). This is similar to the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution which, of course, it includes as a special case. Another singularity occurs in cases in which a wave with an unbounded wave front moves in a region where the opposing wave is non-zero. For example, if  and  so that then I is unbounded on the boundary  between regions III and IV. Similarly, the boundary  is singular if  and  so that Apart from cases containing impulsive waves, where  or , the boundaries of region IV are therefore only regular if  for , which implies the further restriction  on (9.9). These singularities, however, are distribution-valued and their physical significance requires further investigation. The coordinate singularities in regions II and III, however, are not so obviously similar to the fold singularities of the Khan-Penrose solution. The Szekeres solutions are only flat behind the wave front in the special case when . In the general case, regions II and III are curved and the analysis given in Section 8.2 cannot be applied. However, we may notice that in all cases with , 4 becomes unbounded as  in region II. This clearly indicates that, in these cases, the singularity in this region is a non-scalar curvature singularity. This has been confirmed in rigorous calculations by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). It has also been argued in the previous chapter that these singularities have similar properties to the fold singularities that occur for colliding impulsive waves as described in Section 8.2 in terms of the behaviour of neighbouring geodesics. A similar non-scalar curvature singularity also occurs in region III if , as  then becomes unbounded as ."
ACA ACA-B2K-003 8.35 "OTHER VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH ALIGNED POLARIZATION The solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971) and of Szekeres (1970, 1972), discussed in Chapters 3 (and Section 8.2) and 9, describe the collision of plane gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization. It is convenient to consider separately in this chapter a number of other exact solutions that satisfy this same condition. A general method In situations in which the approaching waves are linearly polarized, and their polarization vectors are aligned, it is possible to put  globally. In this case the line element (6.20), and the field equations (6.22a-f) take a particularly simple form. Equation (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give (6.24) and there is only one main equation, namely (9.3), which is a linear equation in V . For any given solution of this equation, a function M can always be found satisfying the remaining equations (6.22b, c, f), although such a function may not satisfy the required boundary conditions. The integral (6.24) involves two continuous functions  and  that are monotonically decreasing for positive arguments. As suggested by Szekeres (1972), it is therefore possible to use these as coordinates in region IV, although care has to be taken at the boundaries and it is not possible to extend these coordinates into the prior regions II and III. Using (7.8), the line element in the interaction region can thus be written in the form  (10.1) and the main equation (9.3) becomes . (10.2) which is the well-known Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. For any particular solution of (10.2), the new function S can be found by integrating equations (7.9), which now become  (10.3) In order for any particular solution to be appropriate to describe colliding plane waves, the function S must satisfy the conditions described in equations (7.10) to (7.13). Using this notation, the components of the Weyl tensor are given by the expressions  (10.4) It can thus be seen that, although (10.2) is linear so that different solutions for V can be superposed, the associated gravitational waves cannot be simply superposed. In addition, the scale factors A and B satisfying (6.13) and (6.14) must contain components of S , and from (10.3) it can be seen that these components are also non-linear in V . Once a solution of (10.2) and (10.3) describing the interaction region IV is obtained, the approaching waves in regions II and III can immediately be deduced. For example, in region II, we simply put  and assume that f takes the form . Then, removing the constant from S , it is convenient to put  (10.5) and the approaching wave is then given by  (10.6) The approaching wave in region III is obtained in exactly the same way in terms of the function . In order to obtain exact solutions, the first step is to obtain a general class of solutions of (10.2). Szekeres (1972) has indicated how to integrate  this equation using Riemann's method, and has given a general solution expressed as a line integral involving a Legendre function of order -½. This will be described in Chapter 14. However, because it is very difficult in practice to evaluate the integrals which this method involves, this does not turn out to be a convenient method for obtaining explicit solutions. As an alternative approach, it may be observed that attempting to solve equation (10.2) by separating the variables leads to the solution  (10.7) where A and J are arbitrary constants. Thus a general class of solutions can be obtained by considering  (10.8) for arbitrary sequences of constants σsub i and A i . The particular decomposition (10.8), however, does not turn out to be particularly convenient in the construction of explicit solutions. We will therefore proceed by changing the coordinates. Before introducing a new set of coordinates, it may be noted in passing that Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered an alternative coordinate system and have expanded a general solution in a different way involving Bessel and Neumann functions of zero order. Their approach will be described in Section 10.7. The appropriate technique is to consider transformations of the basic functions f and g which are here treated as coordinates. It turns out to be convenient to put  (10.9) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting ,. (10.10) With this, it may be noted that  (10.11) and t and z can be expressed in terms of f and g by  (10.12) The boundaries of region IV are now the hypersurfaces on which , and the focusing hypersurface in this region occurs when . Thus, to correspond to the interaction region, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . Using these coordinates, the main equation (10.2) becomes  (10.13) A general class of solutions of (10.13) can now be obtained by considering variable separable solutions of the form . (10.14) With this,(10.13) reduces to the pair of Legendre equations  (10.15) and a class of solutions of (10.13) can be expressed as a sum of products  (10.16) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds respectively, and a n ,q n ,Pn and b n are series of arbitrary constants. In general, of course , Legendre functions of non-integer order may also be included. The Legendre functions of integer order are well known, but it may still be appropriate to note just the first few. (10.17) It may easily be shown that the solutions of Khan and Penrose, and of Szekeres are included in this class. The Khan-Penrose solution uses ,(10.18) and the Szekeres solution (9.4) generalizes this to  (10.19) It may be noted that the Legendre functions of the second kind  are all singular when . The singularity  occurs when , and thus can be seen to be associated with the focusing singularity in region IV. In fact, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions, at least one Legendre function of the second kind must be included in the solution of (10.13). This may easily be demonstrated by substituting only the products of Legendre functions of the first kind into the condition (7.15), which can not then be satisfied. Another solution of (10.13) can be obtained by considering separable solutions involving a sum rather than the product (10.14). This leads to the solution  (10.20) where a is an arbitrary constant. This can immediately be seen to be the obvious solution  which, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner metrics as will be shown in the next section. This term may be added to the sum (10.16). A further solution of (10.2), or (10.13) is given by  (10.21) where c and d are arbitrary constants. In fact a series of solutions of this type can be used having different values of c and d . Thus a different representation of the solution of (10.13) can be written in the form  (10.22) Alternatively terms from the sum (10.22) may also be added to those of (10.16). However, as will be shown in (10.68), some of these terms may also be expressed in terms of products of Legendre functions, and so are already included in (10.16). It may be noted in passing that particular terms of this type have been included by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) in the class of solutions that will be described in Section 10.7. Having obtained an expression for V as any combination of the terms (10.16),(10.20) and (10.22), it is then necessary to integrate (10.3) to  obtain S . These equations may conveniently be rewritten in terms of the coordinates and defined by (10.9) in the form . (10.23) However,V is now so general that no complete integral for S has yet been found. Instead, we proceed by discussing the particular cases that have been obtained. The non-singular ‘solution’ of Stoyanov We may now consider a paper of Stoyanov (1979) in which he claimed to have obtained a solution without singularities. His method was to look for a regular solution of the field equations in region IV, and then to obtain the global solution simply by requiring that the metric coefficients be continuous across the boundaries. The solution he presented for region IV has the line element  (10.24) where a is an arbitrary constant. This clearly uses  (10.25) which does not satisfy the boundary conditions (7.3) which require that f and g must be smooth functions. In fact, it has been shown by Nutku (1981) that the discontinuities in the derivatives of f and g on the boundaries of region IV indicate the presence of an infinite discontinuity in the Ricci tensor on these hypersurfaces. Thus, although (10.24) is a vacuum solution inside region IV, it cannot be a global vacuum solution describing the collision of purely gravitational waves. It may also be observed that, with the positive signs in (10.24) and (10.25),f and g are increasing functions that are inconsistent with (7.13). Such a possibility can only arise if the impulsive components of the matter tensor occurring on the boundary of region IV have negative energy density. It is in this way that the singularity has been removed. It is only with the possibility of the presence of matter with negative energy density that the focusing effect of colliding waves can be avoided. Nutku (1981) also pointed out that the line element (10.24) is the well known cosmological solution of Kasner (1921). He gave the explicit coordinate transformation by which the line element (10.24) becomes ,(10.26) where the coordinate t is not the same as that used elsewhere in this chapter, and  (10.27) which clearly satisfies the necessary conditions . (10.28) The Stoyanov solution has been obtained with the solution of (9.3) given by  (10.29) which is the solution (10.20). With this, the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (10.30) which clearly cannot be continuous across the boundaries of region IV if the junction conditions (7.3) are satisfied. It must be concluded that the above solution cannot be interpreted in terms of an interaction between plane gravitational waves. Certainly, it is not a counterexample of a solution for colliding waves without singularity. However, in region IV, it is the well known Kasner solution which features regularly in discussions of solution generating techniques. In fact, it turns out that this solution can be used as a ‘seed’ from which other physically acceptable solutions may be derived. It will therefore be referred to again in later sections. This solution in the case when  has been further investigated by Taub (1988 a ), looking particularly at the properties of the distribution valued curvature tensor. The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez and Griffiths Now consider the case with the solution of (10.11) given by  (10.31) This solution was first presented by Ferrari and Ibañez (1986,1987 a ) in the case when  and . The solution with general parameters was published by Griffiths (1987). The Ferrari-Ibañez (1986,1987 a ) solution can be seen to be a modification of the Khan-Penrose solution, while the more general case is a generalization of the Szekeres solution (10.19) with . With the solution (10.31), the remaining equations (10.23) may be integrated to give . (10.32) It may be noticed that S contains the term  (10.33) which includes the terms (7.10) that, with (7.8), are required to ensure that  is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.34) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.35) Figure 10.1 Wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari Ibañez-Griffiths solution with . These have been obtained from (10.6), but the scale factor contained in the bounded part of S has been removed. Profiles are shown for the special cases in which  or , when the wave front is continuous. The more general situation is represented by the cases in which b takes the values 1 and -2. By extending this solution into regions II and III and putting , it can be seen from (10.6) that the approaching waves contain an impulsive wave component  only if  and . This case includes the Khan-Penrose solution for which  and the Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 a ) solution in which ,. However, with , the impulsive wave is followed by another wave component. Some profiles for approaching waves of this type are illustrated in Figure 10.1. It can also be shown using (10.6) that the wave front of the approaching wave in region II behaves as  (10.36) Thus, unless , the wave front may have a distributional amplitude. It is unbounded if  and has a step if . The wave front is smooth if . Scaled profiles for the approaching waves are illustrated in Figure 10.2 for some particular values of a and b with n equal to 4, 6 and 8. In all cases the approaching waves become unbounded as  in region II, and as  in region III. Figure 10.2 Scaled wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari-Ibañez-Griffiths solution for various values of a and b , and with n taking the values 4, 6 and 8. It can also be shown that this family of solutions has the same singularity structure as the class of Szekeres solutions as described in Section 9.3 and to which it reduces when . In region IV, there is a scalar polynomial curvature singularity on the space-like surface  on which  and . It may be noted that when , the initial boundaries  and  of region IV contain a distribution-valued singularity. These initial boundaries are regular when . As in all other solutions, it may also be noted that there are non-scalar curvature  singularities in the initial regions II and III on the hypersurfaces on which  and  respectively The soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ) have also used a generating that is familiar in the study of solitons to obtain a solution of (10.2) in which  (10.37) where  and a is an arbitrary constant. This was initially obtained using the inverse scattering technique in which the initial ‘seed’ solution is taken to be the Kasner or Stoyanov solution given by (10.20) or (10.29). This solution can immediately be seen to be a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution (10.18) by the addition of the solution (10.20). It necessarily contains impulsive wave components. It was pointed out by Griffiths (1987), however, that this solution may easily be generalized by treating the parameter k in (10.36) as another arbitrary constant. In this way, this family of solutions may also be considered to be a generalization of the Szekeres solutions with . As in the previous example, this generalization then permits the approaching waves to have a continuous wave front for appropriate values of k and a . It is this more general class of solutions that is considered in this section. It is possible immediately to integrate equations (10.23) to obtain . (10.38) This contains the term  which, as in (10.33), is required to ensure that e -M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.39) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.40) In this case it is remarkable that the junction conditions place no constraint on the parameter a . This feature is, in fact, related to a general result that will be described in Section 12.1. When evaluating expressions for the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to use the coordinates and defined by (10.10)(it may be noticed that these differ from those used by Ferrari and Ibañez). The scale-invariant components of the Weyl tensor are given by  (10.41) For the sake of later discussion, it is found to be appropriate to choose the scale functions A and B defined by (6.2) and (6.14) to be  (10.42) The negative signs are due to the signs of f' and g' . From (10.41) it can be seen that, in general, this solution has the same singularity structure as the Szekeres solution. There is a curvature singularity on the hypersurface given by  or . There are, however, exceptional cases which occur when  and  . In these cases  (10.43) which satisfies the condition  (10.44) which implies that the space-time is of algebraic type D (see Kramer et a . 1980, or Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos 1986 b ). These particular degenerate cases will be analysed in more detail in the next section. When  and , the approaching waves contain an impulsive component. For ,, the null boundaries of region IV contain distribution-valued singularities. These boundaries are regular when ,. The approaching waves have a step wavefront if , and the wavefront is continuous if . Also, as in the Szekeres solutions, there are non-scalar curvature singularities in regions II and III when  and  respectively, for all values of a and all permissible values of k . A generalization of the class of solutions described in this section has been obtained by Tsoubelis and Wang (1989). This has been obtained by putting . (10.45) By a comparison with (10.37) and (10.19), this can be seen to be a generalization both of the above Ferrari Ibañez solution and also of the Szekeres class of solutions described in Chapter 9. Its properties can reasonably be inferred from those of these two subclasses, as has been confirmed by Tsoubelis and Wang. The degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions Consider now the special cases of the above Ferrari-Ibañez solution in which  and , in which the Weyl tensor components are given by (10.43). The properties of these cases have been further described by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988). In the case when ,, there is again a curvature singularity when . However, when  and , the space-time appears to be regular for all , and the singularity caused by the mutual focusing of the two waves appears to have been removed. It is, therefore, appropriate to consider this particular case in more detail. Since  in these cases, it is possible to scale the null coordinates such that. (10.46) When , the metric functions in region IV are then given by  (10.47) and the Weyl tensor components are then given by  (10.48) As expected, these indicate that the approaching waves are impulses followed by continuous components. Of greater significance, however, is the fact that in this case there are two point singularities at the points , and ,. The existence of the singularities at these points implies that the lines  and  in regions II and III act as ‘fold singularities’ like those described in Section 8.2. These lines therefore form boundaries to the space-time in these regions. It is convenient now to return to the time-like and space-like coordinates ψ and λ. In the degenerate case when  the line element in the interaction region takes the form . (10.49) To analyse this particular case further, consider the change of variables . (10.50) With this, the line element (10.49) takes the form  (10.51) which may immediately be recognized as the Schwarzschild metric with ., With , however, we have  which is normally understood as the region inside the horizon. In addition, since increases from zero in the interaction region, this region must correspond to the part of the Schwarzschild space-time indicated in Figure 10.3(b) which is inside the initial horizon. However, it may also be noticed that the coordinate which represents the axial coordinate in the Schwarzschild solution covers the entire range  in this case. Figure 10.3 The interaction region of the degenerate solution viewed in two different coordinate planes. The plane (a) is the u ,v or  plane as in previous figures. Diagram (b) represents the  plane and is equivalent to the familiar Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for the Schwarzschild space-time. From Figure 10.3, it appears that the approaching waves collide at the surface  and reach a horizon at . There is, however, no a priori reason why the coordinate should not be continued beyond π/2.;  If such a continuation is possible, this would indicate that the waves would continue through the horizon until they finally end in a curvature singularity at . The other degenerate case in which  can also be transformed to a Schwarzschild space-time but, in this case, the interaction region corresponds to the upper region inside the horizon and all trajectories end in the future singularity. This case, together with the above transformation, has also been described by Yurtsever (1988 a ). It is instructive also to express the metric in Kruskal-Szekeres form. This can be achieved from (10.49) using the transformation  (10.52) where u and v are null coordinates in the  plane. With this, the line element becomes  (10.53) where ψ is given by . (10.54) In these coordinates the structure of the solution in the vicinity of the horizon is clearly shown to be regular. It is also convenient to consider this solution in terms of alternative null coordinates u' and v' such that, in the interaction region  (10.55) where the new constants a and b are the strengths of the approaching gravitational shock waves. With these coordinates it can be seen that the Schwarzschild mass parameter, which is unity in the line elements (10.51) and (10.53), is here related to the amplitudes of the approaching waves by . (10.56) It follows from this that stronger approaching gravitational waves would produce a shorter proper time between the collision and the subsequent horizon. They would also give rise to a smaller Schwarzschild mass parameter, and hence greater curvature on the horizon. When trying to relate the global structure of this solution to part of the Schwarzschild space-time, it should be emphasised that for this class of colliding plane waves the coordinate is not periodic but covers the full range . Topological singularities occur on the lines  and  on the horizon  (or ). This global structure of the solution has been determined by Hayward (1989 a ). He has noted that the above solution also forms a covering space of part of the Schwarzschild white hole with a quasiregular covering space singularity along the polar axis around which the space-time is wound. He has also suggested an alternative extension of the Schwarzschild exterior inside the black hole. In addition, he has suggested some possible extensions for the non-unique region beyond the horizon including one that is time symmetric. Referring to Figure 10.3(b), the opposing waves in this case collide on the hypersurface . The interaction region is then that part of the Schwarzschild space-time inside the initial horizon as indicated, which extends to the horizon as the focusing hypersurface. An extension through this surface may be taken to be the familiar two parts of the exterior Schwarzschild space-time. This can be continued to the subsequent horizon. A further extension through this horizon is then possible up to the next surface on which  or  at which the space-time again splits into two separating gravitational waves which are the time reverse of the initial approaching waves. At the conclusion of this section, it may be noted that Ferrari and Ibañez (1988) have shown that the shear-free principal null congruences associated with this type D space-time do not focus on the horizon. However, these congruences are in different planes from the congruences on which the two wave components propagate, and for which the contraction and shear clearly become unbounded as . An odd order solution All of the solutions considered so far have involved only Legendre functions of even order. A solution with odd order functions has been presented by Griffiths (1987). This has . (10.57) With this function, equations (10.23) can immediately be integrated to give . (10.58) As in (10.32–34), it can be clearly seen that this expression contains terms of the form (7.10). It may thus be concluded that, if the leading terms in the expansions for the functions f and g are given by (10.34), then the boundary conditions that are required for the solution to describe colliding plane waves are satisfied if . (10.59) As in previous examples, it can be shown that the approaching waves have an impulsive component if . Also the wavefront is unbounded if , has a step if , is continuous but not smooth if , and is smooth if . The expressions for the Weyl tensor components are rather complicated, and there is nothing particularly remarkable about this solution. In the previous examples discussed in this chapter, the two waves approaching each other are identical. The component 0 in region III has an identical form to 4 in region II but with the null coordinate v replacing. Similarly, the expressions for V in the two regions can be related by the same replacement. In this case, however, since odd functions are being used, a change of sign is also included. Thus, and  in region II are replaced by  and  in region III. The approaching waves still have colinear polarization but, in this case, their amplitudes are opposite rather than the same. The second Yurtsever and the Feinstein-Ibañez solutions For colliding plane wave solutions, we are considering space-times with two space-like Killing vectors. Such space-times have also been considered in the context of cosmology, where certain vacuum inhomogeneous cosmologies satisfy the same field equations as the interaction region for colliding colinear gravitational waves (Gowdy 1971), although different boundary conditions are appropriate. In fact the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies can be considered to represent closed universes built from opposing plane gravitational waves. The similarity between these solutions  has been noted by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989), who have used known cosmological solutions to obtain a new class of colliding plane wave solutions. In this section, the Feinstein Ibañez solutions are presented. The electromagnetic Gowdy cosmologies will be described in Section 17.3. It is appropriate at this point to consider the alternative system of coordinates defined by . (10.60) It may be noted that the new coordinate t is a decreasing, or past pointing, time-like coordinate, and that the singularity in region IV occurs when . These coordinates have also been used by Yurtsever (1988 c ). In this case, the line element (10.1) for colliding waves with aligned constant polarization can be rewritten in the diagonal form  (10.61) and the main vacuum field equation (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) becomes  (10.62) and the subsidiary equations (10.3) become  (10.63) where the dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to t and z respectively. The above equations (10.62,63) are exactly those for the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies that have been considered by many authors. The general solution of (10.62) can be expressed as a line integral. However, for the class of Gowdy cosmologies, it is found to be convenient to consider the class of solutions given by  (10.64) where  and  are arbitrary linear combinations of the terms in curly brackets, including the Fourier-Bessel integrals of the form  (10.65) and  are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order, and  and  are sets of arbitrary constants. The first term in (10.64) is clearly identical to the solution (10.20). It is the term that, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner solutions. The set of terms included in L 1 have regular behaviour as . It may be noted that this property is also shared by the combination of terms  that are contained in (10.16). The set of terms included in L 2 , however, are badly behaved as . These are the terms that are considered to induce chaotic behaviour in these cosmological models. The last term in (10.64) is identical to (10.31). This contains the so-called gravitational soliton components. Yurtsever (1988 c ) has considered the asymptotic structure of those solutions which only contain the combinations  and , i.e. in which . He has shown that these solutions are asymptotic to the inhomogeneous Kasner solutions as the singularity  is approached. He has also given explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data specified along the wave fronts of the incoming colliding plane waves. It follows from this analysis that the focusing hypersurface  is a curvature singularity except in the special case in which one of the Kasner exponents is zero. This special case of the degenerate Kasner solution is flat and, in this case, the focusing hypersurface is a Killing-Cauchy horizon across which space-time can be extended. It is reasonable to conclude from this that, although there are colliding plane wave space-times which contain a Killing-Cauchy horizon rather than a space-like curvature singularity, these space-times are unstable against small perturbations of the initial data and that ‘generic’ initial data always produce space-like curvature singularities. Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered the family of solutions for which the combination L 2 is zero. They have shown that, for this case, a curvature singularity does not develop in region IV as  provided that . (10.66) They have also shown that, in this case, the necessary boundary conditions (7.15) are satisfied provided there are at least two solitonic terms  with constants satisfying  (10.67) using the notation of (7.11). (The unfortunate repeated use of constants c 1 and c 2 in this equation should not cause confusion.) It may thus be noted that these two solitonic terms provide the conditions for continuity on the two different null boundaries of region IV. For continuity it is also required that  and , so d 1 and d 2 are constrained to the range . (10.68) It follows from this and (10.66) that , and so the first term in (10.64) must necessarily be included in these solutions. It may also be noted that the solutions given in the notation of previous sections by  (10.69) where c 1 and c 2 are given by (10.67), similarly do not contain curvature singularities on the hypersurface  provided the constants d i and a are constrained by (10.66) and (10.68). It is also of interest to note that the two solitonic terms that provide the continuity across the boundaries of the interaction region are in fact identical to the two separate terms in the Szekeres solution (9.4). This may be observed by noting that  (10.70) and similarly . (10.71) It follows from this that even the Szekeres solution, which is everywhere at least C 2 , can be adapted by the inclusion of a suitable multiple of the term (10.20) to provide a solution without a curvature singularity in the interaction region. Thus, the occurrence of a quasiregular singularity in region IV can have nothing to do with the relaxation of the continuity conditions across the boundaries. The class of solutions included here contain an arbitrary number of parameters. It can be shown that they are algebraically general in the interaction region. They contain the usual coordinate singularity on the hypersurface  but, for this class, this is not a curvature singularity. Feinstein and Ibañez have shown that the solution is extendable across this surface. However, the extension is not unique. The first Yurtsever solutions For colliding plane waves with aligned linear polarization, it has been seen that the main field equation (10.2) is linear. Various classes of solutions have already been obtained by separating the variables of this equation in a number of different ways. A further class of solutions in which the main equation is separated in yet another way has been given by Yurtsever (1988 a ). These solutions were originally obtained indirectly by first considering the Weyl solutions for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, they will be presented here in a more general way that is also more appropriate in considering colliding wave solutions. It is appropriate here to start with the main equation in the form (10.62) using the variables t and z defined by (10.60), and then transforming it by putting  (10.72) where the parameters v and η are not necessarily real. Indeed, real values of these variables only cover part of the interaction region as will be clarified later. With these parameters, the main equation (10.62) becomes  (10.73) and this has a series of separable solutions of the form  (10.74) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds. Figure 10.4 In the interaction region IV for the Yurtsever solutions, the variables v and cosh η are imaginary in the initial region marked A that immediately follows the collision. This region is followed by the regions marked B in which these variables are real. We must now reconsider the parameters of these solutions. As defined by (10.72),z and  are imaginary when the product fg is positive. Since both f and g decrease from ½ towards -½ in the interaction region, it is appropriate to divide this region into the subregions A and B in which the product fg is positive and negative respectively as indicated in Figure 10.4. Explicitly we may put  (10.75) It is clear that v is zero midway along the two boundaries between region IV and regions II and III. The inverse functions of v that appear in (10.74) must therefore be excluded for colliding plane wave solutions since they must be regular along these boundaries. It is therefore appropriate to express general solutions in the form  (10.76) This solution will from now on simply be quoted in the second form since either equation formally includes the other. It may be noted that these solutions are continuous on the boundaries between the subregions A and B. Also, the terms involving the Legendre functions of the first kind are regular on the focusing hypersurface , while those involving the Legendre functions of the second kind are singular on this surface. To be precise, in the original class of solutions given by Yurtsever (1988 a ),V is taken in the form  (10.77) which can be seen to be generalizations of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in Section 10.5. They are therefore distortions of the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the interaction region, and correspond to interior Weyl solutions for static axisymmetric space-times. In terms of colliding plane waves, these solutions all involve approaching waves with initial impulsive components. Some particular examples have been described explicitly by Yurtsever (1988 a ). Clearly these solutions can easily be generalised by modifying the coefficients of the first terms of (10.77). By choosing these appropriately, it is possible to remove the impulsive components from the approaching waves. Further explicit solutions To obtain solutions describing the collision and interaction of plane waves with aligned linear polarization it is necessary first to solve the main field equation, which may be expressed in terms of different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). Any number of further explicit solutions may easily be generated using the methods described in the previous sections of this chapter with different combinations of particular solutions of the main equation (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). It is appropriate here simply to list the various possibilities. First there are the solutions (10.16) which have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.13). These involve Legendre functions of the first and second kinds  (10.78) where a n ,q n ,Pn and b n are series of arbitrary constants. It may be noted, of course, that non-integer values of n may also be included. There are also the particular solutions (10.20),(10.8) and (10.22) that can be re-expressed in the form  (10.79) where  are arbitrary constants. Then there are the solutions of (10.62) that are contained in (10.64) and have previously been included in Gowdy cosmologies, namely  (10.80) where  and ) are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order,,, and  are sets of arbitrary constants. It may be noted that the solutions (10.80) have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.62), taking only solutions that are periodic in z . This constraint is not required for colliding plane waves and an additional set of aperiodic solutions is given by  (10.81) where  and  are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order. Finally, there are the separable solutions of (10.73) which are non-singular on the initial boundaries, namely  (10.82) which again involve Legendre functions of the first and second kind. When considered as infinite series, these different forms may simply be regarded as different representations of the same class of solutions. However, when looking for particular explicit solutions it is necessary to consider only a few terms. In this way, further exact solutions for colliding plane waves may be obtained by combining particular components from  any of the series V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5 and by choosing the arbitrary constants such that(10.83) where k 1 and k 2 are constrained to the range (7.13). If this condition is satisfied, then it remains only to integrate the subsidiary equations in the form (10.3) or (10.63) to obtain the remaining metric function S or M ."
ACA ACA-B2K-008 7.73 "COLLIDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES: THE BELL-SZEKERES SOLUTION In an important paper, Bell and Szekeres (1974) gave an exact solution which describes the collision and subsequent interaction of two electromagnetic plane waves. This solution, which appears to be remarkably simple, will be described in this chapter. Other exact solutions describing colliding electromagnetic waves will be described in Chapters 16 and 17, after more powerful techniques have been developed. The Bell-Szekeres solution Bell and Szekeres have considered a very simple situation involving a collision of two step electromagnetic waves. Prior to the collision, the waves may be described by the familiar line element (4.15). In regions I and II, this takes the form  (15.1) and the step wave is given by . The opposing wave with  may be described in an identical way with the null coordinate u replaced by v , and a different space-like coordinate replacing r . The two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions I, II and III are taken to be . (15.2) The fact that both of these expressions are real simultaneously indicates that the polarization of the two electromagnetic waves is aligned. In addition, they have identical step profiles. The relative amplitudes a and b may, of course, both be equated to unity when convenient. The components of the Weyl tensor are initially all zero. By this stage, we are familiar with the fact that it is appropriate to transform the metrics in all regions into Rosen form. Accordingly, the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of (4.19) and (4.20), namely  (15.3) The initial-value problem is now well set, and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region. The field equations for colliding electromagnetic waves have already been obtained in Chapter 6. In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the gravitational field equations for the interaction region take the form (6.22), and Maxwell's equations are given by (6.21). The appropriate boundary conditions for this situation have been described in Chapter 7. As usual, it may be noted that (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give  (15 4) where f and g are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region. From the junction conditions it can be seen that, in this case, these functions necessarily take the forms:. (15.5) The solution of the complete set of equations (6.21,22) given by Bell and Szekeres is . (15.6) It can be seen that these functions satisfy the required O'Brien-Synge boundary conditions. Thus the line element in the interaction region IV is . (15.7) This line element is in fact one form of the Bertotti-Robinson solution (Bertotti 1959, Robinson 1959), which is known to be conformally flat. The coordinate transformation  (15.8) transforms the line element (15.7) into the more familiar form . (15 9) Halilsoy (1987) has considered an application of the transformation  to the above solution. However, this does not lead to any new results that are of physical significance. The structure of the solution The above solution describes the collision of two step electromagnetic waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. This follows from the fact that  is real, and . As has been pointed out above, the solution inside the interaction region IV is conformally flat. However, as Bell and Szekeres have shown, there are necessarily discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric function V across the initial boundaries of this region. These manifest themselves as the impulsive gravitational waves  (15.10) which may be considered to be generated by the collision. It is in fact a general feature of colliding electromagnetic plane waves that gravitational waves are always generated by the collision. This can easily be demonstrated by considering the field equations (6.22d, e). In the interaction region, and  are necessarily both non-zero. It follows that V and W can not both remain constant. Thus, the congruences tangent to both waves must begin to shear, and it can be seen from (6.23) that the components of the Weyl tensor  and , and possibly  will necessarily appear. In this case, the discontinuity in the electromagnetic components causes impulsive gravitational waves to be generated. It can also be shown that smooth-fronted electromagnetic waves would generate smooth-fronted or step gravitational waves that would persist through the interaction region. It may also be observed from (15.10) that difficulties occur at the points . At first sight, it would appear that curvature singularities occur at these points (Matzner and Tipler, 1984). However, curvature tensors of this type can be interpreted as distributions (see Geroch and Traschen, 1987) and, in this case, the standard definition of a curvature singularity in terms of unboundedness in a parallelly propagated frame is inapplicable. The global structure of this solution has been analysed in detail by Clarke and Hayward (1989). They have confirmed that, in regions II and III, the surfaces on which  and  respectively behave as ‘fold’ singularities similar to those of the Khan-Penrose solution described in Section 8.2. Initially, the most surprising feature of the Bell-Szekeres solution was that a space-like curvature singularity does not occur in region IV. In this case, the surface on which , which is here given by , turns out to be merely a coordinate singularity since the curvature tensor is clearly bounded. Bell and Szekeres have demonstrated how this singularity can be removed by considering the following coordinate transformation:(15.11) where . With this, the line element (15.6) becomes  (15.12) which is clearly regular when . In order to retain the one-to-one correspondence, it is appropriate initially to restrict the Bell-Szekeres coordinate x to the range . The coordinates X and Y are restricted by , where the boundary  contains the space-like plane on which the collision occurs. It has been shown by Clarke and Hayward (1989) that region IV is part of a space-time that is regular apart from two covering-space singularities that occur when . These are points on the boundary of region IV where it joins with the limits of regions II and III. At these points, which are on the polar axis  and  in the Bertotti-Robinson form of the metric (15.9),. With the above transformation, each interval of the coordinate x of length 2 π/; c corresponds to a circular region in the X ,Y plane with the origin removed and cut along the line . Neighbouring regions of x are joined together along these cuts to form a surface which continuously winds around the origin. The origin of the X ,Y plane thus corresponds to a singularity of a quasiregular covering-space type. It is also sometimes convenient (Clarke and Hayward, 1989) to make the further coordinate transformation  (15.13) With this, the line element (15.12) takes the alternative form of the Bertotti-Robinson line element  (15.14) Region IV is now described by the line element (15.14) with the coordinate ranges given by  (15.15) This is joined to regions II and III across the surfaces . (15.16) Clarke and Hayward (1989) have also shown that the Bell-Szekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface , but the extension is not unique because of the presence of the singularities. They have further suggested two possible extensions which will be described in the next section. It is also somewhat remarkable that the global structure of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as described by Clarke and Hayward (1989), is very similar to that of the collision of an impulsive gravitational wave with a null shell of matter, as described by Babala (1987). This will be discussed in Section 19.3. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have conducted a thorough perturbation analysis of this particular solution. Throughout the interaction region subsequent to the collision they have obtained a complete set  of bounded normal modes that are expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. These modes exhibit a behaviour of ever-increasing frequency as the Cauchy horizon is approached. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have also considered perturbations in the initial regions which contain the approaching waves. For the approaching wave in region II which propagates along the null line ,, they have shown that v -independent perturbations are not permitted to all orders, while all the v -dependent perturbations exhibit strong divergences along the ‘fold’ singularity. Unfortunately, these perturbations can not be joined continuously to those of the interaction region. It is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations subsequent to the collision. Extensions of the solution In the Bell-Szekeres solution, it has been shown that the hypersurface  on which the opposing waves mutually focus each other is a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. It is therefore appropriate to consider possible extensions to this solution through the horizon, even though any such extension will not be unique. Two possible extensions have been given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). One natural extension of region IV is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element (15.14). This is achieved by extending the coordinate range to  (15.17) where . In this extension, the waves cross and focus. The subsequent space-time is unchanging. Another equally natural extension of region IV is obtained by noting that the line element (15.14) admits a reflection symmetry  about the hyperplane  (or  about ). Thus, there is an extension in which region IV is extended as far as  and is then followed by the time reverse of the entire solution. In this extension, the waves cross, mutually focus each other, re-expand and then separate leaving Minkowski space between them to the future. This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1 in terms of the original null coordinates and the line elements (15.3) and (15.7). Other apparent extensions of the Bell-Szekeres solution have been suggested by Gürses and Halilsoy (1982) in which the approaching electromagnetic waves consist of a sequence of steps. The step lengths, however, have to be double the distance to the fold singularities. Thus, these  solutions necessarily extend the space-time through the covering space singularities and can not, therefore, be considered as appropriate solutions for colliding plane waves. In all these solutions the space-time can only be extended uniquely up to the fold singularities in regions II and III and the surface in region IV on which . It must therefore be concluded that the Gürses-Halilsoy extensions are not physically significant. Figure 15.1 An extension of the Bell-Szekeres space-time. Regions marked I are flat. Regions marked II and III contain electromagnetic waves with , and  respectively, having metrics given by (15.3). There are impulsive gravitational waves along the boundaries of region IV, which has metric (15.7). A non-colinear collision In the Bell-Szekeres solution, the polarization of the approaching electromagnetic waves is aligned. It is appropriate now to consider how this solution may be generalized to include the case when the polarization is not aligned. In the approaching waves a rotation of the polarization is expressed by a rotation of the components Φ 2 or Φ in the complex plane. The metrics in both regions are unaltered, since a null electromagnetic field  is defined by the metric only up to a constant duality rotation. Thus, to extend the Bell-Szekeres solution, the same initial conditions are given except that the component  becomes complex and, from (6.22e),W must become non-zero in the interaction region. A solution presented by Griffiths (1985) satisfying this condition may be written in the form  (15.18) where  (15.19) The relative polarization angle of the two waves prior to the collision is given by α. It may be noticed that the expression for U here is equivalent to those of (15.4,5) and (15.6). The common multiple 2 has been inserted so that this solution can be more directly related to the Bell-Szekeres solution to which it reduces when . It can be shown that this solution has exactly the same properties as the aligned Bell-Szekeres solution. It is conformally flat everywhere except at the boundaries of the interaction region where there are impulsive gravitational waves that may be considered to be generated by the collision. These are given by  (15.20) According to a theorem of Tariq and Tupper (1974), this new solution must as be the Bertotti-Robinson space-time in a different coordinate system. In fact it can be obtained from the Bell-Szekeres line element (15.7) by the simple rotation  (15.21) Thus, the gravitational field in this case is identical to that of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as may have been expected. In the collision of plane  electromagnetic waves with non-aligned polarization, it must therefore be concluded that the dynamics remains unaltered. It is only the form of the metric in the interaction region that needs to be modified to that given in this section."
ACA ACA-CMA-004 8.15 "SELECTION IN RELATION TO SEX T.H. CLUTTON-BROCK In many animal species, differences between the sexes are pronounced. In fact, there are relatively few morphological, physiological or behavioural characteristics that do not differ to some extent between males and females (see Glucksman, 1974) and the extent of these differences varies widely between species. For example, sexual differences in body size range from species, like worms of the genus Bonnellia , where females can be over 25 times the length of males (Barnes, 1974) to species like the southern elephant seal,Mirounga leonina , where mature males average eight times the weight of females (Bryden, 1969). Other sex differences are less apparent — such as those in fat deposition, in haemoglobin levels and in metabolic rate among mammals (see Glucksman, 1974) or those in auditory apparatus among frogs (Narins & Capranica, 1976, 1978). And many have only recently been explored: for example, recent research shows that in some species there are pronounced sex differences in feeding ecology (Gautier-Hion, 1980) as well as in the effects of starvation on survival (Widdowson, 1976). It was to provide an explanation for the evolution of sex differences that Charles Darwin formulated the theory of sexual selection, described first in The Origin of Species (1859) and later, in greater depth, in The Descent of Man (1871). In this chapter, I briefly trace the development of the theory and describe recent attempts to measure variation in reproductive success in males and females, as well as some of the practical problems involved. However, as I argue in the final section, the extent of sexual dimorphism will depend not on the extent to which reproductive success varies in the two sexes but on the comparative effects of particular phenotypic traits on the breeding success of males and females. A brief history of sexual selection The origin of the theory of sexual selection can be traced to a peacock — or, rather, a peahen owned by Lady Tynte. This bird, born around 1762, lived in such comfortable circumstances that it had already reared eight broods when, to the consternation of its noble owner, it suddenly developed the plumage and spurs of a male and thereafter refused to lay another egg. No possible confusion of identities could have occurred since Lady Tynte was able to recognize her favourite by the nobs on its toes, which were unaffected by its change in appearance (Hunter, 1837). It is not known whether Lady Tynte investigated just what had happened to the bird's genitalia but subsequent studies of female pheasants showing similar transvestite tendencies revealed that only sexual differences developing at or after puberty were affected and that the reproductive organs themselves remained unaltered (Yarrell, 1827). This finally led John Hunter, the eminent surgeon, anatomist and classifier of monsters to produce a seminal paper (An account of an extraordinary pheasant,Hunter, 1837) in which he proposed that differences between the sexes were of two kinds: those involving the sexual organs themselves, which were evident from birth and did not change during an individual's lifetime; and those that did not develop until the animal approached breeding age, such as differences in body size, plumage and in the tendency to be fat which he termed ‘secondary’ marks or characters of sex (Hunter, 1837, 1861). Some of these, like the plumage of gallinaceous birds, could change during an individual's lifetime but these differences were not evident at birth. Hunter realized both that ‘secondary’ sexual characters were functionally related to fighting or display and that their extent varied with ecology. Hunter's distinction between primary and secondary sexual characters was adopted by Charles Darwin (1871) with a subtle distinction. Darwin was aware that many ‘secondary’ sex differences were evident at birth (or  hatching) and distinguished between the two categories on functional rather than on ontogenetic grounds. Darwin's primary sexual characters were those connected with the act of reproduction itself while secondary sexual characters were used in acquiring mating partners. To these two categories, Darwin added a third: sex differences ‘related to different habits of life, and not at all, or only indirectly, to the reproductive functions’, among which he included structures associated with sex differences in feeding behaviour (Darwin, 1871). The theory of sexual selection was intended to provide an explanation only of secondary sexual characteristics. Darwin realized that many secondary sexual differences were a consequence of the greater intensity of competition between males for access to mates and that many traits were more highly developed in males either because they conferred an advantage in fights or because they rendered their possessor more attractive to females. He distinguished sexual selection from natural selection on two grounds:. first, that it was a consequence of competition between members of the same sex rather than between members of different sexes or species; and, second, that it depended on variation in reproductive success rather than survival. ‘…This form of selection depends, not on a struggle for existence in relation to other organic beings or to external conditions, but on a struggle between the individuals of one sex, generally the males, for the possession of the other sex. The result is not death to the unsuccessful competitor but few or no offspring.’ Darwin's theory of sexual selection was less readily accepted by scientists than the theory of natural selection. Wallace (1889) agreed that combat between males was an important source of selection pressures leading to sexual dimorphism but regarded this as a form of natural selection on the grounds that it increased ‘the vigour and fighting power of the male animal, since, in every case, the weaker are either killed, wounded or driven away’. He regarded Darwin's second mode of sexual selection — female choice of particular males — as unimportant on the grounds that any consequences which female choice might have would be annulled by natural selection — unless females selected the fittest males, in which case the results of sexual and natural selection would be inseparable. He also  pointed to the lack of evidence of consistent female choice for mates carrying particular characteristics. Some fifty years later, the same points were reaffirmed in two influential papers by Huxley (1938a, b). Wallace's objection that sexual selection is a form of natural selection is semantically correct — after all, Darwin originally coined the term ‘natural selection’ in order to mark its relation to man's power of selection, and the opposite of natural selection is not sexual but artificial selection (see Brown, 1975; Halliday, 1978). However, his insistence that the process of sexual selection described by Darwin could only increase the average reproductive success or survival of males is clearly wrong (Lande, 1980). Especially in polygynous species, the costs of combat are frequently high (Geist, 1971; Clutton-Brock, Albon, Gibson & Guinness, 1979) and so, too are the costs of many sexually dimorphic characters associated with combat, such as increased male body size and weapon development (Clutton-Brock, Guinness & Albon, 1982): in species where males are substantially larger than females, both growing and adult males are often more likely to die than females (Robinette, Gashwiler, Low & Jones, 1957; Grubb, 1974; Howe, 1977) and in one reindeer population which crashed from 6000 to 42, only one of the remaining adults was a male (Klein, 1968). Sexual selection on males may also reduce the average fitness of females (Lande, 1980): in species where adult males are substantially larger than females, producing sons appears to depress the mother's subsequent reproductive success more than producing daughters (Clutton-Brock, Albon & Guinness, 1981). Wallace's theoretical objections to the importance of female choice as a source of sexual selection on males can also be discounted. R. A. Fisher (1930) demonstrated that female choice for particular male characteristics (such as tail size) can cause them to develop to a point at which they reduce the average fitness of males. Subsequent treatments have confirmed Fisher's conclusions (O'Donald, 1980; Lande, 1981) and shown that the process need not depend on the initial female preference favouring more viable males (Kirkpatrick, 1982). However, while there is extensive evidence of assortative mating (O'Donald, 1980), of the importance of plumage characteristics in courtship (Williams, 1982) and of female preference for males who can defend superior breeding territories (Pleszczynska, 1978) only very recently has it been demonstrated that consistent female choice for any continuous morphological character in males is an important source of variation in male reproductive success. By experimental manipulation of tail length in widdow birds of the African genus Euplectes , Andersson has been able to alter both the extent to which  males are favoured by females and their mating success (Andersson, 1982). This scarcity of evidence does not mean that the evolution of secondary sexual characters through female choice is uncommon, for mating preferences are usually difficult to demonstrate, particularly where inter-male competition is also involved. Nevertheless, the possibility remains that, as Wallace argued, many of the sex differences in plumage and coloration ascribed by Darwin to the action of female choice may have evolved because they help the sexes to recognize or locate each other or because they improve male success in competitive interactions. Measures of sexual selection Darwin was not specific as to why males should typically compete more strongly for access to breeding partners than females and it was left to biologists of this century to provide the answer (Fisher, 1930; Bateman, 1948; Trivers, 1972). The reason why males usually compete more intensely is most easily understood by considering the energetic costs of reproduction to each sex. In most animals, the energetic costs of fertilization to the male are minimal whereas the costs of reproduction to the female are substantial. Consequently, males are capable of fathering more progeny than females can bear and rear: in current terminology (Trivers, 1972) they invest less heavily in their offspring than females. In species where successful males can monopolize breeding access to large numbers of females but similar numbers of males and females are recruited, direct competition between males is likely to be intense, aggressive interactions may be frequent and the selective advantages of possessing traits that affect success in combat may be higher among males than among females. However, neither Trivers' explanation of the prevalence of increased competition among males nor Darwin's description of the theory of sexual selection provide an operational definition of the intensity of sexual selection (Wade, 1979). Many different definitions of sexual selection have been proposed but two kinds are in common use. First, some workers argue that the intensity of sexual selection will depend on the relative variability of reproductive success among males and females. For example, Ralls (1977) argues that ‘the intensity of intrasexual selection in a species should be proportional to the ratio of the lifetime number of offspring sired by a highly successful male compared to the number born by a highly successful female in her lifetime’ while Payne (1979) suggests that the extent to which variance in breeding success differs between the sexes is important. This position is also sometimes mistakenly attributed to Bateman (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). In contrast, other workers use measures of the extent to which male breeding success deviates from mean male success as estimates of the intensity of sexual selection on males (see Wade, 1979; Howard, 1979; Wade & Arnold, 1980). Similarly, the intensity of sexual selection in females can be estimated by measuring the extent to which female breeding success deviates from mean female success. Several statistical measures are in use, including the coefficient of variation, Pielou's (1969) index of evenness and variance in breeding success divided by the square of mean breeding success — a measure derived from Crow's (1958) index of the intensity of selection, where V is variance in fitness and W is the mean fitness of the population. This can either be calculated using total variance in breeding success or using only variance attributable to differences in the number of mates per individual (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). Ratios of variation in male and female success can be used to estimate the relative rate at which male and female characteristics can change. However, since the extent of variation among females differs widely between species (see below), they are of limited value as measures of the comparative intensity of sexual selection (see Wade & Arnold, 1980). The three measures of the extent to which reproductive success varies within each sex are fundamentally similar though the last is the most convenient since it offers a measure of the potential change in fitness between generations, relative to the average (see Crow, 1958). It is still necessary to decide whether to use total variation in breeding success in any calculation or just variation due to differences in mate number. Where the aim of the calculations is to estimate the potential rate of genetic change, total variance in breeding success is clearly the relevant measure to use. In contrast, where calculations are carried out to assess the comparative importance of differences in reproductive success versus survival for each sex, only variation in mate number may be included (see Wade & Arnold, 1980)— though measures of the intensity of sexual selection as conceived by Darwin should also include variation due to differences in mate quality, which may be an important cause of variation in lifetime breeding success both among males and females in monogamous species. Lastly, where the aim is to investigate the functional significance of particular phenotypic sex differences, it may be necessary to calculate  selection intensities for specific episodes of selection, such as mating success at particular ages (see Arnold & Wade, 1983) for the effect of particular traits on lifetime reproductive success may often be obscured by the influence of other variables or by random variation. One general point concerning all indices of sexual selection must be emphasized. Since many of the traits affecting breeding success are strongly influenced by rearing conditions (see Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982), these measures reflect the potential rate of genetic change and may provide little indication of actual rates of change in established populations. Practical problems Although it is relatively easy to decide how the intensity of sexual selection should be estimated, collecting the relevant data poses a variety of logistic problems (Ralls, 1977; Davies, 1982). In particular, in many polygynous species a proportion of males avoid competing directly with larger or older animals and adopt a policy of surreptitious fertilization or kleptogamy (e.g. Clutton-Brock et al ., 1977; Wirtz, 1982). As a result, it is often difficult to be sure that breeding males fertilize all the females in the groups that they guard: for example, even if territorial male red-winged blackbirds (Agelaius phoeniceus ) are vasectomized, their females sometimes lay fertile eggs (Bray, Kennelly & Guarino, 1975). Moreover, all indices of the intensity of sexual selection beg a problem of fundamental importance: over what period should reproductive success be measured? It is widely agreed that the lifetime reproductive success of individuals is the most satisfactory measure of fitness that it is usually possible to collect (see Falconer, 1960; Cavalli-Sforza & Bodmer, 1961; Maynard Smith, 1969; Grafen, 1982). This may not always be the case — for example, in rapidly expanding populations, selection may favour reproductive rate at the expense of lifetime reproductive success (see Lewontin, 1965; Elliot, 1975)— but exceptions are probably rare, especially in long-lived species where variation in longevity greatly exceeds variation in age at first breeding. While many studies of sexual selection pay lip service to the importance of basing calculations on measures of lifetime success, most use estimates of success calculated over a part of the animal's lifespan. The time dimension used varies widely: some studies use measures of instantaneous reproductive success (IRS) calculated across different classes of males at a particular point in time (e.g. Mason, 1964; Scheiring, 1977; McCauley g&, 1980), while others measure dally reproductive success (DRS) or  seasonal reproductive success (SRS)(see Howard, 1979; Payne, 1979). Very recently, estimates of individual variation in lifetime reproductive success (LRS) have become available from field studies of a small number of species, including a territorial and promiscuous invertebrate, the dragonfly Erythemis simplicicolis (McVey, 1981), two monogamous birds, the great tit,Parus major (McGregor, Krebs & Perrins, 1981) and the kittiwake Rissa tridactyla (J. Coulson & C. Thomas, personal communication), and one polygynous mammal, the red deer,Cervus elaphus (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982) while in several other species, including sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus : Wiley, 1973) estimates of individual success are available which span several breeding seasons. These make it possible, for the first time, to test the extent to which variation in instantaneous, dally and seasonal reproductive success reflect variation in lifetime success. There appears to be no consistent relationship between variation in IRS, DRS, SRS and LRS (see Table 23. 1). There are several reasons why variation in daily reproductive success may not reflect variation in either seasonal or lifetime success. In many polygynous species reproductive success varies from hour to hour and day to day and this may cause variation in IRS or DRS to overestimate variation in SRS and LRS. For example, red deer stags which hold a large harem in a sheltered site on one day may have few or no hinds the next day if the wind changes (see Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). As a result, measures of variation in DRS overestimate SRS and LRS in red deer (see Table 23.2). Estimates of variation in DRS and SRS in sage grouse (Centrocercus urophasianus ) show the same trend though estimates of variation in DRS and LRS were similar in McVey's (1981) study of dragonflies. In addition, variation in SRS will not reflect variation in LRS (see Gadgil, 1972) if individuals that breed successfully show reduced success in future or are likely to cease breeding or die earlier than less successful breeders. There is evidence that successful reproduction reduces the future reproductive capabilities or survival of females in several species (e.g. Wooller & Coulson, 1977; Altmann, Altmann & Hausfater, 1978; Guinness, Albon & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Bryant, 1979) and in some species successful males are likely to die before unsuccessful ones (Geist, 1971). However, several other studies have shown that successful breeders live longer (Drosophila melanogaster : Partridge & Farquhar, 198 1). For example, in red deer stags, where harem size is one of the principal determinants of reproductive success (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1979, 1982), not only do stags that hold large harems hold them for longer within particular breeding  seasons than those which hold smaller harems (Fig. 23. 1a), but individuals that are consistently successful in securing large harems throughout their lives tend to live longer than their less successful competitors (Fig. 23.1b). Trends of this kind will produce an opposite bias and may cause variation in SRS to underestimate variation in LRS. For example, the fighting ability and reproductive success of red deer stags shows a pronounced peak between the ages of seven and ten years (see Fig. 23,2). If variation in breeding success is calculated for stags of above a year old (the age of sexual maturity), it greatly exceeds more realistic measures of variation in breeding success such as variation in seasonal success within cohorts or lifetime success (see Table 23.3). This effect will also tend to overestimate variation in male success relative to variation in female success (see Fig. 23.2). A final problem is that unless breeding success is measured across the lifetime, a biased set of males may be sampled. Especially in polygynous species, males that fail to win a breeding territory spend their time on the fringes of the breeding population and often show high mortality. The field observer approaching a breeding colony is likely to see mostly (if not only) breeding males. If he calculates the extent to which reproductive success varies across adults that have managed to gain a breeding territory, he will underestimate the real variance since he will exclude non-breeders. Dividing by the mean success of males in this sample will accentuate this error since the mean success of the males sampled will be higher than that of the male population as a whole. Table 23.4 shows how the restriction of the sample to harem holding males in red deer reduces estimates of daily variation in the number of females held. Estimates that are probably biased in this way are already widespread in the literature (see Trivers, 1976;, Arnold & Wade, 1983). None of these four biases are likely to be consistent either across the two sexes or across different species: all four are more likely to affect estimates of variation in male success than estimates of variation in female success in polygynous species, though in contrary directions. Ignoring short term variation and age effects will tend to overestimate variation in male success relative to variation in female success, which is usually less strongly age-dependent in polygynous species (see Fig. 23.2) and less likely to vary widely from day to day. Conversely, positive correlations between seasonal success and longevity or sampling only successful males will lead to underestimates of variation in male success relative to variation in female success. That the two sets of biases oppose each other is no guarantee that short term measures of reproductive success will provide reliable estimates of variation in lifetime success for the comparative strengths of the different biases probably vary widely too. Moreover, sex differences in the length of effective reproductive lifespans and in the influence of age on breeding success are likely to be more pronounced in polygynous species than in monogamous ones. As a result, short-term estimates of variation in male breeding success are likely to overestimate the extent to which male success varies in polygynous species relative to similar measures for monogamous ones. Biased estimates of variation in reproductive success may also cause the effects of particular phenotypic traits on reproductive success to be overestimated. This applies particularly to traits, such as body size, which are themselves related to age. For example, where the body size and reproductive success of males both increase with age, the effects of size on breeding success may be grossly exaggerated if age differences in size are ignored. This effect is again likely to be stronger in males than females. The most obvious conclusion to be drawn is the need for studies of the extent to which lifetime success varies and of the factors which affect it. Where this is impossible, an alternative approach is to concentrate on studies of variation in breeding success within cohorts but, even here, problems will arise if breeding success is consistently related to longevity. Polygyny, reproductive success and sexual dimorphism The theory of sexual selection has led to four common predictions about the relationship between breeding success and sexual dimorphism. Variation in reproductive success should be greater in males than females in polygynous species but similar in the two sexes in monogamous ones. Both in red deer and in Erythemis , variation in lifetime breeding success is substantially greater among males than females whereas, in kittiwakes, variation is similar in both sexes (Figs. 23.3, 23.4). When the red deer   samples are restricted to animals that reach breeding age, sex differences in the extent to which breeding success varies are accentuated (Table 23.5). Considering that male red deer can hold harems of over thirty hinds, it is, perhaps, surprising that male success does not vary more widely. This is partly because only a proportion of hinds conceive in a given year and individual stags rarely hold harems throughout the whole breeding season, and partly because few stags breed successfully for more than four years. In contrast, the range of breeding success among hinds is greater than might be expected because their potential breeding lifespans are long (over 12 years) and individuals tend to be either consistently successful or consistently unsuccessful breeders. Variation in reproductive success should be greater among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones. One surprising result of the comparison between red deer and kittiwakes is that variation in lifetime breeding success is little greater in red deer stags than in male kittiwakes (see Table 23.5): in fact if all individuals born/hatched are included, it is slightly (though not significantly) greater in male kittiwakes. The comparison is an unsatisfactory one since there are important differences in the life histories of the two species: male kittiwakes can breed for many more seasons, adult mortality is not so strongly age-dependent and females can fledge up to three young per year (see Coulson, 1966, 1968; Coulson & Wooller, 1976; Wooller & Coulson, 1977). However, this example serves to emphasize how misleading it can be to assume that the breeding sex ratio necessarily reflects the extent to which male reproductive success varies for, even among closely related species, it is likely to be the case that males have substantially longer breeding lifespans in monogamous species than in polygynous ones (see Wiley, 1974; Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). Direct competition for mates will be more intense among males of polygynous species than among males of monogamous ones. Fights between males can be common and dangerous in polygynous species (see Geist, 1971). However, competition between males can also be intense in monogamous species (Lack, 1954; Kleiman, 1977) and data are not yet available which would permit a meaningful comparison between the two groups of species. In fact, it is unsafe to assume that the intensity of direct competition  between males should necessarily be reduced in monogamous species. Though variation in male success may be caused principally by differences in mate or territory quality (whereas, in polygynous species, differences in mate number are the main cause of differences in success: Bateman, 1948; Wade, 1979; Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982), monogamous males might be expected to compete as intensely for the best mates or territories as do polygynous males for the biggest harems. Where this is not the case, it may be because males cannot identify the breeding potential of young females or because female choice pre-empts male competition rather than because variation in success is slight among males. Sexual dimorphism will be most developed among strongly polygynous species and least developed among monogamous ones. In many different groups of animals there is an association between polygyny and sexual dimorphism and Darwin himself was well aware of the relationship. More recently, a variety of studies have demonstrated statistical relationships between the degree of polygyny and the development of sexual dimorphism, though the relationship is not always a close one (Ralls, 1977). Compared to monogamous species, polygynous ones usually show greater sexual dimorphism in body size (Clutton-Brock, Harvey & Rudder, 1977; Shine, 1979; Alexander et al ., 1979) while weapons used in intraspecific combat, such as the canines of primates and the antlers of deer, are also more developed in the males of polygynous species (Harvey, Kavanagh & Clutton-Brock, 1978; Clutton-Brock, Albon & Harvey, 1980). However, there are many exceptions (Ralls, 1977). In some groups of animals, the relationship between the extent of polygyny and the degree of sexual dimorphism is not a close one (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1977). In addition, some polygynous species, like Burchell's zebra (Equus burchelli ), show little or no size dimorphism while others, like the spotted hyena (Crocuta crocuta ) and the Weddell seal (Leptonychotes weddelli ), even show reversed dimorphism (Klingel, 1972; Kruuk, 1972; Stirling, 1969). While it is possible that some of these exceptions result from the differing energetic requirements of males and females and attendant selection pressures affecting the relative size of the two sexes (Selander, 1972; Downhower, 1976), the common association between sex differences in size and the development of male weaponry suggests that selection pressures associated with breeding competition are frequently involved. To interpret exceptions to the general rule that sexual dimorphism increases with the degree of polygyny, we need to remember that it is the comparative effects of phenotypic traits on reproductive success in males and females that will determine the degree of dimorphism and not the amount of variation in reproductive success per se (see Price, 1970; Lande, 1980). For example, while sexual dimorphism in size is likely to evolve where variation in male success is greater than female success and a given increment in body size has the same effect on breeding success in both sexes, it will also evolve if variation in reproductive success is similar in both sexes but size has a greater influence on success in males or even if variation in success is greater in females but the effects of size are greater among males. Conversely, sexual dimorphism in size is unlikely to evolve in circumstances where variation in reproductive success is greater among males but the effects of size on reproductive success are slight in both sexes. In the simplest of all possible worlds sexual dimorphism should, perhaps, be predicted by the relative slope of lifetime reproductive success on body size in males and females. However, there is no reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will be linear or that they will follow a similar pattern in both sexes. Indeed, where size differences are heritable and stabilizing selection is operating, there is every reason to suppose that relationships between size and reproductive success will not be linear. In addition, even a knowledge of the relationship between body size and lifetime reproductive success in the two sexes will not answer whether the association occurs for reasons connected with breeding competition or because the two sexes differ in their energy requirements (see Downhower, 1976). To sort out these questions, it will be necessary to identify the particular episodes of selection during which size influences breeding success in males and females (see Arnold & Wade, 1983). This argument raises the question of why it is that sexual dimorphism and polygyny are related at all. The most likely explanation is that the factors determining breeding success in males and females tend to be most similar in monogamous species and most different in highly polygynous ones. The factors affecting breeding success in males and females certainly differ widely in polygynous species. For example, in red deer, longevity, offspring survival and home range quality have a greater effect on the reproductive success of hinds than on that of stags. In contrast, fighting ability, body size and (because of its effect on adult size) early growth have  a more important effect on the reproductive success of stags than hinds (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). The factors affecting lifetime success in males and females of monogamous species have yet to be described. While it is clear that they will not be identical (see McGregor et al ., 1981), it is reasonable to suppose that, especially among species that pair for life, they are likely to be more similar than in polygynous species. Selection pressures on males and females Emphasis on the importance of understanding the factors affecting breeding success in males and females has the advantage that it forces us to ask specific comparative questions concerning the functional significance of particular sex differences. For example, does body size have a less important effect on the reproductive success of male zebras than male bovids because zebras fight with their teeth and hooves rather than by pushing? Similarly, does size have a greater effect on reproductive success in female Weddell seals compared to land or pack-ice breeding species because they breed on fast ice and defend access to water holes? Conversely, is body size less important in male Weddells compared to other species because they defend underwater territories where success depends on manoeuvrability and because females are widely dispersed? Thinking in these terms may help us to understand the distribution of many other sex differences. For example, among hermaphroditic reef fish, some species begin life as females and a proportion of individuals later become males (protogyny)(Warner, Robertson & Leigh, 1975; Robertson & Hoffman, 1977). But in a few species, such as the clown fishes (Amphiprion ), individuals start life as males and a proportion later become females (protandry)(Fricke & Fricke, 1977). The females of most protogynous species spawn on the edge of the reef, releasing their eggs into the plankton, and seldom compete for spawning sites. In contrast, female clownfish lay their eggs around sea anemones which they subsequently help to defend. Does resource defence by females again increase the benefits of large body size to female clownfish while reducing the benefits of size to males as a consequence of female dispersion? Understanding the comparative effects of size may even help to explain variation in birth sex ratios. It has been suggested that in species where reproductive success varies more widely among males than females and is influenced by parental investment, parents who can afford to invest heavily in their offspring should produce sons while those that cannot do so should tend to produce daughters (Trivers & Willard, 1973). In apparent  contradiction to the theory, dominant female baboons and macaques produce more daughters than sons while subordinates produce more sons than daughters (Altmann, 1980; Simpson & Simpson, 1982). One possible explanation is that even though reproductive success probably varies more widely among males in these species, maternal rank has a stronger effect on the success of daughters since females remain in their mother's troop and inherit her rank while sons disperse to other groups and may be unable to benefit substantially from their mother's rank (Altmann, 1980). Perhaps most importantly, emphasis on examining the effects of particular traits on the breeding success of males and females should encourage us to investigate the adaptive significance of sex differences whose functions are not immediately obvious. For example, in many mammals growing males lay down less body fat than females (Glucksman, 1974) and suffer heavier mortality during periods of food shortage as a consequence (Clutton-Brock et al ., 1982). One possible explanation is that because early growth exerts a greater effect on reproductive success in males than females (see above), selection favours increased investment by young males in growth at the expense of laying down body fat to assure survival during periods of food shortage. This prompts the question as to whether young females lay down less fat in species showing reversed size dimorphism. Recent research shows that this is the case in at least one species belonging to this category (the European sparrow hawk: I. Newton, personal communication). These explanations are cautiously worded — and necessarily so, for our current knowledge of the factors affecting reproductive success in males and females is rudimentary. Nevertheless, the way ahead is clear. If we wish to fulfil Charles Darwin's ambition of understanding the reasons for the distribution of differences between the sexes, we shall need to examine the causes of variation in lifetime breeding success among males and females in natural populations."
ACA ACA-EWW-003 9.84 "Properties of Matrices 1.1 ASSUMPTIONS, CONVENTIONS; TRANSPOSITION AND RELATED DEFINITIONS In this chapter we shall discuss certain characteristics and properties of matrices which are of particular importance in dynamical studies of systems with multiple degrees of freedom. We assume the reader to be familiar with the notation of matrices and with the rules of combination: addition, multiplication, etc., and with conformability and non-permutability. We also assume familiarity with the elementary rules for combination and evaluation of determinants. In general, matrices are rectangular; but of particular importance are matrices having equal numbers of rows and columns — i.e. square matrices — and those having only a single row or column, which we call vectors; both types are special forms of rectangular matrices. Normally, we shall use capital bold type, e.g. A, to denote square and rectangular matrices having two or more rows and columns, and lower case bold type, e.g. x, to denote vectors. If a matrix A has m rows and n columns, i.e. it is of order (m × n), its typical element  lies at the intersection of the ith row and jth column (). If we form the matrix  by writing columns for rows in order, the new matrix, of order (n × m) is called the transpose of A and is denoted by . For example, . The process is clearly one of reflection in the diagonal containing the terms , which is described as the principal diagonal. It is of particular importance in square matrices. The terms  in A form the superdiagonal and  the infradiagonal, while for a square matrix of order (n × n)— or more simply, of order n — the elements , form the secondary diagonal. An important property of a square matrix is its trace; this is the sum of all the elements in the principal diagonal. Wherever it saves space, we shall always write a column vector x as  the braces{} denote that this is to be read as a column. Since in dynamics, we are usually more often concerned with columns than with rows, we shall write a row vector as the transpose of a column vector, e.g. . 1.2 SYMMETRIC AND SKEW-SYMMETRIC MATRICES If , the matrices, which are necessarily square, are termed symmetric; if , they are said to be skew-symmetric: in this case, since  = , the principal diagonal has zero elements. A square matrix having zeros everywhere except in the principal diagonal is called a diagonal matrix and is clearly symmetric. The unit matrix I is a diagonal matrix of unit elements; a matrix having all its elements zero is said to be null and is written 0. It is possible to express any square matrix as the sum of a symmetric and a skew-symmetric matrix; this is shown by the identity . The first term is unaltered by transposition; the second changes sign. 1.3 REVERSAL OF ORDER ON TRANSPOSITION If we have a matrix product A = BC, where B is of order (m × r) and C of order (r × n), then A is of order (m × n). If , B and C are conformable only in that order. The typical product element is  . Transpose B and C; Then  are of orders (r × m),(n × r) respectively, and are therefore conformable only in the order . Moreover , or . Hence transposition of a matrix product requires reversal of the order of the matrices. By an obvious extension, if A = BCD, then , and so on. In view of the formulae (1) and (2) it is clear that these results hold whether or not B, C are conformable both in the order BC and in the order CB, including the case where both are square. For the unit and null matrices,(1) implies . 1.4. PARTITIONING OF MATRICES Any matrix may be partitioned, by drawing dotted lines between adjacent columns and adjacent rows, into submatrices. We do this, notionally, in any matrix multiplication: if we are performing the operation BC = A then we isolate a row of B and a column of C — respectively (1 × n) and (n × 1) submatrices — to produce an element — i.e. a (1 × 1) submatrix of A. Similarly, we could, for example, isolate the first three rows of B and the first four columns of C and multiply these submatrices, of order (3 × n) and (n × 4), to give a (3 × 4) submatrix in the top left corner of A. Again, since  it makes no different if we divide the range, s, of summation into subranges; each subrange can be summed, and these sums added to give the total. This is equivalent to vertical partitioning in B with conformable partitioning in C. An example will make this clear. The product BC = A could be  , where B is (4 × 5), C is (5 × 6) and A is (4 × 6). Here B has been partitioned between the second and third rows to give, at the top, a (2 × 5) submatrix (ignore the vertical partition for the moment); C between the fourth and fifth columns to give, on the left, a (5 × 4) submatrix. Multiplied together, these give the (2 × 4) submatrix at the top left in A. The vertical partition in B, after the third column, and the corresponding partition in C, which must be after the third row, merely divide each summation into two parts. Symbolically, we may write the operation as , where the elements  etc are now the above submatrices. It is important to note the conformability; thus  is (2 × 2) × (2 × 4) = (2 × 4) also; and  is also (2 × 4). It is evident that, though partitioning is largely arbitrary, conformability both in multiplication and in addition is essential. Partitioning is often of great use, both in analytical manipulation of matrices and in numerical cases, especially when submatrices can be chosen having simple forms, such as a unit or a null submatrix. 1.5 SINGULAR MATRICES, DEGENERACY AND RANK In a square matrix A of order n the array of elements has a determinant  which is in general nonzero: this implies that the columns (and the rows) are linearly independent, so that there is no nonzero column vector x such that Ax vanishes. If, however, a vector x does exist for which Ax = 0, this clearly means that any column of A can be expressed as a linear sum of the remaining columns; by the rules for evaluation of determinants this requires  to be zero. If two different vectors x exist for which Ax = 0, then not only is zero, but also all the minor determinants of order (n — 1) vanish. When , the matrix A is said to be singular. If only one vector x exists for which Ax = 0, A is said to be simply degenerate, or to have simple degeneracy; if more than one such vector x exists, A has multiple degeneracy. Complementary to the definition of degeneracy is that of rank: for a square matrix, the sum of the degeneracy and rank is the order of the matrix; thus   The rank is in fact the order of the largest nonvanishing minor of , so that rank 0 implies a null matrix. We shall be much concerned in this text with matrices which are simply degenerate (degeneracy 1) and with matrices in which all columns (and all rows) are proportional to each other; in the latter case all second-order minors vanish, so that the rank is 1. In general, for a rectangular matrix, the rank is the number of linearly independent rows (and columns). 1.6 FACTORISATION OF MATRICES All matrices can be factorised, usually in a variety of ways. In the simplest (trivial) case we may write A = AI = IA where I is the conformable unit matrix. Even I itself can be factorised in a variety of ways; as one example, if J is the square matrix which has units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere, which we shall call the reversing matrix, then ; e.g. for order 3  so that J is a double factor of I. The ability to factorise a matrix appropriately can often be of great assistance in solving practical problems. Singular matrices can be factorised as the product of two rectangular matrices — again, in more ways than one — the orders of which are determined by the rank of the matrix. This may be illustrated by a simple numerical example. Let   Inspection shows the third column to be the sum of the first two. Hence if we partition the matrix appropriately,  where the submatrix products are written separately. If now we postmultiply the (3 × 2) submatrix of A by I, we can add the last result to it to recover A as the matrix product  Finally, a matrix of rank 1 can be expressed as the product of a column and a row in that order — for such a matrix has effectively only one independent column, all the other columns being proportional to it; similarly for the rows. For example  In general, any singular matrix of order n and rank r is expressible in an infinite number of ways as the product of two matrices of order (n × r) and (r × n), since r is the number of independent columns (and rows). 1.7 ADJUGATE AND RECIPROCAL MATRICES If  is a square matrix of order n, and if, in the determinant , the element  has the cofactor  (that is, the value of the determinant obtained from  by deleting the ith row and jth column, leaving a minor of order (n — 1) which is then multiplied by , then by the rules for evaluation of determinants  while   since the summation in the latter result gives the value of a determinant having two equal rows. It follows that if the cofactors  are arranged as a matrix  of order n, then  where, to conform with matrix multiplication rules, we must use the transpose of  to postmultiply A. If instead of a row summation as in (1) we use column summation, we find also  so that A and  are permutable. The matrix  is called the adjugate of A. If A is singular, so that  vanishes, then  In this case, if A is simply degenerate,  is of rank 1; but if A is multiply degenerate, so that all the cofactors of Aij vanish for all i, j, then  is null. These results are examples of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (see Theorem XII of 1.22), viz. the degeneracy of the product of two matrices is at least as great as the degeneracy of either factor, and at most as great as the sum of the degeneracies of the factors. When , we may divide  by , calling the result R. then AR = I, and R can be described as the reciprocal or the inverse of A. We have already seen that it permutes with A; however, this is readily proved alternatively. Let  from the latter, postmultiplying by R1, we have R2AR = R1, and using the former, R2 = R1. Moreover, the reciprocal is unique; for if AR1 = I and AR2 = I, then A (R1 — R2) = 0, and on premultiplication by R1 we have R1 = R2. In conformity with usual algebraic notation, the reciprocal of A is written  so that a separate symbol is unnecessary. Thus  expresses the essential property of the reciprocal of A. Just as with transposition, if a matrix product is inverted the order of the factors must be reversed. Let A = BCD, where the matrices are all square and non-singular. By premultiplication or  postmultiplication as required, we have successively  1.8 POWERS OF MATRICES, POLYNOMIALS AND SERIES We have just established the existence of a negative power of a square non-singular matrix. In general, any square matrix can be raised to any positive integral power by continued multiplication, in any order, by itself. Any such powers are evidently permutable; for example  Similarly, any power of a matrix may itself be raised to a power; for example  while if A is non-singular  Evidently, the index laws of ordinary algebra apply. In particular,  where A is non-singular; in fact  applies for all square matrices. Just as we can have polynomials involving powers of a scalar quantity{ gl}, e.g.  so we can have polynomials of a square matrix A:  where the  are scalar multipliers. Polynomials of matrices are of great importance in a variety of ways. For example, suppose we can find a set of multipliers pi such that P(A) vanishes. Then, if  exists, we may premultiply or postmultiply P(A) by  to obtain  as a convenient formula for computing . We can also define matrix series; for example the parallel series  exp A converges in exactly the same way as exp{ gl}. In parallel with the scalar series, exp (-A) is the reciprocal of exp A.  If, as in (2) and (3), we have a polynomial or series in a scalar quantity{ gl}and the corresponding function in the square matrix A, we may multiply the scalar function by I to obtain the two matrix functions  Subtraction term by term then gives  where Q is a function we need not evaluate here. The matrix  is of very great importance, not only in studies of the intrinsic properties of A, but also in dynamical and other applications it is called the characteristic matrix of A. 1.9 SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX We have already defined symmetric, skew-symmetric, diagonal, unit and null matrices. We now summarise and extend these definitions. (1) Symmetric matrix — characterised by A = AT. (2) Skew-symmetric matrix — characterised by A = — AT. (3) Diagonal matrix — characterised by . We now establish an important property of diagonal matrices. Let C be any square matrix and D a conformable diagonal matrix with diagonal elements . Then postmultiplication of C by D multiplies the columns of C in order by , etc., while premultiplication of C by D multiplies the rows of C in order by , etc. Thus, the typical element of CD is  while that of DC is . It follows that if C and D permute, so that DC = CD, then  if . For a diagonal matrix D having all its diagonal elements different, it follows that C must then also be diagonal. If D has some equal diagonal elements, then C can possess nonzero off-diagonal elements in a ""diagonal submatrix"" corresponding to the equal elements of D. For example, if  which we write as D = Diag(1,2,3), and   then if C and D are to permute we must have  so that d = e = f = g = h = k = 0, leaving C = Diag (a, b, c). However, if D = Diag(1,2,3) we have that  so that e = g = h = k = 0 leaving  which we may write as Block Diag  where  Finally, we note that if  for all i, then . This follows from the identity . (4) Unit matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with units in the diagonal positions; it is written I. (5) Scalar matrix — this is the diagonal matrix with the same scalar quantity, say , in the diagonal positions. Evidently such a matrix may be written ; multiplication by a scalar matrix therefore implies multiplication by a scalar quantity. (6) Reversing matrix — this is the square matrix having units in its secondary diagonal and zeros elsewhere; it is written J. Postmultiplication of any matrix C by the conformable J matrix reverses the order of the columns of C while premultiplication by J reverses the order of the rows. (7) Null matrix — this has zero elements throughout. (8) Triangular matrices — these are of two types: lower triangular, L, and upper triangular, U. L is characterised by a typical element having the property  while U is characterised by . Thus, for example  are, respectively, lower and upper triangular matrices. An obvious and useful property of triangular matrices is that their determinants are simply the products of their diagonal terms. Thus, in the above example,  Another useful property of triangular matrices is the ease with which their reciprocals may be calculated. For example, if R = (Rij) is the reciprocal of a lower triangular matrix L then  where a, b, c,…must be nonzero; otherwise  and R does not exist. The first row of the product gives  and in view of this, the second row, excluding its first element, gives  and so on. Accordingly, R is also lower triangular, and its diagonal elements are , as is otherwise obvious from consideration of the cofactors of a, b, c,…in L. Hence a computer program to find R needs to calculate only the n (n — 2) /2 elements below the diagonal; and these are found progressively. For example  gives, from the first column,  and from the second column,   Transposition of the above shows that the reciprocal of an upper triangular matrix U is itself upper triangular, and that its diagonal elements are the reciprocals of those of U. (9) Persymmetric matrix — this is a square matrix in which the elements in any line parallel to the secondary diagonal are equal. Thus, if A is persymmetric, it is characterised by the typical element  and hence has, in general, 2n — 1 independent elements. For example, the matrix  is persymmetric. (10) Centrosymmetric and centroskew matrices — a matrix which is symmetric about the centre point of its array is said to be centrosymmetric; thus, if A is centrosymmetric, of order n, it is characterised by  More simply, if J is the reversing matrix, a centrosymmetric matrix has the property A = JAJ A centroskew matrix is characterised by the equation A = JAJ. For example, the matrices  are centrosymmetric, while the matrices  are centroskew. Centrosymmetric matrices and centroskew vectors arise in the study of the dynamics of mechanical systems having physical symmetry (e.g. a suspension bridge). (11) Orthogonal matrices — a square, non-singular matrix A having the property  is said to be orthogonal. Orthogonal matrices are of very great importance in dynamics. For example, the matrix  is orthogonal, since  It should be noted that the determinant of the above orthogonal matrix is unity: in general an orthogonal matrix will have  as its determinant since  (12) Hermitian and skew-Hermitian matrices — if a matrix, A, has complex elements, it can clearly be written in the form  where B and C are real matrices and  is the conjugate of A. If B is symmetric and C is skew-symmetric, A is said to be Hermitian. Evidently in this case  If B is skew-symmetric and C is symmetric, A is said to be skew-Hermitian. Evidently in this case  For example, the matrix  is Hermitian, while the matrix   is skew-Hermitian. It should be noted that if A is Hermitian, then iA is a skew-Hermitian. (13) The isolating vector ei — this vector is the ith column of the unit matrix; it has a unit in the ith element and zeros elsewhere. The operation  isolates the ith row of A, while Aej isolates the jth column. The combined operation  gives the isolated element of  (14) The summing vector  — this is the vector of which all elements are units. Evidently  gives a row which is the sum of all the rows of A and A{gs} sums all the columns of A. Its principal use is in the checking of numerical operations. The above list is by no means exhaustive, but it covers most of the matrix types which arise in the present text. 1.10 VARIABLE MATRICES, LINEAR SUBSTITUTIONS AND ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS So far, we have discussed the properties of matrices, and the algebra of matrices, in general terms, and without reference to the nature of the elements: where illustrations have been given we have used arithmetical numbers for elements. But the elements can of course be variables. They may, for example, all be functions of time, so that we must write A = A(t); they may be functions of a parameter, typified by  when the elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}, the matrix is called a lambda-matrix; or the elements may themselves (especially for vectors) be independent variables. Finally, when sets of differential equations are written in matrix form, some of the matrices will be, in effect, operators. We now proceed to examine some simple cases. Suppose first that we have a set of variables  related to a second set  by an equation of the type y = Ax; such a relation might, for example, connect the coordinates, referred to two different sets of axes, of a point moving in n-space. Such a relation is called liner substitution. Apart from its intrinsic importance, it is of interest since the subject of matrices evolved from it. Cayley took a set of equations such as  and enclosed each side in brackets, so that two equal columns could be connected by a single equality sign. He then extracted the vector x and wrote it vertically as a parallel to y, so requiring the row-by-column rule for multiplication. A second substitution of the same kind, such as z = By. implies z = By = BAx, so that BA is the matrix converting x into z. If the values of x are unknown, but y is given (say y = b) then we have a set of linear algebraic equations for x: Ax = b, of which the formal solution is : however, various well known methods exist for finding x without computing  (see 2.5). As a very simple example of a linear substitution, consider the coordinates of a point P relative to two sets of axes  mutually inclined at an angle  Evidently  elimination of r,  gives   and it should be noted that in this case the matrix of transformation is orthogonal. The formal solution  (3) assumes that A is non-singular. Suppose, however, that A has degeneracy s. Then s of the rows implicit in (3) may be compounded from the remaining n — s rows, and so provide no extra information. These s rows, including the appropriate elements of b, may thus be discarded. We are left with n — s rows which may be written in partitioned matrix form as  where A1 is a non-singular submatrix of A of order (n — s)(some reordering of the elements of x may be necessary to obtain the non-singular minor),  is of the order  and c is the reduced vector b; x has been partitioned conformably into n — s elements (y) and s elements (z). We may write this equation as  Equation (5) is known as a parametric solution: since we have only n — s independent relations we can determine only n — s unknowns (y) in terms of the remaining s quantities (z), which may be regarded as arbitrary parameters in the problem. 1.11 BILINEAR AND QUADRATIC FORMS Scalar functions often arise which are linear and homogeneous in two sets of variables x1,…, xn and y1,…, ym. By inspection, it is evident that such a function may be written as  when x, y are written as columns. Here A, of order (m × n) is called the matrix of the form. Suppose we wish to express f in terms of new variables , where  then  so that  is the matrix of the new form. We say hat A and  are connected by an equivalent transformation. If the elements of x, y are independent variables, we may differentiate with respect to them. For example, from (1) above,  is the first element in the column Ax,  the second, etc., so that  In this text, we shall be more concerned with quadratic forms, obtained from bilinear forms such as  when y = x, so that  where A is now necessarily square. Moreover, although in the formulation of A the elements Aij and Aji may not be equal, we may note that (see 1.2)  and on transposition it follows that  so that A may be replaced by its symmetric equivalent ; we now assume that A is symmetric. Then if we form  we have  since transposition of the second term repeats the first. Thus, since  If we express a quadratic form  in terms of another set of variables y given by the linear substitution x = By, then  where  and we observe that C, like A, is symmetric. A transformation of type (2), in which A, C need not in general be symmetric, but in which B is square and non-singular, is described as a congruent transformation and is of particular importance in dynamics. A quadratic form  and the matrix A within f, are said to be positive definite (pos. def.) if  for all real, non-null vectors x. We may construct a table for such definitions (Table 1). Necessary and sufficient conditions for a quadratic form to be pos. def. are established in Theorem XIII of 1.22. If a skew-symmetric, transposition shows that  vanishes.  1.12 EQUIVALENT MATRICES AND CANONICAL FORMS We have just defined the general equivalent transformation, and this leads naturally to the important concept of equivalent matrices. We approach this by considering the elementary operations which are commonly used in the condensation of determinants. Let I  be the unit matrix with its ith and jth rows interchanged. The new matrix is symmetric, since both its i, jth and j, ith elements are unity; moreover, its determinant is -1, since in moving the jth row to the ith position  we cross j — i rows; but the original ith row is now the i + 1th and so in taking it to the jth position we cross j — i — 1 rows. In view of its symmetry  can equally be obtained by interchange of the ith and jth columns instead of rows. Let us restrict ourselves to square matrices; then premultiplication of any matrix A by  has the effect of interchanging the ith and jth rows of A; postmultiplication of A by  interchanges the ith and jth columns. Next, let  be the unit matrix with the addition of an element k in the  position. Then premultiplication of A by  has the effect of adding k times the jth row of A to the ith row; similarly the operation AI(kij) has the effect of adding k times the ith column of A to the jth column. The determinant of  is clearly unity. Finally, let  be the unit matrix with the element  substituted for the unit in the i, ith position. Then I(li)A multiplies the ith row of A by l; A multiplies the ith column of A by l. This operation is evidently an extension of the I operation; instead of adding multiples of a different row (or column) to a given row, it adds multiples of the same row; however, it differs in that now the determinant is l. The reciprocal of I is I itself, since a double interchange of two rows restores the original matrix; the reciprocal of I is also evidently I and that of . Any product of these various matrices is always non-singular. Two matrices, A, B are said to be equivalent if one can be derived from the other by any finite number of elementary operations of the types specified above. Hence, if all the premultiplications and postmultiplications are grouped together to form (non-singular) matrices P and Q respectively, and A, B are equivalent, then B = PAQ and  Since k, l are arbitrary (except that ) it follows that there is a infinite number of matrices B equivalent to A. However, there is one matrix which is of especially simple form; it is described as the canonical form of A. First, let us suppose that A is non-singular. If A11 = 0 we can bring any non-zero element to the A11 position by the use of I we can then reduce this element to unity by the use of I(l), and then reduce all the remaining elements of the first row and the first column to zero using I(k). We do the same for the submatrix bordered by the first row and column, and so on, so that finally we reach the unit matrix as the canonical form for A. It is to be observed that, since in using elementary operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l) on A we are effectively at each stage multiplying together determinants neither of which vanishes, the reduction of A to I must be possible when A is on-singular. In passing, we may note that, since PAQ = I,  Now suppose A to be singular, of rank r and order n. This means that all minor determinants of order r + 1 vanish, but at least one minor of order r is not zero. None of the operations I (i, j), I(k), I(l), in so far as they affect the minors, can make a minor of order r + 1 nonzero, nor make the minor of order r vanish, since they merely condense these minors. We may therefore use the processes above as for a non-singular matrix; we achieve a series of units in the positions; the other elements in the matrix are all zero. The canonical form of A is thus  where I is of order r. If B = PAQ, where P, Q are non-singular but otherwise arbitrary, then the canonical forms for P, Q are the unit matrix. It follows that P, Q can be constructed from I by elementary operations; accordingly, if any such product, provided only that P, Q are non-singular, A and B are equivalent matrices; and in particular, they will have the same rank. 1.13 LAMBDA-MATRICES We have already defined a lambda-matrix of which the elements are rational integral functions of some parameter  Such matrices arise in many problems of mechanics. For example, suppose we have a pair of simultaneous differential equations  where the coefficients  are constants. We can write these as  where the column matrices are all functions of time. An alternative symbolic formulation would be  where D = d/dt and the square matrix is now an operator on x. Finally, if we are seeking the complementary function of the equations, we write x proportional to exp  and obtain  as the equations determining  and the ratio  In abbreviated form this can be written . The equation determining  is obtained from the vanishing of the determinant of the lambda-matrix; it is evidently a quartic in  and each of the four roots will have its own associated vector x. While it is often convenient to deal with equations such as(2) in the way indicated, it is also often useful to transform them into first-order equations. This may be done in various ways, but one simple and useful device is to adopt two auxiliary variables:  and to write the equations in the form  Then if we now write  and  proportional to exp  and again seek the complementary function, the four equations may be written, with a little rearrangement,  This equation can clearly be written in partitioned form as  or  where  The quartic determinantal equation obtained from this first-order set of equations may be seen by inspection to be identical with that obtained from the quadratic formulation. A matrix of the form M +  is called a matrix pencil (see 2.9, 2.10). 1.14 ADJUGATE LAMBDA-MATRICES If A  is a lambda-matrix, its elements are rational integral functions of{ gl}and so also, therefore, are the cofactors{ ga}of the elements of A: hence the adjugate,  of A is also a lambda-matrix, and   We shall denote the determinant  by . The reciprocal of A, however, being  divided by  is not a lambda-matrix, unless it should happen that  is independent of . 1.15 EQUIVALENT LAMBDA-MATRICES If we have an equivalent transformation  where P, Q may be constructed by any of the elementary operations defined in 2.12, then B and A are equivalent. It should be noted that the determinants of P, Q must be non-vanishing constants, though  may appear in them. This implies that in an operation I(k) we may see I( ),; but  will not appear in I(l) operations, except in a self-cancelling form, e.g. we could use I(l) with  in the ith place, following with I(l) with  in the jith place, so that the product of the two steps has unit determinant. I (i, j) is, of course, independent of . Using elementary operations of this kind, we may construct a canonical form of lambda-matrices, which is diagonal, the elements in the diagonal being functions of . The canonical form is not unique; the best-known form is that due to Smith (see Ref. (1)). If C( ); is the canonical form, since C{ () = PA( )Q; we have  and since  are non-vanishing constants, we have that  and  differ only by a scalar multiplier. Hence the roots of  are identical with those of . 1.16 THE CHARACTERISTIC MATRIX AND ITS EIGENVALUES Suppose we have a linear substitution Ax = y in which it is required that y be a scalar multiple of x, say x. Then x — Ax = (I — A) x = 0. Then the square lambda-matrix (I — A), which is the characteristic matrix of A (see 1.8), must be singular; i.e. the determinant  if x is not to vanish. This important equation is called the characteristic equation. If A (which is necessarily square) is of order n, then clearly the characteristic equation may be written   The n roots of this equation, say  are called eigenvalues. In what follows, we shall now regard 1,…, n as all different. An alternative formulation of the characteristic function is evidently  and it is to be observed that the two formulations imply, inter alia,  and  where Theorems II and III of 1.22 have been used. Let us write  then from (4),  so that if we regard 1 as typical of all the roots,  since all the roots differ. Now by the usual rule for differentiation of determinants,  is linear and homogeneous in the first minors of{ gd}(). Since, typically,  it follows that not all the first minors of  vanish, so that it is simply degenerate. For the same reason , the adjugate, is not null, and so has unit rank, as shown below. Since  vanishes but at least one first minor does not, there must be n — 1 independent columns, the remaining column being expressible uniquely in terms of the independent columns. This means that there will be a vector x1, called an eigenvector, such that  and x1 is uniquely determined, apart from an arbitrary scalar multiplier; that is, the ratios of the elements of x1 to each other are uniquely determined. Similarly, apart from a scalar multiplier, there will be a unique row vector  such that  It is readily shown that the adjugate  is proportional to the unit rank product . For suppose ; then  Postmultiply this by any column p such that the scalar product ; then  Since the vector x1 is unique to a scalar multiplier, we may identify  with x1 and similarly  with . If we revert to the original problem, the solution of Ax = x, we now see that there are just n eigenvalues s and that correspondingly there are just n vectors xs; i.e. we have n equations  We can combine them all into the single equation  or more briefly AX = X where X is ow the square matrix made up of the n column vectors xs, and  is the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues; and our problem is now to find the matrices X and  for the given A. We may not one further point. Let d be an arbitrary diagonal matrix; then it will permute with the diagonal matrix  Postmultiply (7) by d; then  showing that Xd is a solution of (7). This expresses the fact that the columns of X are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, since in Xd, x1 is multiplied by the scalar d1 and so on. If (7) is premultiplied by A, we have A(AX) = (AX)  and AX is apparently an alternative solution for X. But since AX = X{gd} it is X postmultiplied by a diagonal matrix, as before, except that here the diagonal matrix is not arbitrary. The matrix equation   arises perhaps most commonly in the study of the natural frequencies and modes of vibration of an undamped mechanical system having n degrees of freedom. The matrix A derives from the mechanical properties (mass and stiffness) of the system; s then determines the square of a natural frequency, and xs the corresponding mode of distortion. However, the amplitude is not determined; xs is arbitrary to a scalar multiplier. In this sense an arbitrary multiplier ds can be regarded as an amplitude. Because of its importance in vibration problems, the matrix X, which is the array of the individual eigenvectors xs, is usually spoken of as the modal matrix, even when the problem from which it derives is not a dynamical one. Similarly{ gd}in vibration problems is a diagonal matrix of squares of natural frequencies and thus defines the frequency spectrum of the system; accordingly it is referred to generally as the spectral matrix. We may readily show that the matrix X is non-singular. for if it is not, let us first suppose it to be simply degenerate. Then there will be a vector p, unique apart from a scalar factor, such that Xp = 0. But in that case premultiplication by A gives 0 = AXp = Xp so that p provides a relation different from p between the columns of X, which is impossible. Similarly, if X were doubly degenerate we could have only two vectors p satisfying Xp = 0, but each of these would give rise to other different vectors p. Hence X is non-singular. We may accordingly write (7) as  and A,  are equivalent matrices. If , then B is said to be derived from A by a similar transformation. This type of transformation is of great importance. For example, if  then  where  is the diagonal matrix of the squares of the eigenvalues. Similarly  and more generally  where P(A) is any polynomial in the matrix A.  We now revert briefly to Equations (2) and (3) in order to define the companion matrix C of  (). This is  Condensation of  shows that  so that the eigenvalues of A and C are the same. We shall give an example of the utility of (10) later (2.9). 1.17 THE CAYLEY-HAMILTON THEOREM This important theorem states that any square matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation. First, suppose as above that the eigenvalues are all distinct; then in view of(1.16.9) we may write the polynomial  (A) as  Now the diagonal matrix  has for diagonal elements  all of which vanish; i.e.  is null. Hence  (A) = 0, which is the Cayley-Hamilton theorem. The equation is true even when the eigenvalues are not all different. For we know that in general  where  is the adjugate of (I — A). Since both  and{ gd}() I are lambda-matrices, we amy write them as polynomials in  with matrix coefficients; let us write the equation as  Then on multiplying out and identifying coefficients of , we have   Premultiply the first of these relations by , the second by , etc. and add: the result is  (A) = 0. Equations (1.16.3) and (1.16.4) show that the characteristic equation may be written in the alternative forms  It follows that the Cayley-Hamilton theorem  can be written in the alternative form, in which for consistency each factor has been multiplied by -1,  It will be observed that, with eigenvalues all different, each of these matrices has degeneracy 1, the product of all n factors having degeneracy n: i.e. it is null; this is an illustration of Sylvester's law of degeneracy (Theorem XII of 1.22). Since  (A) vanishes, so also do , etc. it follows that any power n or more of A, or any polynomial degree of n or more in A, can be expressed as a polynomial in A of degree n — 1. Furthermore, if A is non-singular,  may be expressed as a polynomial of degree n — 1 in A, and therefore also  and higher negative powers. Examples of the utility of this theorem will appear later. 1.18 SYLVESTER'S EXPANSION THEOREM We revert to Equation (1.16.9) and write , to conform with the notation for the adjugate of X. Then  Now P(A) is the diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are  in succession. Once again we here assume the eigenvalues s to be all different. We now write   so that each square matrix is null except for a unit in the appropriate diagonal position. In terms of the isolating vector ei this may be written  and if P(A) is expanded in this way, the first term, which is typical will be  The square matrices on the right of these equations are all of unit rank; we may write the last as  where x1 is the first column of X, and  the first row of . We thus establish Sylvester's theorem for the expansion of P(A), viz.  where  The unit rank matrices  which are known as the constituent matrices of A, have interesting and important properties. Thus:(i) As has been noted earlier, in 1.16  is proportional to , where  is the adjugate of (I — A). (ii) We defined  as , hence  This equation requires, for all the rows  and columns   Hence  since the inner product (scalar) is unit. Hence in general  On account of this property,  is said to be idempotent. (iii) We have also  since the inner product vanishes. (iv) If in Sylvester's expansion we put P(A), which is a arbitrary polynomial, equal to I, so that , then  As a simple example of the consistency of the theorem, let us write Sylvester's expansion for A as  Let us square both sides; then  and on account of the properties above  in accordance with Sylvester's theorem. 1.19 ORTHOGONALITY AND BI-ORTHOGONALITY OF THE MODAL MATRIX We consider first the eigenvalues (supposed all different) and modal matrix of a symmetric matrix A. then by (1.16.7) AX = X and on premultiplication  Transpose this; then since  we obtain  Comparison of (1) and (2) shows that  so that  permutes with , a diagonal matrix with all its diagonal elements different. Hence (see 1.9)  must also be diagonal and it then follows that  is also diagonal. Now we have seen that we can use Xd in place of X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix; and it therefore follows that  is also diagonal. Now the ith diagonal element of this product is  and we may clearly choose di to make this element unity. If this is done for all i, and we write Xn for Xd, then  so that the modal matrix Xn, chosen in this way, is orthogonal and we say that Xn is the normalised for of the modal matrix. Next consider the more general case when A is not symmetric, but is expressed as the product of two symmetric factors. Such factorisation is always possible, in a number of ways; for example, since AX = XA then  so that A has been factorised into two symmetric matrices; however, this particular factorisation presupposes a knowledge of X and . Suppose instead that we can write A as  where B, C are symmetric; then we have  or BX = CX. Dynamical problems frequently arise in this form directly. Now as before, if we premultiply by  and transpose, since  and   so that  permutes with  and is thus diagonal, whence it follows that  is diagonal also. Clearly we cannot normalise X in this case to make both  and  unit matrices; we say therefore that in this case X is bi-orthogonal or has a generalised orthogonal form. We may pursue the matter a little further, however. If as previously we write Xd for X, where d is an arbitrary diagonal matrix, then we obtain  as diagonal matrices. Now the ith diagonal element of    where the bracketed term is the quadratic form obtained from C with the ith eigenvector xi. This quadratic form is not, as previously, a sum of squares; but provided it is not zero we could choose di to make the element unity, when we should have (with X for Xd)  On account of the properties established here, it is usual to say that the modes of a system are orthogonal to each other. 1.20 CANONICAL FORMS OBTAINED BY SIMILAR TRANSFORMATION We consider a matrix A, which for the moment we regard as having distinct eigenvalues. We have seen (1.12) that by elementary operations we can perform an equivalent transformation C = PAQ and C has a special canonical form, either the unit matrix or containing a diagonal unit submatrix. Let us now impose the restriction that whenever we perform an elementary postmultiplying operation to make up Q, we premultiply by the inverse operation to make up P, so that . In this case, we cannot reduce C to a diagonal matrix of units, since evidently . However, a simple and powerful canonical form is obtainable. The matrix A has the characteristic matrix (I — A). If this is premultiplied by  and postmultiplied by Q, then  so that A and  have the same eigenvalues. In particular, if we identify Q with the modal matrix X, then  by (1.16.8). Hence, as is otherwise obvious from the derivation of (1.16.8), the eigenvalues of A are given directly by , etc. In this case, therefore, we may regard  as the simple canonical form for a matrix having distinct eigenvalues. Note that if  and  then  so that, if X is the modal matrix of A, QX is the modal matrix of B. The great majority of mechanical problems give rise to matrices having distinct eigenvalues; however, problems involving equal eigenvalues are by no means unknown. For example, a rigid body may have some of its motions constrained by springs, but two (or more) unconstrained; it will then have two (or more) equal zero frequencies. The canonical form obtained by a similar transformation of a matrix having equal eigenvalues, when reduced to its simplest form, has the eigenvalues in the principal diagonal, with equal eigenvalues in groups; elsewhere the matrix is null except that there may be units in the superdiagonal. Thus, for example, a matrix of order 6 having three equal eigenvalues{ ga}, two equal eigenvalues{ gb}, and an unrepeated eigenvalue{ gg}, would have as its canonical form  where each x may be zero or unity; it occurs only within the submatrices containing groups of equal eigenvalues. C is sometimes called the Jordan canonical form and a submatrix such as  is known as a Jordan block. If in C a unit occurs at a position x, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation. This is readily proved as follows. Suppose we wish to remove the unit from the superdiagonal in the matrix   by means of a similar transformation; we can write the most general transformation matrix as  Then  and if both off-diagonal elements are to vanish, then  Provided  we may satisfy (4) and : for example, if we choose . Then  However, if  then the only solution of(4) is c = d = 0 when ad — bc vanishes, so that  does not exist. Hence, if a unit exists (it may not) in the superdiagonal element adjacent to two equal eigenvalues, it cannot be removed by a similar transformation. The reason for the existence or absence of a unit in the superdiagonal is easy to see. Suppose C in (3) is derived by a similar transformation from a matrix A, to which it is therefore equivalent. Then if I-A is simply degenerate when  ={ga}so also is I — C. There must in consequence be two units in the top two places of the superdiagonal, for without them I — C would have three null rows and three null columns, and so be triply degenerate. With two units present, only the first column and third row are null, so that I — C is simply degenerate as required. Evidently the introduction of a unit reduces the degeneracy of I — C by unity. It is clear from the derivation of the canonical form that it is conventional, but not necessary, to put equal eigenvalues in groups, and to put units in the superdiagonal. In a practical case, we might find an intermediate form for the matrix C of (3) to be (we shall discuss the meaning of x and y)   Now suppose , and therefore  to be simply degenerate when  Then  must also be simply degenerate. This requires that either x or y is nonzero, the other being zero; only so does the matrix have only one null column and row. Suppose x is zero, so that the second row and fifth column are null. Then y must not vanish. Now, by further operations of type I (i, j) we can bring the two roots into adjacent places in the diagonal, when -y will move to the infradiagonal and a zero, replacing x, will appear in the superdiagonal. A similar transformation of the submatrix then gives  so that, so far as  is concerned, we have arrived at the conventional canonical form. The conventional form is generally convenient; it is useful to have equal eigenvalues in groups and to the use superdiagonal; but in particular cases it may be well to use a nonzero quantity other than a unit in the superdiagonal. For example, if the eigenvalues are numerically small, a unit could dominate the spectral matrix; or if they are very large, a unit could be of the order of the errors in the computation. It would then be better to choose a quantity of the order of magnitude of the repeated eigenvalue, or even the eigenvalue itself, provided this is not zero. 1.21 SOME REMARKS ON EQUAL EIGENVALUES We have already remarked that the case of equal or confluent eigenvalues is not common in practical dynamical problems; however, when it occurs, it can cause difficulties. We shall not attempt to deal with the full problem of multiple equal eigenvalues; it will be sufficient in general to consider the case of two equal roots 1 = 2 as typical. Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult (a) Extension of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem In 1.17 we showed that a matrix A satisfies its own characteristic equation, i.e.  irrespective of the nature of the eigenvalues. Now when , the characteristic matrix (I — A) may be simply or doubly  degenerate, according to the nature of its canonical form  If it is simply degenerate (i.e. its canonical form includes a unit in the superdiagonal) then  (A) = 0 is in fact the vanishing polynomial in A of lowest degree. But if it is doubly degenerate, there is a reduced characteristic equation  being one degree lower than . Consider the equation  where  is the adjugate of ( if for  ( is doubly degenerate  is null, since all first minors of (I — A) vanish. Accordingly,  must have the factor ( —  in each element, while  () has two such factors. If we cancel one factor from both sides, we can write  and then, as before, we can prove that . An alternative expression is evidently  where the first factor is doubly degenerate; the remainder are simply degenerate, giving as before a total degeneracy n. But if the first factor is simply degenerate, it must appear twice. We may illustrate this with a simple numerical case. Let  Put  = 2 and  in the characteristic matrix  then  since by inspection it is doubly degenerate. Also   which is simply degenerate; the sum of the columns vanishes, but first minors do not. By inspection  satisfying the reduced characteristic equation. However, when we put   in the characteristic matrix , we obtain  both of which are simply degenerate; it is readily checked that  which satisfies the full characteristic equation. If a reduced characteristic equation exists, so that , then …also vanish; and, as in 1.1, we may now express powers of A or polynomials in A as polynomials in A of degree one less than that of . (b) Nature of modal matrix We now turn to the confluent form of Equation (1.16.7), viz. AX = XA, and we shall deal with this by using the example of the numerical matrices A and B above. By inspection of (3) we can see that a column vector xi postmultiplying (2I — A) to give a null result must be such that  vanishes; two obvious vectors achieving this are{ 1,2,4) and{ 1,0,— 1}. Also if (I — A) is postmultiplied by{ 1,1,1}it vanishes. Hence we may write (8) as  so that, in this case (two equal roots and double degeneracy of the characteristic matrix), the form of (8) is unaltered. However, it should be noted that, while the first two columns of X are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, they are also obviously arbitrary to any linear combination; i.e. we may postmultiply the equation by a matrix   in which  and  are arbitrary except that D must be non-singular. The leading second-order submatrix of D corresponds to the scalar submatrix in A and therefore permutes with it, so that as before  and XD is a solution of (8). Now consider the matrix B, which yields two equal eigenvalues but simple degeneracy. Since 2I — B and I — B are both simply degenerate we can find only one vector for each to satisfy ; they are respectively (see (6)){1,2,4}and{ 1.1.1}. No other vector (apart from scalar multiplies) satisfies the equation. It follows that we cannot make up a square matrix X of eigenvectors to satisfy (8); for this reason the matrix B is said to be defective. However, we may note that{ 1.2.4}and{ 1.1.1}are the first and third columns of the modal matrix X appropriate to A. If we try this X for B we find that we obtain L or  where  is now the diagonal matrix of the eigenvalues with the addition of a unit in the top superdiagonal place. Evidently A is the canonical form of A, and  that of the defective matrix B. In this latter case, a postmultiplying non-singular matrix analogous to(9) which will permute with  is  where  and  are otherwise arbitrary. Then  satisfies (10). We may note that, for both the matrices A and B,  we may therefore construct the canonical forms directly from   We now revert to (10); if for convenience we denote the columns of X by  respectively, then as we have said above, only x1 and x3 are eigenvectors; they make  and  vanish, and are each unique to a scalar multiplier. We now examine the origins of , which in relation to B we call an auxiliary vector. In (10) we find  Premultiplication of this by (2I — B) yields  Accordingly, postmultiplication by the auxiliary vector  annihilates , in fact, since  is doubly degenerate, there will be two linearly independent postmultiplying vectors which annihilate it, separately or in linear combinations. We can, and indeed must, choose x1 as one of these, for sine  vanishes, so evidently does ; and then  is the other. We might have anticipated this result from Equations (5) and (7). I (5) the doubly degenerate matrix (2I -A) is annihilated by two linearly independent eigenvectors and the simply degenerate (I — A) by the third. In (7),  is doubly degenerate and so corresponds with (2I — A); however, in this case one eigenvector and one auxiliary vector emerge. It is now clear that, to make up X, we require (i) an eigenvector x1 satisfying  (ii) an auxiliary vector  satisfying  (iii) an eigenvector x3 satisfying  In the numerical example (10),  and postmultiplication by x1 ={1,2,4}makes both vanish; postmultiplication by  ={1,0, -1}annihilates the second but not the first; the product yields — x1. There is one further point of importance:  is not unique, but contains an arbitrary element. As we have seen,  is satisfied by two linearly independent vectors (in our example,{1,2,4}and{ 1,0, -1}and therefore by any linear combinations of them. One is chosen to be x1, satisfying (2I — B) x = 0; the other , is another arbitrary combination. However, it must satisfy  so that if x1 is multiplied by a scalar d1 so also is ; which is why (11) contains  equal elements . But the equation is also satisfied by  so that in our example  with  arbitrary. This result is evidently generally true. As a dynamical example, perhaps the commonest practical problem leading to a double eigenvalue with simple degeneracy is that of critical damping. For example, the equation of motion of a mass constrained by a spring and dashpot is, in the well-known standard form,  Here we shall consider  as fixed and  as a variable (in practice, a variable spring stiffness) and for convenience we shall write  for ; this  is a variable parameter, which may be positive or negative: in the latter case, the motion is a damped oscillation. If x is proportional to expt, we have to satisfy  and for  we therefore have two different roots: either two real roots or a conjugate complex pair. However, for  (the critical damping case) the two roots coalesce into a repeated (real) root,  =  If we write v for x, the equation of motion may be written as the first-order pair  or, when{ x, v}is proportional to expt,  This requires  Giving of course the eigenvalues  for each of which  is simply degenerate. In the critical case, when{ ge}vanishes, we have two equal eigenvalues -{gm}, but I — B(0) is still simply degenerate; thus  and so the column  makes this vanish. Squaring it, we obtain a null matrix, so that  is satisfied by two linearly independent arbitrary columns. As we have seen, one of them must be  the most general form of the other is . Choosing  we find Equation (13) to be, in this case,  with the spectral matrix (on the right) in the standard canonical form for a defective matrix. There is a further interpretation of this which is of great importance. With  general, we may write the eigenvectors corresponding to ,  respectively; hence the operation  and  is converted to the standard canonical form for matrices with distinct eigenvalues. However, this similar transformation fails when : the two columns of X(O) become identical, so that its reciprocal becomes infinite. However, if we postmultiply  by a matrix which in effect sums and differences the columns, thus:  then a similar transformation  yields  as follows:  i.e. a quasi-canonical form: it is to be remembered that the standard canonical forms are conventional, but not unique. The two matrices  and  are both equivalent to  and to each other; they are each derived from  by a similar transformation. But the first is possible only for , while the second becomes a canonical form appropriate to a defective matrix only for  This example shows that the auxiliary vector{ 0,1}is in effect the differential with respect to  of the two confluent vectors  and . (c) Extension of Sylvester's expansion We come finally to the confluent form of Sylvester's expansion for any polynomial, and again we use the matrices A and B as exemplifying the  general case; however, for greater generality we shall write the repeated roots as  the unrepeated root as  and shall replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by r. Them, treating A first, we have as in 1.18  The expansion can then proceed as before, and we obtain  where  are unit rank matrices. The case of B, involving a double root with simple degeneracy, is a little more complicated. In succession, we find  Now P ( is the polynomial in   which on differentiation gives  We can evidently construct corresponding polynomials in the matrices B and , and in view of(13) they will be connected by  in (17), the first column of X is proportion to . Using (15), we may expand  in the form  Accordingly, if we now proceed (exactly as in 1.18) to premultiply (17) by X and postmultiply by  (; the first row of  is proportional to r) we obtain  Comparison with (14) shows that we have now added a new term , which derives from the element r in the superdiagonal of the canonical form. This also is a square matrix of unit rank, and z12 evidently has the properties   In fact, the above equations, and the properties of the matrices  discussed in 1.18, are all contained in the general result  on evaluation of the inner products. Equation (18) is the confluent form of Sylvester's expansion for the case of two equal eigenvalues which give only simple degeneracy to the characteristic matrix. As an example of its consistency, if we put P(B) = I, giving  then as before  while if P(B) = B, then  If we multiply (21) and (22) the result repeats (22) in view of the properties of zii and (19) above; squaring (22) yields  in accordance with(18). As an indication of Sylvester's expansion for more complicated cases, suppose we have  Then if we evaluate , it is readily found that the expansion in this case will be  Further extensions follow this pattern. Example 1 We use B as defined in (2) together with  where, in order to obtain r = 2 in , the first column of X in (10) has been halved, and the first row of YT in (12) has been doubled. These matrices satisfy . Suppose we wish to calculate B-1. Then in (18) we put  with  Then  The reader is invited to check that this is correct. 1.22 SOME MISCELLANEOUS THEOREMS We append here some useful theorems and definitions: Theorem 1 — The reciprocal of the transpose of a matrix A is equal to the transpose of the reciprocal of A. For ; transpose to get . Postmultiply by the reciprocal of AT, and . We shall write . Corollary If A is symmetric, so also is A-1. Example 1 If  Also  Theorem II — The trace of a matrix, which is the sum of the elements in the principal diagonal, equals the sum of the eigenvalues. If the determinant  of order n is expanded in the usual way, the first product is  times its cofactor, which is similar to  but of order — 1. All other products are evidently of degree n — 2 in  at most. By progressive expansion of the diagonal minors it therefore appears that the two leading terms in the full expansion are  Now if we write the determinant as  the leading terms are  Hence  Example II Let  and on expansion   Then  Theorem III — The product of the eigenvalues of A is . In  put . Then . Hence if an eigenvalue of A is zero, A is singular; and conversely if , then one or more eigenvalues are zero. Example III If A is the matrix in Example II, then  Theorem IV — If a scalar  is added to each principal diagonal element of A, the eigenvalues of A are each increased by . This is immediately obvious from the identity  The sum of the eigenvalues, and tr A, are each increased by  Example IV Let us add -3 to each diagonal element of the matrix A in Examples II and III; we obtain  and . Hence, compared with Example I, the eigenvalues have each been reduced by  and . Theorem V — Any matrix can be expressed as the product of two symmetric matrices. The case in which A is non-defective has already been treated in 1.19, so that here we must consider the defective case. We write  Suppose we have a Jordan block or blocks such as   in . If this is premultiplied and postmultiplied by the reversing matrix Js, then . Now let K be the unit matrix, except that wherever a block  occurs in , the corresponding Is is replaced by Js in K. Then  We now revert to (1), postmultiply by  and use (2):  on use of the transpose of (1). Now (3) shows that AXKXT equals its own transpose and so is symmetric, says S1. Also XKXT is symmetric, says S2. Thus  is expressible as the product of two symmetric matrices. If we put  and hence K = I, the two factors in (4) reduce to those given in 1.19. This establishes that such factorisation is always possible. A general numerical procedure, not involving X, , is given later in 2.10.3. Example V (a) Non-defective matrix — let A be as defined in (1.21.1). Then  assumes the numerical values  In this case  and  The reader may check that . (b) Defective matrix — we use B as defined in (1.21.2). Then  takes the numerical values   X being the same as in case(a). Also if  then  while  and again the reader may check that the product of the symmetric matrices . Theorem VI — AT can be obtained from A by a similar transformation. This has been proved incidentally above;(3) may be written  Example VI We use the matrix B of Example V(b) above. Then  Theorem VII — If A is any matrix of order (n × p) and B any matrix of order (p × n) where , then the eigenvalues of AB are those of BA plus n — p zeros. Consider the matrix product   where the matrices are square and of order N = n + p, appropriately partitioned. If we take determinants and note that  we have  In reverse order, we find  so that  and hence It follows that the zeros of  also make  vanish and that  must also have n — p roots  = 0. This last is otherwise obvious; A has only p columns, so that AB, of order (n × n), has at most p linearly independent columns; i.e. it is of rank p at most, and so must have at least n — p zero eigenvalues. If A and B are square, and one at least(say B) is non-singular, this result may be obtained very simply from the identity.  Corollary If A, B an C are matrices of order n × p, p × q and q × n respectively, the nonzero eigenvalues of ABC (n × n), CAB (q × q) and BCA (p × p) are identical. (N.B. if n = p = q, this corollary applies only to the products ABC, CAB and BCA and not to BAC, etc.; i.e cyclic permutation only is permitted.) Example VII (a)   Here,  The reader will verify that AB is of rank 1 with spectral and modal matrices  while BA is of rank 2 with  The eigenvalues of AB and BA are thus 0, 0 and -7. It will be noted that trBA = tr AB = -7 and that Theorem VII applies regardless of the fact that rank  rank BA. (b)  Here  each product being of unit rank. The reader will verify that the spectral and modal matrices are (i) For ABC:  (ii) For CAB:  (iii) For BCA:   The non-zero eigenvalue, 47, is common to all products, as indicated by Theorem VII. Theorem VIII — If, in the eigenvalue problem  the matrices B, C are both real and symmetric, and if further C is pos. def. and B non-neg. def., then all eigenvalues are real, finite and non-negative. In (8) write ; multiply out and separate real and imaginary parts. Two real equations result:  If these equations are respectively premultiplied by  and subtracted, then since B, C are symmetric, the left-hand side vanishes, and  Since x is not null and C is pos. def., the bracketed term is positive; hence{ go}= 0 and  is real. Equation (8) is now  and since the bracketed term is real, so also is x. Finally,  and with the given conditions  is therefore real, finite, and non-negative. I B, C are both pos. def.,  is real, finite, an positive. Corollaries (i) The eigenvalues of a real, symmetric matrix A are all real and finite, and the eigenvectors are real. This follows from the theorem by putting B = A, C = I. (ii) The eigenvalues of a Hermitian matrix are all real. The relevant equation may be written  which yields the two real equations  Premultiply the first by qT and the second by pT. Since B is symmetric, the left-hand sides are equal, an since C is skew-symmetric, its quadratic form vanishes (by transposition ). Subtraction of the two equations therefore yields   (iii) The non-zero eigenvalues of a skew-Hermitian matrix are all imaginary. Here we premultiply the first of Equations (10) by  and the second by . Now, since B is skew-symmetric it disappears from the equations, while C is now symmetric, so that the right-hand sides are equal and opposite. Addition then gives  Theorem IX — If a matrix A and its inverse A-1 are known, then if a unit rank matrix is added to A, the inverse of the new matrix may be written down. Let us write the unit rank matrix as  Then  Hence  To prove this, we merely multiply out the product  which gives I. Equation (11) is an example of the ""modification formula"" generally ascribed to Householder (3). (Householder's formula relates to the more general case where a matrix of rank  is added to A. The additional, modifying, matrix may be written CRT with C of order (n × p) and RT of order (p × n). Then with  an analogy with Equation (11). The reader might verify this useful formula in which it is evident that the inverse of a matrix of order n is obtained in terms of that of a matrix of smaller order). Examples of the use of this theorem are given in 2.2.3. Theorem X — If A is real and symmetric, it cannot be defective. For suppose it is; let us write its spectral matrix  with a Jordan block  as the leading submatrix of order 2 (it can be part of a larger block); x1 is the corresponding eigenvector and  the auxiliary vector. Then from the first two columns of  we have  on transposition, since A is symmetric; and   Premultiply (13) by ; then in view of(12)  In corollary (i) of Theorem VII we have shown that if A is real and symmetric, x is real; hence in (14)  and p vanishes; similarly for all other superdiagonal elements. Hence A is not defective. Corollaries (i) If A is not symmetric, but can be written as the product , where B, C are real ad symmetric, and in addition C is pos. def., then A cannot be defective. In this case,(12) becomes successively  and (13) yields  Hence as before,  We have proved in Theorem VIII that with these conditions, X is real; hence (15) implies p = 0, and as before, A is not defective. Provided only that A is real, it is always possible to find real symmetric matrices B, C satisfying CA = B (see 2.10.3). Accordingly, if A is defective, so that ,(15) requires that  must vanish. (ii) A defective matrix cannot be similarly transformed into a real symmetric matrix. For suppose we have a Jordan block as in the theorem, with , and we apply the most general transformation; we obtain  This cannot be real and symmetric: it requires c = d = 0, which violates the condition . Example X We now illustrate Equation (15). (a) No-defective matrix — we choose the matrix defined in (1.21.1), and write it here as A1. Then with , one possible numerical expression is   Here B, C are real and symmetric, and C is pos. def.; A1 has two equal eigenvalues, 2, and two eigenvectors{ 1,2,4}and{ 1,0, -1}. These give . With p — 0 these satisfy (15). (b) Defective matrix — we use the matrix defined in (1.21.2), writing it here as . A possible choice for C, B now yields  As in (a),  has two equal eigenvalues, 2, but here possesses only the one eigenvector,{1,2,4}. With this vector . This permits  in (15). Theorem XI — The eigenvalues and vectors of a complex matrix may be obtained by treating a related real matrix. Suppose  where  are all complex. There will be a conjugate relation  Write A = B + iC, with B, C real; then  These equations are contained, twice, in the single equation  Hence the real matrix  has the eigenvalues  of (16), and the corresponding eigenvectors  Example XI Let   Then the numerical form of (12) is  so that the eigenvalues and vectors of A are 1 — i,{-1,2 + i}and 2 + 3i,{-1,1 -i}. In the alternative form the system matrix, modal matrix and spectral matrix of (17) are, respectively,  and the reader is invited to check that these matrices satisfy (17). Theorem XII — Sylvester's Law of Degeneracy: the degeneracy of the product of two square matrices is at least as great as the degeneracy of either factor, and at most as great as the sum of the degeneracies of the factors, or the order of the matrices, whichever is less. We consider the product C = AB, where A, B have degeneracies p, q respectively. Without loss of generality we may take ; for, since the rank of a matrix is unaltered by transposition, we may consider the product either as C = AB or CT = BTAT, with the matrix of greater degeneracy on the right. We also recall the result proved in 1.12: if a matrix of rank r is multiplied by a non-singular matrix, the product has rank r. This is because the non-singular matrix may be regarded as made up of elementary operations, and these cannot change the rank of a non-vanishing minor of order r. This is a special case of Sylvester's law: the degeneracy is at least n — r and at most n — r; i.e. it is n — r. We now turn to the general case, and approach it by means of a simple example. Let A, B be standard canonical forms, with n — p, n — q consecutive units in the respective diagonals, beginning at top left, and with zeros elsewhere. Since , only the first n — q units in A are multiplied by units in B, ie.e. the product is identical with B and is of degeneracy q. Now move the units in A one place down the diagonal. The leading element in the  product now vanishes, i.e. the degeneracy is now q + 1. Proceeding in this way, we finally have all the units in A at the lower end of the diagonal, with p zeros at the top, so that the degeneracy of the product is now p + q (or, if , the product is null). This example not only illustrates Sylvester's law; it also makes the important point that the degeneracy of the product depends on the relative positions of the units, and therefore of the linearly independent columns, in the two factors. Now let A, B be general, and let the equivalent transformations which give them canonical form be PAQ, RBS, where P, Q, R, S are non-singular. Then we may write  and D has the same degeneracy as C. The matrix  will in general be fully populated; if it is appropriately partitioned, we may write (18) as  To be conformable with the first and last matrices in the triple product,  must have — p rows and n — q columns. The final matrix then shows that D has p null rows and q null columns; since , D has degeneracy q at least. This establishes the first part of the theorem. Whether or not D has greater degeneracy than q clearly depends on the number of linearly independent columns in  To examine this question, consider the submatrix  The n — p rows of this submatrix, being part of , a on-singular matrix, are necessarily linearly independent. In consequence,  must have just n — p linearly independent columns, making up a non-vanishing minor of order n — p; the other p columns are either linear combinations of some or all of the columns of the minor, or null (a special combination with all coefficients zero). First, suppose . Now  has n — q columns, the minor n — p columns: separately, a total of 2n —(p + q). But  has only n columns; hence  and the minor have at least n —(p + q) common columns, i.e.  has at least n —(p + q) linearly independent columns. The remaining p columns of  may themselves be columns of the minor, or may be linear combinations of some or all of the columns of the minor, or may be linear combinations of the n —(p + q) common columns, or may be null. At the extremes, all columns of  or n —(p + q) columns of{ ga}will be linearly independent, giving D degeneracies of q and p + q respectively; any intermediate degeneracy is clearly possible. Finally, suppose . Then, as before, at one extreme,  can contain n — q columns of the minor, which are linearly independent; at the other extreme, the minor could be wholly contained in  and  could be null, when D has degeneracy . This establishes the second part of Sylvester's theorem. Examples XII Although in a numerical case we can find the degeneracy of AB by evaluating and studying C, it is instructive to examine (18) in numerical cases. We give two examples (i) Let  Here A is of degeneracy 1, B and C each of degeneracy 2. Now by building up P and Q by elementary operations (see 1.12) we obtain  giving the canonical form for A. Similarly, for B we obtain  Inverting Q and R, we find  Hence D is given by   and D is of degeneracy 2. Note that here the submatrix  is  and we can take the first two columns as linearly independent; the third is obtained by subtracting half the first from the second. (ii) If we transfer the last column of A to the first position, we have a new matrix A; with B unchanged we then have  A is again of degeneracy 1, B of degeneracy 2; but here C is of degeneracy 3. We leave it to the reader to follow the steps of Example (i), merely noting that, in the present example,  is  with a null column in the first position. Theorem XIII — a necessary and sufficient condition that a real symmetric matrix A shall be positive definite is that all its leading discriminants shall be positive. If  is the real symmetric matrix of a quadratic form , then the determinant  is called the discriminant of the form. The leading minor discriminant of order 1 is  of order 2 is , and so on. Thus if A is to be pos. def., the theorem requires that , all i. The vector x is real and non-null but otherwise arbitrary. First, we put x = e1. then  reduced to , which must be positive if f is pos. def. Next, put  Now f reduces to  which, with  requires also that . We might proceed in this way, but a different approach is simpler. In the full expansion of f, collect together all the terms involving x1; they may be written as a perfect square, so that  where B is a quadratic form involving ,…, xn only. Now we collect all terms involving  and write them as a perfect square, and so on, so that ultimately we can write the form as   where in fact  and  while y is related to x by the triangular substitution (see (20))  and . Hence f = , so that , and  Now put xn = 0. Then f may now be written as the quadratic form of which the matrix is the leading minor of A of order b — 1, and we may deduce, corresponding to (22),  Now, by putting  we establish a similar result for  and so on, so that finally we establish that  From (21) it is clear that a necessary and sufficient condition that f shall be positive is that Di shall be positive, all i. It then follows from (23) that all the discriminants  must also be positive; this also is both necessary and sufficient. This theorem was first established by Sylvester. Theorem XIV — If two matrices A, B permute, then provided at least one is non-defective, they share the same modal matrix. Let  where C is the canonical spectral matrix  of A, and X is the modal matrix of A:X is not unique; if we have any matrix Y which permutes with C, then from (24) AXY = XCY = XYC so that we can write the modal matrix of A alternatively as XY. Now write  so that D is a similar transform of B. Then it follows from AB = BA, on use of (24) and (26), that  CD = DC. We now consider three cases. (a) The eigenvalues of A are all different. Thus A is non-defective, and C is diagonal, all the diagonal elements being different. In this case (see 1.9(3)), D must also be diagonal;(26) then shows that D is the spectral matrix of B, which thus shares the modal matrix X with A. Note that D can have equal elements (including zeros) in its diagonal. (b) A is non-defective, but has some repeated eigenvalues. Thus C is diagonal; we assume it to be in standard canonical form, i.e. it has equal eigenvalues grouped together: this only requires the columns of X to be written in appropriate order. Suppose, for example, that C has m eigenvalues{ ga}, in a submatrix of order m in the leading diagonal place: there may be similar submatrices down the diagonal. Thus C possesses a scalar submatrix  in the leading position; Equation (28)(see 1.9(3) again) now permits D to have a corresponding submatrix, also of order m, arbitrarily populated: thus D will have a block diagonal form. Now in this case D can be reduced to a standard canonical form E by a similar transformation  where Y has precisely the same block diagonal form as D; in effect, each diagonal block is resolved into its own canonical form. But in this case, Y will, like D, permute with C; thus from (25) the modal matrix of A may be written XY, while (26) and (29) require  so that B shares the modal matrix XY with A. Note that here, E need not be diagonal, so that B can be defective; but non-zero elements in the superdiagonal of E can only occur in a submatrix corresponding to a scalar submatrix in C. This establishes the theorem as stated. (c) For completeness, we look briefly at the case where A is defective. Suppose, for example, that C has the leading submatrix  then the most general submatrix of D which will permute with C1 is   where d, e, f are arbitrary. Thus D1 is in general not of standard canonical form; to make it so we must at least remove f. Now while, we can find a submatrix Y1 such that  where E1 is of standard canonical form, Y1 is not of the general form D1 and so will not permute with C1. In this case, A has the modal matrix X, B the modal matrix XY. Of course, it is possible for B to be such that f = 0, when D1 is in standard canonical form: A and B then share the modal matrix X, though both are defective. The obvious (trivial) example of this is that of a defective matrix permuting with itself. But in general, if A and B are both defective, they do not have a common modal matrix. In the light of the above, it is clear that two matrices having the same modal matrix do not necessarily permute; they will do so only if their spectral matrices permute. Corollaries (i) If A, B permute, so do powers of A, B. For example  (ii) If A, B permute, and the eigenvalues of A are all different, then B can be expressed as a polynomial in A. As in case(a) above, here  where C, D are both diagonal. Now consider the general polynomial  We can identify P(C) with D; this requires  where 1,…, n are the diagonal elements of C, and d1,…, dn those of D. The square matrix in (30) is known as an alternant: its reciprocal is discussed in Ref (P1). Equation (30) defines the coefficients  such that  which establishes the corollary. It is capable of extension, but we shall not pursue the matter here. There is a considerable literature concerning permutable matrices, see, for example, Turnbull an Aitken (4). Theorem XV — Sylvester's ""Law of Inertia""  Let a real symmetric matrix A be rendered diagonal by a congruent transformation , where B is, of course, non-singular. Then the numbers of positive, zero, and negative elements in the diagonal of  are invariant with B. The number of matrices B which diagonalise A in this manner is indefinitely large: to prove the theorem we need only show that it holds for any two. Our first choice is B = X, where X is the orthogonal modal matrix of A (being symmetrical, A cannot be defective: see Theorem X) so that , the spectral matrix of A. Our other choice is , where L is the lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal and its other elements so chosen that LA is upper triangular, when , a diagonal matrix. It is a simple exercise, which we leave to the reader, to show that the process of triangulation of A by LA without row interchanges gives the elements  discussed in Theorem XIII, where the  are the principal discriminants of A and : and example (for a non-symmetric matrix) is given in  We first note that if A is of rank r, then so are ; for since , B, may be regarded as made of elementary operations  which cannot change the rank of a matrix. Thus both  and D will have n — r zeros in their diagonals, which establishes part of the theorem. To prove the remainder, we suppose the theorem does not hold; let  have p positive and r — p negative elements in addition to its n — r zeros, and D have q positive and r — q negative elements. Then  where, since we have introduced the negative signs, all non-zero i and are positive numbers. We begin by supposing p = q + s, where s is a positive number, so that ; and we examine the general quadratic form . If  then  These two expressions are equal for all x; subtraction yields   Let us seek a vector x such that  Now from (31), ; thus the first part of (33) provides n — p relations of the form , and the second part, q similar relations: a total of n — p + q = n — s relations. But x has n elements, so that we can find only n — s of its elements in terms of the remaining s (see  an example is given in 2.5) which are arbitrary. Thus a vector x satisfying (33) has s arbitrary elements. Now substitute (33) into (32); the RHS vanishes, and so, therefore, does the LHS. With all  positive this implies, inter alia  This, taken together with (33), gives y = 0 which in view of(31) gives x = 0. We thus have two results; x has s arbitrary elements, and x is null: these can only be reconciled if s = 0, when q = p. If we now take , a similar argument leads to the same result q = p.

ACA ACA-EWW-004 9.73 "SOME NUMERICAL METHODS 2.1 INTRODUCTION In this chapter we shall discuss some numerical methods for solving problems formulated in terms of matrices. However, it must be stressed at the outset that we can do no more here than to indicate the basic principles involved, and give illustrations of a few of the almost innumerable variants of basic methods that exist. Quot homines, tot sententiae: almost every worker in the field has his pet variation, which suits him ad his computer better than any other. For a wider discussion, readers are referred to texts such as Bodewig (5) and Wilkinson (6). Most of the numerical problems which arise in matrix studies (particularly those which derive from dynamical systems) lead ultimately to one or both of two basic processes:(a) the inversion of a numerical matrix;(b) the evaluation of its eigenvalues and vectors. It will be convenient to deal with these under separate headings. The methods themselves also divide into two broad categories:(a) direct methods, in which the solution requires is reached in a finite, predictable number of operations;(b) indirect methods, in which the solution is usually obtained by successive approximation procedures, when the number of operations is determined by the rate of convergence. I: RECIPROCATION; LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 2.2 DIRECT METHOD FOR MATRIX INVERSION Under this heading we give three methods which are all very different in principle. Each has variants; for each there are circumstances which favour its use. 2.2.1. Pivotal condensation This method is the simplest, and probably the most universally used. Suppose we have a square matrix A =  of order n for which we require to find the reciprocal R: then AR = I. Now it is possible to write down a sequence of matrices  Mr (r is usually n or n + 1, depending on the variant employed) which when used as a chain to premultiply A, condense it to the unit matrix, so that  which evidently implies  The numerical procedure is to operate successively on 91); given A we can write down M1 and we evaluate  so that(1) becomes  Knowing B we can now write down  and form  and so on , until R is obtained. As we shall see, in practice it is not necessary to write down the matrices  merely perform simple operations with the rows of A and I in (1), which is all the matrices  do. For ease of exposition, let us suppose n = 4. Consider the matrix product, corresponding to (3)  In writing down  we have first arbitrarily selected a non-zero element  of A as a pivot (underlined) for this first step in the operation.  is then obtained from the unit matrix by replacing its second column (corresponding to the subscript 2 of  by the third column of A divided through by  with negative signs for the off-diagonal elements. The third column of B is then null except for a unit in the position corresponding to  The product makes it clear that all we are doing, in fact, is to operate with the rows of A in a manner similar to that often used in the condensation of determinants. Thus row 1 of B is now 1 of A minus  times row 2 of A; row 2 of B is row 2 of A divided throughout by 3; row 3 of B is row 3 of A minus  times row 2 of A; and so on. Having obtained B, we now select a pivotal element in it for the next step; the selection is arbitrary except that the element must be nonzero and must not be in the second row, which contains the unit. For example  in which  has been chosen as the pivotal element. We now choose a pivotal element in C, excluding rows 2 and 3 containing the units. Note that  and  cannot both be zero, or A would be singular and R would not exist; similarly for  We choose a nonzero element from these  four -say  and then  The last step is not arbitrary: we must exclude the first three rows (containing units), so that the only choice for pivot in the next step is D44, which cannot be zero. We write down , evaluate E =  obtaining a matrix which if the rows are rearranged by premultiplication by an obvious matrix , becomes the unit matrix. As we have said, in practice we do not need to write down M1 etc. When we use  as a premultiplier of (1) we combine the rows of I in exactly the same ways as those of A. We can therefore write the two arrays side by side and operate on rows of 2n elements. For example, to summarise what has been done above (we refer to row i as ) we use Table 1.  When the left-hand array has been condensed to I, the right hand array is R.  This method has a number of variants. First, it is possible to operate with columns, using postmultiplying matrices Mi; but this is really only transposition of operations on rows. The variants derive mainly from the choice of pivot. In the so-called optimal pivoting method, one chooses the element of largest modulus from among those available. In a second variant, one chooses the element of largest modulus in each column in turn; in a third, the diagonal elements are chosen in order; and in a fourth, the diagonal elements of largest modulus are chosen in turn. The third has the advantage that no final rearrangement of rows is required; on the other hand, it fails if a pivot becomes zero, or even very small. The third variant is usually described as ""diagonal pivoting without row interchange"" , the fourth as ""diagonal pivoting with pivotal strategy"" . It is to be observed that the determinant of A is readily found from the condensation procedure. The determinant of  is , etc. It follows that the determinant of A is , i.e. the product of the pivotal elements chosen, multiplied by the determinant of , which rearranges the rows, and so has the value , according as to whether the number of interchanges is even or odd. Example 1 We exemplify these procedures using the matrix  This matrix, in fact, has the determinant 100; since its elements are integers, the elements of the reciprocal will be terminating decimals. In the intermediate steps, however, the numbers are incommensurable: for brevity of exposition we give four decimal places only, though of course a computer will normally employ a much greater number. (i) Optimal pivoting In Table 2, the last array on the right is the required reciprocal. Note that, in the rearrangement of the last step, we crossed three rows in bringing  to the top; then the new second row  crossed two rows in going to the bottom. Since the total number of crossings, 5 is odd,  has the determinant -1; accordingly       Coincidentally, this example also illustrates he second variant: it is adventitious that the largest element among those available occurs in the first, second, third and fourth column in succession. There is thus no difference in the working. However, in the optimum method a computer is required to scan all elements available, i.e.  in successive steps, while in the second variant only m,(n — 1),…, 1 need scanning. In this example, therefore, the second variant has the advantage; in a matrix of large order, the scanning process can take considerable computer time. No scanning is needed in the third variant, where the diagonal elements are prescribed. (ii) Diagonal pivoting We now treat the same matrix by the third variant (see Table 3). For this example, this variant presents no difficulty. Also  as before. The student is invited to effect this reciprocation by means of the fourth variant, in which the largest diagonal element available is chosen as the pivot at each stage; it begins with the bottom right-hand element. 2.2.2 The method of submatrices This method has nothing in common with the pivotal method, but has great advantages in certain circumstances. (a) Suppose we have a computer which will accommodate a matrix of order m, but we require to reciprocate a larger matrix A of order n where . (b) Suppose we have a matrix B of which we know the reciprocal ; B is now bordered, so that it becomes a submatrix of a larger matrix A, and we require A-1. The method of submatrices is particularly useful in solving both these problems. Let A be partitioned in the form  Here A is of order n, B of order m, E of order n — m; C and D are in general rectangular. Let the reciprocal of A be similarly partitioned:   Then the equations  provide relations from which, in general,  , may be explicitly found. Various formulae are possible, but the most advantageous from the computational standpoint appear to be the following. Write  Then  as may be checked by evaluating  It is to be noted that, although these formulae involve a number of multiplications, only two reciprocations, B-1 (of order m) and  (of order n — m) are involved. Problem (a) It is clear that the formulae just established provide a method of solution for problem (a) since  and the computer can reciprocate both B and  and perform the required multiplications. Example 1 Although it is very small, we may use the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4) to illustrate the principles involved. We shall here partition it into four square submatrices, each of order 2. In this simple illustrative case we avoid decimals. Thus    We are now able to evaluate the remaining submatrices of the reciprocal as  Accordingly, the reciprocal is  in agreement with the result found earlier. Problem (b) It is also clear that Equations (3) and (4) provide a solution for this problem. We are given  and we border B as in (1) and apply our solution to obtain  The working is then exactly as in the example just given. The formulae are, however, rendered much simpler if we have only line bordering, i.e. C is a column, D a row, and E a scalar. Then X is a column, Y a raw, and  a scalar. It follows that we can provide the answer to a third problem,(c): the successive evaluation of the reciprocals of the leading minors of a matrix A until  is achieved. Example 2 Again, we choose the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4):(i) The leading minor of order 1, b1, is the element 6: reciprocal 1/6. (ii) Using (i), we apply the formulae (3),(4) to find the reciprocal of the leading minor of order 2, viz:  Here   and we deduce  (iii) We now use this result to examine the third order minor  Then  similarly,  Also  Note that, in Equations (4) which we now evaluate,  is a matrix of rank 1. We find  (iv) Using , we proceed to obtain the reciprocal of . We leave this step to the reader, but observe that  Since an element in the reciprocal of a matrix M is defined as the ratio of the cofactor of the corresponding element in M to the determinant , it follows that, for example,  and hence   In this example, therefore,  2.2.3 Column (or row) building This method makes use of Theorem IX of  which states that if we have a square matrix Ao of order n, and know , then by a simple calculation we can find the reciprocal  of a new matrix , where  is a unit rank matrix, also of order n,  being an arbitrary column and row respectively. A second application of the theorem enables us to find , where  and so on, until we find , where  In this present context, suppose we have a matrix A of order n and require to find its reciprocal. Then it is possible, using (1), so to choose, , etc. that Ao is transformed into A, when a last simple calculation gives  The method has many variants: we can build A column by column, or row by row, or column and row simultaneously. We give here what seems to be the simplest approach. We choose  (or possibly a scalar matrix ). Then, if  is the isolating row vector, we form  Here  is the first column of A except that the leading element  is diminished by 1; thus the first column of  is identical with that of A, while the (n — 1) remaining columns are those of I. By Theorem IX of 1.22  Next we evaluate (this step is not quite so simple)  so that  Here  is the second column of A but with the second element reduced by 1;  and  is the second element of  Further steps follow this  pattern and are obvious. We may, however, observe that (4) may be written  i.e. as the sum of  and a rank 1 matrix of which the rows are proportional to the second row of . Example 1 We choose the same numerical matrix as before (Equation (2.2.1.4)), viz:  so that    2.2.4 Triangulation We have already seen, in  that reciprocation of a triangular matrix can be achieved by a simple process of back-substitution. Accordingly, if we first reduce a matrix A to triangular form we can then proceed to determine its reciprocal. The usual reduction to triangular form is by a pivotal condensation similar to that described in 2.2.1, except that we only remove elements below the diagonal. We may best illustrate this with out usual example (see Table 1). What we have done is to keep  but use it to eliminate the leading elements of  and so on, reducing the number of rows by 1 at each step. We have now, in effect, achieved the equation    This has been obtained by triangulation without row interchange. If we now proceed to the process of back-substitution, this is in effect operating again with rows, and all it does is to compete the process which was done continuously in the pivotal condensation of 2.2.1. There is thus no advantage at all in he intermediate triangulation step. However, much attention has been given in the literature to inversion of triangular matrices by methods other than back-substitution, particularly iterative methods. We illustrate below one direct method. Triangulation has many important uses. When we reduce a matrix A to triangular form, we write it as . We may first note that the product of the diagonal elements of the leading matrix in (1) is evidently . If we divide each row through by its diagonal element,(1) becomes  The leading matrix here is of the form I + C, where C is null except for the elements above the diagonal. Now, provided  as r increases,  as may be checked by premultiplication by I + C. In this example   and on use of (3) we obtain from a single multiplication  Premultiplication of(2) by (4) yields finally  in agreement with results given earlier. 2.3 ITERATIVE METHODS These methods are well suited to computers and often have the advantage that, should an error occur, at worst it lengthens the computations a little. 2.3.1 Improvement of an approximate reciprocal This is an important topic; it often happens that an approximate reciprocal of a matrix A is known: perhaps from a rough calculation, or one in which an error has been made, or even that belonging to a neighbour matrix of A. Refinement of this approximate reciprocal is then required. The usual procedure is as follows. Let R be the exact reciprocal and  the approximation. Write  Then  Premultiply by  then since   Thus  is a new approximation to R, and we may repeat the cycle as required to obtain R, subject to convergence of the method. The conditions for this are readily established. From (2) we find.  and further steps give   and so on. Thus, provided  as r increases, the method will converge very rapidly. This will normally be the case of R1 is a reasonably good approximation, when the elements of  will be small. At each step the method requires the multiplication of two matrices such as AR1, the subtraction of the result from 2I, and then the second multiplication, e.g.  to obtain the next approximation. An alternative procedure which achieves the same result but is more convenient computationally is the following. Write  Then  Inversion of this and premultiplication of the result by R1 gives, provided  as r increases.  It is readily checked, in view of(3) et seq., that he product of the first two terms in (5) is R2, of the first three is R3, and so on . The number of matrix multiplications in this procedure is the same as before; but the squaring of  etc. is usually relatively easy since they become rapidly smaller in practice. Indeed, if, for example in (5),  and higher powers are sensibly null to the order of accuracy required, we can write  saving one multiplication. In practice, since the numbers in  and I become progressively and rapidly more disparate, it is better to deal with them separately; i.e. the operations in (5) are carried on as follows; we are given A and R1:(i) evaluate  (ii) evaluation …until to the order of accuracy required a power of E1 is sensibly null. (ii) evaluate  and add R 1 to get R 2 ,(iv) evaluate  and add  to get ,(v) evaluate  and add  to get , and so on. Normally, very few steps are needed. Example 1 Suppose we are given  Then A is the matrix of our previous examples, and R1 an approximate reciprocal, given to three places of decimals. It is required to find the reciprocal R of A, correct to six places of decimals. Then  where the figures are exact.  is thus exact to six decimal places, viz:  but  would require 12 decimal places. We retain only eight:  an to this order of accuracy  is null. Hence   Since  is null, we can apply (6), when  where we have retained eight decimal places. Finally, to six decimal places   2.3.1 General Iteration The most general iteration procedure appears to be the following. We require to solve RA = I for R. Write the known matrix A as A = B — C, where B is a matrix having a known (or easily found) reciprocal. Then the problem can be written  where we have written  There are various iterative methods for solving (2). For example, we may write it as  and use the regression formula  so that , for example , if Ro = 0, we should obtain  and so on . Evidently, these are successive steps in the solution of (2), which is valid of  as r increases.  A rather more rapid method is to write (5) as  For the simple reciprocation of a matrix A these methods hardly compete with pivotal condensation; however, they do have a place in the parallel problem of solution of linear algebraic equations. It must be stressed, however, that the choice of B must be such at  has eigenvalues with moduli all less than unity; Sylvester's expansion then shows that  as r increases. There are certain physical problems yielding matrices for which this can be guaranteed; but in general some trial and error is involved. It should be noted that (2) can be written alternatively as   leading to  It is important to observe that this general iteration procedure is really exactly the same as the method given in 2.3.1 for improvement of an approximate reciprocal. The first of Equations (4) shows that  is an approximate reciprocal, and then Equations (2.3.1.5) and (6) are the same, provided E1 and E are the same. Now, if B-1 is the same as R1,  so that the methods are effectively the same. This result shows that, although in (1) no restriction is placed on B, it must in practice be a reasonable approximation to  if the method is to converge. Example 1 We illustrate Equation (6) here. Let  Here we have chosen B as the lower triangular portion of A, and C is of course B — A. We are given that   To four places of decimals we now find  and to this order of accuracy,  is null. Then, successively (note that these are not the steps of (4)).  and  is in fact the exact reciprocal of A.  2.3.3 Special iteration procedures In Equation (2.3.2.1) the only restriction placed on B was that it should have a known or easily-found reciprocal. We now discuss two particular choices for B. (a) Seidel iteration. Here B is chosen to be the lower triangular part of A, including the diagonal, with all superdiagonal elements null. B is then reciprocated as in 1.9(8) an the methods of the last paragraph applied. The example given there is in fact an illustration of Seidel iteration. (b) Simple or diagonal iteration. Here B is chosen to be the diagonal matrix of the diagonal elements of A. Its reciprocal can therefore be written down. It is mostly used when A is a ""sparse"" matrix, with elements dominated by the diagonal; B-1 is then a reasonable approximation to R. If this is not the case, the method may not converge, or do so very slowly. For example, if we take the matrix A of the last example, an choose  then  This matrix has two real eigenvalues, 0.319 and 0.597, and a pair of complex eigenvalues of modulus 0.999. The powers of E therefore converge very slowly indeed. A better illustration follows. Example 1 Let   Then, if we retain eight decimal places  Hence, if  and so on, we find as successive approximations to  correct to six decimal places,  2.4. SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX Certain matrices have properties which make reciprocation rather easier than would otherwise be the case. We give a few examples. 2.4.1 Symmetric matrices The reciprocal R of a symmetric matrix is itself symmetric. For if A is symmetric and we transpose AR = I to get  then evidently  (see also 1.22, Theorem I, Corollary).   It follows that we do not need to compute all the  elements of R; n (n + 1) /2 elements, comprised in the diagonal and below, are all that are required. Example 1 We give in Table 1 a scheme for pivotal condensation of the matrix just examined in Example 2.3.3.1. For convenience, the reciprocal has been multiplied by 103; we work to six decimal places on the left, three on the right. If the last four rows of Table 1 are taken in reverse order, the required reciprocal is obtained. It is to be noted that the starred numbers in Table 1 do not need to be calculated, though it is convenient to write them down. Provided that appropriate proportions of  are subtracted from  as they stand to give zeros in the first column, the array of numbers on the left in  can be written down; when the rest of  is found, the third element of  can be inserted, and so on. Also, when  is reached, this gives the last row of R and hence also the last column, so that the eighth elements in  can be written down, and so on. However, in practice, the programming required to avoid these calculations could be more time-consuming than the straight pivotal condensation, when the symmetry of the final result gives a check on the calculations. The procedure in Table 1 also exemplifies triangulation without row interchange. The product of the underlines elements in the table gives . 2.4.2 Positive definite (symmetric) matrix The method to be described is usually attributed to Choleski. It is a simple matter, which we leave to the reader, to show that if A is real, symmetric and positive definite, then it can be written as the product BTB where B is real and triangular. Then if  and since B is triangular,  is readily found. We give a simple example. Example 1 Let  The leading element gives  (use of — 10 makes no difference). Then ab = 30, b = 3; ac = 10, c = 1; ad = -10, d = -1. Next  and so on. In this way it is quickly established that  Inversion of B as in 1.9(8) then yields  and then  It may be of interest to note that if x ={p, q, r, s}is any vector of real numbers, not all zero, then the quadratic form  may be written (see also 1.22, Theorem XIII)  where  so that, where the second term does not involve p, the third p, q, and the fourth p, q, r,  and is always positive under the conditions given. If A is not pos. def., the elements of B are in general complex. 2.4.3 Persymmetric matrix The reciprocal of a persymmetric matrix is not in general also persymmetric; e.g.   A persymmetric matrix can be treated as symmetric for the purpose of reciprocation, but otherwise it is not special. 2.4.4 Centrosymmetric matrix We shall consider here only matrices of even order; the odd-order case is quite straightforward, but is algebraically more complicated. A centrosymmetric matrix A is characterise by A = JAJ, where J is the reversing matrix. Inversion of this gives  since J2 = I; the reciprocal of A is therefore also centrosymmetric, as are the integral powers of A. If A is of order 2m, it can be partitioned into four submatrices, each of order m, thus  other representations are possible, but this appears to be the most convenient. If (2) is premultiplied and postmultiplied by  the result is A as required. We can write the reciprocal of A as  and then the product of (2) and (3) yields (twice)  These may be solved if either P or Q is non-singular; we assume P-1 exists, and we write R for P-1Q. Then from (4) we obtain  The reciprocation of A may thus be effected through two reciprocations of order m, instead of the much more laborious single reciprocation of order 2m. Example 1 Consider  Then, in the above nomenclature  Accordingly,  A caution must be added: the method is not always viable. Thus, for example,  but this result cannot be obtained by use of (4) since by inspection the submatrices of order 2 are all singular. 2.5 LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS A set of linear algebraic equations (often called simultaneous equations) has the form Ax = p. Here A is, in general, a rectangular matrix of order m × n with given elements, p is a given column of m elements, and x a column of n unknowns; it is required to find x. Suppose first that . Then we have more equations than unknowns. If (1) is soluble, there must be n independent equations; if these are written first, we can partition (1) in the form  where B is square and non-singular. Then  If s does not satisfy (2) the set of equations is inconsistent, and (1) does not have a valid solution. If, however, the equations are consistent, then the solution (2) for x uses only n of them; the remainder are superfluous. Now let. In this case, we have fewer equations than unknowns; we now partition (1) in the form (B, C){y, z}= p, where B is square, of order m, and y is a column of m quantities. We now obtain the partial solution for x  in which we determine m of the unknowns x in terms of B, C, p and the remaining m — n unknowns z. This is the parametric solution of 1.10. Example 1  Consider  as partitioned, the solution is (see (2))  and  so that the equations are consistent; if they are taken any two at a time, the three cases all yield the same answer. However, had the last element in p been other than 4, the three pairs of equations would have given three different answers. Example 2 . Here, a simple example is  which yields  In Examples 1 and 2 the main numerical problem is the solution of BX = r, By = p — Cz, where B is square. We now confine our attention to the case where A is square and non-singular; this is obviously germane to the above solutions. 2.5.1 Direct Method Our problem is to solve Ax = p, for x; here A is a given square and non-singular matrix of order n, p is a given column of n quantities, and x a column of n unknowns. Formally, the solution is obvious: x = A-1p. We can therefore obtain our solution by inverting, using any of the methods of 2.2, 2.3, and postmultiplying the inverse by p. In some problems we require to obtain x for each of a set of values for p; e.g. the elements of p may be functions of an independent variable, and we require x for each of a number of values of the variable. If this number is high — in particular if it exceeds n — then labour is saved by inverting A and using (2). If, on the other hand, the number is small, labour is saved as follows. We use the approach of 2.2.1; but instead of operating on (2.2.1.1) with the matrices Mi, we operate directly on (1). Evidently, we then progressively approach the solution (2). The computations, by simple operations on rows, are effected in exactly the same way. Indeed, reciprocation is really only the solution of a particular set of linear algebraic equations, in which the vectors p are successively  For a single set, in pace of e1 we use the single vector p. Example 1 Suppose we require to solve   The square matrix used here is that employed for the Examples of 2.2; we choose diagonal pivoting without row interchange. The working of the left-hand array is thus identical with that of Example 2.2.2.1. See Table 1. The last four figures in the right-hand array are given correct to three decimal places and are in fact the exact solution. 2.5.2 Iterative methods We exemplify the general iteration procedure of 2.3.2; we write B — C for A, where the reciprocal of B is known or easily obtained. Then Equation (2.5.1.1) can be written  so that, if F is written for B-1C, the solution is given by  say. As before, this may be developed in either of two ways, provided  as r increases: x = q + Fx, suggesting the regression formula  or  Though the computations may be different, these two formulae are equivalent; for if xo = 0 the regression formula gives  and so on. We illustrate (3) below. Example 1 It is required to solve  The square matrix has been used in Example 2.3.2.1. We again choose B to be A except that the elements to the right of the principal diagonal are all zero: then, as before     Note that here F = B-1C: in the previous example, E = CB-1. We now construct the iteration table (see Table 1), beginning with x1 = q and applying (3). Since, in view of the fact that F has two null columns, the first two elements of x are always multiplied by zeros, it is not necessary to compute them until the iterations are complete. At the beginning of the iteration, we have retained only two decimal places: later three, then four, until to this order of accuracy the iteration repeats. Finally, the first two elements are computed, when the last column (here x10) is the solution required. It may be observed that equations of the form x = q + Fx arise naturally in some dynamical or quasi-static problems, e.g. the distortion of a structure under applied load, when the load is varied by the distortion. 2.5.3 Choleski's method for positive definite matrices Let us now suppose that in 2.5.1 A is pos. def. Then as in 2.4.2 we can write A as  where B is triangular. The equations for solution are now  Write y for Bx; then (1) can be solved in two steps:  and then Bx = y for x. It may be noted that a set of equations Ax = p, where A is general, may be cast in the above form by premultiplication by AT:  However, this does not appear to offer any computational advantage. Resolution of  into  implies A = CB where C is an orthogonal matrix, so that . Again, however, this does not appear to offer any worthwhile computational short-cut. Example 1 Suppose we wish to solve  As in 2.4.2, we can quickly resolve the square matrix into  A self-explanatory scheme for computation is shown in Table 1. Here BT, p are written at the head of the left-hand array; by obvious row combinations we find y at the bottom. This and B are inserted at the top of the right-hand array, when again obvious row combinations give the required solution at the bottom right: in summary   2.5.4 Least squares In 2.5 we noted that if we have more equations than unknowns, the equations must be consistent, or a unique solution does not exist. Nevertheless, especially in experimental work, cases often arise where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns. For example, suppose we have a measurable quantity f which we have reason to suppose is a polynomial function of an independent variable t:  and we wish to find the m coefficients . Measurement of f at each of m values of t would provide m equations for the m unknowns; however, since f is measured and so is inexact, it may be thought better to measure f at n values of t, where  in order to minimise the effects of experimental error. How do we proceed to find optimum values of the coefficients ? The ""least squares"" solution of this problem is due to Gauss. Let the n equation in m unknowns  be written Ax -p = e, where A is of the order (n × m), x is the column of m unknowns , p is the column of n measures values of f, and e is a column of n errors. We are given A and p; e will vary with x. Gauss' proposition is that x will have its optimum value when the sum of the squares of the errors, ie.e  is a minimum. Now  and for this to be a minimum, its differential with respect to x (see 1.11) must vanish; i.e.  which is our original set of Equations (2) with e = 0, premultiplied by AT; it gives m equations for the m unknowns. Example 1 Suppose we expect the relation (1) to be  and suppose further that we have the following experimental table:   Then in view of(5) our equations for solutions may be written  Before we proceed to the least squares solution, let us see what results would be obtained if we solved these equations three at a time, with e taken to be zero for each set of three. We should get  These are all very different. Moreover, if we adopted the first solution and applied it throughout, e would become (the first three elements have been assumed zero)  which is clearly quite unacceptable for the later measurements. However, if we premultiply (6) by AT as in (4) we get  and the solution, by inspection, is x ={1, -2,1}, i.e.  If we now return to (6) and use this solution, we find  which compares very favourably with the result given earlier.  2.5.5 Least squares: weighted errors In the basic Gaussian method just described, it has been tacitly assumed that  all errors are equally likely. The method is readily adapted, however, to cases where some weighting of errors is desirable: it is merely a case of premultiplying (2.5.4.2) by an appropriate diagonal matrix. Example 1 Suppose we wish to put a straight line  through the following set of experimental points:  Suppose further that, in view of the experimental method, we may expect errors in f to be proportional to t. Let us first examine the straight Gaussian solution. The equations can clearly be written  Premultiplication by AT yields  so that the optimum lime, if all errors are equally likely, is f = 0.57t + 1.80. However, we are given that errors are likely to be proportional to t. To make them equally likely, we must multiply the first of Equations (1), at t = 1, by 6; the second, at t = 2, by 3; the third, at t = 3, by 2, etc; i.e. we premultiply (1) by Diag(6,3,2,1,5,1,2,1). The result is   and premultiplication of this by  yields  to two decimal places. Hence in this case, the optimum line is f = 0.50t + 2.01. For comparison, the errors e in the two solutions (2) and (3) are (the lines intersect at t =3)  and it is clear that in the second case the errors increase markedly with t, as required. II: EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS 2.6 THE CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION The n eigenvalues of a square matrix A = (Aij) of order n are given (see 1.16) by the roots of the characteristic equation  which, in expanded form, can be written  In theory, therefore, the calculation of the eigenvalues of A is straightforward: we form the characteristic determinant in (1), expand it to the form (2), and solve this by any suitable means to obtain . Having obtained the eigenvalues, can readily find the corresponding eigenvectors. If r is a known eigenvalue (which we assume here to be unrepeated) and  the corresponding column and row eigenvectors respectively, then   Since  are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we can in each vector make a suitable element unity; then Equations (3) provide in each case n linear algebraic equations for the (n — 1) unknown elements: one equation is superfluous, or can be used as a check. For example, if we make the last element of  unity, and partition () to isolate its last column and row, we can write (3) as  which give  Equations (5) can be solved by any of the methods of 2.5 (the second would be transposed to , and then  Unfortunately, so far as the expansion of (1) to (2) is concerned, theory and practice are at odds. With  general, the labour involved in the expansion is quite prohibitive even for small values of n, and indirect methods are always used in practice. We describe two such methods below; first, however, we observe that, in (2), we can readily obtain the two coefficients p1, pn, since (see 1.22, Theorem II, III)  The evaluation of a numerical determinant, even of high order, is very quickly accomplished on any modern computer by reduction to triangular form; thus we can find p1 and pn without difficulty. It remains, however, to find p2, p3,…, pn-1. 2.6.1 Location method In Equation (2.6.1) we arbitrarily assign (n — 2) different values to  (other than  = 0, which we have in effect used to determine pn) and then evaluate the (numerical) determinant for each of these. We then obtain n — 2 linear algebraic equations for the n — 2 unknowns pi. A caution should be added: most the arbitrary values of  should preferably lie among the zeros of  (; otherwise inordinately high accuracy may be needed. At this stage, the zeros of  () are now known, but their approximate locations may often be inferred from their sum and product as given by (2.6.6) and (2.6.7). Example 1 Let  The sum of the eigenvalues is thus  and their product 3906.25 (=p4). Their arithmetic mean is thus about 11 an the fourth root of  about 8. These suggest that we might use  = 20,  = 10 in (2.6.1); we have already used  = 0 to obtain . It is readily found, by condensing the numerical determinants,  Now we know that  or  Insertion of  = 20,  = 10 in (3) together with the numerical values of  (gl}) from (2) yields the two equations  which give p2 = 606.25, p3 = 2812.5. Hence  on factorisation. The eigenvalues of A are thus 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5. We illustrate the calculation of the eigenvector  corresponding to the eigenvalue 12.5. Then   giving  of which the solution is (any method from 2.5 may be used)  and it is readily checked that these also satisfy the fourth equation. 2.6.2 Iteration method In view of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, A satisfies its own characteristic equation; i.e.  Postmultiply this by any arbitrary column co and write . Then a computer will rapidly evaluate the successive products  and so on. Accordingly (1) yields  This provided n linear algebraic equations for the n unknowns pi. As before, we can find  independently if we so wish. It must be added, however, that this method is not suitable when n is large. As we shall see later, the columns ci usually tend to proportionality as i increases, so that Equations (2) become increasingly ill-conditioned; also the numbers involved can assume widely different magnitudes. Example 1 We use the matrix A of (2.6.1.1) with co = e4. It is found that successive columns ci are then   Accordingly,(2) can be written  in agreement with (2.6.1.4). With the particular choice of co, p4 enters into the last equation only. Accordingly, if we calculate p1, p4 from the trace and determinant of A, we can discard the last equation and substitute for p1 in the remainder, when (3) reduces to  Any two of these (consistent) equations give p2, p3 their values in (4). 2.7 POWER METHODS The most commonly used device for finding the eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix A is the power method, or one of its many variants, in which A is effectively raised to a high power. We illustrate some aspects of the basic principle. 2.7.1 A dominant eigenvalue Sylvester's expansion for A is (see 1.18), in its simplest form,  and in view of the properties of the constituent matrices ,  Since the order of the terms on the right is immaterial, there is no loss of generality i supposing1 to be the eigenvalue of greatest modulus. If for the moment we assume it to be real and unrepeated, then all other eigenvalues have smaller moduli. Thus if r is increased sufficiently, say to a value s, the first term on the right of (2) dominates the rest, which become relatively insignificant. Then, in the limit,  By use of (3) we thus find both 1 and . We could in theory find them from As only, since , but there is a practical difficulty. Unless the  modulus of 1 is close to unity, the numbers appearing in Ar (r large) are either inordinately large or small; in practice therefore it is usual to find not Ar but a matrix proportional to it: at each stage in the power evaluation, a homologous element is reduced to unity. Example 1 Let A be the matrix in Equation (2.6.1.1). Then, if we reduce the bottom right-hand element to unity, we have  We now evaluate B2 and divide through by the bottom right-hand element to obtain  Evaluation of F2/2.4997 repeats F except for occasional small differences in the fourth decimal place. Now, if we round off to three decimal places, we find that F can be written as the unit rank matrix, proportional to    If we now revert to A and postmultiply by   Thus, 1 = 25. Also, the inner product  is  so that normalising to make  unity: Note that  so that A has been raised fairly rapidly to a high power. An alternative. There is, however, an alternative device which is in practice more commonly used; this is repeated premultiplication by A of an arbitrary column  as in 2.6.2. We successively evaluate  etc. If we postmultiply (2) by co and write  (ki is of course a scalar) we obtain  Accordingly, provided that co is not such that k1 () vanishes, the first term on the right dominates the rest as r increases, until in the limit when r = s  Example 2 We exemplify this using the same matrix A as above; also, we adopt the device of reducing at each stage a homologous element (in this case the bottom element) to unity, beginning with co = e4. The first step is  Proceeding in this way, we find successive columns as in Table 1. Also given are the dividing factors at each step. Since c16 repeats c15, they give x1; also the dividing factor 25 is 1. To complete the solution, we now require to find ; this could be done by repeating the iterative procedure, evaluating , where  is an arbitrary row, or more usually, by the device given in (2.6.4), viz:  giving  We leave it to the reader to show that in this example,(7) leads to  or to a scalar multiple of it. We normalise  in the usual way. We may note in passing that (as they should) the columns  and  of Table 1 agree with the last columns of B, C, D, E, F (subject to rounding-off errors in the last place of decimals). This leads naturally to a comparison of the two methods. There are two reasons why the second method is commonly used. First, if an error (even of rounding-off only) is made during the successive squaring process, it is multiplied by itself   subsequently, an persists through the calculations; in the second method, if an error is made in calculating ci, this only amounts to choosing a new arbitrary column, an at worst may prolong the calculations. But, mainly, the first method usually involves more work than the second. It is difficult to quantify ""work"" exactly, but if the number of individual multiplications is taken as a guide, then, if A is of order n, each of the n2 elements of  involves n multiplications: i.e. n3 in all. If r squaring processes are needed, we perform rn3 multiplications, yielding , r must be an integer. In the column process, each step involves n2 multiplications; hence, to reach the same accuracy, between  and  multiplications are needed. Now, provided the eigenvalues are reasonably separated, column iterations usually number between 15 and 50. Suppose, in a particular case, 25 are required. Then the ""work"" is measured as  From Table 2, r must be 5, with the work measure for squaring 5n3. The ratio is n/5; so if  the work involved in squaring is greater. If, say, n is 100, the work is 20 times greater.  2.7.2 Subdominant eigenvalues: deflation Again, for the moment we assume the eigenvalues of A to be real and unrepeated; and we assume that in (2.7.1.1) they appear in descending order of modulus. If, as in 2.7.1 we have found , then Equation (2.7.1.1) can be written  The known matrix on the left now has all the eigenvalues and vectors of A except the first set, and it can be treated as in 2.7.1. The process of reducing A in this way is known as ""deflation"" . Evidently the eigenvalue 1 has been replaced by zero, so that A1 is singular. Having evaluated A1, we can again apply column iteration. However, we need not begin with an arbitrary column; we can readily find an appropriate column to begin with, which avoids many iteration steps. An example will make this clear. Example 1 We continue Example 2.7.1.1. The iterations have shown that 1 = 25, while x1 is proportional to{ 1,2,3,5}and  to (1,7,5,4). Normalising these, we find   Note that  vanishes when premultiplied by . We now revert to the iterations for 1 an observe that, for example, c9 of Table 2.7.1.1 is mostly composed of x1. The remainder will clearly be mostly . Since x1 is orthogonal to , the part of c9 due to x1 will disappear when it is premultiplied by A1 (see 1))). Thus we find  and dividing by the last element, we find as a starting column co for iteration with A1   The iterations give us successive columns as in Table 1. Column c9 repeats c8, so that 2 = 12.5 and  is proportional to{ -0.5, = -0.5,0,1}. As before, we now find that  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising, we find  We proceed to the third eigenvalue; we further deflate A by subtracting the unit rank matrix (3) from A1:  Note that  = 7.5, while  is in fact doubly degenerate; it vanishes when premultiplied by  or . As before, we choose a column from Table 1 — say c3 ={-0.4978, -0.4992, -0.0015,1}— and apply it as a postmultiplier to . The result is a column proportional to{ 0.981, 0.0095,— 1.0095, 1}. We leave it to the reader to show that this leads rapidly to 3 = 5 with x3 proportional to{ 1,0,— 1,1}an that  is then found to be proportional to (27, -11, -15.8). We normalise this to obtain  an now further deflate A to obtain A3; in this case, as will be seen, no iteration is required to obtain a solution:   In obtaining the last form of(5) we have noted (a) that ; since the other three eigenvalues have been replaced by zeros, 4 = 2.5;(b) A3 is, by inspection, of unit rank an so, with 4 extracted, can be written in the form (5). This completes the solution. With the four terms of the Sylvester expansion now given numerically in (2),(3),(4) and (5), the whole solution can be expressed compendiously as  2.7.3 Subdominant eigenvalues: sweeping Although the delation procedure discussed in 2.7.2 is the most straightforward possible method, other devices are often useful and sometimes preferable. We now discuss ""sweeping"" , which takes two forms. (i) First method Instead of operating with a deflated matrix, we operate on the original matrix A (or a part of it) with a column vector from which all contributions from x1 have been ""swept"" away. This is valuable, for example, when (as is often the case in dynamical problems) A is sparse. Deflation destroys this characteristic; the sweeping method under discussion does not. With r = 0, Equation (2.7.1.5) becomes  Hence if we choose co to make k1 zero, it will contain no contribution from x1, and, as r increases sufficiently to a value s,(2.7.1.5) will tend to  The condition  means that we can express one element of co in terms of the remaining n — 1. In theory, if co is chosen in this way, the iterations will in due course yield (2) without further attention. In practice, rounding-off errors soon produces inaccuracies which re-introduce small  proportions of x1, which tend to grow relatively rapidly. It is therefore best to apply the criterion  at each step; i.e. to calculate one element of cr from this criterion when the others have been found. This means that we can ignore one row of A; we exemplify this below. As before, we need not be completely arbitrary i our choice of co (though it must satisfy ) from (1), a column free of x1 is  with co arbitrary. But we can with advantage choose co to be a column in the previous iteration to find1 etc.: this will contain mostly x1, some , but little else; then  eliminates the contribution from x1. Example 1 We use the same example as before, restating for convenience what we have already found.  Note that  have been normalised to give . Now any postmultiplying column say{ a, b, c, 1}, must satisfy  In performing our iterations, therefore, we may ignore completely the first row of A; we use the last three rows to find the corresponding elements in a column, and then apply(3) to find the top element. For our initial column co, we again choose the column c9 from Table 2.7.1.1, in the iteration to find 1 etc.; thus for our present purpose  Then  and  As it should, this column vanishes when premultiplied by . We divide throughout by the last element to obtain as our new starting column  then the iterations, using (3) at each step, begin   We postmultiply A (ignoring its top row) by the column (4) to get the column of three numbers on the right; divide by the last element to get the bottom three elements in the next column, and find the top element from (3). In this way, we obtain the successive columns and dividing factors in Table 1. Thus we find . As before, knowing 2, we find  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising:  The same principle serves for the third root. If cr ={a, b, c, 1}then  and  must both vanish; we find   If we select c3 from Table 1 as our new co, it already excludes x1, so that  will also exclude . This is  If this is written{ 0.9333,0.0333,— 1.0333,1}, it satisfies (6). We now iterate on A, but ignore the first two rows:  We leave it to the reader to show that this converges quickly to 3 = 5, x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. In the usual way,  is found to be proportional to{ 27, -11, -15.8}. Normalising:  As before, no iteration is needed for the completion of the solution. If we choose the last column above (which excludes x1 and ) as a new co, then a column which also excludes x3 is  Since x1, , x3 are excluded, this column is proportional to x4. Premultiplication by a row of A gives 4 = 2.5; completion of the solution is straightforward. (ii) Second method Instead of sweeping our iterated columns at each step, we can do it one for all with the aid of a ""sweeping matrix"" . In view of(3) we may write  If (8) is used as postmultiplier of A, it is clear that A is deflated by the sweeping matrix in (8) to   (note that A1 here differs from the deflated form A1 of 2.7.2). If A is of simple form (e.g. sparse) this characteristic may be partly or wholly destroyed in forming A1; on the other hand, A1 has a column of zeros, and thus its own simplicity. This means also that the umber of the head of a column iteration is always multiplied by zero, an so need not be calculated till the final step. We are thus effectively operating with the third-order submatrix of A1 when its first row and column are omitted. As before, we may find a suitable initial column such as(4). We then perform the iteration, omitting the first element of (4):  The numbers produced in this way reproduced exactly those of the last three elements in the columns of Table 1, as well as the dividing factors; they are of course exactly the same calculations, but with the matrices associated differently. At the conclusion, the top element of the final column is found by use of the first row of A1. We must emphasise, however, that the row vectors A1 are not , . Hence, when 2 has been found, we revert to A itself to find . For the next root, we use another sweeping matrix based on the second part of (5):   If this square matrix is used to postmultiply A1 we find  We now iterate on the submatrix  to determine the last two elements of x3; we leave the completion of the solution to the reader., 2.7.4 Shifting and inverse iteration Theorem IV of 1.22 noted that, in view of the identity  addition of a quantity{ ge}to each of the diagonal elements of A implies the addition of{ ge}to each of the eigenvalues of A. We note here, additionally, that the constituent matrices zii of A are unaltered by such a change. Sylvester's expansion gives (see 1.18)  whence  The device of adding{ ge}in this way is known as ""shifting"" , and has a variety of uses. For example, with hindsight, we know that the eigenvalues of A in (2.6.1.1) are 25, 12.5, 5 and 2.5. the rapidity of convergence of the initial power solution depends principally on the relative separation of the eigenvalues 25 and 12.5, i.e. 2:1. If we reduce all eigenvalues by 7.5, they become 17.5, 5,— 2.5,— 5 and the relative separation is 31/2:1 which yields much quicker convergence. Note that this is the optimum: the second and fourth eigenvalues now have equal moduli. To select the optimum requires accurate knowledge of the eigenvalues, which at the outset of a calculation is of course not available; but if one has a general idea of the disposition of the eigenvalues, shifting can save much time. The principle use of shifting, however, lies in inverse iteration. Suppose, for example, that the matrix A is the system matrix of a vibrating mechanical system, and suppose further that this system is excited by a  forcing vibration of frequency corresponding to  = . It is desired to determine the eigenvalue (and its vectors) nearest to  in order to study the response. To approach this problem, we first note that Sylvester's expansion for negative powers of a matrix B gives  It follows that the eigenvalue of B with the smallest modulus now becomes the eigenvalue of B-1 with largest modulus. Hence, to solve our problem, we first evaluate B = A — the eigenvalue of A nearest to  now becomes the eigenvalue of B nearest zero, i.e. of smallest modulus. (Note that A, B and B-1 all have the same constituent matrices zii.) We therefore invert B and iterate on B-1 as usual to obtain our solution. Example 1 Once more we choose the matrix A defined in (2.6.1.1) and used in previous examples. We also let  = 5.5. Then  If we invert this, e.g. by the methods of 2.2, we obtain  We postmultiply this by an arbitrary column co: here we choose co = e1 and iterate as usual. The successive columns are given in Table 1. The iterations converge rapidly to x ={1,0,— 1,1}with the eigenvalue of B-1 equal to -2. Hence the eigenvalue of B is — 0.5 an of A is 5.5 — 0.5 = 5, in accordance with results obtained earlier for 3 and x3. Note that, since the eigenvalues of A are in fact 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5, those of B are 19.5, 7,— 0.5,— 8, and of B-1 therefore 0.0513, 0.1429,— 2,— 0.124. The relative separation of the two roots of largest moduli is here 14:1. Clearly, the method is not restricted to mechanical systems: by its means we can study the eigenvalues and vectors of any matrix A which lie near any given value o of .  2.7.5 Confluent eigenvalues So far, we have restricted our attention to unrepeated real roots of the characteristic equation belonging to a matrix A; we now consider the case of two equal real roots. Multiple roots are in practice very rate (except perhaps for mechanical systems moving freely in space, when multiple zero roots can occur: but these have a special simplicity). The treatment for two roots is readily extended to the multiple case if required: even for two roots, however, we require to examine two cases (see 1.21). We assume the roots to have dominant moduli, any roots of greater modulus having been removed by deflation etc. (i) Characteristic matrix doubly degenerate When a repeated eigenvalue 1 makes the characteristic matrix doubly degenerate, we know (see (1.21.14)) that the Sylvester expansion of the system matrix A is  It follows that we can use the power method to find 1; postmultiplication by co gives in the limit, when r is sufficiently large, say s,  We thus find 1 without difficulty; but the determination of z11 + z22 requires further consideration. Now   and  is thus, in general a linear combination of 1, . At this point, the iteration has given no indication that a double root is involved; however, this becomes apparent when we seek the row vector corresponding to cs: for all first minors of 1I — A vanish and we cannot find a unique row vector. To proceed, it is simplest to generalise (2.6.4) by partitioning off the last two rows and columns of 1I — A, thus:  Here  is a square submatrix of order  of order 2;  has two columns and  has two rows. Then  These algebraic equations are solved for ; we now have two independent columns  which annihilate 1I — A when used as postmultipliers; and correspondingly for the rows . We now normalise them; we evaluate  Then m is a square matrix of order 2 and, for example,  are normalised rows and columns. Finally  Note that only the sum  is unique. If they are individually expressed as  and  then their sum can be written  where M is an arbitrary non-singular matrix of order 2. This replaces x1,  with two different linear combinations (x1, ) M of them, with corresponding changes for . It will be observed that in this approach we have not used cs (which we have already found); its introduction would spoil the simplicity of (2). When x1,  have been found, it is possible to check that cs is a linear combination of them., Example 1 Consider the matrix   It is assumed that at this stage we have no knowledge of its eigenvalues. If we choose  and iterate in the usual way, we find quite quickly that  Normally, we would choose  However, if we attempt to use (2.6.4) to find , it at once emerges that all first minors of 1I- A vanish, indicating that 1 = 12.5 is a repeated root. We therefore apply (2) with  This gives for the solution of (2)  Since the columns and rows are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we may now write  (for simplicity of exposition we have multiplied the first column on the right by 3). The product of the numerical matrices in (8), in that order, is (see (3))  If we premultiply  we ca finally write  These enable us to choose, if they are required,  but, following (5), we could equally well use any two different linear combinations o x1, , represented by (x1, ) M provided these are associated with ., /div4. (ii) Characteristic matrix simply degenerate This case is rather more difficult: the difficulty derives from the appearance of a unit in the superdiagonal of the spectral matrix of the given matrix A. For simplicity of exposition we assume here that A is of order 4: extension to larger matrices is obvious. We know (see 1.21) that ,  so that  on expansion of the triple product. We know further that, in view of the properties of the constituent matrices zij,  When  is absent, this reverts to the simpler case dealt with under (i). Our task now is, given A, to resolve it numerically into one of the forms (12), i.e. to find 1 etc. Sine, a priori, we do not know the nature of A, we should approach this task as usual by iteration with A on an arbitrary column co. If we write  then postmultiplication of (13) by co yields  When the iterations have proceeded so far, say when r = s, that contributions from 3, 4 are insignificant and may be neglected, then   Previously, with  absent, at this stage  equalled . Now, owing to the last term, this is no longer true and successive columns tend to show a near arithmetical progression in their elements. It is true that, when s is very large  the columns tend ultimately to x1 (last term in cs dominant), but the number of iterations required is very large. However, in place of the simple  we can drive from (15) the relation  In practice, therefore, if convergence seems very slow, we evaluate three successive columns fully, omitting the reduction of a homologous element to unity, and solve the quadratic  for at least two homologous elements. If they have a common root, we test the remaining quadratics to see if they are satisfied by this common root. If they re, then the root is 1 and the iterations have proceeded far enough (r = s) for only terms in 1 to remain. Knowing 1 we use (15) to evaluate  giving us a column proportional to x1. Knowing 1, we now form the matrix 1I — A; if we put r = 0,1 in (13), multiply the first by 1 and then subtract the second:  Premultiplication of this by , or postmultiplication by x1, annihilates it; none of the other vectors does so: the matrix is rendered simply degenerate by the presence of z12. We may, however, use (2.6.4) to find , we then known 1 and  subject to scalar multipliers. To find  we revert to (11), which yield, inter alia,  or  Since 1I — A is simply degenerate, the last equations provide, in general , n — 1 independent linear equations for  (and ). However, one element in each of these vectors may be assigned arbitrarily. For, since (1I — A) x1 vanishes, the equation for  is also satisfied by , where q is arbitrary; so, for example, if we choose a non-zero element in , the homologous element in  may be made zero by appropriate choice of 1. Similar considerations apply for . We are thus able to solve (19) for  and . Having done this, we now require to normalise: we evaluate  and we may then choose our vectors as, for example, ,  and the pair  which we now call . We have now obtained 1 the vectors  and , and the auxiliary vectors  and ; we are therefore in a position to deflate A (see (12)) by removing all contributions from these quantities. The solution is then completed in the usual way. Example 2 We require to find the modal and spectral matrices of  We begin by iterating on co. If we choose co = e4, then after about 18 steps, four successive columns are  These show very slow convergence; indeed, the elements show a near-arithmetical progression. We therefore choose, say, the first of these columns and without reducing the last element to unity, calculate the next two columns:  We choose, say, the first and last elements of these and solve   The common root 12.5 also satisfies the middle two quadratics; hence we find 1 = 12.5. We now use (17) and find{ 2.2875, 4.6875, 7.5, 13.125}— 12.5{ 0.165, 0.355, 0.57,1}={0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.625}and hence  may be taken as{ 1,2,3,5}. Using (21) we now evaluate  and it may be checked that postmultiplication by  gives a null product. We use (22) as in (2.6.4) to find , we leave the solution to the reader: it is found that  which when used to premultiply (22), annihilates it. We now proceed to find the auxiliary vectors. If we write  (the first element of  is nonzero, so that of  may be taken as zero) then we solve, using the appropriate submatrices (see(19))  The solution is . A similar calculation yields . We must now normalise these. We evaluate  Note that here, since the second row and first column of the product are necessarily orthogonal, m is triangular; also in this case it happens that m-1 = m. Accordingly, we may choose to retain the columns  and to adopt the rows, orthogonal to , ,   We are now able to evaluate  and  We can now deflate A (see (21)) to  Note that trA1 = 7.5; also A1 is doubly degenerate, being annihilated by postmultiplication by both  and . Iteration with A1 on co = e4 produces quite quickly the simple eigenvalue 3 = 5 and vector x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. We then evaluate 5I — A1 and employ (2.6.4) to obtain . Normalising this with x3, we obtain  and we are now able to deflate A further to   Since  and  is the only remaining eigenvalue,  and  can be written  which completes the solution. The results may be expressed compendiously as  The numbers are not of course unique. We could, for example, divide x4 by any factor f provided we multiply  by f. However, if for example we divide  by 10 and multiply  by 10, we must replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by 10. 2.7.6 Conjugate complex eigenvalues and vectors of a real matrix So far, we have restricted our studies to real eigenvalues. However, complex eigenvalues and vectors are of frequent occurrence , and require special consideration. First, if the matrix is real, then its characteristic equation must have real coefficients. Hence, if it is satisfied by , then it will also be satisfied by ; complex eigenvalues of a real matrix therefore occur in conjugate pairs. In a similar way, if the eigenvector corresponding to  is , then the relation  implies the conjugate relation; hence p — iq is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue  Evidently, the vector in (1) is arbitrary to a scalar complex multiplier, say  +  another vector satisfying (1) is thus  Any arbitrary linear combination of p and q may therefore be taken as the real part of the vector, with a corresponding combination for the imaginary part. If we expand (1) we obtain successively  If we eliminate q we find   The same equation is satisfied by q. This suggests that the square matrix in it is doubly degenerate and that p, q can each have two arbitrary elements; but this is not so. When  p are known, q is uniquely related to p by  in which  is not singular. What is said above gives a background to what follows. We assume once more than  have dominant moduli, any eigenvalues of greater moduli having been removed by deflation etc. Again, a priori, we assume nothing is known of the nature of A, so that the process of finding the dominant eigenvalue and its vector is approached as usual by iterating with A on an arbitrary column co. Once again, for simplicity, we assume A to be of order 4. The Sylvester expansion of A gives  Accordingly, if we perform the usual iteration on co and continue until, with r = s, terms in 3 and 4 are negligible.  where  is a complex scalar. Now, as we have seen (p + iq) is arbitrary to a complex scalar multiplier (and p — iq similarly). We are therefore at liberty to choose  and then  Elimination of p, 1 from these three equations yields  Note that, since  this is precisely the same as Equation (3); however, in the iteration case, it is only true when the iterations have proceeded sufficiently far for the terms in 3, 4 to disappear, when cs consists only of p. Now in practice, with a pair of complex eigenvalues, the elements in  tend to change sign periodically: there is no point in reducing a homologous element to unity, since there is no convergence to a settled form. When  behave in this way, conjugate complex eigenvalues must be suspected; and then three consecutive columns must be periodically tested to see whether various pairs of  homologous elements give consistent values for . When this happens, the iteration has gone far enough, and we can take p = cs, when q is determined from the second of equations (6), which is in fact the same as (4). We now know{ gm},{go}p and q. Finding  is not so straightforward. Knowing  we can either(i)Solve  with one element of  arbitrarily assigned. We then have to solve a set of linear algebraic equations with complex coefficients;(ii) Iterate with A postmultiplying an arbitrary row ; this will lead to  (and  again) as for p, q. (iii) Solve the equations which parallel (3) and(4):  Since  are known, this, like (ii), involves only real numbers; on the other hand, it requires , the evaluation of which requires considerable computer time if the order of A is large. On the whole, since most modern computers can work with complex numbers,(i) seems the most straightforward. When we have obtained  we can perform a check, which is in any event needed when the vectors are normalised. For since  belong to different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal, and  so that  For the process of normalisation, we require to evaluate  and m is evidently diagonal; in view of the check equations (9) it can be written  the determinant of which is , so its reciprocal is readily written down and we can obtain normalised forms of . We can now deflate A. Since  a deflated matrix A1 is  We can therefore use A1 to obtain the remaining eigenvalues and vectors of A in the usual way. Example 1 Let  If we use this for iterative premultiplication of an arbitrary column, say the summing vector, successive columns are as show in Table 1.  It is apparent from the first that the vector elements are changing sign; so we do not reduce a homologous element to unity (though in general we might periodically remove a power of 10). If, starting say at c5, we test to see if pairs of homologous elements give consistent values for ,  in (7), we find  this is not so. However,  give nearly consistent values; we therefore begin with  accurately:  If these three columns are used in (7) then any two pairs of homologous elements give . We thus obtain  Also, we may now choose  and using the second of Equations (6) we now find  We now have to find , and for this we use (8). One element of  can be arbitrarily assigned: here we assign the value 1 to the third element and solve  which, if we omit one column (e.g. the last) from the square matrix, gives  We omit the details of solution; the answer is   Note that  Accordingly,  and if we postmultiply p + iq as given by (14) and (15) my m-1 we obtain as our normalised p, q,  We are now able to deflate A. Equation (11) becomes, with A given by (12) and use of (13),(14),(15) and (16),  A1 is, in fact, doubly degenerate; it is annihilated by both the columns immediately above it. iteration with A1 on an arbitrary column quickly leads to the result  Further delation leads at once to  which completes the solution. 2.7.7 Adjacent eigenvalues: Two eigenvalues with nearly-equal moduli When two eigenvalues have nearly-equal moduli, it is obvious that very many iterations will be required for a direct solution. The following device can be helpful in this case. Suppose the iterations have proceeded so far that only contributions from the two nearly-equal eigenvalues remain. Then we can write, when a homologous element is not made unity,  Here a, b, c, d; p, q are the values of a homologous element in the various columns; a, b, c, d are known. Elimination of p, q, yields two equations which may be solved for 1 + 2 and 12:  Hence, ,  are readily found. When they are known, then  which follow from the first two of Equations (1). When 1, 2 are very close, both numerator and denominator in (2) tend to be small differences, so that accurate calculation of a, b, c, d is desirable. In practice, iteration in this case behaves rather like that for a defective matrix (2.7.5), in that convergence is slow and successive columns tend to a quasi-arithmetic progression of the elements. The occurrence of nearly-equal roots is more common than that of a defective matrix; hence tests to see whether homologous elements yield, in (2), consistent results should be applied first when convergence is slow.   Example 1  Iteration on a column, beginning with co = e4, yields successive columns as given in Table 1. At this stage, we make consecutive accurate calculations, to see if we can get consistent values for :  Using the elements of the last line in (2) we obtain  The elements of the first line give  The results are consistent, as indeed are the results from the second and third lines. By inspection (or from the implied quadratic)  We now evaluate the eigenvectors:  so that we may take  I now remains to find the corresponding row vectors and to deflate A for  further study; we leave this to the reader. However, we may note here that  whence . 2.7.8 Applicability of power methods We have seen that the power method can be used to obtain dominant eigenvalues and the associated vectors, and, by deflation, sweeng, shifting and inverse iteration, can also be used to find all non-dominant eigenvalues and their vectors; the results are obtained seriatim. This implies that, if one is interested only in a limited number of eigenvalues, the power method is the obvious choice. For example, suppose we have a mathematical model with n = 100 for study of the vibration characteristics of an aircraft. The aeroelastic engineer will usually be interested only in the fundamental mode of vibration and a few overtones, say 10 in all; in the usual model this implies the dominant and the 9 immediately subdominant eigenvalues and vectors. The vibration engineer will be concerned with a band of frequencies near the engine rotational speed, and so will use shifting and inverse iteration. But in any event, the mathematical model will usually involve the finite element concept which gives accurate values for the lower band of frequencies, but is often quite unrepresentative of the top frequencies. Evaluation of all frequencies and modes is therefore not normally required. For such a model, power methods are the obvious choice. However, if interest attaches to all eigenvalues, and in particular if there is less concern with the associated vectors, other methods may be used. We now begin a brief study of transformation methods. 2.8 TRANSFORMATION METHODS In these methods, we apply a succession of similar transformations to a matrix A:  and so on, until A is transformed into a form giving the eigenvalues directly: it may be a triangular form, or the ultimate canonical form  (or  if A is defective). Since the transformations are similar, all the derived matrices B, C, D,…have the same eigenvalues as A; and if we proceed to the diagonal form, then the chain product X3…gives the modal matrix X. 2.8.1 Jacobi's method for a real symmetric matrix In 1.22, Theorems VIII and X, we have shown that a real symmetric matrix  has real eigenvalues and that it cannot be defective. Moreover, its modal matrix is orthogonal; hence  Jacobi's method is as follows. We begin by searching the off-diagonal elements of A (since A is symmetrical, we usually use the upper half only) to find the element Auv of greatest modulus. We then construct the orthogonal matrix , which is the unit matrix except that the units in the (u, u) and (v, v) positions are each replaced by  and the zeros in the (u, v) and (v, u) positions by  and s respectively. Then  and we may evaluate  of which the relevant submatrix is (omitting all other rows and columns)  which yields  We now choose{ gth}1 such that Buv vanishes; i.e.  This fixed{ gth}1. If than 2{gth}1 is positive, we take 2{gth}1 to lie in the first quadrant; if negative, in the fourth, Then{ gth}1 lies between  = c is positive and  has the sign of tan 2{gth}1. With c, s fixed, we can now evaluate B fully. Elements other than in the uth, vth columns and rows are unaltered from those in A; at the intersections of the uth, vth columns an rows the new elements are given by (3)(with Buv = 0), while the remaining elements Biu, Biv in the uth, vth columns and rows are  We may make two deductions. First, from (3) we have  and since only these diagonal elements have changed, it follows that  as it must in a similar transformation. Next, fro(5), squaring  and adding, we have  and since only the uth, vth columns and rows have changed, we deduce that the sum of the squares of all the off-diagonal elements of B is less than that of A since we have replaced the two elements Auv of A by zeros in B. Thus  Having evaluated B, we repeat the procedure to find C; we select the element Bpq of largest modulus and find  from (see 4))  we then proceed as before to construct  and . C will have Cpq = 0 and may also have cuv = 0 (if ); but this situation will not persist. At some stage, in general, elements formerly made zero will again become nonzero, though usually smaller than before. Thus Jacobi's method does not terminate in a finite, predictable number of steps; indeed, the umber may be very large. Nevertheless, following (6)  and, in an overall sense, the off-diagonal elements therefore become progressively smaller, until eventually we obtain a matrix in which the off-diagonal elements are all vanishingly small: i.e. a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. We give below an example, but must enter the caveat that because of its small order (n = 3) it converges radly. At each stage, the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements decreases by at least one third. However, if we had a matrix of order 100, it would have 9900 off-diagonal elements, and we can only say that at each stage the sum of the squares of these elements would decrease by 1/4950 at least; convergence to diagonal form is likely to take very much longer than for a small matrix. We may add two observations. The method is viable if Auv is reduced, not to zero, but to some lesser modulus; nevertheless, reduction to zero is obviously best. Also, the method requires only that A is real and symmetric: its state of definiteness is irrelevant. In the example below, A has a negative eigenvalue. Example 1 Let  We select the off-diagonal element of largest modulus (underlined) and evaluate (we record only six decimal places)  Hence  and then  Note that  also  thus we have effected a considerable overall reduction. The second step is to obtain C. For this we select the underlined element in B an evaluate in succession   and then  Note that the zero elements in B have become nonzero in C; however,  is now 2.19132; compare  above. Proceeding in this way, after six transformations, we find to the order of accuracy employed  2.8.2 The LR and QR methods We now describe briefly two methods which are applicable to any square matrix A, whether symmetric or not, real or complex, simple or defective, non-singular or singular. Here, we shall merely state and illustrate the methods; for proofs, readers are referred to Wilkinson (6). We may note, however, that while a complex matrix A = B + iC (B, C real) may be treated as such, using complex arithmetic, it is more usual to treat its real equivalent  which (see Theorem XI, 1.22) yields the eigenvalues and vectors of A and its conjugate. 2.8.3 The LR algorithm It is a straightforward process, readily programmed for a computer, to resolve a matrix A into the product L1R1 where L1 is a lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal, and R1 is an upper triangular matrix. For a model, we here take n = 4; it is tycal of any order. Let    Apart from the top row of  which by inspection is identical with that of A, we have here 12 equations ad 12 unknowns. From the first column of the product we have  which determine p, q, r. The second column yields  which, with p,. q, r known, determine in succession 2, s, t. The remaining unknowns 3, x33, n and the last column of R1 are found progressively in the same way. Note, however, that A11, 2, x33,…are divisors (vots) in this procedure, so that a voting strategy may be needed. Note also that , so ; hence, if A is non-singular, the diagonal elements of R1 must all be nonzero. Indeed, this program is very suitable for the numerical evaluation of determinants. The  algorithm resolves A into the product  as above, and then multiplies the factors in reverse order to obtain a new matrix B. Since  and then  is a similar transform of A. B is, in general, a fully populated matrix of which the last column is that of R1 (thus A14 reappears in B) and the last row that of L1 multiplied by x44. When B is found, it is in turn resolved into the product L2R2 and  evaluated, and so on. As the succession of similar transforms proceeds, it is found that (a) the elements below the diagonal become progressively smaller,(b) the diagonal elements tend to the eigenvalues, in descending order or modulus down the diagonal. When the process is well established, it is found that (with n = 4 as our model) the element  becomes approximately  in . When this element becomes very small  tends to decrease by the factor  and  by  and so on. Accordingly, if the eigenvalues of A are widely spaced, convergence of the  method is fairly rad; if, however, there is a pair or group of nearly-equal eigenvalues, then very many iterations may be required before the end result is achieved. This is an upper triangular matrix T, of which the diagonal elements are the(real) eigenvalues in descending order of modulus, and which still retains the  element A14 in the top right position. If A has a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalues, then T is not strictly upper triangular: the diagonal includes a block of order 2 such as  with  on the diagonal of T and  below it. In this case, the solution of  yields the complex eigenvalues. the numbers,  not in general constant under transformation; but if the iterations have proceeded so far that I is in the quasi-triangular form, the trace and determinant of (3) are invariant, so that the complex roots are fixed. As the LR transformations proceed, the most rad convergence is to the smallest eigenvalue in the bottom right-hand corner. Indeed, if there is a zero eigenvalue, it appears in the first transformation, i.e. in B. It follows that shifting (see 2.7.4) can be used with great advantage to accelerate convergence. When the element in the bottom right-hand corner has reached a settled value (i.e. the eigenvalue), we can deflate the transform, by omission of its last row and column, before continuing the iterations with a matrix of reduced order., /div4. Example 1 We choose the deflated matrix i (2.7.2.2) as A:  Since , the bottom right-hand element of  vanishes, as it should. We now evaluate the product in reverse order:  The reader is invited to check that, if B is resolved as it stands into  then C =  will also have its last row null, the zero eigenvalue thus repeating. We may therefore deflate B, omitting its last row and column and continue the iterations with the leading first minor of B. It is found that, after 22 more iterations, working to six decimal places,  Thus, the eigenvalues of A are, in descending order of modulus, 12.5, 5.0, 2.5, 0. The whole operation may in fact be summarised as LT = AL:  Recovery of the eigenvectors in the LR procedure is not straightforward, especially if deflation has been used. Since the eigenvalues are known, probably the simplest method is to use (2.6.4). However, if we have not deflated, then clearly  leads to (see (5) above)   We now require to transform T to . If TP = PA, then tycally  where PA has been multiplied out. Identification of the elements on each side, beginning with the superdiagonal, leads to  giving a, d, f. The remaining unknowns, b, e, c are found progressively. With P determined in this way, we have  so that the modal matrix of A is the product LP. The reader is invited to evaluate LP, using the numerical values of (5) in (6), and in particular to note that the eigenvector belonging to the zero root is that originally associated with the eigenvalues 25 in (2.7.2.6) The LR procedure is thus simple and easily programmed. However, in practice, it normally requires very many iterations before convergence is achieved; moreover, the process of recovering eigenvectors outlined above is apt to be ill-conditioned, and some other procedure is usually to be preferred. 2.8.4 Pre-reduction to upper Hessenberg form As we have seen, the LR procedure (and the QR method, to be discussed shortly) annihilates the elements of A below the diagonal. This is, however, usually a very long process; and while it can be accelerated by shifting and deflation, it is in fact better to depopulate A below the diagonal, as far as possible, as an initial step. An upper Hessenberg matrix has only zeros below its infradiagonal; and it is possible to transform any matrix A to this form by a similar transformation. This is the best that can be done to depopulate a matrix below its diagonal; if one could remove infradiagonal elements as well, there would be no problem in finding eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix. We illustrate reduction to upper Hessenberg form with a general matrix of order 4; it is clear that the procedure applies to matrices of any order greater than 2. We  write AK = KH as  Just as we have done earlier, we can evaluate the n2 unknowns progressively. The first column of the product gives  which determine h11, h21, p, q (note that here, also, a voting strategy may be needed). From the second column  which yield in succession  and so on. Thus, by progressive substitution, we arrive at the Hessenberg matrix ; it possesses the same eigenvalues as A. If we apply the LR or QR algorithms to H, the Hessenberg form is retained at each step; thus, instead of removing all the elements below the diagonal, we have to remove only those in the infradiagonal. Much computer arithmetic and time is thus saved. Transformation of A to H therefore greatly improves the LR algorithm; we have introduced it here, however, because for the QR method it is a sine qua non. We may add here, in passing, that it is possible by simple substitutions to reduce any matrix A to tridiagonal form — populated only in the superdiagonal, diagonal and infradiagonal. However, for our present purposes this is unnecessary; and in any event it often involves ill-conditioned equations and so lacks accuracy. Example 1 We again choose the matrix A of (2.8.3.4). The reader is invited to check that, if A is transformed as in (1), then  If we now treat H as our basic starting matrix A and resolve it into L1R1 then  As will be seen from , resolution of an upper Hessenberg matrix requires an upper Hessenberg L1, i.e. a matrix with zero elements everywhere except in the diagonal and infradiagonal. Both the resolution of A into L1R1 and the subsequent evaluation of  (B is also of upper Hessenberg form) are thus much simpler than when A is fully populated. 2.8.5 The QR algorithm We assume that the matrix A is already in upper Hessenberg form. Then, in parallel with the LR algorithm, we write  where , as before, is upper triangular. However, here we do not resolve A into  instead, we require that  shall be a orthogonal matrix:  Thus  is our similar transformation of A into B. We then transform B into C:  and so on, until the transform is eventually an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of A in its diagonal. It remains to explain how Qi is chosen. There are various possibilities; the most popular methods are those of Givens and Householder (6). Here we describe Givens' method; and as before, for simplicity of exposition, we choose n = 4. Let the matrix, pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form, be  Also, let  where . Then if we evaluate  as a chain, beginning by premultiplying A by the last of the three matrices in (4), and if also we take  then A is first replaced by a matrix in which the leading element of the infradiagonal vanishes. The top two rows of A are altered; in particular, 2 is replaced by . In the next multiplication we take  and then the second element in the infradiagonal vanishes. Finally, with A33 now altered to  we put  and complete the chain. The result is the upper triangular matrix R1. We now have to complete the similar transformation by postmultiplying by Q1; the result,  is again of upper Hessenberg form. We now repeat the cycle to obtain  and so on. As before, it is found that the infradiagonal elements become smaller at each step until the similar transform of A is ultimately upper triangular (or quasi-triangular if A has complex eigenvalues); i.e. a matrix T given by  The following point is important. In our treatment above, B is the product of a chain of seven matrices. When the multiplications are carried out in the order indicated, the upper Hessenberg form is maintained throughout, If, however, we begin by multiplying the central three matrices, the upper Hessenberg form is lost, with a accompanying loss of simplicity. It is now apparent why A must be pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form. Equation (4) employs one matrix for each nonzero element below the diagonal — three in this case; n — 1 in general. There are thus 2n — 2 multiplications in each iteration. But if A were fully populated, the number of multiplications would be n (n — 1). Example 1 The reader is invited to work through this example; we avoid repetitive labour by the use of hindsight. Consider the matrix defined in (2.7.6.12) and reduce it, as in (2.8.4.1), to upper Hessenberg form. The result is a new matrix  We now, with hindsight, use a shift of 0.2; i.e. we work with the matrix A — 0.2I. Shifts are always used to improve convergence: this particular shift requires only one step. The matrix is now  and after the six multiplications implied (see (4)) in  it becomes   Thus A — 0.2I has a zero eigenvalue; we recover B by adding 0.2I and can then deflate and consider the reduced matrix  Once again, to avoid repetitive labour in the example, we use hindsight: we now apply a shift of 0.4 and consider  We require only one step (four multiplications) to reduce this to  We now recover  by adding 0.4I and deflate by omission of the last row and column:  In any similar transform of  the trace and determinant are unaltered. The two eigenvalues of  are thus determined by  The required eigenvalues are thus 0.2 (bottom right-hand element of B), 0.4 (bottom right-hand element of ) and . The convergence properties of the QR algorithm are superior to those of LR, particularly when shifts are used and deflation is performed whenever possible. If complex eigenvalues exist,""double shifts' (see Wilkinson (6)) may be made and two QR steps performed simultaneously to give rapid convergence while all arithmetic is kept real. The QR method is thus very powerful and of quite general applicability; it is probably the most popular technique on modern main-frame computers for the evaluation of  eigenvalues of non-symmetric matrices. On the other hand, recovery of eigenvectors, though possible, is very difficult and often inaccurate, and some quite different routine (e.g. (2.6.4), when the eigenvalues have been found by QR) is recommended., 2.9 MATRIX PENCILS Our discussion of this toc is very limited, though we look again at the subject, also briefly, in 2.10. 2.9.1 Eigenvalues and vectors of matrix pencils Any lambda-matrix of the form C — B, which can in general be rectangular, *is described as a matrix pencil (see 1.15). If C is square, of order n, and non-singular, the pencil is described as regular, since in the polynomial equation obtained by expansion of  the coefficient  which does not vanish, so that there are n eigenvalues i which satisfy (1). It is clear that these eigenvalues belong also to the matrix . For each root i there will be at least one linear relation between the columns of the pencil, so that we may write  and  is an eigenvector of the pencil. The pencil is described as simple if there are n independent vectors  so that we may write the set compendiously as  where  is of simple diagonal form, even through it may include multiple roots. If, on the other hand, one or more auxiliary vectors are required, so that the spectral matrix takes the form , then the pencil is defective. In particular, a pencil is simple if B, C are real and symmetric and if C is pos. def. This proposition is proved in Corollary 1 of Theorem X of 1.22. However, it does not follow that if B, C are real and symmetric, the pencil is simple, or its roots real. The reader is invited to study the two pencils  Pencil (i) is real and symmetric; it has two equal eigenvalues  = 1 and the spectral matrix is of elementary Jordan block form; it is defective, with only the single eigenvector{ 2,1}. Pencil (ii) also has real, symmetric coefficients; but its eigenvalues are , with independent vectors{ 1,1 + 1}and {1,1 -i}. It is thus simple. In both (i) and (ii),  is negative, and so C is not pos. def. (see 1.22, Theorem X). If B, C are real and symmetric, and if in addition C is pos. def. then as in Theorem VIII of 1.22, the eigenvalues are real and finite and the eigenvectors real. We ow restrict our attention to simple pencils, where symmetric or not. In parallel with (2) we have the equation  and this leads to the counterpart of(3)  Postmultiply this by X and use (3); then  For simplicity, let us now suppose all roots i to be distinct. Then  permutes with a diagonal matrix and is therefore itself diagonal:  But (see (3)) is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix; we may thus write  and then from (5)  In the special case where B, C are symmetric, we may evidently identify Y with X. So much for the elementary properties of pencils. We turn ow to their numerical treatment. First, if we have a simple pencil C — B, we may premultiply it by C-1 to obtain I — A, A = C-1B; we may then obtain the eigenvalues and vectors of the pencil by applying any of the methods of 2.6–2.8 to A, and often this is the simplest procedure. However, cases can arise where this is not the best approach. For example, suppose C to be tridiagonal and B diagonal. Then C-1 is in general fully populated, and so would be C-1B; the simplicity of the pencil is thus lost in A. The same is true when C, B are sparse. We now give an example in which C, B are sparse and symmetric. The reader is invited to study this closely, since it illustrates more than the possible treatment of a pencil. Example 1 Consider the pencil  here C is tridiagonal and symmetric; B is diagonal. Also (though this is immaterial for our present purpose) both are centrosymmetric. The pencil thus has particular simplicity as it stands. We re required to find the eigenvalues i which satisfy , and the corresponding vectors. First, if we attempt this evaluating A = C-1B we find  Thus A is fully populated and is not symmetric (though, as it must, it remains centrosymmetric). We therefore return to the original form (8). A possible way of dealing with this is to use the location method (see 2.6.1). If we write  then  (since P is of order 4); we therefore require to assign three arbitrary values to  and then, by simple triangulation, evaluate  for each of these. Since the product of the roots is , we may choose  = 2, 1,— 1 as reasonable arbitrary values. Then we find, using a typical direct triangulation  while . Fortuitously, we have found one of the zeros of. Disregarding this for the moment, we write   and use the above values; we find  the solution of which is . Hence  or  To find the zeros of  () we may, for example, use the companion matrix (see 1.16), which, in this example, is  the eigenvalues of which are the zeros of (10). We may find these in the usual way by iteration: we repeatedly premultiply an arbitrary column, say , by M. Successive columns are then given by Table 1. We observe that, owing to the particular form of M, we need calculate only the top element of each column, in this table; the remaining elements are those of the previous column, one step down. In fact, we re only solving the regression formula   which is equivalent to the iteration with M; this is in effect Bernoulli's method of solution of  () = 0. To six places of decimals, we have now found 1 — 6.464102. Hence  on extraction of the first factor. If we set up a regression formula (or companion matrix) for the cubic, we find the next factor to be ( + 1), as we have already noted. In face  so that the eigenvalues are . We now look briefly at the eigenvectors. Typically  which is of course singular. We treat it by the method of Equation (2.6.4), using the first three rows, to obtain with x4 =1,  so that we find at once . In this way, with the eigenvalues in order of modulus, we find  A point of interest may be noted: the individual vectors are either centrosymmetric or centroskew, just as a symmetric structure has either symmetric or antisymmetric modes of vibration. We leave it to the reader to check that (see (3))   and also that  are diagonal. To complete this discussion, we may observe that the companion matrix, or its equivalent — the regression formula, may be used to find complex roots of a determinantal equation (see 1.7.6). For example, suppose we find  Then we may set up the regression formula  and if we begin with , we find for successive values of   The periodic change of sign, with no settled ratio, indicates complex roots. We therefore apply Equation (2.7.6.7) to the last 4 figures in sequences of 3 (we assume contributions from the other roots to be vanishingly small):  which give us . Hence (13) has the factor ; and we may write  so that all he factors of (13) are complex. 2.9.2 Deflation of a matrix pencil The eigenvalues and vectors of a simple pencil (not necessarily symmetric) will satisfy  Write these as  then  are evidently the eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalue i of C-1B. If we normalise them so that  then Sylvester expansion of C-1B (see 1.18) is  so that we may express B in terms of C, etc., as   Now suppose that we have found . Then we are able to evaluate, on the left-hand side,  and evidently a new pencil, which has all the eigenvalues and vectors of the original pencil except that 1 is replaced by 0, is  This is Lancaster's deflation formula. We may note two points:(i) since  has a zero root, must be singular,(ii) it is not necessary to normalise the vectors; we can write B1 generally as  Example 1 We use the pencil defined in (2.9.1.8) and we assume first that we have found an eigenvalue 1 = -1 and the associated eigenvector . Since the pencil is symmetric we shall have y = x. Now, using (2.9.1.8), we have  Hence, from (5) we find  which, with B defined as Diag(1,2,2,1) gives  This matrix is simply singular; indeed, as is indicated by (3), it is annihilated by postmultiplication by : in (3),  is orthogonal to , i = 2,3,…, n. Accordingly, the pencil P1( ); has a zero eigenvalue. The deflation can of course be repeated. If, using P1( ),; we now find an eigenvalue 2 = 0.6 and the associated eigenvector , then   and then we may calculate  which, with B1 given by (6), yields  By inspection, B2 is doubly degenerate; it is of course annihilated by postmultiplication by  or . A third deflation would produce B3, a unit rank matrix, which in this instance (n = 4) would be the last term in (3). 2.9.3 Iteration with submatrices of vectors We conclude this section with a description of a method often used in the following circumstances:(a) The problem is formulated as a matrix pencil; if it is of dynamical origin, we re given a non-singular symmetric stiffness matrix C of order n and a corresponding symmetric mass matrix B: the problem is to find certain modes and frequencies satisfying , x being proportional to exp (b) the order n is large, say  (c) Interest attaches only to a relatively small number, say , of consecutive frequencies and modes, beginning with the fundamental. The process is one of iteration with a submatrix of p vectors, where p is a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought, and involves the solution at each step of an eigenproblem of order p only. Since B, C derive from a mechanical system and are non-singular, they will be pos. def., and accordingly (see Theorem VIII of 1.22) the system eigenvalues are all real, finite and positive. if we write  then the full problem may be written  where X is the modal matrix,  the spectral matrix, and A = C-1B the dynamical matrix. It is assumed that the eigenvalues in  (and the corresponding eigenvectors in X) are so ordered that  has the eigenvalues   in descending order of magnitude down the diagonal, so that 1 and the first vector in X define the fundamental frequency and mode. We are not concerned to solve (1) as a whole. If it is partitioned in the form  where Y is of order (n × p) and  square, of order p,(2) gives  and only the first of these equations concerns us. However, we may note that (see 1.19) premultiplication by  of the first equation in (1), and transposition, shows that  are both diagonal. For analytical purposes we may normalise X so that  which imply, inter alia,  Having set out some preliminary considerations, we now state the method. Select a set of starting vectors Yo, arbitrary except that they must be linearly independent; then evaluate the (n × p) matrix  and use Wo to form the two square matrices of order p  Now solve the eigenproblem (any suitable method from this chapter may be used)  for its modal matrix Mo; the spectral matrix Ao which emerges is (see below) a first approximation to Ay. Then an improved approximation to Y is  where do is an arbitrary non-singular diagonal matrix which may, for example, be used to make a homologous element in each of the corresponding columns of Y1 and Yo the same; do is useful, but not essential. This completes one step. The next step uses Y1 in (6) to give W1 = AY1, and the cycle of operations is repeated until convergence occurs. We may note some interesting aspects of the method. (i) If Yo consists of one vector only, so does Wo, and then  are scalars, s is the modal matrix . If we choose  in (9) then  and this is the single vector iteration discussed in 2.7.1. Moreover, the trivial  eigenproblem gives a first approximation to 1 as the Rayleigh quotient. (ii) If Yo happens to be the correct set Y, the method makes this apparent at once, for then in view of (3)  so that , on use of (5)  Thus both matrices are diagonal, so that the eigenproblem is again trivial, having the solution . Then  when scaled appropriately, repeats  showing that both equal Y. (iii) If Yo happens to be a set of linear combinations of the vectors in Y, the correct solution is obtained in one step. For we may then write  where P is a square matrix of order p, non-singular since the columns of Yo and of Y, separately, are linearly independent. Then  in view of(3). Thus, on use of (5),  On premultiplication by , the eigenproblem (8) reduces to  which has the solution  If do is chosen as  The condition envisaged in (iii) is, in general, unlikely, unless for example a neighbour system (see Chapter 3) supplies a good approximation to Y. In most cases, we must write  where R, like Yo, is of order (n × p). In this general case  in view of(1). Then the eigenproblem matrices become  where (4) has been used. We therefore have to solve for   Knowing Mo, we now use (11) to evaluate   whence in turn we find  Since  is non-singular, we may reduce the eigenproblem based on W1 to  which we solve for the unknown . A third step leads to  It is clear from (13),(16) and (17) that after r steps we have to solve  If  is written as M,(18) in partitioned form is (see (10))  or, on expansion,  Now, since all the eigenvalues in  are greater than any of those in , when r is sufficiently large the terms in  become negligible compared with those in , when (19) reduces to  and if s is on-singular, this in turn reduces to  which has the solution . This shows that convergence is complete. Two things must be noted here. First, although when r is large, in an overall sense the terms in  those in , yet the smallest element in  is not necessarily much larger than the largest element in . As a result calculation of the last two or three eigenvalues in  may not be very accurate. It is for this reason that we choose p to be a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought. Second, reduction of the eigenproblem to (20) requires s to be non-singular. Now R has p linearly independent columns, and therefore also p linearly independent rows. Thus s can be non-singular; but it is not necessarily so, and then Y as given by the method may be deficient. For example, if the top row of s were null, the first vector in X (the fundamental mode) would be absent in the make-up of Yo, and this absence would persist. There is no certain way of avoiding this difficulty when Yo is chosen arbitrarily; but in practice it does not often arise. Although the eigenproblem to be solved at each step is vastly less time-consuming and expensive than direct methods applied to the full system, yet it does take much time. However, after a few steps v, and  usually become heavily diagonal, so that Mr tends towards I; this occurs before the vectors Yr have converged. In these circumstances, use of the Collar-Jahn method, described in Chapter 3; may greatly expedite the solution. An example of this is given in 3.9. Further reference to the method is also made in 8.5. Example 1 The small-order example which is all we can give here does not of course do justice to the method, but at least shows how it works. We begin with an illustration of the situation in (iii) above; the reader is invited to check the arithmetic. Let  Then  Suppose now we are given, or choose,  It then follows that  The eigenvalues of  are thus 10 and 5 and   The reader should check that these are eigenvectors of A and that they correspond to eigenvalues 10 and 5. We have thus obtained our solution, in this case, in one step. It will be found that each column of  is in fact, a linear combination of the columns of  Example 2 We use the same A, B, C, as in Example 1, but select as our starting vector submatrix  In choosing Yo we have selected simple vectors which are clearly linearly independent, and which between them bring all elements in A into operation in the formation of Wo. We then find  where the product is quoted to four significant figures. Its eigenvalues are 9.805, 2.411 and, very approximately (great accuracy is not necessary),  which yields, again approximately,  Proceeding in this way, we find at the end of the fifth step  and in the sixth step this gives   These are so nearly diagonal that the eigenproblem is trivial; the eigenvalues are 10, 4.9987. However, we do not obtain convergence until after the 10th step, which gives eigenvalues 10, 5 and  The second columns should be{ 1,1,0, -1}. 2.9.4 A variant We now give a variant of the method of 2.9.3; we do so partly because the variant can save computer time, especially if may iterations are required, but also because it enables us simply to bring out certain features of the method, which lead to possible modifications. For simplicity, we assume that the eigenvalues sought are all different. We are given the matrices C and B, both symmetric an pos. def. We may therefore use Choleski's method (see 2.4.2) to find a lower triangular matrix L such that , and may then evaluate , accordingly the equation  may be written  and S is symmetric and pos. def. Now, instead of using the three matrices C, B and A = C-1B as in 2.9.3 we work only with S. Suppose we now proceed as in 2.9.3: we begin with the submatrix Yo and successively evaluate  and we then solve for Mo the eigenproblem  Then a new approximation to Y is   At this point we may ask: what is the purpose of eigenproblem? The answer appears if we premultiply and postmultiply Equation (5) by appropriate quantities to give since do permutes with ,  on use of (6). Transposition of (7) shows (compare 1.19) that  permutes with  and is therefore diagonal, as is . The columns of  are thus mutually orthogonal; this is the purpose of evaluating Mo: its use orthogonalises the columns, an our ultimate objective is the orthogonal set Y. A second step with Yo in (2) replaced by Y1, leads to the eigenproblem (compare (5))  Again we may pause and observe that (8) gives us  directly; we do not need to find Mo first from (5) and then M1 from (8). Thus the step (5) is unnecessary. Then, in its turn, the step (8) is unnecessary; and so on. Indeed, in theory all that is required is that a sufficient number of direct iterations is made, with the columns orthogonalised as the last step; in practice, however, the numbers would become increasingly ill-conditioned as S is raised to a high power and approximates to a unit rank matrix. However, it is probably sufficient if the columns are orthogonalised at, say, every fourth iteration. If we do this, the procedure is as follows. Begin with Yo and evaluate successively . At this stage, evaluate  and solve the eigenproblem  for M. Then a new approximation, which has mutually orthogonal columns, is , with which in place of Yo the cycle is repeated, and so on. Example 1 We use the same matrices B and C as in Example 2.9.3.1. then, if , , we find, to four decimal places,    As our starting matrix we choose  This has mutually orthogonal columns; however, as we shall see later, it is not a good initial choice for the first column. We ow form , at each stage making the ""11"" and ""22"" elements unity. We find  we require  as it stands. We now form v,  as in (9),(10), and solve (11) for M. To sufficient accuracy, we find  and then a new Yo is, with d chosen appropriately,  and it may be checked that these two columns are, sufficiently nearly, orthogonal. We now repeat the cycle. This time we find   and  and again, sufficiently nearly, the columns are orthogonal. A third cycle leads to the eigenvectors (and eigenvalues) of S:  We leave it to the reader to establish that the eigenvectors of the original system, given by premultiplication of w by  may be written  2.10 IMPROVEMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS It frequently happens, both in dynamical problems and in other eigenvalue problems that we have approximate values for one or more eigenvalues (and perhaps vectors) and require to obtain more exact values. This problem, from another viewpoint, is discussed more fully in Chapter 3. Here we shall deal only with some simple cases. 2.10.1 Problem formulated as a matrix pencil For simplicity, let us first discuss the undamped oscillations of a mechanical system having n degrees of freedom, the equations of motion of which have been derived by Lagrangian methods from energy considerations; they will appear, in the usual notation of dynamics, as  Here x is the column of coordinates; in what follows, we assume the last element x to be non-nodal (if it is not, it can be made so by rewriting the equations in a different order). Also C, the inertia matrix, will be symmetric and pos. def. and B, the stiffness matrix, also symmetric and non-neg. def; finally, F is a column of applied forcing functions. In simple harmonic motion, these forces, and x, will be proportional to exp  and if we then write  for{ go}2,(1) reduces to the usual formula  . We observe that, in addition to the given matrices C and B,(2) contains 2n + 1 other quantities, viz. λ, x, and F. Since we have n equations, we can determine any n of these quantities in terms of the remaining n + 1, to which we can ascribe arbitrary values. Here, we shall (a) choose λ as an independent variable; (b) prescribe the value unity for ; (c) prescribe the value zero for each of the first n -1 functions in F, the last being written f. Then f and the coordinates  become functions of λ, and we note that when f vanishes (i.e. all the functions F vanish in (2)), λ will be an eigenvalue and  the corresponding eigenvector. We not write, in partitioned form, , , and, since the pencil in (2) is symmetric, , where  is a square submatrix of K of order n = 1. Then (2) becomes , which yields, progressively, , . Since the submatrices in (5) are all functions of λ,(7) and (8) give f and ξ (or x) as functions of λ. Now suppose we have an approximation  to an eigenvalue. Since f is a function of λ which vanishes at the eigenvalues, we may use it in the Newton-Raphson method to obtain an improved approximation : , the zero suffixes indicating that the functions are calculated for . Equation (8) is not suitable for differentiation; instead, we obtain another form for f by premultiplying (6) by ; we obtain , and since K is symmetric it follows that , which, with K given by (5), reduces to . In a numerical calculation, we use (11) for  and either (8) or (10) for f. If we use the latter, we must note that, at , , when Equation (9) reduces to , i.e. the well-known Rayleigh quotient. In the numerical evaluation of this, we obtain x from (7) with . Having obtained  we can adopt it as a new  and repeat the cycle of approximation, which is known to be quadratically convergent: i.e. if  is the true eigenvalue, then for small differences . Equation (9), with  given by (8), is analytically precisely equivalent to (12). In numerical applications, they may differ, depending on the accuracy with which  and ξ are evaluated. Probably (12) is the user to use. Example 1 In Equation (1), let . Suppose we are given an approximate eigenvalue . We evaluate  , which we have partitioned as in (5). Then ξ is given by (7) as , and the reader may check that this yields . We give this to four decimal places only: it is not necessary to calculate ξ to great accuracy, but once found, it must be used consistently, and calculations made accurately. We deduce that for , the approximate eigenvector is , and we are able to calculate , , whence . If we round this off to a new , we quickly find that  also, i.e. 40 is an exact eigenvalue; also the corresponding eigenvector becomes  . If, instead of the Rayleigh quotient, we use (9) directly, we require from (8) . Hence (see also (16)) , in close agreement with (16). Problem formulated in terms of a single matrix If we premultiply (2.10.1.2) by  and write , we obtain the problem in terms of the characteristic matrix of A: . Note that here A is, in general, not symmetric; however, it evidently possesses the same eigenvalues as the system (2.10.1.2). Let us now abandon the connection with a mechanical system, and treat this as a problem involving any given real matrix A, the eigenvalues and vectors for which have to be found. The treatment is closely similar to that of §2.10.1. As before, we choose λ as an independent variable, assign the value unity to  and zeros to the first n -1 elements of G: ; we also write, remembering that A is not symmetric, . Then Equation (2) gives us , from which we obtain as before , . We now look for the left vector  corresponding to x as the right vector; in §2.10.1 this was : here it is different. In place of(2) we write ; by the same argument as before, we set , , hence from (4),(9) and (10) , yielding , , and on comparison of (12) with (7) we see that h and g are identical; this is not surprising, since they are evidently similar functions and have the same zeros, i.e. the eigenvalues. As before, we now employ g in a Newton-Raphson application to improve the accuracy of any given approximate eigenvalue . Premultiplication of (5) by  gives , and then, differentiating term by term, we have , which in view of(4) reduces to . Accordingly, as before . This is the parallel to (2.10.1.12); as before, we can, if we wish, use g as given by (7) for alternative treatment, but we shall not pursue this here. Example 1 In (2), let . This matrix is, in fact, obtained from our previous example by evaluating . However, we shall treat a different eigenvalue: suppose we are told that there is an eigenvalue in the neighbourhood of . We evaluate and partition . Then we find at once from (6) and (11) that , , and hence, from (15), . If we round this off to a new , and repeat the calculation — we leave it to the reader to check this — we find ; finally, rounding this off to 20 and repeating again, we find that 20 is an exact eigenvalue and that the corresponding right and left eigenvectors are, respectively, , . 2.10.3 Factorisation of A into two symmetric matrices In Equation (2.10.2.1) we derived A as the product of two given symmetric matrices,  and B; this was done for convenience in the examples. For completeness, we interpolate here a brief discussion of the reverse procedure: it was shown in §1.19 and Theorem V of §1.22 that a matrix can always be factorised into two symmetric matrices, but the subject was not pursued there. Here we obtain the most general solution. We first continue the discussion of §1.19, and treat the most common case in which A has distinct eigenvalues. It was shown there that A permutes with , which is therefore diagonal. This diagonal matrix, D, is arbitrary, since X is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix. Write where P, Q, R,…are arbitrary. Now if (see §1.18) we write , C may now be expressed as , so that C is expressible as an arbitrary linear sum of the n symmetric unit rank matrices . Next consider the case where A has two equal eigenvalues α, but is not defective. Then A can be written with the (2 × 2) scalar submatrix αI in the leading diagonal position. This means that D is not necessarily diagonal; corresponding to αI there may be a (2 × 2) block which is arbitrary except that it must be symmetric and non-singular. This therefore contains three arbitrary quantities, giving n + 1 in all. Finally, suppose A has two equal eigenvalues α but is defective. As previously, we note that   since  is symmetric. Accordingly  with K as defined in Theorem V of §1.22. Thus  permutes with . This implies that  is diagonal except for the leading (2 × 2) submatrix. Now the following submatrices permute (see also §1.21) , , where a, b are arbitrary. The second of these is thus the leading submatrix of , whence in  it is , which is symmetric and contains just two arbitrary quantities; there are thus just n arbitrary quantities in all. Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult. However, these studies employ the modal and spectral matrices, and in practice these may not be known. We can, however, find directly the general solution of . Write , so that C contains n (n + 1) /2 unknown elements, n in the diagonal, viz. p, q, r,…, and n (n -1) /2 elsewhere, viz. a, b, c…. Now the conditions that B is symmetric provide just n (n -1) /2 linear algebraic equations connecting the unknowns, so that we can determine a, b, c,…in terms of p, q, r…which are arbitrary. The procedure is best illustrated by means of a numerical example: we choose A to be the matrix of (2.10.2.16). Then . Then the condition that , for example, leads to , and there are five other such equations. We set them out thus:  These are then solved, e.g. by direct operation on rows, when a, b, c,…emerge as quantities linear in p, q, r, s. To set out the result compactly, we write , where …have zero diagonals except for a unit in the first, second,…place respectively. In this example, we can write , where to keep the elements numerically simple, we have extracted the factor 1/3 from  and . This is evidently the most general form of C. Postmultiplication by A yields B in the form  . When p, q, r, s are assigned numerically, C and B are known and then the factors  and B of A are found. We can recover the matrix C (and also B) defined in (2.10.1.13) by assigning to p, q, r, s the values 1, 1.52, 3, 0.92 appearing in the diagonal of C. The following characteristics of , , etc. are to be noted. First, since each contains zeros in its diagonal, it cannot be pos. def. Next, the ranks of the matrices do not conform to any simple pattern:  is of rank 4,  and  of rank 3 and  of rank 2. Finally, in relation to our main problem, since for the Rayleigh quotient (which gives eigenvalues identical to those of A) , and since also p, q, r, s are arbitrary, it follows that , i = 1,2,3,4, though this result is not particularly helpful in practice. 2.10.4 Another method for improvement of eigenvalues We discuss here the same problem as that in §2.10.2, but vary the treatment. The eigenvalues are determined by Equation (2.10.2.5) with g = 0, viz. , where α is the submatrix of A corresponding to , and  is the last diagonal element in A. From this we find , , and elimination of ξ leads to the equation for λ  . This equation is not easy to solve numerically as it stands; however, if we are given an approximation  to an eigenvalue, we write  for the exact eigenvalue, which therefore satisfies (4), so that we obtain , which is now an equation for ε Write  then . Thus , provided ε is sufficiently small. Insertion in (5) leads to , or, if , , , etc., . Finally, if  is written , we obtain the scalar equation . Provided the series converges, this may be solved for ε in any suitable way; often a regression procedure, beginning with ε = 0 on the right-hand side to give a new approximation on the left, will solve the equation in two or three steps. Comparison of (8) with (3) shows that, when ε has been found from (9) , so that both eigenvalue and vector are found. Example 1 Once again, we use the matrix specified in Equation (2.10.2.16) and we are given that it has an eigenvalue near . Then, in (6), with n=4, . Also, ; ; ;. Hence, using (7), we obtain , , , , , and it is in fact unnecessary to proceed further. We now evaluate the scalars ; they become , , , , . Hence Equation (9), for ε, becomes , and if we collect the linear terms and rationalise:  and solution of this, by regression or otherwise, gives ; . Also, using (10) with , we find  or ."
ACA ACA-FPG-003 8.08 "FILE ORGANIZATION FOR MULTIPLE-KEY PROCESSING 8.1 Introduction Much of data processing involves retrieving records that refer to a given customer, stock item or member of staff. In each of these cases a single key is all that is required to reference the record. However, in retrieving documents from a database holding the contents of a library, or when a request is based on meeting several different criteria, the situation is quite different. There are no longer any single ‘keys’ that uniquely define the document or documents wanted by the user. Generally, a combination of words or phrases is used as descriptors that can be combined to select the desired record. For example, a business in the United States may wish to assign an engineer to work in Japan for some months. The personnel file might be examined to list all the employees who meet the following criteria: Speaks Japanese AND Graduate Engineer AND Single The personnel department would make the final choice, from the list produced by this enquiry. If the resulting list were too large, further descriptors could be added to reduce it. If it were too small, the ‘single’ restriction might be removed; if the whole family also needed to be sent to Japan this would add to the assignment costs, which might be an acceptable price to pay in order to send the right person. Multiple-key applications present different problems from those associated with the single-key files discussed so far. For smaller files, magnetic tape is the obvious storage medium — an example is the International Food Information Service described by Larbey. Small files that demand multiple-key handling are usually stored on magnetic tape and processed sequentially. A file arranged as in Fig. 8.1 has considerable advantages for the retrieval of records that meet some request based on a number of separate criteria which are often called record attributes or descriptors . Each record (such as a title, a summary or a full text) is characterized by the descriptors D1, D2, etc. Records 1 and 2 have a common descriptor D3, records 2 and 3 share D6, while records 1 and 3 have D1 in common. Record 4 has no shared descriptors with the other three records, although it may have with later records. The file organization techniques used for multiple-key processing are discussed in this chapter, but chained and tree structures used in database systems are not. 8.2 File types Two main file types are used in multiple-key retrieval. These are serial, which was described briefly above, and inverted. There are variations of each technique, and they are considered below. Serial files The straightforward method of handling the examination of multiple keys is to hold all the keys in the record, as in Fig. 8.1. A further example of this is shown in Table 8.1; each personnel record holds a number of fields, any one of which may be used as a key. A specific request might require a count of all the grade 2 employees in the systems department. This could be answered by scanning the whole file record by record, examining each to see whether it met the specified requirements. After all the records have been scanned a list of two names — Mason and Vince — would be provided. In the case of a personnel file, the list is likely to be sorted into an order that depends on some major key — in this case, usually alphabetic order or personnel number. If the file were made up of documents, books or papers the overall classification would probably be based on subject, and the order within subject might well be accession date. In these library databases the major key is often an accession number. In either case, the order does not affect the amount of searching to be done and in this sense the file is serial, although it will probably be in sequential order with respect to the major key. This type of file has to be scanned completely before a single query can be answered. Each record is examined in turn, and its descriptors are compared with those of the search request (which might be like that for a graduate engineer with other attributes shown above). Because only one record is examined at a time, it is possible to test the descriptors against very complex Boolean conditions, expressed in terms of the descriptors desired by the user, to obtain a match. The work areas required in main storage are relatively small as only one record is being examined at any one time. However, as the data file increases in size, the time taken to search through   the data increases in proportion. At between 20 000 and 60 000 records, the search time becomes so slow that it no longer allows a reasonable number of requests to be handled in a working day. The point at which this happens depends on a number of factors such as complexity of requests in terms of Boolean conditions, speed of access of the medium in use, and size of data file. A number of steps can be taken to speed up processing, each depending on some different method of handling the search. The first of these is the bit-pattern index, in which all the alternative descriptors for each record are given values of 1 if the attribute is present and 0 if it is not. The data in Table 8.1 has been organized into bit-pattern format in Table 8.2. In cases such as that of a personnel file, for which the number of attributes is relatively low and the same for each record, a bit-pattern index can be a compact way of storing information about the file. However, it is not very useful for a bibliographic file in which there may be thousands of potential attributes for each record, only a very few of which are non-zero. The storage of this sort of data causes the difficulty that the compact format is counterbalanced by the redundant information. Bit-pattern indexes will be examined in more detail later; however, in some circumstances a more rapid reference technique than that provided by a serial file is required. For this purpose, inverted files have been developed. Inverted files When records are to be selected on the basis of the state of one or more attributes, a serial search concentrates on the records , examining each in turn to see if it meets the specified conditions of the search. In fact, what is known from these specified conditions is the attributes required. A search of the records having a given attribute, to see which of them also has a second, third,…etc. in the required list, will eliminate all the records that are not wanted. This is achieved by inverting the file, i.e. by providing lists of records or record references possessing each one of the various attributes in turn. The resulting set of lists — which are, in effect, indexes — is shown in Fig. 8.2 for the same records in a data file that have already been shown in Fig.8.1. A further example is shown in Table 8.3, which is an inverted version of the data set out in Tables 8.1 and 8.2. Given that a male in the operations department is required who is able to speak Italian, the male list is scanned first. This provides seven records. When the operations condition is added, only records 94 and 122 meet the double condition. Adding the need to speak Italian eliminates record 94, leaving only a single employee from this small part of the personnel file, with personnel number 122, who meets all the three conditions. A file in which all the attributes are inverted, i.e. have indexes provided so that a direct search can be made on any attribute, is known as fully inverted . A file in which only a number of selected attributes have indexes provided is known as partially inverted . In the case of a fully inverted file the designer has the option of holding very little information in the master file itself, and assembling records from their constituent parts as they are referenced. In practice many designers prefer to hold the complete record in the master file, as this avoids the problem of assembling information about attributes possessed by the record but not specifically referenced in the request. To take the example of record 122, grade and branch were not included in the request for a male from operations department who can speak Italian. This information would not be automatically collected from the request, but is essential in order to  describe the person fully, and the retrieval process has to ensure that it is provided. A master file record in a partially inverted file will always be required to hold at least the data on fields that are not inverted. The most usual arrangement is to have inverted lists of each descriptor, with a list of the major record keys and addresses or, if each record has a separate address, addresses only, for each of the records to which that descriptor applies. The master file contains the complete record. Keeping the index record size down is helpful because if the inverted indexes are small they can be held in main storage, and so cut search times down to a minimum. Inverted files should not be confused with the alternate indexes available in many indexed file systems such as VSAM or ICL's 2900 series equivalent. Each such index can be used to give limited partial inversion, i.e. of one descriptor at a time, but they are generally provided and employed to allow the file to be accessed in ways other than by the major key, rather than to carry out an elimination of master file records not meeting some search criterion. An example would be to use department code as an alternate key to provide personnel listings by department from a personnel file arranged in some other order, such as alphabetic. When an inverted organization is employed, a number of limitations may follow. First, the file may not be able to support such complicated search conditions as a serial file, because the size of work area required to process a request is now much larger; instead of dealing with one record at a time, the system now deals with all relevant records at once. This speeds request handling but greatly increases the work area size needed, particularly if a very widely used descriptor is the first to be cited in the retrieval request. Second, addition of records to the file is no longer a matter of adding to the end of the file. Each descriptor record throughout the file that applies to this new record has to be updated, so the process is relatively slow. Third, the space requirements for such a file are considerably greater than those for a serial file. Spiegel and Miller investigated IBM's STAIRS/AQUARIUS system (Storage and Information Retrieval System/A Query and Retrieval Interactive Utility System). The system uses four main files: a dictionary, a text data set, a text index data set, and an inverted file of all descriptors used in the database. These files are indexed by the use of BDAM (Basic Direct Access Method) and in a typical database of just over 2 Gbytes, which they found was the average size of those they examined, the number of characters in the files comprising the database was as follows: TEXT 864 000 000 TEXT INDEX 83 000 000 INVERTED 781 000 000 DICTIONARY 442 000 000 It is clear that the basic text file has been increased by around 150 per cent in order to provide the retrieval capabilities offered by the package. This is  typical, and should he borne in mind before abandoning single-key reference, which usually involves an overhead of only 5 — 20 per cent in providing the facilities offered by indexed sequential or direct organizations. The system described by Spiegel and Miller could handle up to one thousand queries per hour, but many of them were relatively straightforward. Larbey described a tape-based system in which the text file contained a maximum of 1400 items, each of 4300 characters or less — six megabytes at most. This system provided SDI (Selective Dissemination of Information) on current data only to eighty scientists who used a set of thirty-eight separate query profiles. Each profile was made up of a combination of descriptors and Boolean conditions, and averaged twenty-six distinct search terms. Production of the complete SDI output took 12 minutes, or just under 200 queries an hour. A further file storage technique is sometimes useful in handling information retrieval applications. This is the multilist . Multilist files In this type of file there are the same sets of indexes as are required for an inverted file. However, in this case only the first reference to any descriptor appears in an index, while all further linkages are made from record to record (rather as in a chain of synonyms in a direct file). The arrangement of the same data that has been shown in Figs. 8.1 and 8.2, but now held as a multilist, is shown in Fig. 8.3. Cardenas compared inverted files with multilists, showing that their space requirements are usually very similar, and that the speed of access provided by each file organization is dependent on the structure of the data. In particular, multilists provide rapid access when the file has many different descriptors that apply to only a few records, as in this case each chain will be short. Cardenas also commented that ‘…the manner in which secondary indexes or dictionaries and associated lists are managed, may have under-estimated impacts.’ Much of this book is aimed at ensuring that file designers know how to minimize the impact of such indexes or dictionaries on space used and time wasted in file processing. McDonell provided a useful analysis of what is involved in addition, deletion or modification of records, so far as the maintenance and use of associative key lists is concerned; he defined an associative key list as ‘a list for each indexed key which joins together all the main file records containing that key’. He also compared multilists with inverted files, and showed that inverted files have an advantage when the indexes have to be altered frequently. As the performance of the two is relatively similar and inverted files are more widely used in their own right, most of this chapter deals with serial and inverted files. 8.3 Record reference For small numbers of records, serial files have significant advantages. The first is that, because each record is dealt with singly, the main storage work area space requirements are very low. This allows relatively complex Boolean conditions to be built up and tested, such as: in the programming department AND able to speak French BUT NOT if in grade 3 UNLESS from North branch. In the example in Table 8. 1 the only person corresponding to this request is Duncan. In this case the BUT NOT condition was not fulfilled, but would in any case have been overridden by the UNLESS. This example is not in itself very complex. However, it indicates how very complicated multiple conditions can be built up in the creation of user profiles for information retrieval systems. This is because in searching a very large library collection it is essential to attempt to ensure that the user gets just those references that are required. A profile that provides far too many irrelevant references is of little use; such lists normally find their way into a wastepaper basket because the user sees that they are full of irrelevant material and is not prepared to search through them hoping to find some relevant references. On the other hand a profile that fails to provide the user with required material is equally useless, however brief it may be. This second problem is more dangerous than the first because the user may not realize that information is missing. Information retrieval systems include the concepts of relevance — the proportion of retrieved material that is relevant — and recall — the  proportion of relevant material that is retrieved. These are dealt with in some detail elsewhere, but the reader who wishes to study the matter in depth should consult specialist references. As the numbers of records increase, the problem of waiting for a reply to a query until the whole of a serial file has been searched increases in proportion, and eventually this delay becomes unacceptable. As mentioned earlier, one possible answer is to use a bit-pattern index of the sort shown in Table 8.2. When the number of attributes is low, this allows very economical storage of the data about a particular record. A single bit represents each possible attribute. If it is set to one, the record in question has this attribute. If it is set to zero, the record does not. Searching such an index is very rapid. For simple cases an equal compare is all that is needed. However, this means that every attribute has to be specified. In an earlier example it was shown that a large proportion of requests only require some attributes to be present or absent. In these cases a Boolean AND condition can be set up. For instance, a request for a male in operations department who can speak Italian can be tested by comparing each of the bit-pattern index entries in Table 8.3 against a mask of: The Boolean condition will be an AND, which will only return a true indication if all these bits are on. A bit-pattern index can extend the use of serial files when the number of attributes is limited, but a break-even point will occur somewhere between 20 000 and 100000 records, depending on record size, number of possible attributes and the complexity of Boolean conditions required. In bibliographic applications the number of possible attributes may be many thousands. In this case the only possible solution when retrieval times become too long is to turn to an inverted file or a multilist. An inverted file is the usual choice, but when there are many attributes, each of which is used by relatively few records, it will be worth considering multilist files. It was pointed out earlier that one difficulty in using inverted files is the need to deal with all the records possessing a given attribute at the same time, so that a great deal of working space is required in main storage. This is reduced if there are many possible attributes because each attribute index list will tend to be shorter. Thus, the more suitable the application is for bit-pattern index handling (small numbers of possible attributes), the less suitable it is for inverted file handling. The number of nested Boolean conditions that can be handled by an inverted file is generally less than the number a serial file can handle. In addition, the conditions OUT OF , specifying any n conditions out of a larger  number, and BETWEEN. setting upper and lower limits to the value of an attribute, are difficult to achieve. These conditions can be very useful in setting up a user search profile, which is one reason that information retrieval systems often use a serial file for new accessions, which are matched against user profiles intended to inform users of the latest accessions in their subject field. This is linked to a complete file of the bibliographic collection held in inverted form. All the records in the serial file are transferred to the inverted file at intervals, generally when the size of the serial file is beginning to make reference to it relatively slow. The reasons for keeping down the number of updates to an inverted file are discussed below, and the form of a dual serial-inverted file system is shown in Fig. 8.4. Such a system has been discussed further by the author. 8.4 Additions and alterations Serial files can handle additions without difficulty. In very simple cases the new record is added to the end of the file. Even if the master file is held in a sorted order there will be no particular difficulty, as these files are usually stored on magnetic tapes. All that is required is to create a new file, although this can be time-consuming. Inverted files require quite different treatment. Ideally, the indexes should be held in main storage. They will certainly need to be on a direct access device. Addition of a new record will mean that a number of indexes  will have to be updated, one for each attribute possessed by the new record. Thus, even if space is left within and at the end of each index, updating will involve the shifting and shuffling of a number of records or the use of pointers and links to the new records. The contrast between these two is a further reason for the popularity of dual systems. It is easier to handle the file in serial form until sufficient new records are available to justify the time and effort involved in an update of the inverted file. 8.5 Storage requirements Serial files can be held in one coherent file. This is very convenient for the user as it requires the minimum of handling. An inverted file, however, has to be held in a number of related indexes, and is thus far more ‘bitty’. In , the typical overhead of indexes and related files leads to a final size of about two and a half times the size of the corresponding serial file. However, there can very occasionally be a space-saving in the use of an inverted file as is shown in the discussion below, due to Revell. Suppose a file contains N fixed-length records and each record is comprised of a key of k characters and n data items of average size a characters. If this file is fully inverted, the resultant file will contain as many records as there are unique descriptor values — say V. The inverted file will be made up of variable-length records. For each descriptor value, the rest of the record will be a list of the keys of the original file records which possess that specific value. If the average number of keys in the inverted file records is A then: since the total number of terms in both the original and inverted files must be equal. The size of the original file is: and the size of the inverted file is: It is therefore advantageous, purely from a size point of view, to use an inverted file when: or   For applications of size such that equation (8 1) approximates to: Additionally, if n is large the expression simplifies further to: Thus, the decision as to whether a file takes up more space in serial or inverted form depends on the ratio of the size of the key and the data items. Note that this is of limited use as it implies that the data is held only in the index or in the main file. The more usual arrangement is that the inverted indexes are an addition to the main file, as explained earlier. For this reason it is not often possible to achieve a reduction in space requirement by using an inverted file. Conclusion Serial or inverted files specifically designed for the retrieval of records on the basis of the values of multiple keys are a useful tool for the file designer. Generally the file itself, and the associated processing programs, will have to be written by the user if high standards of optimization are required. However, the alternate index facility of VSAM and similar software can sometimes be used to build the indexes required. Salton has reviewed the methods of handling information retrieval, while a number of authors have described specific techniques that offer advantages in particular situations. Ramamohanarao et al . described a mixed hashing/descriptor-based method of retrieval; Nievergelt et al . presented a ‘grid’ file that performs particularly well when the number of search attributes is ten or less, and offers a high data storage utilization, good growth characteristics and efficient processing of range queries; Stanfill and Kahle explain the principles of a parallel free-text search on a particular parallel computer, and claim a retrieval speed of 2 — 3 minutes for Boolean queries of 25 and 20000 terms respectively when the database in question takes up 15 Gbytes of storage space. Their method of searching does not depend on pre-determined descriptors. Many database systems use the inverted technique, and the convenience of having the software provided by such systems will often outweigh its relative inefficiency. ‘Tuning’ of the database software may also be possible  using manufacturer-supplied options to achieve results more in line with those attainable by programs written in-house. In order to obtain optimum results, however, there is no substitute for a carefully user-designed and written system.

ACA ACA-J18-002 9.14 "CHAPTER SEVEN SPECIES RICHNESS Not only trees but almost all groups of animals and plants exhibit their greatest variety in the tropics in terms of the number of species recorded there. How is it that the tropics generate, or at least harbour, so many species and how is it that these can coexist? The answer to the first question involves an analysis of speciation, which in turn leads to a consideration of the ecological conditions under which such speciation might have taken place, and the answer to the second also involves an analysis of the physical and biotic influences on the organisms concerned. A prerequisite of speciation is variation, and if the variation patterns within species are examined, some ideas of the possible modes of incipient speciation may be gained. As was explained in Chapter 5, some tropical tree species seem to be very homogeneous in their morphology over wide ranges, even including populations widely separated from others with little possibility for gene exchange. Examples of this are species now in populations in southern India and far away in Malesia, like the yam ally Trichopus zeylanicus (Dioscoreaceae). Other species seem to be separable into geographical races based on their morphological features. These are usually given subspecific rank. The segregation may be more precisely ecological than geographical in (say) forest and savanna races of trees in Africa. Yet other species exhibit variation patterns that defy analysis of the sophistication of present-day biology. Such are the ochlospecies of White, a term coined to convey the annoyance such species cause taxonomists, and including some of the ebonies (Diospyros spp., Ebenaceae) of Africa. Although there is much to be said in favour of the notion of evolution by discrete jumps in plants, particularly through allopolyploidy involving small numbers of individuals, current orthodoxy holds that the greater part of speciation events occurs through the isolation of fragments of an initial population, the change of these fragments in response to the conditions in their isolation and, with the breakdown of isolation, the co-existence of the newly speciated populations in one locality. Clearly, many partially speciated populations will come together and then merge once more. The ochlospecies is not readily explained, however, while apomixis is another phenomenon to be taken into account. It occurs in several dipterocarps (see later) and also some Garcinia spp. (Guttiferae) in the understorey of Malesian forests: these set seed without pseudogamy. Already we have seen microspeciation occurring in trees in Trinidad and Tobago (section 6.2.6), but it has also been suggested that in crossing major faunal boundaries, plant species may undergo so-called ‘cryptic’ speciation with major differences in fruit sizes and so on, associated with different dispersers; i.e. obscured rather than obscure in that herbarium material is rarely preserved with fully ripe fruits and complete field notes. Of course, such examples may represent changes undergone since the arrival of different faunas rather than the arrival of plants in different faunal regions. In view of the conclusions of the last chapter, it is likely that such patterns will be archaic and also confused by local fluctuations in dispersal agents and this may be exacerbated in regions of geological instability, e.g. New Guinea with confusing variation patterns as in the tree Chisocheton lasiocarpus (Meliaceae) and the herbaceous Impatiens hawkeri (Balsaminaceae). Certainly within tree populations, there are family groups in mosaics of genetically and phenotypically distinct patches, making up ‘populations’. These distinctions are marked by morphological features such as leaf shape, thickness and pubescence, bark properties and biochemical features such as relative amounts of sugars, amino acids, terpenes and tannins. In turn, this makes them differentially susceptible to pathogens and herbivores. Such patterns may be the result of Sisyphean fitness and not represent irreversible tendencies to speciation, i.e. the formation of ‘populations’ of plant genotypes, representing the best available to arrive at a particular point under the prevailing biotic and physical features at any one particular time. Crossing with other such genotypes inevitably leads to the breakdown of this optimum (hence the name) and formation of new genotypes to be filtered by the new conditions. Nevertheless, speciation appears to be greater in regions of geological instability or great physiographic diversity with rapid climatic gradients as  in Madagascar. New Guinea has both such features, whereas Africa has been very stable in this regard, while contact with Laurasian floras has been restricted by desert barriers and this contrasts with the intermingling in other tropical regions. Other places, particularly the tropical Far East have been very unstable over the last 15 million years. The richness of the Malesian flora, for example, may be partly accounted for by the Laurasian elements in the lowland rain forest and the Gondwana elements in the heath forest and in montane communities. In the Neotropics, richness is due to the combination of Amazon-based groups and those based in the northern Andes, these latter being poorly represented in Amazonia. Almost all lianes and canopy trees in the lowland neotropics are in Amazon-centred taxa; epiphytes, understorey shrubs and palmettos mostly belong to Gondwana groups with Andean-centred patterns. Of trees with Laurasian affinities, almost half of the families represented have wind pollination, while none of the Gondwana ones do; many of the northern-Andean ones are hummingbird-pollinated, while those with pollination by large-or medium-sized bees tend to belong to Amazon-centred groups. The woody, wind-pollinated Laurasian groups have not speciated greatly in South America, but almost half of the neotropical flora belongs to the Andean-centred groups of epiphytes, understorey shrubs and palmettos, all of which are poorly represented in Africa and, to a lesser extent, Asia. Highly frugivorous birds like toucans and cotingas have radiated with the Amazon-based canopy-trees and lianes, while the Andean fleshy-fruited understorey flora has been associated with the radiation of manikins, tanagers and bats, making these faunas greater than those in Africa or Asia. The low patchiness of fruit associated with the richer ‘fruit-floras’ in America has resulted in the evolution of more diverse communities of frugivores with reduced dietary overlap, relatively small body size and sedentary ranging patterns, whereas in Asia, where fruit seems to be rarer in space and time, with fewer species, there are fewer frugivores with broadly overlapping diets (e.g. terrestrial and brachiating primates), larger body size and more mobile ranging patterns. Africa is somewhat intermediate in this respect. 7.1.1 Refugia It has been widely argued (but see later) that within the lowland Neotropics, the fragmentation of populations took place as a result of climatic and associated vegetational changes in the last 2 million years. The changes seem to have been alternating periods of humid conditions and aridity. It is    argued that during the dry phases, the humid forests would have been fragmented into island-like refugia (Figure 7.1) of isolated blocks of forest. The organisms would then come back into contact, merge again or coexist as new species. There is some (disputed) geomorphological evidence for such contractions, supported by palaeobotanical work. Much evidence comes from the mapping of the distributions of rain-forest organisms, most notable being those of various tree families by Prance and his co-workers. Although the detail of the distributions varies, the broad pattern is the same. Similar schemes have been drawn up for several mammalian groups, certain butterfly genera, various reptiles and amphibians while a good deal of work has been carried out on the distributions of the avifauna. All these give some idea of possible refugia, sometimes referred to as centres of dispersal. That the modern distributions of organisms could be explained in terms of ecological rather than historical factors was rejected, as no clearcut correlations between the distributions and any ecological factors such as precipitation or soil factors could be discerned. In Mexico and central America, eight refugia have now been recognized; in the terra firme rain forests of lowland south America, 26 centres of endemism have been identified, 15 in the great block of Amazonian-Orinoco-Guayanan rain forest. Today, the forest is at a maximum, so that it is the drier forests that are today's ‘refugia’. In these, some species appear to be uniform, e.g. Tabebuia impetiginosa (Bignoniaceae), while others such as T. ochracea, are divisible into several subspecies indicating active differentiation. It has been argued that differentiation in refugia is less marked in trees than it is in insects or birds, because of their different life spans, but such theory provides an explanation for the now sympatric occurrence of 12 species of Eschweilera (Lecythidaceae) near Manaus. Similar explanations have been put forward for the distributions of herbaceous plants, as in Ischnosiphon spp. (Marantaceae), where cycles of dryness have been invoked to explain species relationships and distributions. The distributions of forest passerines in Africa show centres of endemism, centres of richness and disjunctions, which have been fitted to refugia theory, but close examination of the geographical ranges of subspecies of the Heliconiini and Ithominae groups of butterflies gives 44 centres of endemism in tropical America, though the two groups have very different ecological characteristics. The richest centres have the most complicated mosaics of different habitat types reflected in topography, soils and vegetation. However, the patterns of species diversity do not coincide with those of endemism and one of the present ‘refugia’ seems to have been underwater 5000 BP and its endemism must have arisen subsequently. 7.2 Species diversity Several hypotheses to explain the coexistence of so many species have been proposed. Some place emphasis on biotic, others on environmental factors. Of biotic arguments for explaining greater tropical diversity, one of the most familiar is that there are more ‘niches’ than in temperate latitudes, arising from more habitats or more resources, but these hark back to environmental arguments ultimately. Usually, however, it is argued that there may be a finer division of these habitats or resources or, in short, that tropical species are more specialized. Added to this is the historical argument that in the tropics more of the available ‘niches’ are filled and that, because of ice ages or other environmental factors, temperate habitats are not yet saturated with species. Much of this ‘niche theory’ is rooted in zoological studies, so some animal examples will be considered first. Species co-existence levels in rain-forest mammals (and reptiles) are lower than in birds, whose locomotor abilities allow them access, at a low-energy cost, to food unavailable to species confined to terrestrial or arboreal substrates. Moreover, there can be many bats and small-to medium-sized mammals (arboreal) from the smallest marsupials to the smaller monkeys, in contrast to the larger mammals confined to the forest floor where food is always scarce, and therefore there are fewer species of them. Between closely related taxa, resource partitioning is found as in the case of squirrels in Gabon, where two of the nine coexisting species are found in special habitats, the other seven being taxonomically rather diverse: four of these are essentially arboreal, the other three ground foragers, and in each group there are differences in size such that food is partitioned by hardness and size. The weights of 66 species of mammalian primary consumers in Gabon are nearly uniformly spread over a range of five orders of magnitude, the 11 shrew species alone covering three. The ways in which resources are partitioned are many, as, for example, on Barro Colorado Island where there are as many as eight variables of importance in just the food of coexisting ‘surface-gleaning’ bats. Among primates, orang-utans, gibbons and siamangs in west Malesia have differences in body size, permitting coexistence. The gibbons are chased off by siamangs as they dominate through size, though they require a lot to eat over a small area; the gibbons travel longer distances for small resources. Of the 46 species (16 genera) of American primates, all but 10 (2 genera) occur in Amazonia and up to 14 (12 genera) can occur sympatrically in Amazonia: the importance of size in resource partitioning is evident. In the most diversified locality examined, in south-east Peru, size has effects on not only diet and prey search but also capture methods, vertical position in the forest, habitat use and locomotory patterns, the larger primates apparently differing in diet as to the percentage of fruit versus leaves for example. A ‘community’ of bats in Queensland comprised two subunits: four species in the closed canopy and five in gaps, while three other species used both. The gap specialists are fast fliers whereas those in the canopy are slower and more manoeuvrable. The bat community on Barro Colorado Island is perhaps the most complex assemblage of sympatric mammals anywhere in the world, comprising 35 species, which can be arranged in nine feeding ‘guilds’, based on diet and mode of food gathering. Within the guilds, food resources are partitioned spatially and temporally as well as by size and quality. At the Brown River in southern New Guinea, 83 coexisting bird species were examined: resource partitioning allows a high number of frugivore species (few mammals there) and there is a size range among them. There is a similar range of related carnivores but these have no great bill-size differences. The frugivores seem to have wider ‘niches’ in rain forests than elsewhere, but the converse theory that the habitat lends itself to finer division into niches seems to hold for the carnivores. Also in New Guinea are sympatric birds of paradise apparently dealing with fruit in a similar way, staying in the trees for only a few minutes, perhaps through fear of predators. On examination, it was found that two species were largely insectivorous, two largely fig-eaters and five were generalist frugivores. Fundamental to the idea of finely divided ‘niches’, however, is the notion that there are finite or limiting resources, whereas in trees in the tropics with abundant light, water, CO2 and a conservative nutrient-cycling system, this seems as inappropriate as it does in the case of tropical corals making up species-rich reefs, where food is not readily seen as limiting when compared with space to occupy. Another and very fashionable biotic argument is that of ‘predation’; that there are more predators and greater predation in the tropics than in temperate regions, and that these are matched by more defensive or avoidance mechanisms. The prevalence of predation appears to be correlated with the relative lack of seasonality, for, in temperate countries, winters prevent a good deal of predation. Nevertheless, it would seem that this ‘explanation’ is merely a restatement of the facts of tropical high diversity in that if there are more species, there will be more species of predators. Of environmental arguments, attention is focused on those features of the environment that are peculiar to the tropics. Firstly, the tropical belt is a large region and for marine organisms, for example, the sheer size of the  available area for diversification is greater, though, as we have seen, tropical rain forest occupies only a small part of the tropical land-surface, and thus a very small fraction of the tropical global surface. Nevertheless, the range of environmental heterogeneity in the tropics from the foot of the Andes to their peaks is greater spatially than in temperate regions, even if the environment in temperate regions varies greatly temporally. The absence of the rigours of an annual drought in tropical forest is correlated with high species-richness of both forests and within individual genera of plants. We are left, furthermore, with the heterogeneity in the tropics engendered by disturbance through storms or other violent environmental factors such as fire and the seasonal changes of weather, some of which, like short droughts, are unpredictable. Cyclones are seen as a force that prevents the ecological succession of coral reefs from terminating in less species-rich assemblages (in those reefs, the earlier stages are more species-rich). Furthermore, the importance of predation can be seen as yet another element in the disturbance picture. In summary, time, space, resources, competition and predation, may play a part in explaining the biological diversity of the tropics. 7.2.1 Environmental heterogeneity In Amazonia, the density and species-richness of non-flying mammals is positively correlated with soil fertility and undergrowth density. What is the evidence for some microenvironmental differentiation of rain forest supporting a diversity of species, each in the case of trees with very specific requirements in terms of nutrients, soil water content and so on? Firstly, individuals do not all occur randomly in a forest and often there is much clumping as we have already discussed. Furthermore, a monograph of any large tropical group will show varying degrees of recognition of the ecological requirements of different species. Of the 51 species of Chisocheton (Meliaceae), in Malesia for example, one species is restricted to peat-swamp forest and another to limestone, while, in dipterocarps, Shorea curtisii is always found on ridges and slopes apparently associated with particular water relations in the forest. Similarly, in the igapo forests, that is those inundated by black or clear water, in Brazil, the species distributions are thought to reflect differential tolerance of flooding. In Sri Lanka, the abundance of Dipterocarpus zeylanicus is associated with particular levels of soil potassium, that of D. hispidus with nitrogen and phosphorus, while Artocarpus nobilis (Moraceae) and Campnosperma zeylanicum (Anacardiaceae) are found only where D. hispidus, the local dominant, is not. In the dipterocarp forests of Borneo, the  variation in species patterns is correlated with HCI-extractable phosphorus and magnesium where these levels are lower than about 220 ppm of phosphorus and 1200ppm magnesium. Above these levels, such correlations are less evident and over-ridden by a correlation with topography. Below these levels, species richness is linearly positively correlated with soil magnesium, but above it negatively so. It is suggested that the critical levels coincide with those below which the rate of litter accumulation exceeds its breakdown and that the ecological optimum may represent that of the dipterocarps' mycorrhizae. At higher nutrient levels with higher water-retaining capacity, trees with a higher heat load in the canopy, i.e. with densely arranged large leaves, are at an advantage and shade out others, depressing species-richness. This example shows that environmental factors cannot be cleanly isolated from biological ones. When 46 forest sites in Costa Rica were examined it was also found that there was a negative correlation between soil nutrient availability and the richness of tree species. In other words, the highest species richness was found under ‘poor’ growth conditions. Under very low nutrient conditions in general, however, species numbers are low as they are, contrariwise, under greenhouse competition experiments with high nutrient levels. An example that pinpoints the problem was exposed when a map of all trees over 20 cm diameter at breast height in 2 sq km of the semi-deciduous forest of Barro Colorado Island was made. It showed that most species are patchily dispersed, while many appear to be randomly distributed and a very few are uniformly distributed. Most of those that are clumped, however, are in groups not associated with the topography, while some species are restricted to particular kinds of site: Ocotea skutchii, for example, is always on slopes. In short, some heterogeneity and aggregations may have a physical explanation, others not. In the neotropics, the question of the maintenance of diversity of the rich epiphyte flora has been considered to have a partly physical explanation, though the germane physical features are generated by living hosts, i.e. the nature of bark surfaces. 7.2.2 Biotic factors Among seven species of fruit pigeons in tropical Queensland, the diets of the birds change with the seasonal fruits, each species with a different suite of plant species. Coexistence is reinforced by nomadism and migration, but the diets overlap at times of both high and low fruit availability. Indeed, of the biotic explanations of how existing plant species avoid competition, some are based on time-sharing of animal agents. For example, over a season, six species of Shorea are visited in turn by species of thrips, which are believed to be their major pollinators. Thus with nonspecific pollinators, competition is avoided and there is no problem of the build-up of pollinators at any one time of year to satisfy any one plant species. The problem comes with the first-flowering species. However, apomixis through pseudogamous agamospermy has been confirmed in a species of Hopea (Dipterocarpaceae) and inferred in two of Shorea on the presence of polyembryony or triploidy, e.g. S. macroptera, which is the first of the section to flower, when the pollinator numbers have not yet built up (see section 6.3) and would experience the greatest vicissitudes if dependent on insects. Similar time sharing is known in dispersal. In Trinidad, 19 species of the pioneering Miconia (Melastomataceae) fruit successively, providing fruit for dispersing birds throughout the year and staggered batches of seedlings that avoid interspecific competition. Although this example has been questioned, there could be ‘shiftwork’ in other examples — in that there is a segregation of animals between night and day. Biotic explanations for both clumping and diversity have been adduced. The habits of some animals lead to the deposition of many seeds in one place. This is especially noticeable with frugivorous bats, which, in a dry forest in Costa Rica, produce seed shadows of a mixture of species around fruiting trees in which they roost. Again, agoutis in south-east Peru store fruits of Astrocaryum, a palm, in hoards, which may lead to clumped distribution as well as to the ‘clumped’ behaviour of white-lipped peccaries, which in turn disinter this food. By contrast, it has been argued by Janzen that species-specific ‘predation’ of juveniles growing around their mother will lead to a progressive decline in density of successful saplings towards the mother. This might then account for the apparently non-environmentally controlled distribution pattern in which other species could insinuate themselves in the holes of the forest ‘lattice’ devoid of the first species. This has been extended in the case of specific fruit and seed predators to account for the frequency of dioecy in some forests. In dioecious species, regulated in numbers by such predators, a high level of gene exchange could be maintained by the presence of a number of male trees that would not be attractive to these predators. ‘Predators’ can include fungi and vertebrates as well as invertebrates. Of insect attack, that by bruchids of Scheelea zonensis (Palmae) in central America is greater, the nearer the mother plant and early survival of Virola surinamensis there is enhanced by being away from the parental crown, as seedlings closer to the bole suffer attack from weevils. Faramea occidentalis (Rubiaceae) seeds dispersed as little as 5 m from the mother  there have a distinct advantage over those beneath her. Seedlings of Platypodium elegans (Leguminosae) also in central America die of damping off as a function of distance from the mother in their first year, when the mortality rate can be up to 81%. Experimental work on Barro Colorado Island showed that decreasing density of seedlings and increasing distance from the mother reduced the incidence of damping off. Seedlings of another legume in Panama, Dipteryx panamensis, survive in light gaps best, under adults worst. Damage to the apical meristem shows similar patterns with respect to distance from adults and density of seedlings as the pathogen damage in Platypodium, though in Dipteryx it is due to insect herbivory and tree or litter fall. In other parts of the tropics, similar patterns have been found in Aolaia seedlings (Meliaceae) in Malaysia and Pandanus tectorius on Fanning Island in the central Pacific. Such mortality at La Selva leads to uniform distributions of Iriartea gigantea and Socratea durissima (Palmae) and Pentaclethra macroloba (Leguminosae) from initially clumped ones. At the ‘community’ level, most of the 300 or so species populations studied in the large plot on Barro Colorado Island discussed above show positively correlated survival with distance from reproductive adults up to 15 m. In plots in the Queensland rain forest, seedling recruitment of subcanopy trees and understorey species was found to be lower for common than for rare species: for canopy species there was no such correlation. It was found that growth and mortality were no greater in dense stands of conspecifics than in others. At very small spatial scales, there seemed to be trends in recruitment, growth and mortality that fit the general hypothesis in promoting species richness, but at larger scales, besides the smaller species mentioned above, there were no such discernible trends. There are certain general observations that might favour the predator argument. In chalk grassland in Britain, for example, the removal of grazers, such as rabbits or sheep, has a devastating effect on the fine-leaved bouncy turf rich in species. In a few years, the sward may become dominated by the coarse tussock-forming grass, Brachypodium pinnatum, and eventually the vegetation turns into some form of scrub and possibly woodland. On the other hand, an increase in grazing pressure leads to the elimination of all but a few very tough species. At the maximum plantspecies diversity, the grazing lowers the competitive ability of certain species, allowing, under the same conditions of soil, aspect and so on, the coexistence of the smaller species that otherwise could not exist there. What is perhaps most remarkable about this grassland is that it is only  maintained under active management even rabbits were introduced by the Normans and, although it resembles some periglacial assemblages of plants, it must have been reconstituted after the forest maximum unless there were extensive grazed glades in that period. In short, it is possibly not very old. Palatable seaweeds in North Carolina have improved fitness if growing with unpalatable competitors less susceptible to herbivory, i.e. one competitor seeming helpful to another, the abundance of the less palatable leading to increases in abundances and numbers of other species. The edible species grow at times of high predation as epiphytes on the less palatable. In the absence of herbivores (fish and urchins among them), the palatable species grow less when epiphytic, though the less palatable are little retarded. A series of observations first put together by Gillett is perhaps nearer our subject. It is well known that it is difficult to grow plantation rubber (Hevea brasiliensis, originally from Brazil) successfully in the forest lands where that species grows wild, and it grows best in Malaysia; cocoa, which is also native to the New World, grows best in West Africa, cloves from Indonesia, in Zanzibar, and so on. The argument runs that in the absence of their predators, performance is better and that when such predators, be they animal, fungus or other pathogen, catch up with the crops or evolve to attack them, disaster follows, as occurred in the coffee harvests of Malaya at the beginning of the century and in the banana-growing countries of Central and northern South America before that. The corollary is seen where alien plants, contrary to expectation, appear to oust native plants in species-rich environments, where every ‘niche’ would appear to have been filled by species evolving more or less in situ to fit those environmental factors. Examples are Hakea (Proteaceae, Australia) and pines that have been able to take hold in the Cape. Exotics may appear to compete better with indigenous vegetation in Britain: possibly the success of sycamore can be seen in this way. The principle is, of course, the essence of biological control: the introduction of the predators or other pests of plants getting out of control may lead to their collapse in numbers. The most successful example is probably the reduction of American prickly pears (Opuntia, Cactaceae) in the rangelands of Australia by the introduction of the moth whose larvae feed on such cacti in the Americas. 7.2.3 Combinations of factors A biotic effect may be attained via an environmental one as in the case of allelopathy favouring particular associations of plants, mentioned in  Chapter 3. Furthermore, of those explanations that incorporate biotic and microenvironmental as well as disturbance effects, the most balanced account is that of Grubb, who used the term ‘regeneration niche’ to cover all the factors that affect a plant during its career from fertilized egg to death. According to this view, differences at any point in the natural history of the plants will allow their coexistence and an examination of related species' response to potential germination sites, shade tolerance, pollination or dispersal mechanisms and so on will disclose these differences. These then are features of species or subdivisions of them, by geography or sex for example, leading to a consideration of the form of organisms, so that differences in morphological features may reflect different lifestyles in closely related species, which can coexist. In the neotropical Lecythidaceae for example all species have large circumscissile capsules, but such uniformity disguises a wide range of variation in the texture of the mesocarp, degree of dehiscence, and development of the aril into a fleshy or winged structure, with the result that different species are dispersed by birds, bats, monkeys, rodents, wind, water and possibly fish. Another example, the Brazil nut (Bertholletia excelsa) has an operculum or lid that opens inwards so that animals have to get the seeds out, while in Gustavia the mesocarp is brightly coloured so that, once damaged, it is attractive to animals. In others the seeds hang out on funicles and are dispersed by bats; others have persistent calyces that allow the fruit to float. Germination features may differ, as in species of Shorea (Dipterocarpaceae) where, in Malaya, S. curtisii requires moister conditions than do S. Ieprosula or S. parviflora. It is also more tolerant of low light intensities following establishment and is thus able to regenerate under the shade cast by the palm, Eugeissona tristis. Clumps of particular species may reflect past tree falls in this way. In Costa Rica, the size of clumps of Cryosophila guagara palms corresponded to the size of light gaps created by fallen trees. In the lower montane forests of Costa Rica, however, 23 tree species within the same family, Lauraceae, have the same insect pollinators and bird dispersers. There is little evidence for phenological character displacement and thus avoidance of competition, though fruit removal rates decline when many species are in fruit, i.e. there is competition for dispersal agents. In a similar case of a montane forest, between 56 tree species in several families, this time in Jamaica, there was, again, only slight interspecific temporal separation in the use of animal pollinators and dispersal agents, thus ‘niche’ separation in this sense is slight and the coexistence of the 56 species cannot be explained in this way. Nevertheless, in ordinations of vegetation, the regeneration characteristics  of assemblages of species may give meaning to the observeddistribution of vegetation types, rather than the terrestrial features of the environment. This was revealed in Whitmore's classic study of the vegetation of Kolombangara in the relatively species-poor rain forest of the Solomon Islands. The aim was to make a classification of the forest types of the island using 12 selected large tree species when, as a blessing in disguise, the forests were hit by a violent cyclone. The regeneration strategy of each of the 12 species was worked out and the percentage occurrence of certain of these differentiating the forest types on the island reflected different meteorological regimes. The element of environmental compared with predation disturbance is undoubtedly one that maintains diversity and if this is removed, the species total may fall. Since 1923, on Barro Colorado Island the numbers of species of reptiles, amphibians and birds have fallen since the effect of the secondary habitats associated with agriculture, prevalent there beforehand, has diminished. A similar effect is seen in British woodlands where the maintenance of traditionally disturbing management (like coppicing) keeps up species numbers of animals and plants, whereas abandoning of such management leads to a decline. Geomorphological data support the idea that the western parts of Amazonia are under severe and constant erosion with surface losses of 2–3cm per century, or 3–10cm in the life of a tree, leading to great instability in the forest. Lake sediment records in Ecuador suggest that there was regional flooding of western Amazonia 1300–800 BP, i.e. major hydrological disturbance, which raised the water level as far east as Manaus, while savanna regions seem to have persisted on the northern edge of the basin throughout the late Quaternary. The areas to the south-west and east, today enduring fluctuating intensities or durations of dry seasons, have a history of such. In northwest Amazonia (Venezuela), there is evidence for fire disturbance over the last 6000 years, with charcoal deposits under terrafirme forests as well as caatingas, and some of the fires may not have been anthropogenic. The effects of drought, floods, erosion and fire on the forest of different types — savanna-like in the north, seasonally-flooded in the centre, with a seasonal climate in the south and south-west, a dry one in the north-east and the perhumid climate with species-rich forest in the west — has not yet been fully assessed. There is no reason to think that disturbance was any greater in glacial times, though there was a cooling and 10–20% less precipitation in the monsoon rains that could have allowed savannas to take over in what are today ecotonal areas. Unlike Africa or Asia, however, there have been throughout the great diversity inducing system of the great rivers driven by Andean precipitation. Although outside the Amazon basin, there is evidence for glacial or lateglacial aridity, in the Galapagos, the Guyana Highlands and the Caribbean coast, but the sites are far away. Refuge theory would predict that where forest now stands today, there would have been savanna and that the higher wetter country would have been the ‘refugia’ in glacial times. The only site so far fully examined, at Mera (Ecuador), seems to show that there was a minimum temperature depression of 4°C between 35 000 and 26 000 years BP when the forest was replaced by a moist forest with Andean elements, implying forest descent of at least 700 m, the pollen spectrum there being unlike any in modern Amazonia; there are, for example, high percentages of alder (Alnus, Betulaceae) pollen. Colinvaux therefore suggests that the so-called refugia were thus denied to some rain-forest species presently there, i.e. the supposed migrations to them of lowland species in inducing today's diversity is questionable. The refuge theory has also been questioned in terms of the botanical information originally used to formulate it, in that it has been suggested that the ‘refugia’ may represent regions where collecting has been at its most intense. It has also been argued that the highest diversity is found in elevated sites most protected from fluvial erosion. 7.2.4 An element of chance? In our attempt to understand the diversity of tropical forests, using largely the example of the trees, we have had to take into account all the features of the plant that would appear to reflect the forces of natural selection in terms of physical factors: meteorological, topographical, pedological, and biotic ones. Added to this must be an element of chance in that not everything can be evenly distributed nor is disturbance predictable, as reflected in the ‘first come, first served’ stands of pioneers. This is best exemplified by islands, however, and by Krakatau, with its suspended succession, showing that with a chance introduction of some late successional species, diversity would probably increase. Again, an examination of the isolated neotropical cloud forests by Sugden, shows that under certain conditions, the role of chance in terms of long-distance dispersal may be as important as the environmental factors in promoting diversity. The woody floras of those forests that are surrounded on all sides by arid woodlands consist of species with wide neotropical distributions and many of them are found elsewhere in a wide range of habitats while few are restricted to montane forest. Many of them are pioneers, characteristic of early successional sequences elsewhere, and are well adapted for long-distance dispersal, so that under isolated circumstances such pioneers can form ‘mature’ communities, even though the level of disturbance is low. Birds in central Panama seem to track microclimatic optima, such behaviour producing dynamic (non-equilibrium) assemblages or ‘communities’ in space and time, but this is not stochastic as each species seeks optima in the current context of environmental conditions. Even in chalk grassland in Great Britain, non-equilibrium models may best explain the coexistence of plant species and, in lowland rain forest, there is still disagreement about the importance of chance establishment of trees. Moreover, there is some confusion about the level of selection in that a genetically linked population is composed of particular trees on each of which selection acts, and differing in space and time in terms of biotic neighbourhoods as well as genotypes. In terms of genotypes, competition between individuals of a very polymorphic species may be less than between related ‘jordanons’(selfing lines) or apomictic lines, even though these be isolated genetically from one another. Outcrossing promotes diversity suited to high biotic uncertainty and does not invariably lead to specialization of species but, on the contrary, may lead to greater generalization of a species and therefore similarity between species of a tree ‘guild’. Species may therefore come and go from guilds without causing havoc there. Hubbell and Foster argue that such thinking could lead to a return to the classical views of rain forest and speciation espoused by Corner, Fedorov and van Steenis. In conclusion, it may be remarked that, besides chance effects, the greatest diversity is found where there is an unseasonal climate, topographic and edaphic heterogeneity, and where the nutrient levels are lo–, but not too low, and where predation and other disturbance is high but not too high. As for an explanation of local heterogeneity, however, T.C. Whitmore at the end of his study of the Kolombangara forests, may be quoted. ‘It can therefore be seen that variation from place to place in climax tropical lowland rain forest, which has for so long intrigued and challenged ecologists, is not open to any single or simple explanation. Rather, it is due to a complex interplay of extrinsic and intrinsic factors, which are not unique to the tropics and which have to be resolved individually for any particular forest.’ 7.3 Practical problems That there should be about 400 woody species in a hectare of South American or Malaysian forest has led to problems not only in accounting    for such diversity, the main subject of this chapter, but also in actually measuring the richness of such forests. Sampling is likely never to be comprehensive in terms of the total number of species recorded from an area (Figure 7.2) unless almost the whole area is used as the sample. The time involved is also a major factor: in the 10 m x 10 m piece of forest in Costa Rica, discussed in Chapter 1, the analysis took 192 man-hours, in other words, a full hectare would take one man a decade! In a recent study, 10% of Barro Colorado Island was used in sampling and only 80% of the known flora was found. The problem then arises that a sample of such size, or indeed any large plot, will mask any microtopographical diversity in the forest and thus any local species assemblages under particular microenvironmental conditions. In an attempt to reach a practical solution, Brunig and Klinge worked in Amazonian forest that was estimated to have some 700 plant species, excluding cryptogams, representing 70 families. In view of the problem of the masking of environmental heterogeneity, they found that small plots of 40 x 50 m were the most profitable in terms of time and information gained (even though they recorded only 500 common tree species in 35 families), and that for phytomass studies small plots were adequate. Nevertheless, they stressed that any sampling design should be rigorously stratified according to site conditions and the stage of regeneration of the forest, and that measurements of parameters such as stand height, basal area and tree density in the areas around plots should also be taken. In this way, they argued, a reasonable picture of forest diversity and structure could be built up."
ACA ACA-J18-004 7.59 "CHAPTER NINE THE CHANGING FOREST TODAY We have already observed. that the most luxurious vegetation of spontaneous growth affords us certain proof that the soil which has produced it will prove equally favourable for the production of the usual objects of culture (George Finlayson Mission to Siam and Hué…in the years 1821–2 (1826) p.57) By the time of his explorations in South America (1799–1804), von Humboldt's suggestion that the Amazon should be deforested on a large scale to improve agriculture was part of the European view of how tropical territories might be developed. With the establishment of colonies as opposed to trading posts, came the need for production and exports over and above what had sustained the earlier economic relationships between the West and the tropics. In the Amazon, the numbers of Indians declined, ceasing to be a threat to western expansion, so that by the second half of the last century, they were becoming more of a curiosity, regarded as anachronistic impediments to progress, which had to be educated on Christian lines on the one hand, the true lords of the territory to be given their freedom on the other. In Brazil, there came a romanticism of Indian life, though by the time of the establishment of the Republic in 1889, they had few rights and the rubber boom brought entrepreneurs to the uppermost headwaters of the Amazon followed by railways and telegraph lines. Developers hired murderers to exterminate Indians while in the coastal cities a pro-Indian movement gathered strength and by 1910 an ‘Indian Protection Service’ was formed. By then the population of Indians, about a million, was just over a quarter what it had been at the time of the European colonizations of the sixteenth century. Many groups have entirely disappeared except as blood mixed with immigrant blacks and whites, but some tribes resisted, to the despair of well-wishers imbued with the inevitability of Euro-Christian civilization. They rejected the new ideas offered to or forced  upon them, convinced that their ancient ways were more appropriate to the forest in which they lived. In general, however, the needs of tropical territories meshed into the modern economic order, have meant that the first wave of human invaders in the rain forest have had to take second place to the exploitation of the second wave. The effect on the indigenous peoples has been debilitating in that their loss of faith in, for example, indigenous medicine has been combined with a realization of the ineffectiveness of western medicine in treating psychosomatic illness. Besides the introduced diseases, they have suffered demoralization as qualities such as prowess in hunting, traditionally so significant, are no longer valued. The dominant cultures have very often not understood their ways, have gaped at their nakedness and laughed at the rituals they do not understand. But most significantly they have lost the use of their traditional lands. This has been due to agriculture and forestry activities, which must now be considered. 9.1 Forest conversion 9.1.1 Farming and gardening The slash-and-burn type of shifting cultivation has been used continuously for some 2000 years in Indomalesia, each patch being cropped for only 2 or 3 years, the people at a density of some five or fewer cultivators per km 2 . It is a practical and successful way of using land used throughout the tropics under different names, where poor soils, steep slopes and heavy rainfall obtain. It is successful where temperate zone type methods are not, and is generally held to be the most efficient in terms of soil recovery. Formerly considered the bane of tropical forests, perhaps in part as a way of keeping the ‘peasant’ economy distinct from the (colonial) plantation one, despite the fact that such was freely integrated in the system of exporting natural products, e.g. most of Indonesia's pepper, coffee, coconuts, tobacco and rubber is grown thus, it is now praised, possibly too much so, as a result of the increasing romanticization of forest living, for shifting cultivation is changing. With the arrival of western man, who took spices and introduced new crops, has come plantation agriculture and a reduction in the mortality rate. Smallholder agriculture has led to the concentration of people being three times that that would support shifting cultivation in some areas. There is insufficient time for the land to recover between cultivations and, largely through the agency of western man, exotic weeds become established and   encroach on the smallholdings. Inevitably, more forest land is brought under cultivation to counter this (Figure 9.1). Before man started burning the forest, fires were the result of lightning, which is common in the tropics, and possibly of falling rocks and, in wooded savanna, fermentation under compaction. In New Guinea, in the seasonal forests of the Gogol Valley, is evidence of major fires, for Intsia spp. (Leguminosae), which readily regenerate after fire, make up some 25% of the log volume there. In Africa, it is argued that man was using fire at least 50–55 000 years ago, taking coals from camp to camp and using the fire to smoke out bees from their nests in honey-hunting, or driving game. This probably also occurred in the drier types of forest and savanna. Nevertheless, tropical rain forest may be flammable at the edges, so that savanna may spread. It has been calculated that because of burning, only some 60% of Africa potentially covered with forest actually bears it today. Fires set to control weeds on degraded pastures also spread, particularly to selectively logged areas as in Para, Brazil, as the gaps left have tracks connecting them and plenty of fuel: such have had devastating effects in Borneo during seasonal droughts (see section 2.2.2). The effects of fire are to increase light intensity at the ground, affecting germination but also the fauna and flora of the soil. There is an increase in evaporation and  rain has more impact. Nitrogen is rapidly lost but immediately available potassium, magnesium and calcium increase as input from the ash. Run-off is increased, especially on slopes, and there may be marked compaction or other deterioration of the soil structure. Burnt sites improve grazing and tend to concentrate herbivores such as elephant and buffalo or antelope, some of which, in turn, attract concentrations of carnivores. Increased clearing in the Ituri forest, Zaire, seems not to have much affected the abundance of 16 out of 19 mammal species examined, though okapi, yellow-back duikers and leopards are less abundant. After burning in the Indomalesian region, grasses appear and, if these are left without grazing or burning, will slowly be replaced by the forest. If there is grazing or cutting, the grass composition may change and, if burnt, it may become dominated by lalang (Imperata cylindrica) a grass that is very difficult to eradicate. Continuous use of the land for cropping leads to declining yields, such that rice production, for example, may be halved in 3 years, partly due to nutrient removal, erosion, the physical deterioration of the soil and partly to the multiplication of pests and diseases and an increase in competition from weeds. Relic terraces and raised fields in the Mayan lowlands of Central America have been interpreted as indicative of a settled, sophisticated, intensive, prehistoric agriculture, rather than shifting cultivation, which collapsed for just these reasons. Of the many explanations for the collapse in the ninth century after such intensive cultivation without metals for 6–16 centuries, the most plausible is that it resulted from sustained failures of maize due to a leafhopper-borne virus, maize mosaic virus, which may have originated in northern South America at roughly the same time as maize was brought to the Caribbean by the Arawak about the time of Christ. Indeed, archaeologists now believe it was due to agricultural mismanagement combined with a booming population, for investigation of a major palace in the site at Copan, Honduras, has revealed that there was only a small contingent of specialist workers employed in constructing the elaborate structure, in other words that this was not enough to overburden the economy as is sometimes alleged to be the cause of the collapse of that civilization. Certain soils, like the Kalahari and Benin sands of Africa carry good forest, but, if cleared, only two worthwhile crops can be grown. The luxuriance of tropical forest deceived many colonists from Europe, their efforts being commemorated by scrub and bare rock, nowhere more markedly than the ‘Joden Savanna’ of Surinam, the result of a short-lived farming attempt by Jewish refugees 150 years ago. The traditional forest cultivators are now being joined in many parts of  the world by subsistence peasants, new arrivals, pushing further and further into the forest, often along paths or tracks cut by lumbermen. In Peru, for example, people from the Andes are moving down and across as a front into the Amazon plain. It has been estimated that in the early 1980s there were 240–300 million people involved in shifting cultivation who occupied perhaps half of the total tropical land surface. They were converting the forest at a rate of some 100000 km 2 per annum. The greatest effect is in Indomalesia, where some 85 000 km 2 are thought to be lost each year. In short, farming is reducing the rain forest by 1.5% of its area annually. This rate is likely to increase as many of the countries with moist forests — Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia, Kenya, Madagascar, peninsular Malaysia, Peru, Philippines, Thailand, Uganda, Vietnam and all of West Africa and Central America — have high population growth rates. Furthermore, pressed by urban problems and sometimes apparently with other motives, several countries, such as Brazil, Colombia, Indonesia (where, since 1905 , at least 2.5 million people have been moved from crowded Java, Bali and Lombok, to the ‘outer’ islands — an official figure where two or three times this number may have emigrated unassisted) and Peru are promoting transmigration schemes so that it is projected that the number of forest farmers could double or increase even more than that. It has been argued that continuous agriculture could be maintained if a closed nutrient cycle could be achieved, the canopy not perforated so that leaching would be prevented and the forest floor would not deteriorate, and if nutrients were added to equal those exported as crops and the diversity of species maintained. The problems to be added to this list of desiderata, making this theoretical model almost impossible to attain, include the problem of all year-round warmth, so that there is no respite from pests and diseases, a rapid breakdown of litter and subsequently enhanced leaching after the harvest of the crop. Furthermore, the social aspirations of the cultivators themselves in a climate where actual and potential production per man per year is less than in temperate countries, and such simple facts as the rapid rotting of produce, have to be taken into account. The mixture theory is also matched by the fact that, in practice, many crops have had their natural resistances, whether they be chemical or mechanical, or indeed temporal like staggered germination, bred out. The question then comes back to tackling the problem of how yield could be improved using traditional methods. Such ideas as the use of more legumes or other nitrogen-fixers and the ingenious use of nitrogen-fixing bacteria in the floating fern, Azolla, in paddy fields in southern China offer a ray of hope. Remarkable systems used by Chinese farmers in western Borneo merit  further attention. Here grains, pepper and rubber and many vegetable crops are interspersed with fishponds and livestock grazing, enabling the people to make permanent use of impoverished soils. Farming, then, is the biggest devourer of rain forest. Perhaps the region that has received most attention in the press in this context is Amazonia. Formerly the Amazon region was more thinly populated than the Sahara, containing perhaps some 50000 people, and importing food. The government's plan was to cut a 70m wide swathe through the forest for a major highway and that 100km both sides of this was to be developed. Every poor family that moved there from the crowded east of Brazil was to have about 100 ha and a small house. There was to have been an ‘agropolis’ every 50 km and a ‘ruropolis’every 150 km. All the colonists were supposed to feed themselves, though each of the plots was supposed to be left half-covered with forest. Such an idea led to isolated fragmentation of the forest, but in the 10 years up to 1977 over 11000 km of roads were built and settlers moved in. Land was given away and there were tax incentives to exploit the area, though increasingly it was large-ranching projects and multinational interests that took more and more land. By 1977, then, there were 300 cattle ranches and 6 million head of cattle, while a fifth of the forest had disappeared. In the 7 years up to 1977, 7389 families were established as opposed to the goal of 100 000 by 1974, largely because of poor agricultural yields, in part due to the use of the wrong rice cultivar for Amazonia, problems of storage of produce and of predators and pests, in an imported technology that was too temperate-oriented. The timber was burnt rather than used or sold. Such large companies as Volkswagen, which burnt down 120000ha, became involved. It was found that certain valuable cash crops like coffee, cocoa, oil palm and pepper grew well along rivers and that under the forest there was probably enough iron ore to meet world demand for 400 years, large deposits of bauxite, gold, nickel, copper and tin. Thought of as a model for Amazonia, the great Jari scheme, where 4 million ha of land were bought along the Jari, a tributary of the Amazon, was planned to combine the mining and smelting of bauxite with logging, rice-growing and the establishment of plantations for pulp, as a world shortage of paper was envisaged. Over 4500km of roads, four towns, an airport, railway, a port, schools and hospitals were built, the pulp mill came from Japan and was floated thence up the Amazon. Timber had been removed without nutrient replacement and there were major weed problems in the rice. Bulldozers were used to clear 1.6 million ha for Gmelina arborea (Verbenaceae), which can yield up to 30 m 3 per ha per annum, but the best stands yielded only 14 t, the scheme overall only 3–6 t. Pines and  Eucalyptus were tried but the pines produced only 6 t. Planting began in 1969, but in 1981, 15 years after the scheme had begun, the whole was sold off for a fraction of almost the billion dollars that had been invested in it. The stress on mineral extraction has left the settlers (now almost 10 million as was estimated early in 1982) in effect abandoned, and their fate is reported in terms of disputes over land, the sowing of their land with weed seeds from the air and even the poisoning of their drinking water. A scheme, more successful from the settlers' point of view, was that in part of Ecuadorian Amazonia, where a ‘settlements first; roads second’ philosophy prevailed. It had more egalitarian holdings, less interest by speculators (because of its remoteness) and, as the government authority tended to be weak, the settlers were more self-sufficient in setting up schools and cutting tracks and so forth; moreover, it was less costly for central government. However, to lay claim to the land, settlers were compelled in such a milieu to be seen to clear it of trees, so the result was ecologically undesirable. A further factor in the clearing of forest leading directly to farming is warfare. From 1962 to 1971 during the Vietnam War, the Americans spread some 72 million litres of herbicide from the air, mostly Agent Orange and similar preparations. About 36% of the mangrove forests were destroyed; 10.3% of inland forests besides cultivated and other lands were sprayed, some of them repeatedly. In many areas, the recovery has been so slow that cultivators have been able to move in, while fires have been an added retardant to recovery, sometimes resulting in the familiar Imperata savanna. 9.1.2 Logging and silviculture Wood is the most important commodity in international trade after gas and petrol, though most of it is used in the country of origin and much of it very close to source, being the only source of fuel for warmth and cooking for a third of the developing world. In the 1980s, the world wood requirement was some 3000 million m 3 , of which, following earlier figures, some 47% was used as fuel (80% of it in the developing world), 43% for building and other ‘solid wood’ purposes (two-thirds of this in the developed world) and 10% for paper (some seven-eighths of this used in the developed world). It is estimated that the demand by the turn of the century will be 6000 million m 3 . So far, tropical moist forests provide little more than 10% of the total wood used as solid wood and pulp, but as temperate forests become depleted or increasingly under pressure of the ‘environmental’ lobby to be managed for functions other than production, attention will inevitably be focused on the tropical resources. Indeed, temperate forests are worth up to 50 times more in return per unit area and some tropical countries are net importers of timber. Nevertheless, Japan is two-thirds wooded but imports half her pulp, and the United States grows half as much again timber as it needs and could easily become self-sufficient in hardwoods. In 1950, 4.2 million m 3 were exported to the developed world, in 1980 some 66 million m3, and this could be 95 million m 3 by the end of the century. Even now exports surpass local consumption, and Japan takes over half of them. Until lately, her major source has been Indomalesia, which is the origin of some 75% of the trade in tropical hardwoods. It is alleged that by 1989 30% of the world's tropical sawlogs in trade were from the Malaysian state of Sarawak, where forest was being lost at a rate of 3 ha per minute and the resistance of the local Punan to this had been contained. Certainly, world production and export of tropical logs and wood-products is dominated by Malaysia, Indonesia and Philippines and, in 1984, this trade was worth $4 billion dollars a year. The bulk of it was unprocessed but there have been moves towards processing it away from Japan and the industrialized countries of the region. Recently it has become possible to convert simultaneously wood chips of a hundred or more hardwood species into paper pulp, which is important, as it is estimated that paper consumption will increase more than that of timber. The average citizen in the developed world uses over 155 kg of paper per annum(325 kg in the United States), whereas in the developing world, the average citizen uses less than 5 kg. It is estimated that demand in the developing world will increase by some 2.75 times per citizen and that in the developed world some three times, so that the proportion consumed in the tropical world is going to increase. Some parts of the developed world, much of western Europe for example, are self-sufficient in pulp, but Japan is heavily dependent on foreign sources. At first, very few species were extracted for export. In South America, the mahoganies, Swietenia spp., were much sought after, so that today, they have suffered through genetic erosion to such an extent that often they are not worth exploiting, only those of poor form having been left in the forests to set seed. Some species have been almost exterminated, e.g. Per.sea theobromifolia (Lauraceae), formerly the ‘mahogany’ of Ecuador is now known from only 12 trees. In other forests only the greenheart, Oeotea rodiaei (Lauraceae), was exploited, the rest of the forest unused. In the Brazilian Amazon, exploitation was first in the varzea and igapo, but, since the 1970s, in the terra firme as well. Before the building of roads, it was peripheral and resembled that practised for the previous 350 years. In 1951, six species accounted for 89% of the harvest, 24% by volume being O. cymbarum and another 40% the meliaceous timbers — Cedrela odorata. Swietenia macrophylla and Carapa guianensis cut close to the high water mark and floated downstream on the rising waters. Although there were losses to insects during the wait for the rise, some 60% of the logs travelled 1500 km. By 1973, there was still only 20% of the total from terra firme, but towards the end of the decade the proportion was over 40%, mainly C. odorata and S. macrophylla; only some 20–40 species were acceptable to sawmills. Only some 50 of the thousands of species in the Amazon as a whole are commercially exploited, though up to 400 may have some value. Africa exports only 35, of which 10 make up some 70%. So poorly known were the timbers in West Africa, that at the beginning of the century the houses and offices for British colonial civil servants were built from imported coniferous timber. In Indomalesia, there is concentrated interest in fewer than 100 species with exports of 12 or so. lt is remarkable that despite these low numbers of species, little is known of their biology and one, the sebastiao-de-arruda, a well-known timber export from Brazil since the last century, has only lately (1978) been botanically identified and given a Latin name: Dalbergia decipularis (Leguminosae). In Trengganu, in the Malay Peninsula, the percentage of trees used in the 1970s was 4.5–26.3%, the number of actual trees being 2.5–12.5 per ha. Because lianes often tie together several trees, felling of one tree may lead to considerable damage to others, while logging tracks (Figure 9.2) may take up to 10% or even 30% of the forest area. It is estimated that in south-east Asia, some third or two-thirds of the residual trees are damaged irreparably while up to a third of the area is left as bare ground, often compacted by the forestry machinery. It is argued that greater care in extraction would lead to a higher price of the timber but, in hill-forest in Sarawak planned systems using directional felling are said to reduce logging damage by half without incurring additional costs. Nevertheless, logged forests are fireprone and, in Borneo, this has led to the devastation discussed in Chapter 2. In those fires in Sabah, 38–94% of the trees in logged forests were killed, 19–71 % in unlogged nearby, with more than 80% mortality of saplings in both. The effect on arboreal animals is largely to force them to leave logged forest and, as forests diminish, to promote their overcrowding. This is indicated by more frequent calling and, in the orang-utan, to fewer young, as the secondary forest is less acceptable to the apes, which prefer the   strangling figs of the ‘primary’ forest. Where selective logging is at a low density (10 stems per ha) in Pahang, West Malaysia, infant mortality in all primates is greatly increased, perhaps because of injuries due to the female adults having to make greater leaps from crown to crown across gaps or abandonment in the face of human presence or possibly reduction in available food. Nevertheless, the indications are that the populations recover if not disturbed again. Of ground-living mammals in Malaya over half of the species are forest animals and the elimination of the forest leads to the elimination of almost all the mammalian fauna except for a few rats. Added to this is the pressure from wild-life traders for skins, eggs, live birds, and butterflies, much trafficking in which is now illegal, but nevertheless rampant. Perhaps even more destructive than these has been the effect of orchid collectors, particularly in South America in the last century. Large horticultural firms sent out or subscribed to the activities of professional collectors, who often employed local people to bring orchids to them and there was little hesitation in felling a tree to get a good specimen. It is alleged that one British collector had 4000 trees felled in tracking down one particularly rare species in Colombia. Despite resistance of markets to novelty and indeed diversity and the fact that few mills can handle a diversity of timbers, the advent of techniques for  pulping mixtures of species means that the diversity of the rain forest becomes less of a problem. Small areas can be exploited intensively and more and more may be capable of being processed; for example, one plant in Colombia produces pulp, adding tropical hardwoods to long-fibre coniferous chips (30%). Although timbers with high levels of latex, silica or high density are avoided there; another plant in New Guinea can now utilize wood from up to 200 species, including dead and defective trees, so that yields have already increased by some 300%. On the other hand, desolation in these areas is total. This plant exports the chips to Japan for processing but the scheme to replace the original forest with plantation to sustain the plant indefinitely has foundered because it has not been demonstrated that timber-growing is a worthwhile economic activity that does not threaten ownership of the land. Moreover, with more recycling in Japan, long-fibred coniferous pulp from the Pinus radiata plantations of New Zealand and Chile is necessary for this, and increased imports from USA in the form of chips to help redress the balance of trade, there is little incentive for the plant owners. It has been suggested that rather than rely on plantation, natural regeneration should be encouraged by clearing 200m swathes through the forest. Narrower strips, perhaps 50 m wide have been suggested as appropriate in Amazonia, such strips being gardened for some years and replanted with trees as well; seed and mycorrhizae sources are close by. Until fairly recently, tropical silviculture has largely relied on natural regeneration. ‘Refinement’ or the reduction of competition from non-usable species, often leads to a considerable increase in the area occupied by the crop, so that once this is cut, there are lots of gaps for pioneers. Sometimes these are valuable, as in the case of Funtumia elastica (Apocynaceae) in Uganda, a source of rubber. Systems involving the repeated return to the forest and removal of the best trees are referred to as ‘polycyclic’. These cause repeated damage to the forest, including saplings of desirable species, and lead to the problem of genetic erosion of the crop, and are also difficult to administer. Compared with the continuous damage, though small clearings, of polycyclic systems, monocyclic ones involve clearing large areas at one coup but there is then less disturbance in the time thereafter. In Malaysia, for example, there was a change from polycyclic buffalo extraction to monocyclic mechanical extraction: now, dependent on the site, the range of possibilities with these as extremes is considerable. When natural regeneration is difficult or inadequate, it may be supplemented artificially by  planting out nursery-raised trees —‘enrichment’— in gaps, lines or groups. In most extreme cases, close planting may require the clear-felling of the forest. In 1980, only 4.4% of tropical forest was under active management, and half of that was in India. Of the 828 million ha of productive tropical forest left in 1985, only some 850000 or so were demonstrably under sustained-yield management in the producer countries of the International Timber Trade Organization. Indeed, there has been widespread belief that management is not really feasible despite the fact that, in terms of producing a naturally-regenerating stand of timber trees without any sign of soil deterioration, there has been success for over a century, beginning with teak in southern Asia. Dawkins has suggested that, for success, the desired species should be commonly occurring pioneers, that there should be relatively easily controllable climbers, while ground-cover must be maintained. However, ‘mega-mechanization’, short-term financial calculations discounting the sustention of biological and soil factors (and thus favouring plantations), inadequate provision for silvicultural programmes or even the removal of the successful forests themselves have made the systems seem not to be viable. To establish a tropics-wide base for sustainable timber production, permanent ‘forest estates’ have to be established in the producer countries, with high public profiles and proper controls and more co-operation between the trade and environmental movements to create the best conditions for such management in appropriate forest lands. Ecologically-based silviculture classifies the regeneration characteristics or syndromes into three major but overlapping categories, viz. (i) the pioneers (partially fire-tolerant) and the gapfillers (fire-sensitive), both incapable of establishment or growth in the shade, e.g. Albizia, Tectona (teak), Ochroma (balsa), Macaranga;(ii) trees of the consolidation phase, which are only capable of rapid growth when exposed, i.e. are light-demanding later in life, e.g. Swietenia, Shorea, Triplochiton (obeche), Khaya, Carapa; and (iii) the trees that are shade-bearers throughout life and are incapable of rapid growth in the sun. e.g. Ocotea. The pioneering syndrome was discussed in Chapter 5, but in terms of silviculture, its important features are the relative longevity of seeds, the large annual growth increments — 2 –10m in height (10m in Paraserianthes (Albizia) Jalcatoria), 10–20 cm in bole diameter the short lived nature of the tree and the light, perishable wood. The second group has shorter seed longevity and rarer seeding, germination in the open in some or in the shade in others, trees  living for 100–300 years and producing light to dark woods of medium weight. The last group is the least known: the trees grow very slowly, live at least 300 years and produce dark, heavy, close-grained wood, much of which is unusable. The manipulation of forest successional cycles can be seen as the ecological basis of tropical silviculture. The first-stage trees are largely used for pulp, while the second-stage ones are the bulk of the tropical timber industry. Many of these timbers are referred to as ‘mahogany’ of which some 200 sorts, many not true mahoganies (Meliaceae) but with timber features like them, have been listed. The third-stage timbers have specialized, if any, uses. Notable is greenheart, used for locks and harbour fittings and ports, as in the Panama Canal, for it withstands sea water well. Restrictions on silviculture in the tropics are most striking in the area of soil properties; for example, the pisolites of parts of West Africa are some 10 m deep with no obvious horizons and, although trees grow well at first , they later collapse and the removal of the forest leads to desolation resembling a gravel pit. Building on the experiences of mixed tree and herbaceous cropping, or agrisilviculture, elaborate ecologically-based schemes have been proposed, using a succession from grass and herb crops to shrubby and mixed perennial crops with an understorey of shade demanders. Such a system in Central America begins with maize and beans followed by cassava and banana and palms, then cocoa with rubber and, finally, timber trees of the Meliaceae. Pressures for increased production are forcing out the naturally regenerating forests as commercial propositions, though very specialized woods are difficult to grow otherwise. Plantations favour pioneers such as the pines, Pinus kesiya and P. merkusii, in the Indomalesian region. Plantations outyield by almost 10 times managed ‘natural’ forest and these pines have a long fibre suitable for pulp, but hardwoods, notably Eucalyptus spp. yield higher total amounts of dry matter, and the most productive may yield up to twice that of the best pines. Much research is now directed to the vegetative propagation of high-yielding clones, despite the potential danger of growing genetically identical monocultures over wide areas. Though increasing rapidly, plantation probably still occupies less than 18 million ha in the tropics (about 15% of the world's plantations), an area of the same order of magnitude as that lost to agriculture annually. Of all such plantations, 85% are of pines, teak or Eucalyptus. 9.1.3 Ranching In 1940, there were about 400000 km 2 of forest in Central America and this was reduced to about half by 1987, compared with perhaps 500000km 2 standing at the time of the arrival of Europeans in the early sixteenth century, when there was a large population: the Mayas with shifting cultivation and intensive terraced agriculture. With slavery and introduced disease, the population was reduced by 90% within two generations and, by 1550, there was a plantation economy exporting sugar, cocoa, indigo and cochineal but large amounts of the land originally cultivated reverted to forest. After independence in the 1820s, an expanding plantation economy removed the forest and became dominated by coffee and bananas, with a dangerous reliance on a few exports. With world price fluctuations in these commodities, diversification was sought by the 1940s, firstly cotton and then cattle. Beef demand in the United States increased to a level equivalent to 60 kg per head per annum by 1976, but increasing prices there encouraged commercial interest in Central American beef. However, such beef is lean as the animals are fed on grass rather than grain, so that it is fit only for the fast-food trade, one third of this meat goes into hamburgers. The trend was reversing by 1980 with American consumption falling and exports from Central America halved by 1985. Nevertheless, between 1950 and 1975 the amount of pasture doubled and between 1966 and 1978, perhaps as much as 80000km 2 of Brazil's forests disappeared in the formation of ranches. After the burning of the forest, pioneer trees appear and it is burnt again, and again the following year. The grass is then sown and it is periodically burnt thereafter to improve palatability. With the addition of legumes and appropriate management, it is alleged that pasture productivity can be maintained but the grasslands are quickly invaded by inedible weeds such that by 1978, 20% of the pasture area in Amazonia was degraded. There are also major problems with compaction and the abandoned ranches become covered in a stunted tangle of indigenous pioneers and exotics. 9.1.4 Fuel At present, only a small part of the fuel used in tropical countries is taken from tropical rain forest, little of it from ‘primary’ forest. Usually, it is gathered in scrub or secondary vegetation or local woodlots are utilized. Nevertheless, local supplies may become exhausted and, with an increase in  the use of charcoal, particularly in urban areas, forests far away are beginning to be affected. Thus forests far from Bangkok are being converted into charcoal, as are those of northwest Kenya for the Nairobi market. The reduction of fuel availability leads to the use of dung, some 400 million tons of which are burnt in Africa and Asia alone each year. On the face of it, this seems good, but it must be remembered that each tonne used for fuel instead of as a fertilizer means a yield loss of some of 50 kg in grain production, for example. 9.2 The prospects An attempt at modelling the future role of tropical forests in the world economy had the export of tropical hardwoods doubling between 1986 and 2000 with the opening up of industries in other countries. This demand was extrapolated from the projected growth in such countries' gross national product. There was a projected shift of leading exporters from south-east Asia to tropical America as domestic consumption increased in the Asia-Pacific regions and as stocks became depleted. Because of the time needed to grow trees, plantations already established would not, before 2020, be capable of balancing that removed from natural forests, which would, in consequence, be under continued pressure. Imposed management is a necessary desideratum, as 11.3 million ha of mature forest land is being lost annually. Of this, 5.1 million is being converted to forest fallow, of which, in 1982, there was 409 million, with only 1 million ha of unforested land being taken over by natural regeneration. Looking at different parts of the tropical world, it has been noted that by 1981 only 20% of all rain forests including tropical ones in Australia remained when compared with the total at European settlement (1788) and that there were only a few thousand ha left in northern Queensland, all accessible forest outside National Parks having been (or likely to be) logged, leaving an archipelago of ‘refugia’. By 1983, Costa Rica had lost 78% of its wet lowland forest and all of its dry; by 1987 the Indonesian rain forests had been reduced from 65 million ha to 20 million and the Philippines from 16 million to one, though both countries had by then banned the export of unprocessed logs. Only 5O of the Madagascar rain forest presently survives and little remains of the Atlantic coastal forest of Brazil. Myers has estimated that by the end of the century, at present rates, there will be only two relict blocks: western Brazilian Amazonia and Zaire, with smaller ones in New Guinea and the Guyana Shield of South  America, but that these are unlikely to last beyond 2050 because of cultivation as, for example, the population in Rondonia in south Brazilian Amazonia increased from 1100 in 1975 to well over a million by 1986, with an increase in cultivation from 1250km 2 to 10000 in 1982 and 17000 in 1986. With such projections, then, over the next few decades, the world will lose the bulk of the rain forest remaining today. Many thousands of species of plants and animals will become extinct. Myers estimates a rate of loss of species from tropical rain forest at 10000 a year and compares this to a major ‘evolutionary spasm’, but unlike previous ones such as the end of the dinosaurs, the present phase has the plants as well as the animals in decline. The explorers' accounts of the unending forests of the nineteenth century will seem as fabulous as mediaeval bestiaries. Politics and economics have heeded the advice of biologists and conservationists but little. Even where money could be made through tourism by conserving forests with their complement of birds and other animals to attract visitors, the animals have been shot and agriculture has encroached. This has led to the regazetting of boundaries and the diminishing of reserves. In this gloomy state of affairs, attention is being focused on the possibility of rehabilitation of habitats. This idea has borne some fruit in temperate countries, where spoil-tips, gravel-pits and other industrial eyesores have been returned to some sort of semblance of native vegetation with its associated fauna. What are the possibilities in the tropics? 9.2.1 Soils In the Upper Rio Negro Region of southern Venezuela, a study on the recovery of caatinga forest was carried out. Two plots were cut and one of these was burnt after cutting. Shortly afterwards, an area nearby was bulldozed to make way for radar-tracking equipment. The sites were reexamined (Figure 9.3) 3 years after the initial disturbance, and recovery measured in terms of vegetation composition, biomass, nutrient accumulation, soil characteristics and nutrient leaching. The cut site was densely populated with many species of forest trees, the tallest of which had developed as coppice, while the burnt site had a loose canopy of pioneering Cecropia spp. 7m tall, and the bulldozed site had a thin layer of herbs, notably Xyris sp. The nutrient levels in the soil were higher, even 3 years after disturbance, in both the cut and cut-and-burnt sites, than in the surrounding untouched forest, probably because of steady transfer of nutrients from the forest ash to the soil. In the bulldozed plots they were    lowest of all, because the topsoil had been removed. The above-ground biomass in the cut site was 1291 g/m 2 , in the cut-and-burnt 879 g/m 2 , while in the bulldozed only 77 g/m 2 . From these figures, it was calculated that it would take some 100 years for the cut and cut-and-burnt sites to attain biomass levels of the original forest, while for the bulldozed forests, it is estimated that 1000 years would be needed. Two forests in Costa Rica, one wet and one dry, also received cutting treatments. Biological features of the colonizing vegetation were seen to change with time and from the rate of change in these features a time for ecosystem recovery was calculated. Using mean seed weight, which increases with time, as a parameter, it was found that the dry site would take about 150 years to revert to the conditions obtaining in the original forest, whereas in the wet forest, the figure of 1000 years was obtained once again. This is far longer than in temperate ecosystems. On the Rio Negro in Amazonia it apparently takes 80 years to reach half the mature biomass, suggesting that a return to forest is possible. Total stocks of calcium and potassium increase, apparently because of atmospheric input, phosphorus through mobilization of insolubles in the soil and nitrogen partly by biological fixation. Nitrification is higher under slash-and-burn regimes than under primary forest in southwest Venezuela and is apparently regulated by ammonium activity. In northern Queensland, soil under rain forest had markedly higher organic carbon, nitrogen, acid-extractable phosphorus and exchangeable calcium, magnesium and potassium than soil under a 41-year-old plantation of Araucaria cunninghamii. The loss of nutrients here is probably due to the original clearing of the forest and subsequent uptake by the crop. Soil-nutrients have been found to be at similar levels as under mature forest, at least so far as phosphorus, organic carbon and nitrogen are concerned, though the pH and cation concentrations are higher. Lowuse sites were found to be depleted only in nitrogen though the heavily used ones were depleted of potassium and magnesium and possibly of calcium and phosphorus as well. The soils of the secondary fernlands of southwestern Sri Lanka are dominated by Dicranopteris linearis. Rain-forest litter in situ is reduced by 63% in I year, but only by 41.7% in the fernland; fernland litter is reduced by 24.6% in the forest but only 15.7% in situ. Immobilization of nitrogen occurs in both types in both sites but phosphorus is immobilized only in the fern litter. Burning of the Dicranopteris, which acts as a nutrient-conservation system, leads to its shooting out from the rhizomes but trees cannot get established. For the growth of a forest, the fires have to be stopped and some enrichment planting of  early successional species tried, e.g. Canarium zeylanicum (Burseraceae), Artocarpus nobilis (Moraceae) and Vitex pinnata (Verbenaceae), etc. to restore the tree cover. Losses of soil through erosion vary greatly: under closed forest it may be 2.55 t per ha per annum in Trinidad, less than a tonne in Java or 0.41 in French Guyana, while under secondary forest in Madagascar it was nil, but up to 9 t when cleared and cultivated. Under Eucalyptus plantation it was 0.025 but, under other crops, up to 59 t. Loss of organic matter in the upper layers of the soil was found to be at a rate of 9% per annum in the first 2 years in Trinidad, while after clear-felling and burning in Ghana, up to 13% was lost per annum and up to 33% of the cations. On volcanic soils in the Solomon Islands, even higher figures have been recorded. In 22 years, croplands in Costa Rica lost 60% of their calcium and 25% of their magnesium even though the fields in the first year were higher than the surrounding forest in these ions, through ash input. In Colombia, a forest of known bioelement constitution was subjected to treatments leading to burnt and unburnt fallow. These treatments led to cation losses of 100–240 kg per ha per annum calcium and 30–80 of magnesium, for example, but it was estimated that such would be restored through rainfall input over 10–20 years of fallow; the 1300 1400kg of nitrogen appears to be more easily replaced as fixation rates of 100–150 kg per ha per annum were recorded. When forest is cut in Amazonia, cations from the burn de-acidify the soil, releasing phosphorus from iron and aluminium compounds, but leaching rapidly removes the cations, only 18% of the standing crop potassium remaining after 3 years, while in crops only 3% of the nitrogen was incorporated (only 1 % in the edible parts), 12% of the calcium (1% in edible parts) 24%, potassium (4% in edible parts) and 5% of the phosphorus (1% in the edible parts). As the cations are leached, the acidity rises and the phosphorus becomes re-locked with the iron and aluminium, so that in some cases at least, phosphorus is the first limiting nutrient. In the Rio Negro region, there is a large increase in leachate of potassium, magnesium and nitrate in the first 2 years after burning, but, by the fifth year, it is not significantly different from those in undisturbed forest, when the general nutrient levels are similar to those in mature forest. Fires associated with cultivation volatilize 300–700kg nitrogen per ha from vegetation and surface-litter and a further 500–2000 disappear from the surface soils in the next year or two. If overall losses are estimated at 1000 kg per ha per year, then the 20–25 million ha under shifting cultivation or permanent conversion from forest to other uses, generate more than the total nitrogen  delivered by rivers to the oceans. At Turrialba in Costa Rica, the mineralization of nitrogen is higher in secondary forest there than in most forests so far measured elsewhere. With disturbance the rate is further increased by two or three times and then decreased to comparable levels after 6 months or so, the short-lived increase representing 300–400kg nitrogen released to the site. The nitrogen level in the microbial biomass was only 50% of the original 1 year after clearing and remained low; little mineralized nitrogen was lost to the atmosphere by denitrification but much may be retained low in the soil profile. From a practical viewpoint, it has been found that Eucalyptus deglupta becomes established best in enrichment sites rather than after clearing or burning, apparently because of greater nitrogen availability in the unburnt system. Such reduces the need for supplementary fertilizers. Amazon soils cannot provide nutrients from the parent material as can soils in temperate regions because the Basin has a Tertiary deposit of kaolinite derived from the sediments eroded from the surrounding highlands, but in some areas are patches of black soil, developed by the Indians for intensive cultivation by addition of organic matter. Such patches still retain high levels of fertility. Interest has therefore been taken in the effect of adding fertilizer in an attempt at rehabilitation. In a study, again in Costa Rica, the vegetation biomass, nutrient content and species composition were measured during the first year after clear-cutting of plots, some of which were treated with commercial inorganic fertilizer (70kg N, 87.5kg P and 166kg K per hectare) while others were planted with the pioneering Cecropia obtusifolia, as seedlings. These latter plots produced the highest biomass and nutrient standing crop while neither of these features was enhanced in similar plots that had been fertilized. The plots allowed to regenerate naturally were dominated by shrubs and trees on the unfertilized ones, though by herbs on those that had been fertilized. These latter had the lowest biomass and the lowest nutrient standing crop. In short, fertilization enhanced neither the build-up of biological materials nor the capture of nutrients by it. It merely retarded the successional process by enhancing the competitive ability of the herbs, in this case Phytolacca rivinoides (Phytolaccaceae), which dominated. A similar retardation has been recorded from Fiji where the fertilizer applied was some 195 kg P per hectare. Continuous agricultural crop production on tropical rain-forest lands hinges on the application of fertilizer and rather sophisticated advice and soil analyses year by year for success. Tropical soils often have too little zinc for rice or citrus, or molybdenum for legumes while reclaimed peats  have too little copper for many crops, while there are low levels of nitrogen and phosphorus almost everywhere. Some nitrogen-fixing trees are useful, e.g. Inga jinicil (Leguminosae), used as a coffee-shade in Mexico, fixes more than 40 kg nitrogen per ha per year, though I vera fixes none. Nitrogen-fixing bacteria inhabit the rhizosphere of some tropical grasses but the amounts fixed for sugar-cane and rice, about 30kg per ha per year at a maximum, are unlikely to satisfy crops, though they may be of significance in pasture and natural ecosystems. After clearing there seems to be a predictable cycle: firstly a phosphorus deficiency, then nitrogen, then phosphorus again. Nitrogen is abundant to begin with but there is an initial shortage of phosphorus because of its immobility, but nitrogen soon falls through leaching and uptake. Later, roots reach deeper phosphorus and this therefore is not limiting though nitrogen is, but later still all the phosphorus available has been taken up and is being recycled. Therefore in the early stages nitrogen and phosphorus fertilizer will improve growth, but the sooner the deep-rooted mycorrhizal species become established, the quicker there will be self-sufficiency in phosphorus, though phosphorus is likely to be limiting as the agroecosystem matures."
ACA ACA-J18-001 7.91 "CHAPTER SIX COEXISTENCE AND COEVOLUTION At its simplest, the relationship between animals and plants, with the exception of carnivorous plants, which are not restricted to the tropics, is one of eater and edible. We have seen how animal cycles are often associated with plant ones and how the activity of animals affects gap formation and mortality of plants. It is now time to examine in more detail the intricate relationships between plants and animals, beginning with ‘predation’ of plants by animals, or herbivory, its extent and plant resistance to it, then the interactions that are more clearly of advantage to plants, namely dispersal of propagules (i.e. genetic material at the diploid level) and pollination of flowers (i.e. dispersal of genetic material at the haploid level). Both would appear to have evolved from herbivory. 6.1 Herbivory and resistance to it Some of the earliest known fossil vascular plants, those of the Rhynie Chert of the Devonian 370m years ago, show damage, which might be attributable to biting arthropods. Cockroaches and dragonflies appeared in the Upper Carboniferous (300 m years ago), at the same time as the giant clubmosses, ferns and seed ferns; beetles are known from the Permian, and flies and wasps from the end of the Jurassic and Early Cretaceous when the angiosperms were diverging from their seed-fern ancestors. According to Southwood, phytophagy arose from both saprophagy, the consumption of decaying or at least dying plants, and from feeding on fallen propagules including spores and pollen grains, which led to living on the strobili themselves, a route followed by the extinct insect orders, Dictyoneurida and Diaphanopterida. The earliest known herbivorous vertebrate is the late Carboniferous pelycosaur,Edaphosaurus : it and other early herbivores were large (24m in length) and it has been suggested that size was an  adaptation to low-energy food, as their ancestors were carnivorous and smaller. It is generally held, then, that there were some 70 million years between the origin of the land plants and any significant herbivory by either invertebrates or vertebrates. Compared with animal tissues, those of land plants are low in fat and protein (and this is often built quite differently from animal protein), while cellulose is almost universal and the phenolic toughening compound, lignin, is found in all woody ones. Lignin, the mechanical pre-requisite for erect growth of any size, and thus the origin of trees and forests, is an effective herbivory deterrent. Tannin, another phenolic derivative, is common in the outer parts of land plants and is instrumental in the inactivation of proteolytic enzymes. The inedibility of the early land plants to animals and, apparently, fungi led to the great Coal Measures of the Carboniferous and thus to the fuel of the Industrial Revolution and thence the technology for the destruction of those forests' successors. Indeed, in large part, the problems of digestion have been associated with the rise of the organisms in the other kingdoms in response to these unused resources: bacteria as well as fungi, and, perhaps, their associations with both animals and plants, from rumen bacteria to mycorrhiza. This then allowed not only the efficient re-cycling of nutrients, enhancing plant growth, but also the opening of a ‘Pandora's Box’ in terms of the exploitation of plants by animals. Perhaps because of the symbiotic requirement for such exploitation, phytophagy is restricted within the   animal kingdom as shown in Table 6.1. In addition, there are problems concerning particular nutrients. Folivores (leaf-eaters) may satisfy their sodium requirement only by consuming soil or water plants, while animals like litter-feeding cockroaches in Amazonia would need to consume 30–40 times their energy requirement of litter to satisfy their phosphorus needs: in fact they eat dead animals as well. Today, herbivory in the crowns of mature trees in lowland rain forest in geographically distinct regions in the New and Old Worlds leads to 13.8–14.6% tissue loss in the leafy branches of trees, but consistently less in epiphytes, while in Ghana it has been shown that those plants with a rapid flush of leaves are consistently less severely attacked than those with a slower leaf production. Long-term observations of leaves in Australian forests, using labelled leaves and shoots, contrasted with the usual technique of measuring leaf damage on one occasion, gave much higher herbivory levels, particularly in temperate forests, since such measuring does not account for leaves totally eaten; ‘long-term’(3 months) study showed similar trends in tropical forests, where up to 21% losses were recorded. Closeness of conspecific plants can increase the rate and there are many examples (see Chapter 7) of increased attack of seedlings associated with closeness to the mother tree. This is not an exclusively tropical phenomenon: seedlings of Chinese Elm,Ulmus parvifolia , under the canopy of the mother tree at Albuquerque, New Mexico, were found to suffer some 580 times as much attack from the elm leaf beetle,Pyrrhalta luteola , as those beyond it. Damage due to phloem feeders can also be substantial; leaf feeders can be miners or raspers; there can be root feeders e.g. some insect larvae, nematodes, stem-miners and gall-formers where the allocation patterns of plants are over-ridden. Moreover, it is not just live tissues that are consumed as bark feeding is widespread among mammals, e.g. orangutans, elephants, rhinoceros and squirrels, besides many invertebrates. The stomach contents of the small squirrel,Sundasciurus lowii , on Siberut Island west of Sumatra, contain an average 4% bark in which 90% of its food trees are represented. This animal does not strip bark like other squirrels, but merely removes flakes of the large smooth-barked trees with low levels of hydrolysable tannins. The concentrations of fats, protein and carbohydrate and the calorific value of the bark of the different species seem to have no bearing on the choice of food. Of non-flowering plants, it has been argued that ferns have a lower associated insect fauna, though it has long been known that bracken has a large number of associated arthropods. In Costa Rica, three species of  different genera of ferns were examined and have been found to carry a fauna as rich as that on angiosperms; damage was just as great. Of fungi, spores, hyphae and spore bodies are eaten by a wide range of invertebrates and fleshy spore bodies soon become infested with maggots; snails rasp them; beetles lay their eggs in them; carrion-and dung flies take the foul-smelling slime of phalloids, while tortoises, rats, pigs, deer, macaques and probably other large mammals, in the Malay Peninsula at least, also eat them. 6.1.1 Plant resistance Herbivores are, of course, also affected by the carnivory regime, weather, and other physical features, but, in the groups of plants that have survived the animal onslaught, there has been evolution of defensive features, both physical and chemical. Bark loss is generally repaired by the formation of new bark, the inevitable result of secondary thickening in dicotyledons as the phloem dies. In some plants, thin roots are produced beneath the bark, thickening and coalescing, as in Ormosia nobilis (Leguminosae), while many palms (monocotyledons) have harder wood on the outside. Hormone analogues and other anti-herbivore compounds have evolved, followed by their being overcome by certain groups of herbivores, some even using the toxins in their own defence. For example, some Asclepiadaceae synthesize cardiac glycosides as defence but some danaid butterflies convert them to their own defences against carnivores, mainly birds. In turn, there are non-toxic mimics of those butterflies. In many plants, secondary compounds are concentrated in the trichomes and, for example, a ketone is thus concentrated in the hairs of tomato plants, but that same ketone has been found in the defence secretions of termites and caterpillars. Again, the male adults of certain danaids ingest material from withered Asclepiadaceae and Apocynaceae before mating and without this their pheromone systems are unable to function adequately to ensure successful mating; the dihydropyrrolizidines in their odour is similar to the heterocyclic moieties of the plants' pyrrolizidine alkaloids. Rubber latex is a physical defence but also contains insecticides; such occurs in unrelated genera in a range of families, such as Apocynaceae, Caricaceae, Guttiferae, Moraceae and Sapotaceae, while, in other families, there are defensive resins and gums. Latex is avoided variously by insects, e.g. the butterfly,Lycorea cleobaea , avoids papaya latex as the larvae make holes, isolating distal sections of the leaves in which latex flow is therefore  negligible; this also works on figs (Moraceae) and Asclepiadaceae. Other ‘defences’ such as resins may be actively collected as in the case of those gathered by euglossine bees in their ‘pollen baskets’from Anacardiaceae, Burseraceae and Leguminosae used in nest construction, sometimes with added bark fragments. Leaf-cutting bees in Malesia take resins from dipterocarps, Chalicodoma pluto, the world's largest bee, using resin to line its tunnels in the active nests of arboreal termites. The insects may be attracted by volatiles, in the way that heartwood borers are attracted from distances up to 2 km to felled Shorea robusta trees in India, as the resin is collected from wounds in the trunk. Such resins are known to inhibit the growth of certain fungi. It is known that attacks on plants by herbivores reduce the quality of the tissues for subsequent feeding. In poplars, it has been found that there are increased concentrations and rates of synthesis of phenolics within 52 hours of attack. This is also true in sugar maples, where it has been claimed that undamaged plants near the damaged ones have increased levels of phenolics and hydrolyzable and condensed tannins, suggesting an airborne cue from the damaged to the undamaged, which then become less attractive to herbivores. Such increases in tannin in browsed Acacia nigrescens in southern Africa have been reported to take place in a few minutes and the production of ethylene during damage has been considered to be the promoter of tannin increase. With such rapid production, it would be advantageous for a particular plant to do this as browsers would move away from branches near the wounded ones. Certainly in the tiny weed beloved of geneticists, Arabidopsis thaliana (Cruciferae), wounding and other stimuli promote the expression of touch-induced (TCH) genes: within 10–30 minutes, messenger RNA levels associated with at least four genes increase 100-fold. Ethylene has been suggested as being involved in some but not all of this, the products including materials of the calmodulin type, materials involved in the metabolism of calcium ions and therefore many growth processes: in this case the change to ‘bolting’. Although twice as high a proportion of tropical plants contain potentially toxic alkaloids compared with extra-tropical ones and, although these are often concentrated in the young tissues of plants, insects specializing on such tissues may have rather unsophisticated problems compared with those feeding on mature leaves, where so much ‘secondary chemistry’ is manifest. It should be pointed out, though, that were it not for the attacks through evolutionary time of these herbivores, there would be none of the commercially significant heartwoods, latexes and resins so useful to  humans. On Barro Colorado Island, herbivory rates and defence mechanisms of young and mature leaves of 46 canopy species were observed throughout the year: leaf properties such as toughness, phenolic content, pubescence, water, fibre and protein contents accounted for over 70% of the variation in herbivory, with leaf toughness most highly correlated. Mature leaves of pioneers were attacked six times as much as canopy species. In 70% of all species, young leaves suffered more than old ones, though they have two to three times the phenol concentrations. It has been suggested that pioneers are able to tolerate high rates of herbivory because of their ‘cheaper’ leaves and faster growth rates. For a given herbivore pressure, the advantage of defence should increase as the potential maximum growth rate declines. This is confirmed by nutrient-poor soils such as kerengas in Malesia having no poorly-defended, fast-growing trees. In Africa, comparison of forest on white sands in Cameroun with that on better soils in Kibale, Uganda, showed that the first had trees with higher concentrations of tannins and other phenolics, though in Kibale there were more species producing alkaloids. In Bako National Park, Sarawak, it was found that in terms of percentage leaf area consumed, young leaves of Eugenia ochrocarpa (Myrtaceae) were eaten no more than mature ones, the damage being due to edge grazing, mining and holing (in that order in both), whereas the leaves of the dipterocarp Shorea species were not significantly eaten as adults. Young leaves of both had higher enzyme inhibition than older ones, though levels of condensed tannin were unchanged. With more nitrogen, less condensed tannin and less enzyme inhibition in the young leaves of Shorea compared with Eugenia, it is not surprising to discover that they suffered more damage. When forests in the Malay Peninsula (Kuala Lompat) and northern Borneo (Sepilok) were phytochemically compared, and the levels of nitrogen, fibre, total phenolics and condensed tannin, and degree of digestibility by both cellulase and pepsin determined for both young and old leaves of the canopy species from both places, that at Kuala Lompat was found to be more digestible in having higher nitrogen but lower fibre and phenolic levels. Sepilok is typical of the dipterocarp forests of the region and the trees have high levels of quantitative defences, whereas Kuala Lompat, which is unusually rich in leguminous species by comparison with dipterocarps, has trees with less reliance on them. The study was carried out on trees of greater than 30 cm girth at breast height and it was suggested that the differences between the sites were due to the soils, the podzols of Sepilok being less fertile than those at Kuala Lompat. 6.1.2 Some mammals The Colobinae are a group of monkeys with sacculated stomachs with associated bacteria and flagellates, and they show the best adaptations to leaf eating, allowing the use of coriaceous leaves, though all species eat at least some fruit and seeds. However, there are marked variations in biomass of Colohus spp. in Africa and Presbytis spp. in Asia in different forests and these cannot be explained in terms of the overall degree of herbivory of an individual species or its body size, both of which are known to be correlated with biomass in primates as a whole. At Sepilok, the biomass is 64 kg per km 2 but 876 kg per km 2 at Kuala Lompat, 153 in Gabon and 1849 in Kibale. In studies at these sites, correlations were found between feeding and nitrogen levels in young and mature leaves, but a negative relation with fibre; the effect of condensed tannins was less obvious but colobines most frequently ate leaves low in this. There was no strong correlation between the levels of condensed tannins and palatability , for, despite the debilitating effect of tannin on digestion in vitro, it is clear that the precise types of tannin, the substrate and probably other substances, besides the possibility of interspecific differences in the tolerances of them, all affect the edibility. Colobines select foliage maximizing nitrogen and mineral input and minimizing digestibility retardant fibre (and possibly some tannins): alkaloids seem not to be a deterrent as many can probably be detoxified by bacteria in the foregut. The biomass of colobines shows a close positive correlation with the ratio of protein to fibre at each site, while there is no evidence of predation or disease limiting the populations. It is likely that the protein/fibre ratios for mature leaves represent the degree to which colobines avoid them and rely on more limited and seasonal resources with a concomitant decrease in population density notably at times when the preferred foods are scarce, especially at Sepilok and in Gabon. Presbytis melalophos (banded leaf-monkey) at Kuala Lompat and P. rubicunda (red leaf-monkey) at Sepilok spend about half their time eating leaves, favouring high-protein, low-fibre foliage found especially in young leaves. P. melalophos is able to eat foliage from many canopy species in its home range, while P. rubicunda relies on rare trees and lianes. As there are many dipterocarps at Sepilok, the rarity of food plants there is held to be the main reason for the greater home range and lower population density compared with P. melalophos at Kuala Lompat: the home range is some 70–84ha compared with 31.5. It may be that the oleoresins of the dipterocarps have an effect on the bacteria of the fore-stomach of colobines and it is now necessary to study the interaction of these bacteria with fibre  and the wide range of tannins, some of which shield protein from degradation in the fore-stomach, or denature them so as to enhance proteolysis. On white sands in Cameroun, where tannin levels are much higher, black colobus monkeys avoid all canopy trees and feed selectively on gap species and, unlike other colobines on other soils, have to feed on seeds, which make up half their diet. Phytophagous bats take principally fruit or flower products, though some take leaves, extracting fluids and rejecting solids. The sloths, arboreal herbivores with stomachs and digestive systems showing convergence with ruminants, at least the two-toed (Choloepus hoffmani) and three-toed (Bradypus infuscatus) on Barro Colorado Island, feed on at least 31 species, not just one or two as was long-believed, and it is estimated that they consume about 14.7 g dry weight of leaves each day in the case of the three-toed sloth, a cropping-rate of 5.1 g of leaf per kg of sloth per day, whereas howler monkeys crop at seven times this rate. The low rate in sloths is probably associated with their lower metabolic rate (51% lower than other mammals of comparable size) and daily lowering of body temperature. The effect is to maintain more animals on the same food supply, but with less metabolically active individuals, so that retention or re-evolution of poikilothermy is part of a syndrome of cryptic, relatively sedentary individuals with relatively high opportunities for contact and mating: 8.5 three-toed sloths and 1.2 two-toed sloths per ha. Their biomass totals 22.9 kg per ha, 73% of arboreal mammal biomass on Barro Colorado Island and they crop 38 kg leaves per ha per annum(40–60% of their diet), whereas the howlers take 52.8 kg, reflecting their higher metabolic rates and less ruminant-like digestion: they are therefore less efficient, even though at a lower density and biomass and with a smaller percentage of leaves in their diet. By comparison with that of insects, sloth herbivory there is low: about 0.63% of leaf production, but some ‘modal’ trees, targeted by sloths can lose as much as 7.7% and one tree suffered 20% loss. Sloth faeces, estimated to contain half the leaf material, are returned to the ground around the trees: the three-toed sloth actually buries them! The largest living lemur, Indri indri, weighs 9 kg and lives in the Madagascar rain forests, feeding mainly on leaves, 40–70% of sightings being of buds and young leaves being eaten, though fruits, seeds, dead wood and earth (possibly involved in improving the physical texture of the food) are also taken. Spider monkeys (A teles geoffreyi) on Barro Colorado Island eat leaves, which account for about 20% of their fresh weight intake and provide most of their protein, notable being the protein-rich young shoots of Poulsenia armata (Moraceae) and Ceiba pentandra (Bombacaceae), which  has 25.3% dry weight protein, and Cecropia leaves, especially their petioles, which have high mineral content. Leaves make up 15% wet weight of the diet of the omnivorous white-throated capuchin monkey (Cebus capucinus) on Barro Colorado Island. In Gabon, the prosimian Euoticus elegantulus, by contrast, has gums from trees and lianes making up 75% of food intake. These gums are highly polymerized pentoses that have to be broken down by bacteria, which release nutrients roughly equivalent to the yields from fruits. Gorillas eat only, or at least concentrate on, 29 species including some with apparent deterrents, including the viciously stinging hairs on the shoots of Laportea alatipes (Urticaceae), but these 29 species lack condensed tannins. Important all-year-round foods of the lowland gorilla in Gabon include the large ground-living herbaceous Marantaceae and Zingiberaceae, which are also consumed by chimpanzees, pygmy chimpanzees, mandrills and elephant as well as being browsed by duiker, bongo, buffalo and so on. They are important in the forest, especially in light gaps, representing about 230 kg of food per ha in the forest for such animals. In western Ghana, the elephant (the forest elephant, Loxod onta africana cyclotis, of central and west Africa, subspecifically distinct from the elephant of east and south Africa) browses some 138 different plant species, mostly lianes for leaves and stems, but also 35 different types of fruit. The number of tree species with high proportions of ‘barked’ trees is low, but bark of a few species is pulled off in strips up to 10m long as seen in Bombax brevicuspe (Bombacaceae) and Lannea welwitschii (Anacardiaceae). Through their activity, browsing areas (gaps) are maintained as well as seeds dispersed. The Asiatic elephant favours rattan, as do squirrels, while young rattans are used in pig-nests. The ‘deterrent’ compounds of many rain-forest plants are used (and have been fought over in major wars) by humans to flavour food, e.g. cinnamon (bark of Cinnamomum verum, Lauraceae), tea (alkaloids and tannin of Camellia sinensis, Theaceae) leaves, ginger (rhizome of Zingiber officinale, Zingiberaceae) and seeds such as nutmeg (Myristica fragrans, Myristicaceae), cardamom (Elettaria cardamomum, Zingiberaceae), and coffee (Coffea arabica, Rubiaceae), and cloves (flower buds of Syzygium aromaticum, Myrtaceae). Many others have to be removed (or have been bred out) during preparation of food, e.g. the raphides of many Araceae and the cyanide-containing compounds in cassava (Manihot esculenta, Euphorbiaceae). What such compounds ‘taste’ like to other animals is difficult to ascertain, but sometimes very different flavours are due to quite subtle chemical differences between compounds, the sweet taste of vanillin, for example, giving way to the hot and pungent zingerone when condensed with acetone and its double bond reduced, while pungency itself can be explained as to its relative strength by the replacement of particular groups in the molecule. Gymnemins from Gymnema sylvestre (Asclepiadaceae) remove the sense of sweetness in some mammalian tongues, but are not deterrent to caterpillars and have less effect on dogs or rabbits than they do on apes. They appear to have no effect at all on pigs, rats or guinea-pigs. Thaumatin, which seems sweet to primates is not perceived thus by dogs, hamsters, pigs or rabbits. 6.1.3 Some invertebrates Other compounds have been used to fend off micro-organisms, e.g. ‘fever barks’ such as quinine from Cinchona officinalis (Rubiaceae) angostura bitters from certain South American Rutaceae, and timbers such as sandalwood (Santalum album, Santalaceae) and camphor (Cinnamomum camphora, Lauraceae). They are used to ‘tan’ leather and give rise to the ‘termite-proof’and ‘teredo-proof’timbers so prized in tropical construction. Humans also exploit the foliage of plants with natural insecticides such as those containing anti-feedant triterpenoids, notably the cucurbitacins in Cucurbitaceae, but especially azadirachtin and other limonoids from Meliaceae, that from Azad irachta indica being very important: even desert locusts will not attack it. Some of the most spectacular herbivory, besides the outbreaks of caterpillars mentioned in Chapter 4, and other ‘outbreak’ insects of the last chapter, are due to the activities of leaf-cutting ants, the Attini, which occur between 25° north and south of the equator in the Neotropics. The species of the genus Atta and Acromyrmex cultivate (possibly different strains of) a basidiomycete fungus, Attamyces bromatificus, which allows them to overcome a wide range of plant defences and to be polyphagous in a diverse environment. They also take sap from cut leaves and this is the principal, if not sole, larval food, sometimes avoiding leaves that would be good substrates for cultivating the fungus, but which are variously repellent to ants. They attack high-protein leaves, more acidic ones having less available protein, the optimum pH for the fungus (pH 5) being reached when the material is mixed with the ants' acidic faeces: then the fungus can break down the hydrolysable tannin/protein complexes. Atta cephalotes builds nests up to 150 m 2 in surface area, containing up to 5 million workers, ranging from minima 2 mm long to the largest soldier 20mm long with medians about 10mm long, which do most of the leaf  cutting. The minima act as nurses and tend the fungus garden fed on leaves. The leaves are cleaned and the cuticle scratched, thus aiding fungal decay; the ants cut and chew the pieces into fragments, which are mixed with saliva as well as faeces before being put in the garden, the swollen tips (gongylidia) being collected by the ants for food. The gongylidia undergo enzymatic hydrolysis of their cellular components. This seems to be associated with the development of lipoproteic particles and the resultant material, unlike the ordinary hyphae, are edible. The fungus lacks some proteolytic enzymes, which are added in the ant faeces and are derived from the gongylidia, the ants merely acting as translocators, their digestive tracts not breaking them down. A small piece of fungus is carried by a founding queen in her buccal pouch before her mating flight. Some plants are immune to attack because of their terpenoids, some of which are volatile and affect the fungus, i.e. plant protection from leaf cutting is achieved by the synthesis of an antifungal agent. The nests may persist for up to 20 years and such a nest in rain forest can completely defoliate a major tree in a single night. It takes some 5 or 6 years for a nest to produce sexual insects, so that it would appear that the complete defoliation of the immediate area or the removal of the more palatable species would lead to deteriorating conditions for the ants. In other words, in the long term, the maximum energy return for a given energy output in the short term would seem inappropriate. Evidence suggests that, on the contrary, grazing pressure is evenly spread throughout the area exploited, that area is related in size to the size of the nest and that it is defended against competing leaf-cutting ants and that a wide range of plant species is exploited. When the forest is felled, however, and replaced by monocultures of, for example, fruit trees, with a much reduced number of leaves per hectare, the system breaks down and there is often widespread crop damage. Among leaf-cutting ant populations under more natural conditions, inter- and intra-specific competition are some of the factors controlling overall numbers. Aggression leads to the death of founding queens and small colonies (or their emigration). Ants, which may make up to half of the animal biomass in some habitats, are not always involved in such an apparently one-sided relationship with plants, as we have seen in the case of the myrmecophytic epiphytes. Ant plants are not necessarily found in nutrient-poor sites and many so-called ant-plant species sometimes have ants in them but sometimes do not, e.g. species of Aphanamixis and Chisocheton (Meliaceae) and many examples seem to show that the presence is due to‘casual’ entrance through wounds suffered by the trees through damage by other animals or tree falls and so on . The most widespread plant feature that attracts ants, however, is extrafloral nectar, produced from special glands. Although attractive to several types of insects, such secretions are usually involved in ant attraction and the ants protect their ‘host’ from attack by other animals. The chemistry involved here is scarcely different from ‘normal’, when compared with the elaboration of ‘secondary’ compounds in defence. They are found at various points on plants, including fruits as on those of Crescentia spp. and in 15 other genera of Bignoniaceae, and the nectar may make up substantial parts of the ant diet as in the case of the extrafloral nectar of Caularthron bilamellatum (Orchidaceae) of Central America, which comprises up to 48% of the associated ants' diet at some times of the year. The presence of ants allows Bixa orellana (Bixaceae), a dye plant with nectaries on the nodes and pedicels, to mature twice as many seeds as antless individuals, while Aphelandra scabra (A. deppeana, Acanthaceae) with nectaries on the bracts matures nine times as many fruits as plants deprived of their ants. Species of Inga (Leguminosae) with them on their rachis have herbivore damage reduced by a third or even a half. Moreover, parasitoids may also feed at the nectaries and then infect insect larvae by oviposition thereafter and, in Inga, this seems effective in control at altitudes where ants are uncommon. Ants are also attracted by lipid- or protein-rich food bodies, e.g. lipid in Macaranga spp. (Euphorbiaceae), protein in Acacia spp. (Leguminosae) but carbohydrate in Cecropia spp. (Cecropiaceae). Piper cenocladum (Piperaceae) in the understorey of Costa Rican forests has a petiolar chamber formed by the adpressed margins of a flattened petiole and this is usually occupied by Pheidole bicornis ants. Only when the ants are present, however, does the plant produce significant numbers of food bodies, which are lipid-storing single-celled ones developing from the adaxial surface of the petiole. In this and other ant-inhabited species of Piper in Costa Rica, the ants remove encroaching climbers and it is argued that the plants absorb nutrients from the decaying nest material of the ants. However, where ant presence promotes food-body production, certain (Phyllobaenus) beetle larvae prey on the ants; such can be found inhabiting plants even in the absence of the ants and their presence causes the food bodies to grow, while herbivore damage seems to increase. The beetles are clearly parasitic on the system. The climber-pruning habit is known in several other genera and was first documented in Central American A cacia Spp. The origin of such pruning is possibly associated with the discouragement of other invading ants, for it is more frequently found  in ant species with stinging rather than other chemical defences. In Peru, where uncuttable contacts were made to plants of Triplaris americana (Polygonaceae), Crematogaster ants invaded more frequently than otherwise, even carrying off larvae and usurping the resident Pseudomyrex dendroicus. On Cordia nodosa (Boraginaceae), however, invaders did not increase under these conditions, perhaps because the plant is so pubescent and therefore impassable to large ants in any case: only when lianes occupied by the smaller Crematogaster ants came near did the resident Allomerus demerarae attack. Liane deterrence may thus be a side benefit and it is possibly attained in other plants by different mechanisms as in the case of some tree ferns, where marcescent fronds may deter both lianes and epiphytes. In Barteria nigritana (Passifloraceae) in Africa, one coastal subspecies is inhabited by one species of ant; however, the more widespread other subspecies has another ant species, but again not all specimens are infected. In Nigeria, saplings occupied by Pachysima aethiops have more leaves and branches and less attack than those without but, because the few larger workers have a ferocious sting and the habit of dropping from the crown, it is suggested that they may have been effective against large browsing mammals too; the ants also attack nearby plants and keep the host's leaves clear of debris and epiphyllae. In Leonardoxa africana (Leguminosae) in Cameroun, there are extra-floral nectaries and swollen internodes occupied by ants in some parts of its range with different ant species involved in different areas. The ant, Petalomyrex phylax, is apparently restricted to the plant and protects its stem apices from attack. Indeed, in some sites Leonardoxa trees are unable to reach maturity without the ants. Another ant species, Catallaucus mackeyi, does not protect the tree and also keeps Petalomyrex ants away: it is therefore a parasite on the system. The long-lived leaves are not patrolled but have an effective chemical defence. Daemonorops verticillaris and D. macrophylla (Palmae) are rattans characteristically associated with resident ants in Malesia: their nests are made of plant hairs and sometimes spines as well and they can absorb 185% water by weight. 14C in throughfall is absorbed by the rattan through the nest, and falling debris around its apex, particularly in D. verticillaris, yields nutrients in throughfall and these are also absorbed via the nest. In other plants, nutrients flowing down stems are absorbed through the root system, but here they apparently pass straight into the stem. If disturbed, the ants beat on the stem, alerting predators, possibly elephants, with an alarming noise. Other ‘domatia’ are more substantial structures and are known from over 400 species (half in America, fewest in Africa) in over 30  genera of trees and lianes: in A cacia they are in stipular thorns but in the rest they are in the stems, where the stems are sometimes swollen as in some species of Clerodendrum (Verbenaceae). These are sometimes naturally hollow with ants biting entrance holes at thin-walled points while others have natural invaginations. In Cecropia, the pith stops growth before the stem reaches its full diameter and the Azteca queen enters through a thin unvascularized membrane at the top of an internode. As the brood grows, workers chew through septa in the shoots and kill or seal off other queens, after which the whole tree is taken over. Even in the absence of ants, the tuber of the epiphytic Myrmecodia develops but the ants, usually species of Iridomyrex, keep broods in smooth chambers, placing debris in warted ones: the release of nutrients may be facilitated by the presence of fungi. Myrmec odia plants are patrolled by ants, especially along the stems, where they gather nectar and are protected by stipules or spines. Some ferns are similar, e.g. Lecanopteris spp. (Polypodiaceae) one of which is spiny, the spines being used in ant ‘carton’ runways. The neotropical fern Solanopteris bifrons has complex rhizomatous sacs in which ants leave debris and then roots enter while detritus traps of many ferns with polymorphic leaves are often inhabited by ants: the ants get nectar from nectaries on the fronds. Other such epiphytes include some bromeliads and several orchids, where ants live in hollow pseudobulbs or between the roots. In Dischidia (Asclepiadaceae), there is a range of form associated with increasing involvement between the different species and the ant, Iridomyrex cordatus. Dischidia nummularia has lens-shaped leaves with no ant-association, while D. parvifolia in the Malay Peninsula with similar leaves is associated with Crematogaster ants, which, in the mountains, make tunnels at the bases of Leptospermum flavescens trees and take Dischidia seeds inside such that plants germinate in the insect frass there, such that their distribution is thereby associated with that of the tree. In D. cochleata the leaves are arched with edges pressed against the trunk, adventitious roots and ant broods with debris underneath, while in D. major (D. rafflesiana), the leaf forms a sac into which ants and adventitious roots go, though the nests are elsewhere. Inside are stomata (the few outside are small and probably permanently closed), which probably gain  from the ants and decaying material, reduce transpiration loss and also improve the oxygen and moisture regimes for the ants. D. pectenoides (Philippines) has an inturned lip rolled back on itself such that inner chambers are produced in the sacs, though the adventitious roots enter only the outer ones. The so-called myrmecophytes are found in all continents and are  represented in about 20 families of angiospers, notably Rubiaceae and Leguminosae. Almost all of them are found in regrowth, e.g. species of Cecropia and Piper, where the chewing off of competing plants is important. Endospermum formicarum (Euphorbiaceae) is the Arbor Regis of Rumphius, who named it thus because it is untouched by other trees. The ferocity of ants in attack is a consequence of their haplodiploid sex determination: sisters in a brood are genetically identical with half of one another and half identical with the rest (their fathers being haploid), so that, on average, they are 4 identical to sisters and only half to offspring. Ant species that are not so aggressive avidly remove insect eggs from foliage and generally ‘spring-clean’ the host. The ants are broadly-based, e.g. almost all ant-fed epiphytes in Asia are visited by Iridomyrex cordatus, while many different ant species service plants with extrafloral nectaries. Similarly, Peruvian myrmecophytes appear to have a range of possible inhabiting ant species and these may compete for occupation. Plants with defence ti-ichomes are suited to the smaller species as the larger ones have to cut a path through them and are therefore at a disadvantage. In the Malay Peninsula, there is just one ant species, Crematogaster borneensis, for all infected species of Macaranga (Euphorbiaceae). This ant does not sting and cannot live away from its hosts; although it does not bring in nutrients, it protects the host from herbivore and liane damage. The queen sheds her wings on entering the internode and seals the entrance, but coccids, attracted by food bodies on the leaves, are cultured within. Some ant chambers contain fungi and these are kept in check by nematodes (cf. fig syconia discussed below) and many species tend sap-sucking Homoptera: aphids most commonly in temperate regions, coccids (scale insects) in the Old World tropics and membracids (tree hoppers) in the New, and these are a drain on the host-plant. Domatia on the abaxial surface of leaves are usually small invaginations or hair tufts in the axils of the veins. Of 32 species studied in cultivation (these representing 18 different families), all but one had their domatia (‘acarodomatia’) containing mites (Arachnida) and 75% of them held mite eggs. A high percentage had beneficial mites, a much lower percentage had harmful ones. It can be argued that these associations serve as shelters and nurseries for mites, which, in turn, eat herbivorous arthropods and pathogens, a general theory put forward by Lundstrom over a century ago. As domatia are found on crops like coffee, the phenomenon may be of agricultural significance. However, insects such as the harmful scale insects are sometimes found there too. The weighing up of ‘advantages’ and ‘disadvantages’here and in general is extremely difficult and will change with time and locality. Furthermore, defences — mechanical or chemical properties such as tannins, which make digestion hard (though the effect greatly varies in magnitude), or toxins such as alkaloids — are no deterrent to some animals. There may be variations in toxin levels with the season, and animals, in any case, eat different parts of plants with different levels of toxin and, at different stages of their own development, may be able to deal differently with such toxins. It has been suggested that alkaloid level fluctuations may affect the feeding patterns of orang-utans through the day. The relationship between herbivores and plants has often been seen as some kind of arms race, but there have been opposing views in that, for example, spittle-bugs in the dry tropics of West Africa, rather than depleting valuable water resources may promote microbial activity beneath particular tree species, allowing them to take up nutrients in the dry season from the surface layers of the soil, provided that other roots can tap a deep water source. Such are the ‘raining trees’ of Africa. This attractive hypothesis has been extended to other groups of plants and their ‘consumers’ suggesting that under certain circumstances plants may benefit from those animals that feed on them and, indeed, may positively ‘encourage’such herbivory. The step from predation to this symbiosis is a short one. One such hypothesis with respect to tropical trees argues that the solid bole of a tree locks up an enormous amount of nutrients and that, if this could be recycled by ‘employing’ micro-organisms to rot down the heartwood, thus providing a roost for animals whose nests and droppings would subsequently rot too, the roots of long-lived organisms like trees would be prevented from exhausting local resources and competing with other roots, and the chemicals produced to prevent heartrotting would be saved. The discovery of a species of Guarea (Meliaceae) with its own roots growing up into its hollow trunk, shortcircuiting the nutrient cycle, seemed excellent evidence in support of the hypothesis, though in Jamaica it was found that many such hollow trees were full of roots, but some of them were from trees that were not merely different individuals, but of different species! 6.2 Frugivory and dispersal Compared with pollination, the process of seed dispersal is more closely associated with the depleting of plant materials. Indeed, the line between  ‘predation’ and dispersal mechanism is hazy in that plants with a small numbers of seeds in any season may lose the whole crop to ‘dispersal agents’. Rather than try to disentangle the scores of relationships examined between animals and plants in this area by putting them into categories of predation or dispersal mechanism, an attempt is made to look at the relationships of particular taxonomic groups of animals and their food plants. The seeds of 50–90% of tropical trees and shrubs are dispersed by vertebrates and much of the vertebrate fauna up to 80% in Peru for example is supported by fruit. The seeds of herbs may be dispersed by large mammals, which eat and pass plant material in bulk: many such seeds have up until recently been considered to exhibit merely ‘gravity’ dispersal, when looked at in isolation from the rest of the plant. The leaves of such plants may therefore have ‘fruit features’, even though the original megafauna has been removed from many tropical and temperate habitats. Such dispersal mechanisms are associated with small seeds, which suffer less damage in the mouth and enjoy a rapid passage through the gut, possibly aided by their laxative qualities as in Plantago spp. (Plantaginaceae, long-used medicinally by humans). Moreover, anti-insect toxins may become attractants for mammals as in the case of cabbage and onions in humans. Fruits are generally protected from ‘wrong’ animals and microbes, and protect the seeds from climatic extremes and predation. During development, they expand from hard, small and inedible to large, soft and edible, often containing a wide range of compounds toxic to a wide range of organisms. As they ripen, the toxicity may fall as in Passiflora spp. where the cyanide content declines to 1% of its original strength and oxalates in other fruits may disappear altogether. Indeed, relative to other ‘prey’, fruits have evolved to be generally accessible, conspicuous and rather digestible when ripe. In frugivore diets in those Neotropical forests examined, species with black fruits outnumber those with red and, in Florida and Europe as well as Costa Rica and Peru, the proportion of species with fruits of one or both of these colours is some 62–66%. However, it must be remembered that red and orange are conspicuous to neither insects, nor, probably monkeys, and bats are colourblind. A complicating factor, so often seen in evolution, involves the ‘cheats’, for there are many species with non-nutritious seed appendages but coloured so as to mimic them, e.g. species of Ormosia and Rhynchosia (Leguminosae). Fruits contrasting in colour with unripe ones, or with bracts, peduncles or calyces are common, and seeds may contrast vividly with their dehisced fruits or be bicoloured: the combination of black with red occurs in 18% of all fruit ‘displays’ in both  Costa Rica and Peru, whereas red, orange, white and yellow tend to occur alone. Uniformly blue berries that are familiar in certain temperate Ericaceae seem to be particularly associated with the attraction of pheasants, at least in the Malay Peninsula, where they are found in Pollia spp. (Commelinaceae), Peliosanthes teta (Liliaceae) and Labisia longistylis (Myrsinaceae) in the undergrowth there. At one extreme, some plants produce many small, nutritionally poor fruits that attract a wide range of ‘poor quality’ dispersers, while at the other, some produce a smaller number of large, nutritionally superior fruits, dispersed by a limited number of species. Rarely, though, has it been demonstrated that only one species is associated with dispersal, in contrast to several examples known of one-to-one pollinator-pollinated relationships. On the contrary, the majority of studies of birds, for example, show that a wide range of species visits particular fruiting trees. Even the ‘specialized’ high-reward fruits of some Lauraceae may have the seeds dispersed by more than 17 species of bird. Such birds may vary widely in morphology and taxonomic affinity. Most studies of this type have yet to evaluate the efficiency of such species as dispersers rather than visitors or feeders, but in cloud forest of Costa Rica, where three pioneer tree species were found to be visited by six bird species, only three left seeds in a viable condition, the ‘seed shadows’, found by radio-tracking, extending up to 500m from the parent tree. Despite the apparent closeness of the relationship between the three plant species and the three bird ones, this is illusory in that all three plant species are geographically and altitudinally widespread in tropical America, whereas the birds are much more restricted; moreover, the food gained from these plants is a very small proportion of the birds' diet. Indeed, most frugivores are variously omnivorous, though oilbirds, manikins, bell-birds and cotingas in the Neotropics may be essentially obligate, while many ‘carnivores’ often take fruits. When non-exclusive fruit-eating passerines (in Israel) were kept on exclusively fruit diets, they lost weight as the protein digestibility increased: they ingested more energy and protein than was required but digested less, suggesting that the fruits may contain agents that reduce the efficiency of nitrogen metabolism, such that dispersal is improved because birds must move away from the fruit source to seek out insects or other animal proteins to balance their diet. Moreover, the effect of avian frugivores on insect frugivores may be to force the latter to eat unripe fruits or leave the host, lest they be eaten by omnivorous birds. Again, larvae in fruits may improve the bird diet! In pollination, the target for pollen is a stigma, which pollinators are  encouraged by a number of lures and mechanical devices to brush, whereas the target sites for seeds are particular points suited to germination. In few cases a dispersal agent does deliver a seed directly to such a target other than by chance. Exceptions would be certain Loranthaceous and Viscaceous seeds, which birds remove from their bills by brushing them through bark crevices, or the passage of seeds through an animal to germinate in its dung. Indeed, many seeds will not germinate unless they have undergone such passage or, at least, had the nutritious outer integument of the seed, an aril, removed. Again, the deposition of pollen is timed to suit its germination in that stigmas and anthers are synchronized, whereas the site for germination of a seed may occur randomly in time as well as space in the regenerating gaps of forest. A habitat specificity of a pollinator would improve pollination success; however it can be argued that in a dispersal agent this would lead to increased predation of seedlings. spread of disease and sibling competition, while it must be remembered that a site suited to germination of a particular tree species is no longer suited once an adult is in that place. Furthermore, pollinators are directed to suitable target sites for deposition of pollen by a series of rewards at those sites, whereas dispersers are not and indeed, jettisoning of the ‘ballast’ from their food as rapidly as possible is to their advantage: food may take 10 to 20 minutes to pass through a bat or small bird, though up to several months in animals like the rhinoceros. A plant could in theory ‘specialize’ in a few generalist dispersers, just as a frugivore could specialize on a plant dispersed by many other species. In short. there is no theoretical reasoning for supposing that there should be mutual ‘co-evolution’ of dispersers and dispersed plants. On the contrary, a wide range of dispersal agents would allow a larger number of individuals to strip the tree of fruit at its prime and it would then be distributed to a wider range of habitats and be buffered against any disaster that might overcome the dispersal agent of a species relying on just one such agent. So far as the dispersers are concerned, being generalist would overcome the problems of poor years of any particular plant species, which, in any case, rarely fruit continuously throughout the year. Furthermore, the common dispersal agents of tropical seeds are much larger than the pollination agents: few of them complete a life-cycle that would be compatible with the short flower-to-fruiting cycles of plants, more suited in this respect to close associations with insects, as in pollination. Not surprisingly, therefore, a number of large, principally frugivorous birds undergo marked seasonal movements during the year, in response to local variations in fruit abundance. 6.2.1 Birds With these general views in mind, the relationship between different groups and their plants will be examined. Tropical bats and other mammals, particularly primates, and also lizards, may take fleshy fruits from trees, and other mammals and reptiles may disperse fallen fruits, but birds are most important overall, and bird dispersal was probably critical in the advance of the angiosperms. Mammal fruits are often rather dull-coloured but highly scented, as opposed to the bright colours and relatively little scent of bird-dispersed fruits. Some frugivorous birds that have been tested (four species of tanager, which crush fruit) are known to be able to detect differences in sugar contents of 8,10 and 12% in their diets and prefer the sweetest, though it must be pointed out that others like manikins, which swallow fruits whole, are less sensitive to sugar content. Nevertheless, it is likely that birds have selected for sweeter fruits through evolutionary time. Fleshy fruits of the type birds eat are often thought of as primitive in many features, that is to say that they share more characters with ancestral flowering plant fruits than do fruits with wind-dispersed seeds. This hypothesis is supported by the fact that most plant families that produce bird-dispersed seeds are of very wide distribution and that several of them are held to be primitive, e.g. Annonaceae, Lauraceae, while several genera conspicuous in this trait are found in both tropical America and Australasia. Many of the families involved are represented in temperate countries by species with wind-dispersed fruits, e.g. the ashes, Fraxinus, in Oleaceae, many tropical species of which have drupes. Although the families of plants involved are ancient, they are represented in tropical rain forest to different extents in different continents. In particular, the two most important families, Lauraceae and Palmae, are richly represented in the tropical Americas and Indomalesia including New Guinea, but poorly so in Africa. For example, the island of Singapore has more native species of palm than has the whole of the African continent. This probably explains why Africa is relatively rather poor in specialized frugivorous birds. The tropical American cotingas (Cotingidae) and manikins (Pipridae), and the birds of paradise of New Guinea, have no African counterparts. Because fruits have a limited range of presentation possibilities and in many respects mimic one another in attracting birds, the frugivorous avifauna is less diversified than the insectivorous. For example, in the New World the largely tropical groups, the cotingas and manikins. are together represented by only 140 species, whereas there are 370 species of flycatcher (Tyrannidae) and 220 species of antbird (Formicariidae). Again, the insectivores in closely related groups can coexist, whereas this is rare in the frugivores. Birds range from the most unspecialized, which regularly take other foods besides fruits and cannot subsist on fruit alone, to the most specialized, absolutely reliant on the fruit. Of these, the unspecialized are typically opportunist, taking fruits as and when they become available. The fruits associated with such dispersers are conspicuous, produced in abundance, and are rather watery, sugary and with little nutritive value, for they have little fat or protein. As with the plants visited by nectarivorous birds, these plants provide a source of energy but not a whole diet. The fruits and seeds tend to be small. These are features of the early successional plants of clearings and forest edge, and, in Europe, would be exemplified by elder, Sambucus nigra (Caprifoliaceae), with its small shiny-black sweet fruits produced in abundance. By contrast, the most specialized frugivores are attracted in general to the large-seeded fruits, a common feature of later-successional species. In such plants, the seed is attractive in being covered with a layer of nutritious material. As it must be swallowed, the layer is not too thick, which may account for the common occurrence of relatively thin layers of nutritious material over a single seed or a few seeds in a fruit. Such a layer may be derived from carpellary structures, it may be an aril (a third ‘integument’ of the seed), or a sarcotesta, which is a lleshy layer less readily removed, sometimes being an elaboration of one of the other integuments. Such fruits have high levels of protein and fat and are not very conspicuous. The specialized frugivore is typically a larger bird than the unspecialized one and may have a very wide gape, but also the capacity to strip the seed and regurgitate the ballast rather rapidly, while the fruit itself must be available all the year round. The specialized frugivores are, in general, foraging for only a short period of the day — in the cases of manikins and cotingas, for only some 10% of the daylight hours. (Such species also have social systems in which males spend almost all their time at display grounds while the females spend almost all of theirs performing nesting duties singlehanded.) In temperate plants, it has been shown that the proportion of two-coloured displays of fruits discovered by birds is greater than that of monocoloured, but that the consumption after discovery is greater when the distinguishing features are ‘natural’, e.g. representing different stages of ripeness, rather than differences due, for example, to artificial painting. The ‘modal’ fruit in both tropical and temperate regions is a 7–9 mm black or red berry, but as there is a greater gape range in tropical birds, it is perhaps not surprising to find a wider range of fruit and seed size there. In  temperate regions, there is nothing like the exclusively frugivorous fruit pigeons of the tropics, but many temperate bird species eat little else in autumn and winter. There are generalists in both tropical and temperate regions and, in the diet of some temperate birds, a single plant species can be most important as in the case of the Sardinian warbler, Sylvia melanocephala, which is rarely found except near fruiting Pistacia lentiscus (Anacardiaceae), but this is highly unusual. Within the range of a single tree species, there may be very distinctly different assemblages of birds taking the fruits. In Casearia corymbosa (Flacourtiaceae), for instance, there are ecologically distinct groups of birds on the different sides of a mountain range in Costa Rica. Overall, it is now generally held that the interactions between fruiting plants and birds in both tropical and temperate regions are loose, asymmetric, variable in time and space, non-obligate and apparently inefficient. In a moderately seasonal environment, in which several species produce lleshy fruits, there might be expected to be selection for a particular species to fruit out of step with the others, and thereby avoid competition with other species for dispersers. In Miconia (Melastomataceae) in an area of forest in Trinidad, a set of species with such staggered fruiting seasons, between them, produced available fruit all the year round but among the bird-dispersed (and insect-pollinated) Lauraceae in the lower montane forests of Costa Rica this was not found, although the trees shared many seed dispersers (as well as flower visitors). Over 7 years, the 22 sympatric species of Lauraceae showed great fluctuations in fruit production and this was apparently unconnected with weather or earlier reproductive behaviour. The fruits make up some 60 80% of all those eaten by some of the bird species, which, in years of scarcity, respond by migrating locally, turning to previously ignored foods or by delaying breeding. In these forests, the number of bird species feeding on any particular tree was found to be correlated with its size and frequency but the Lauraceae with large fruits obviously have fewer visitors, though the birds with big gapes tend to be generalists and take fruits of all sizes. The chestnut-mandibled toucan, Ramphastos swainsonii, the largest toucan species in Central America, eats a very wide range of fruits. Small seeds pass through the digestive tract but the large ones are retained in the crop for 5 30 minutes and are then regurgitated. Unlike smaller birds which, though more numerous, go to cover to eat, this bird is ‘fearless’ and defends the tree against other frugivores and may thus, on two counts, be rather inefficient at promoting dispersal of seeds away from the mother tree. Those  destructive birds that ‘mash’ seeds can take fruits larger than their gape, when compared with those species that swallow fruits, so are less restricted in their feeding than the more benign swallowers. Because of this behaviour and because large seeds may be more easily dropped than small ones, studies of faecal samples in work of this kind will be biased towards small seed sizes. In Panama, 60% of the seeds from the understorey tree, Guarea glabra (Meliaceae), were removed by four species of North American migrants, though there was no evidence that any single bird species was dependent on the tree for nutrition, nor the tree reliant on any one species of bird for dispersal. In the north temperate zone, the latitudinal range of fruiting season seems to be associated with the arrival of the southward-shifting, migratory, frugivorous birds such as thrushes. In the Mediterranean, where many such frugivores overwinter, bird fruits tend not to ripen until winter, and show some of the attributes of tropical specialized fruits in that they are drier and more nutritious than northern fruits and can provide a complete diet for the birds. Notable then is the liane, ivy (Hedera helix, Araliaceae), the only member of its predominantly tropical family to reach northern Europe, for it produces unusually nutritious fruits that do not fully ripen until spring (it flowers in autumn) when these are fed to nestlings, whose diets are otherwise almost entirely of animal origin. Another isolated tropical-type plant in northern Europe is the mistletoe, Viscum album, the only representative of Viscaceae, a pantropical family. The relationship between the ecologically similar Loranthaceae and their birds — mistletoe birds (Dicaeeidae) of Indomalesia and Australasia, certain small neotropical tanagers and certain small African barbets — seems to be close. The birds are small like the fruits, and have short, rather stout bills, quite unlike the specialized frugivores discussed above. The seeds are embedded in a sticky material undigested by the bird's gut and are either voided through the gut, or, as in mistletoe, the sticky seed is scraped off in crevices in bark by the bird, which has first removed the fruit structures. A similar parallel is seen in the epiphytic cactus, Rhipsalis, the only cactus genus to be found outside the Americas, while birds may also be involved in the dispersal of the fruits of other epiphytes such as aroids and bromeliads. Many birds eat seeds and are often referred to as seed predators. Parrots and most pigeons, for example, are notorious seed consumers. Of the fruit-eating pigeons, obligate frugivores in tropical Australia, one group does not take grit and the seeds are passed through the gut while the pericarp is digested, but the brown and white-headed pigeons have a large  muscular gizzard typical of columbids and take grit, which means that the seeds are ground up and later digested. An argument for the co-evolution of dispersers and their trees is that they, in contrast, avoid the seeds, though in the past such seeds may have been in some way indigestible, promoting the relationship of today. Indeed, the seeds of such specialized plants as the Lauraceae of Trinidad are not, in general, attacked by parrots. Palms seem to have a mechanical defence in the form of a woody endocarp, familiar as the ‘stone’ of a date. So far as is known there is no toxic substance in palm fruits, but by contrast, the seeds of Lauraceae contain alkaloids: the avocado pear (Persea americana), for example, has a poisonous seed. Seed-predators that hoard seeds may be effective as dispersal agents: in temperate regions, nutcrackers and jays (Corvidae) store large numbers of seeds and exploit them later, and death or ‘forgetfulness’ of the bird will result in successful dispersal. Of course, other animals behave similarly. In tropical America, agoutis (Dasyprocta punctata), like squirrels, scatter-hoard seeds, including those of the Brazil nut, but there is no evidence that they remember specifically where they have buried them. However, the sites are usually near a buttress or a fallen bole. The agouti-dispersed palm, A strocaryum stand leyanum, produces seeds that have a much smaller chance of survival if the pericarp around them is not removed and they are not buried. Burying conceals the seeds from other predators, for which they are an important resource in Central America, while the agouti's peeling off of pericarp before burial may remove any invertebrate larvae therein, before they can get to the seed. The guts of birds may contain seeds of more than one species of plant at any one time and, in eastern North America the greatest mixing of seeds and consequential passing of seeds in faeces is of seeds from fruits with low nutritional quality and, perhaps not surprisingly, of small rather than large seeds. Frugivorous birds, by eating fruits of preferred species in preferred proportions, co-ordinate the dispersal of particular species, so that in the long run, the birds will modify their habitats in terms of the nutritional configuration or the spatial arrangement of the local fruiting plants. This could lead to a mutual reinforcement connecting the dispersal mechanism to the composition of the vegetation. 6.2.2 Dispersal by several agents Most studies have been carried out by watching just one plant species and drawing conclusions from that, though a study by Leighton and  Leighton analysed a whole forest in eastern Borneo. Fruiting in general was found to be markedly seasonal, one dry period being followed by a massive flowering and fruiting. Predator satiation, particularly of primates and some squirrels, which seem to eat almost anything, was notably associated with some trees like many Euphorbiaceae. Of the predators, fruit pigeons were abundant on figs whose seeds are inviable thereafter, but they avoided, as in the Trinidad example, the large fruits, such as those of Dysoxylum (Meliaceae), which they would appear to be able to deal with (these fruits are dispersed by hornbills). Because of the seasonality of fruiting, the major question left unanswered is where the dispersal agents come from and where they go to. This has, of course, important implications for the appropriate sizes for nature reserves. Of all large and medium-sized trees that fruit in the rainy season on Barro Colorado Island, 85% are animal-dispersed and 12% wind-dispersed. Of those that fruit in the dry season, 36% are animal-dispersed and 57% wind-dispersed. Of smaller trees, almost 100% of the wet-season fruiters are animal-dispersed as are only 35% of the dry season ones, of which 21% are wind-dispersed. In more seasonal regions, as in West Africa and South America compared with Indomalesia, for example, the percentage of wind-dispersed trees in the canopy is in general higher. When the flora of fleshy-fruited species in a forest as a whole is examined, as at Cocha Cashu in Amazonian Peru, the fruits of the majority of the species (in this case, two-thirds of 258 species, representing a quarter of the total flora and half of the genera with fleshy fruits) seem to fit into one of two categories. Within many genera, there seemed to be little variation, but, within families, there was rarely uniformity, the two classes being:(i) large orange, yellow, brown or green fruits with a tough outer layer; and (ii) small black, white, blue, purple or mixed colours, corresponding to mammal and bird ‘syndromes’ respectively. Within large genera, however, a range of form is sometimes found. In Aglaia (Meliaceae) in the Malay Peninsula, this range seems to be associated with the different chemical constitution of the fruits offered: three species with dehiscent fruits with arillate seeds were taken by at least nine bird species and there was a high lipid content (27–60%); other species taken by primates were lower in lipid but higher in free carbohydrates (reducing sugars and sucrose) and sweet-tasting amino acids. Although only a handful of species in this large genus (the biggest in the family with perhaps 110 species) were examined, and only a single sample from each, while other nutrients such as minerals and vitamins were not assessed, the results are rather indicative of a pair of chemomorphological dispersal ‘syndromes’ within the genus. Some plants, however, are known to be efficiently dispersed by two quite distinct types of agent, e.g. the fruits of Faramea occidentalis (Rubiaceae) on Barro Colorado Island are eaten by a range of mammals and birds, but dispersal is said to be principally effected by howler and white-faced monkeys and by crested guans. At Los Tuxtlas in southern Mexico, the females of the pioneer, Cecropia obtusifolia, more or less continuously produce fruits and 48 species of animal use them: one insect, one reptile, 33 birds (both residents and migrants) and 13 mammals (flying, arboreal and terrestrial). Seeds from the faeces of three species of mammal were subjected to various light treatments and it was found that passage through two of them reduced the effectiveness with which exposure to far-red light overcame the effects of previous exposure to red light. The pioneer C. glazioui of the coastal rain forest of south-east Brazil, is visited by three tanager species by day and three species of fruit bat by night, all in search of fruit. The minute hard fruits are ingested with the lleshy perianth and later dispersed through defaecation, though only 32% of those passed through birds would germinate compared with 78% from the bats. Fruit bats in Malesia press small-seeded fruits against their palates and drop the dried dross including the seeds. In this way figs, Muntingia calabura (introduced from the West Indies, but fruiting all year round) and species of Melastoma are dispersed. The exotic Piper aduncum from South America has probably recently been spread around Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, in this way. Of species dispersed by birds and primates, the latter may sometimes surpass the birds in spreading seeds. For instance, in Slemmadenia donnellsmithii (Apocynaceae), spider-monkeys may excel over parrots and other birds in this respect in Guatemala. Fruiting Dipteryx panamensis (Leguminosae) trees on Barro Colorado Island are visited by 16 mammal species, taking pericarp or seeds. There is predation by peccaries and rodents, which eat seeds (most of the others eating the pericarp and leaving the seeds under the trees): occasionally primates, coatis, kinkajous and so on disperse seeds but only the bat, Artibeus lituratus, the agouti and the squirrel Sciurus granatensis disperse large numbers, the last two being seed predators most of the time, but sometimes dropping or scatter hoarding seeds. In a study of the Panamanian rain forest tree, Tetragastris panamensis (Burseraceae), visited by a wide range of animals, it was found that three mammal species accounted for over 97% of the seeds removed from the tree, the howler monkey (Allouatta palliata) alone being responsible for 74%. A number of other mammals and birds probably also disperse a very small proportion of the seeds, while two parrot species are the important seed predators among  several mammals and birds that destroy seeds. From 19 study trees in one season, fewer than 4% of the total of more than 430 000 seeds produced had a chance of establishing, for 6% were killed by the parrots, 66% fell under the mother trees and 24% germinated in close competitive clumps in faeces. Even lower percentages are estimated for Shorea ovalis (Dipterocarpaceae) in Malesia, where there was 83% abortion, possibly due to the failure of pollination, while 90% of the survivors were killed by a single insect predator species before being dropped. Sixteen per cent of the survivors on the ground were then killed by three other insect species and although mortality declined with distance from the mother tree, it was not due to host-specific predation. In a study of a forest as a whole, the Budongo Forest in Uganda, it was found that 40% of all seeds were eaten by rodents before and immediately after germination and about a further 30% were killed in 2 years by browsing antelope, while there were further losses from seed rot, insect and fungal attack and drought. The result was some 2% survival of the seeds as saplings in 2 years. Compared with most of the species mentioned so far, many figs seem to produce fruits almost all year round and are the most important foods of many specialized frugivores in Africa, Malesia and Australasia — the siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) in Malaya spends a quarter of its feeding time in fig trees. A Ficus liane in southern Cameroun was visited by one species of fruit pigeon, four of hornbill and three of greenbul, two of monkeys and two of squirrels over 9 days; the greenbuls alone ate 17332 syconia. Their gizzards are gentle when compared with those of fruit pigeons, which generally destroy the seeds. In the New World, bird species are less restricted to fig species, even if fruit is available continuously, as was found for individuals of two Ficus species in Panama, which, between them, produced fruit all year round. In both these species, though, the major fruiting peak occurred when most other species were not in fruit, and it is suggested that the two species fruit asynchronously at relatively short intervals. This would seem to be linked with the capacity to provide egg-laying sites all the year round for the obligate fig-wasp pollinators, as well as to the year-round provision of food for the specialized dispersal agents such as howler monkeys and bats, which may travel long distances, in the case of Artibeus jamaicensis in Mexico up to 10km, to feed on figs. Janzen calculated that in a fig ‘seed’ shadow in Costa Rica created by bats depositing ‘splats’at the density of some 10perm2 over 2500m2, there were 367500 fig seeds dispersed. By contrast, wind-dispersed species in a Mexican study normally fruited during the dry season, producing a large amount of seeds, which were  simultaneously dispersed on days with low relative humidities. Such species thus give rise to wide and uniform seed shadows. Megachiroptera are known to feed upon fruit of 145 plant genera, often secondary species and usually with sweet rather than oily fruits. Large fruits like mango and papaya are consumed in situ and the smaller ones taken away, especially if the bat is disturbed. The large Pteropus vampyrus (weight 800 g) can carry up to 200 g, Pteropus travelling up to 50 km to forage. Nevertheless, the plants are dispersed by a range of other agents including primates and even water. In forests with very seasonal production of fruits and seeds, as at Cocha Cashu, there are periods of scarcity when frugivores turn to a limited range of food sources, sometimes referred to as ‘keystone’ species. At Cocha Cashu, 12 species provided 80% of the animal biomass with food and it is argued that the carrying capacity of the forest is governed by the abundance of these species, the most important of them being figs. 6.2.3 Some marsupials and primates In a secondary forest near Cayenne, French Guyana, five of the six nocturnal mammalian frugivores (effective dispersers rather than predators) were found to be marsupials: 13 of the 26 plant species with a major role as food sources for nocturnal mammals made up approximately half of the total basal area of the forest and 25% of the number of trees there. The trees were found to exhibit three types of phenology:(i) low fruit production over a long time (usually pioneers);(ii) synchronous but irregular fruiting (associated with predator satiation of rodents, the seeds being larger than those in (i); and (iii) synchronous regular cycles with successive and partly overlapping fruit production (providing a year-round supply for the frugivores). The lean period at the beginning of the dry season with few available fruit resources is tolerated as the marsupials store fat. New World primates are red-green colourblind and spider-monkeys eat the seeds of Virola spp. (Myristicaceae) corresponding in their colours to a ‘bird syndrome’; V. surinamensis is dispersed by both birds and water. Of capuchin monkeys in Amazonia, brown capuchins with heavy jaws can open palm fruits and can survive the dry season on them, though the whitefronted capuchins cannot, such that in the dry season, 90% of their food is figs. The figs are widely scattered in the forests, however, so a troop ranges over much more ground than does one of brown capuchins. The effect of passage through the primate gut has been examined in the tamarins in Amazonian Peru, where it was found that germination  success rates were about 70%. The seeds tended to be large and heavy and passed through the gut in 13 hours, the passage time inversely correlated with specific gravity of the seeds and had an indirect effect on the distance that seeds were dispersed away from the mother tree. Of the ‘preferred’ fruit trees, the distributions of the adult trees of three of them closely resembled the seed shadows made by the tamarins in a way not unlike that of the birds mentioned at the end of section 6.2.1. Howler monkeys can detoxify several chemicals that many other New World monkeys cannot: unlike others, they can also eat unripe fruits. Generally, unripe fruits are rendered unpalatable by the tannins that precipitate salivary mucoproteins and cause astringency. In ripening (commercial) fruits, the tannins form large complexes with pectins and the astringency is lost. In the Old World, chimpanzees can deal with unripe fruits, breaking open tannin-rich mature fruits or eating unripe ones. Howlers on Barro Colorado Island eat large quantities of fruit, notably figs, though different Ficus species have different amino-acid contents in the protein fraction of fruits and leaves (40% of their intake is leaves). At Los Tuxtlas, howlers spend half their time collecting fruits of 19 species with a preference for those of certain Moraceae and Lauraceae. Ninety per cent of the seeds in their faeces belonged to just eight species of tree and one liane, the rest to 15 other liane species. The germination success, compared with a control with 35% was about 60% for seeds from the faeces. Nevertheless, besides dispersing some species, howlers waste a large amount of fruit and seed material. Figs are also important in Old World primates, troops of siamang taking up to 13 kg of small ones within 10 days in the Malay Peninsula. Although the orang-utan of Sumatra and Borneo is primarily a fruit-eater, it takes a wide variety of foods including leaves, young shoots, flowers, pith and bark and occasionally mineral-rich soil, insects and possibly small vertebrates and birds eggs. Plants in some 34 families were used in Borneo over a period of 16 months and all but 5 were sources of fruit. The apes fed on a wide range of foods at all times of the year, but when fruit was scarce, they spent more time travelling and turned to less nutritious plant materials as well. Of the 28 chief fruit species taken, 18 were rare (fewer than two trees per ha), six occasional (two to four per ha) and four had four to eight per ha. Individuals of a few species like durians provide food for several orang-utan meals, but most are cleared by one animal in a single meal. In rainy weather, they sometimes concentrate on the less nutritious foods rather than search for more fruit, but in fruiting trees seem not to pay much attention to other frugivores though they eat most, and that wastefully. Because of the  scattered distribution of food, the orang-utan population is split up into small dispersed foraging units and the flexible nature of orang-utan society allows them to exploit irregular fruit distribution better than territorial monkeys or gibbons, for example. The monkeys live largely on leafy shoots and eat fruit when it is available, while the gibbons have become largely specialized for diets of figs. Furthermore, the orang-utan can tolerate a wide range of bitter and sour fruits and high alcohol levels and its strong hands allow it to open spiny or hard fruits like durians and legumes. The Sumatran orang-utan seems to be an important dispersal agent for some Aglaia spp. (Meliaceae) but durian seeds are so damaged that ground-walking animals are thought to be the principal effective agents possibly sun-bears, or even tigers. Man has also been suggested — it has also been pointed out that the fruits favoured by him and the ape are the same. Certainly the absence of commercially significant rain-forest fruits in the New World, compared with the Old, is because the primate fauna in the Old World has flavour preferences nearest to those of humans. Possibly, then, the orang-utan has been excluded from the ground through competition with man, and has become arboreal, perhaps also as a result of being hunted for 30000 years by its competitor. 6.2.4 Fish and ants, wind and water Dispersal agents not mentioned so far include fish. Some seeds of rheophytic plants are fish-dispersed and fish dispersal gets round the perennial problem of how plants can move ‘upstream’. One such rheophyte is Dysoxylum angustifolium in the Pahang River basin in West Malaysia. In the same family (Meliaceae), in the allied genus Guarea in South America, G. guidonia is fish-dispersed. This mechanism seems to have arisen in parallel in these plants. Growing in the same river as D. angustifolium, but in other places as well, is another rheophyte in the same family, Aglaia yzermannii, which may also be fish-dispersed. In the case of the Dysoxylum, the fish flesh is rendered rather unpalatable by substances from the seeds. The indigenous people avoid these fish during the tree's fruiting season and, if other fish predators do the same, the tree could be said to be operating a Securicor system for its offspring. In the peat-swamp forest of Sarawak, the commercially important Gonystylus bancanus (Thymelaeaceae) is distributed by a small catfish, the strange flavour of whose flesh at different times of the year is attributed to the tree's arils. There are probably well over 100 000 km2 of flooded forest in Amazonia with rather predictable seasonal floods, with periods of inundation in  different places lasting up to 6 months. Some characin fish there are seed predators as they crush seeds, which are not destroyed in the gut itself. There are 30 predator species but many so-called predators have been found with whole seeds in their guts, e.g. Colossoma brachypomum, which can reach 20 kg in weight, with seeds of Astrocaryum jauary (Palmae). A given species or even genus tends to specialize in that at the same time in the same area, the same plant species is exploited, and this takes a great toll of water-dispersed seeds such as rubber. As dispersers in these forests, fish are probably more important than any other animal group, because of their larger biomass and feeding at night, as well as in the day. The important groups are the frugivorous characins and catfishes, though even piscivores have been found with viable seeds, perhaps eaten by the herbivore prey in the first instance. Fleshy fruits, including figs are taken and over 100 species are known to be dispersed in this way. Many of the fish species migrate from one river system to another: they can travel 20–30 km upstream in a single day and seeds can remain in their guts for 1 7 days. Characins migrate only upstream, but their young are displaced downstream once more; they are less good as dispersers than catfish, however, as the latter have weaker jaws. In these nutrient-poor waters, the fishes may be reliant on such vegetable input and, in turn, the homogeneity of the inundated forest of Amazonia may be related to this fishy connection. Invertebrates are less conspicuously involved in seed dispersal, but there are many examples of ant-dispersed seeds in temperate countries, e.g. species of Carex (Cyperaceae), Ulex (Leguminosae), and Viola, whose seeds are attractive because of oil bodies, often rudimentary arils. Carunculate seeds are perceived by ants, which see in ultraviolet light, because the caruncle reflects ultra-violet light, the fluorescent compound probably being a phenolic. A recently reported tropical example is of two arrowroot relations, Calathea spp. (Marantaceae) in the Mexican rain forests. Of the 21 species of ant attracted to the arillate seeds, there are predatory carnivorous ponerines, which bear off the seeds, like animal prey, to the nest, where the nutritious arils are removed. The aril-less seeds have higher rates of germination than the undivested ones and the distribution of seedlings matches the ants' behaviour patterns. The hemi-epiphytic Ficus microcarpa of Malesia has a caruncle around the fruit inside the syconium; when it is removed, the fruit is less likely to be ant-transported and those with it removed had a higher germination rate. Remarkably, the primary dispersal is by vertebrates, in whose guts the caruncles are not destroyed. After primary dispersal by a range of vertebrates in a dry-seasonal forest in Costa Rica, the fruits of F.  hondurensis are known to be re-arranged by several ant species. Ants may hinder dispersal, however, as in the example of the aggressive arboreal weaver ant, Oecophylla longinoda, which reduces the dispersal of F. capensis syconia in West Africa by deterring night visitors such as bats. The plumed seeds of Dischidia parvifolia (Asclepiadaceae) are wind-dispersed but, if they land in the vicinity of ant nests, they are gathered and taken into tunnels, where they germinate and their roots gain access to nutrients in the insect frass. In Amazonia, taxonomically diverse groups of angiosperms grow on the carton nests of ants, forming arboreal ‘antgardens’, which may be up to 1 metre across and 2 m long. Several of the plant species have extra-floral nectaries but almost all the plants can be found growing away from the ant nests and the ants can form nests without the plants so that, despite the apparent advantages to both plants and animals, the relationship is not obligatory, though Codonanthe spp. are not found away from the nests. The seeds of the epiphytes have arils, while those of Codonanthe seeds, unlike all other New World Gesneriaceae, closely resemble ant pupae. The seeds are brought to the nest, though the gardens are sometimes colonized by other plants, e.g. Anthurium sp. (Araceae), which offers nothing to the ants. The seeds of most of the plants have a smell of vanilla; nine of the 10 epiphyte species examined in Amazonia had the same volatile oil and a second, unrelated, compound in six of them. Compounds similar to these are known to retard fungal and bacterial growth. They thus protect the ants against nest pathogens in a way similar to that of the fungistatic resins collected by bees for their nests. Other dispersal mechanisms on the forest floor may include rat dispersal, which has been claimed for Curculigo spp. (Liliaceae) in the Malay Peninsula, while, on Fanning Island in the central Pacific, Pandanus tectorius is effectively dispersed by a land crab, Cardisoma carnifex, which moves fruits and discards the seeds. Ocean currents are important for other coastal plants such as some mangroves (though none of these has reached the isolated archipelago of Hawaii), while seeds of the forest lianes, Entada (Leguminosae), are washed even as far as Europe. In Australasia, seeds such as these germinated in North Island, New Zealand, after some time in the sea and 21 months in soil. In the Amazon, there are many water-dispersed palms and legumes: propagules of Montrichardia arborescens, a characteristic aroid, and even rubber, stay afloat for 2 months. Again, in Amazonia, there are some waterballistic understorey herbs, their seeds being bounced by raindrops, e.g. Monolena spp. (Melastomataceae), while in the Malay Peninsula, raindrops run down the longitudinally dehisced capsules of Didymocarpus  spp. (Gesneriaceae) carrying away the minute seeds. Along the margins of the immense rivers of Amazonia, there takes place wind-dispersal with alate drupes of Triplaris surinamensis (Polygonaceae), winged seeds in Couratari spp. (Lecythidaceae), plumed ones in Salix martiana and S. chilensis, and seeds in carpel hairs as in Ceiba pentandra. Storms can disperse seeds and fruits via high altitudes as in dipterocarps in the Malay Peninsula, where one recorded storm deposited 3 — 4 per m 2 possibly over several km 2 . Lianes tend to have a higher percentage of wind-dispersed species than do trees, though hemi-epiphytic lianes tend to be bird-dispersed. The rarity of lianes on truly oceanic islands, e.g. Mauritius and Galapagos Islands (one or two only), can be explained by wind-dispersal not being efficient enough to get them to islands. However, wind-dispersal is important in orchids, where air occupies much of the space within the testa, three orchids reaching Krakatau after its 1883 eruption, by 1896, 25 by 1933. Air-dispersal probably accounts for the distributions of some liverworts, though many spores are not long-lived in a desiccating atmosphere, but the presence of certain hepatics on Ascension Island, St Helena and Tristan da Cunha seems to confirm it. Within a climatological belt, the spread of bryophytes with spores smaller than 25 –m is probably by wind though birds and insects may be important over short distances. Vascular-arbuscular mycorrhizae are spread as spores by wind, water and animals both invertebrate and vertebrate, the longest distances perhaps being achieved on birds' feet, as well as by the more familiar root contact and infected plant material. However, for ectomycorrhizal fungi in southwest Australia at least, dispersal is by marsupials and germination of spores is unsuccessful unless they have passed through a digestive tract. In northern forests, the dispersers of e.g. Fagaceae also eat ectomycorrhizal fungi and seeds planted by them also have ectomycorrhizae. In mast fruiting, there are increases in dispersers in anticipation pigs (flowers) or jays (green cones) but pigs also take fungi, e.g. truffles, which exude sex pheromones. In northern forests, the formation of most sporocarps is associated with fruiting generally and mast-fruiting in particular. Perhaps the mycorrhizae direct the pigs in their spectacular migrations in Borneo. 6.2.5 ‘Anachronisms' Although parrots have been treated as seed predators, they are not always so, for they appear to be the principal dispersal agents of seeds of several species of Parkia (Leguminosae) in the Neotropics as, well as certain  Lecythidaceae there, even though they are partly destructive. It may well be that the gum that surrounds the seeds of these species of Parkia and not of the seeds of the Palaeotropical ones is important here. Some other Parkia species are dispersed by agoutis and it is possible that others may have been adapted to dispersal by large terrestrial herbivores that are now extinct. About 10000 years ago, over 15 genera of Central American large herbivores became extinct so that the megafauna, previously comparable with that of Africa before the decimations caused by man, largely disappeared. Those that became extinct included gomphotheres (mastodon-like proboscidians), ground sloths and equids. The plants that these animals dispersed may thus be seen as vegetable anachrorlisms and the introduction of horses and cattle in historical times seems to have locally restored the ranges of such trees as jicaro (Crescentia alata, Bignoniaceae) and guanacaste (Enterolobium cyclocarpum, Leguminosae), which may fall in this category. The absence from tropical Australia of plants whose dispersal is, or was, associated with large mammals may explain why few, if any, indigenous fruit species there are worth developing for horticulture. However, in southern Australia, there are some southern rain-forest species still with large diaspores, and fossil evidence suggests that the extinct cassowary relations, the Dromornithidae, were there in the Pleistocene. These large birds could have been the original dispersal agents. Of the extant ‘megafauna’, the smallest of the five living species of rhinoceros, the Sumatran rhinoceros, Dicerorhinus sumatrensis, eats wild mangoes and other fruits as well as browsing many gap species. In lowland Nepal, the greater one-horned Asian rhinoceros (Rhinoceros unicornis) takes the large hard and dull fruits of Trewia nudiflora,(Euphorbiaceae), which are unattractive to birds, bats or monkeys. The fruits are an important food source and the seeds remain in the gut for 37 days. Such treatment does not improve germination (they are protected by a hard endocarp during their animal passage), but seedlings grow up in dung piles in clearings: the species is shade-intolerant. The tree regenerates elsewhere, where there are bison and wild cattle or even domestic buffaloes and cattle. Such anachronisms are likely to be common in those regions from which the large forest animals have been lately removed and may, in any case, be a common feature in evolution. Some of the woody lobelioids of Hawaii have thorns and toxins, apparently noxious to the type of herbivores not found in these islands, but possibly on the mainland where their ancestors came from. Surprisingly, Hawaii has plants with extrafloral nectaries, though no ants are native there. In a national park, 33 such species were found: one endemic (Acacia koa, Leguminosae) though six other indigenous species were pantropical coastal plants, but three others with such nectaries elsewhere in their range did not have them in the Hawaiian populations. In the archipelago as a whole 11 of the 1394 endemics have these nectaries as do a number of indigenous non-endemics. No other relationship with other insects has yet been demonstrated, but much of the fauna may be lost, in which case there is some short-term ‘phylogenetic inertia’. If this is not the explanation, then the inertia is even greater, the nectaries being relict structures from the ancestral colonizing plants. The Hawaiian endemic bird pollinators of Freycinetia arborea (Pandanaceae) have died out, but the plant's pollen is still to be found in the head feathers of museum specimens. Pollination is now effected by a Japanese white-eye, Zosterops japonica, introduced in 1929. Another Pacific anachronism associated with birds is the tree Pisonia grandis (Nyctaginaceae), found from Madagascar to Polynesia, but on Niue Island is in decline as it is guano dependent and sea birds are decreasing in numbers there. Dispersal agents must have changed with time as in long-lived taxa such as Ginkgo biloba (Ginkgoaceae) and Podocarpaceae, which were probably dispersed by long-extinct groups of reptiles, while in the largest genus of plants with fleshy fruits in New Zealand, Coprosma (Rubiaceae), comprising 29% of all such species there and 50% of the species of fleshy-fruited shrubs, 52 species are dispersed by birds, bats, lizards and formerly the moas, now extinct. As with the Japanese white-eye pollination on Hawaii, seed dispersal on Three Kings Island, New Zealand, is now effected by introduced bird species. Another example of a dispersal anachronism is the extraordinary palm, Lodoicea maldivica, now restricted to small areas of the Seychelles. This tree is familiar to botanists because it has the largest seed known, as well as one of the largest leaves. The leaves of palms in general are often used for thatching and are relatively durable compared with most tropical foliage. The leaf litter of this remarkable plant is therefore bulky and relatively persistent. A single fallen leaf can smother a wide area of seedlings and it is perhaps no surprise then to learn that it has such a large seed, which could not only penetrate this mass but have enough stores to supply a seedling as it grew up through it. Nevertheless, these large seeds are rather unlikely to be moved uphill by dispersal agents, particularly as there are no large animals on the island where the palm grows. It seems then (possibly retarded by a cotyledonary stalk up to 3 m long), to be slowly moving  downhill as a species. The seeds are not resistant to salt water and immersion kills them. In short, this species is ‘adapted’ to going extinct. How did it reach the Seychelles? A clue may be found in the geology of those islands, for some of them are granitic and part of the Gondwanaland, which linked India and Africa when they were adjacent. Is it then a relic of the greatest antiquity? 6.2.6 Specificity Where there is great specificity in seed-dispersal, a state of affairs that seems in general very rare, the disappearance of the dispersal agent is the road to extinction for the plant. Elephants, which lack colour vision but have a strong sense of smell and favour large, smelly, dull fruits, are the only animals able to swallow the pyrene of Panda oleosa (Pandaceae) and collected seeds do not germinate unless passed through an elephant, in whose dung they germinate. The seed content of droppings throughout 1 year in a rain forest in Ivory Coast comprised some 37 species of trees and five of herbs. Of the trees, only seven are known to be dispersed by monkeys or birds as well. Some 30% of the trees whose dispersal agent is known in these forests are dispersed by elephants. It may well be that other such cases as the Panda represent extreme forms of the ‘anachronisms’ and that, formerly reliant on a number of dispersal agents, only one of these is now left. Again, the flightless cassowaries to 1 .5 m tall survive in Australia (one species), New Guinea and the neighbouring islands. In northern Queensland, their dung heaps (up to 1 kg each!) were examined and found to contain 78 species of seeds, of which 70 were viable. Although passage through the gut did not improve germination rates, it must be remembered that the birds are the only frugivores large enough to deal with some of the fruits, e.g. Casuarius casuarius in Queensland taking Beilschmiedia (Lauraceae) fruits and passing the seeds more or less intact even though they are 6 cm diameter and weigh 52g. A celebrated, final, example is that of Sideroxylon (Calvaria) sessilijlorum (Sapotaceae), only geriatric trees of which could be found in Mauritius, to which island it is restricted. An inspired guess was made that the failure of the seeds to germinate was because its seeds had not passed through the gut of the dodo (Raphus cucullatus), extinct since 1681. This led to forced feedings of turkeys, and, after being voided, resultant germination of seeds of the tree which was on the verge of extinction, though this may have been exacerbated by the depredations of introduced monkeys, which take unripe fruits. By contrast, the flexibility of plants (as in the examples of the Freycinetia  and the Three Kings Island flora discussed above) in terms of dispersal agents can be seen in two Neotropical studies. In a broad-scale study of cloud forests, it was concluded that random colonization had played an important part in determining the species compositions of different ones and that the predominance of widespread species of successional habitats elsewhere reflected a high rate of generalist dispersal. In the second, three submontane tree species common to Trinidad and Tobago were examined, the assemblages of frugivores in the two islands being very different, with passerine dispersers predominating in Trinidad, parrots and other predators on Tobago. On Tobago, the fruits of the tree species had significantly more thickened layers and higher frequencies of multiple seeds and so on. Selection by the different avifaunas seems to have generated these infraspecific differences and the tree species survive in both islands. Although not immediately apparent in studies of ‘variable’ plant species, it must be expected, in view of the non-uniform disperser fauna in tropical regions, that wide-ranging species will probably be shown to have such patterns. Nevertheless, such patterns reflect not only the present fauna, but in the cases of long-lived trees, the fauna of the past. In short, in the context of the modern fauna, many trees may appear to represent the ‘living past’. 6.3 Florivory and pollination In the previous chapter, it was noted that some groups of trees employed in turn the same species of pollinating insects, suggesting that within certain constraints these were generalist in their flower-visiting. This contrasts with the often-repeated one-to-one association of certain orchids and their insects and of the hundreds of species of figs and theirs. How closely knit are pollinating animals and plants in rain forest? In the wet forests of Costa Rica it was found that some 90% of tree species were insect-pollinated, approximately the same percentage as in dry forest, so the insects will be considered first. 6.3.1 Insect pollination (entomophily) For insects, plants represent humid but well-drained surfaces and increase the amount and diversity of living space while for some, they represent food to browse, or a repository to bore into in egg-laying. Early pollinators were attracted by pollen and probably had grinding mandibles: they also took ovules and developing seeds. They were probably derived from predominantly predacious groups adapted to seeking pollen, which is high in protein, and the foraging behaviour of modern predacious insects and pollinators is similar. Pollen and ovule eating may have begun in the Carboniferous, the first ‘modern’ group with such mandibles, the Coleoptera, appearing in the Permian, with Diptera and Hymenoptera in the Triassic, and Lepidoptera in the Lower Cretaceous. There appear to have been trends in the fossil gymnosperms leading to increased protection of the ovules. By the Cretaceous, insect damage is very pronounced as in the example of hundreds of cycad cones that have been examined: 22.2% of them had damage especially noticeable in those with mature pollen-bearing organs. Many different groups are involved in the pollination of modern angiosperms and, in rain forest, this seems to be rather bound up with the level in the forest at which the flowers are presented. In Costa Rica, the large and medium-sized trees are associated with generalist insects and not bats or birds, the almost exclusively tropical pollinators. Only 3% of species there were visited by bats: a similar percentage was recorded for wind-pollinated trees. Hummingbirds and hawkmoths are largely associated with trees producing flowers near the forest floor, where noctuid moths are found to be important pollinators in the smaller species of Meliaceae and butterflies in such families as Rubiaceae. The scent-sensitive Lepidoptera are thus associated with the strongly-scented flowers in the relative calm there. Almost all the insects examined are generalists, particularly small bees that visit a wide range of the trees with rather small ‘unspecialized’ flowers. The stratification could be summarized as follows: large bees in the emergents, smaller bees in the lower reaches with other generalist insects, and near the forest floor everything, including wind, as pollinator. In West Malaysia, there seems to be a clear distinction between the pollinators above and those below the canopy. Below, the flowers have minimal visual lures and are produced over extended periods, or even continuously, while others are strongly scented and produced more periodically. In the canopy, the flowers are larger and more conspicuous, as in almost all of the emergents. The pollinators in the lower regions are nonspecific and include meliponid bees, solitary wasps and butterflies and also unspecialized beetles, midges, flies and thrips, all rather short-range pollinators. Most of these are also found in the upper canopy, although that is dominated by the wide-ranging bee, Apis dorsata, with Xylocopa bees also conspicuous. Sunbirds and bats, which live outside the forest, also work the flowers at this level. Xylocopa and the sunbirds are mostly found in the forest fringes, foraging on gap-phase plants though they move to the  mature forest trees during flowering periods. In the lower reaches of the forest, then, there is a constant but low level of presentation of a few flowers dealt with by low but more or less constant densities of animals, whereas in the upper layers, the flowers are more conspicuously advertised and draw such animals as birds, which are wider-ranging and with good sight, as well as the local, more stationary pollinators from lower in the forest. The trees of the lower reaches are thus generalized in their attractions while trees like the dipterocarps get the local fauna and the bee Apis dorsata. Some trees such as Polygalaceae, two subfamilies of Leguminosae, Papilionoideae and Caesalpinioideae, have floral structures restricting access to the nectar or pollen to Xylocopa bees, a mechanism familiar enough in the temperate representatives of these families. Some of the dipterocarps, as was mentioned in the last chapter, are visited by thrips though these trees are strongly self-incompatible. Other ways in which outcrossing may result include the consequences of the aggressive behaviour of some of the pollinating bees, which may force other pollinators to withdraw from a particular tree and seek another, though short-distance pollinators are often territorial and may see off new arrivals, thus reducing crossing. In mass-flowering, the thrips with their rapid breeding cycles and build-up of numbers can form a very high percentage of the pollinators. Possibly such mechanisms can be used to explain where the pollinators come from in species-poor forests such as the Shorea albida forest in Sarawak when the dominants flower. Despite this apparent stratification, certain groups of plants are very restricted in their range of pollinators. Palms, which may vary in size from emergents in the montane forest of the Andes to treelets 30cm tall in the Madagascan rain forest, are thought to be pollinated largely by beetles and sometimes bees, and not, as was formerly believed, entirely by wind. Indeed, many trees that look as though they might be adapted to wind pollination are known to be pollinated by insects — like Mallotus oppositifolius (Euphorbiaceae) in West Africa, which has an attractive sweet scent — and it has been suspected that even forest grasses are animal pollinated. Examination of particular species seems to show elaborate systems for enhancing cross-pollination. Many tree species are dioecious, although sometimes the rudiments of the opposite sex are found in the flowers. Such is the case in the majority of the Meliaceae, for example. The dioecious Xerospermum noronhianum (‘X intermedium', Sapindaceae) in West Malaysia has a prolonged sequential development of flowers on each inflorescence as well as the sequential development of the inflorescences  themselves, making a small number of flowers available at any one time but ensuring economy by not producing excess flowers within a short period (these would not be pollinated owing to the low density of pollinators). The major pollinators are short-distance generalists and the fidelity is maintained by the simultaneous flowering of trees of both sexes within close proximity. Furthermore, it was observed that female trees flowered less frequently: 22% of the known females in a 5-year study flowered more than twice, compared with 35% of the males. This could be argued as promoting the crossing between different parent trees in successive seasons. In Costa Rica, 333 of the approximately 400 tree species at La Selva were examined and 65.5% were found to be hermaphroditic, 11.4% monoecious and 23.1% dioecious; of 28 species examined in detail, 24 showed self-incompatibility, either in the stigma or style in distylous species, in the ovary in most of the monomorphic ones. Insects collect pollen and, in the case of, for example, beetles, solid food bodies in or about the flowers. In a species of the palm genus, Bactris, the fleshy petals and sepals are eaten, while the fleshy bracts of a species of Freycinetia (Pandanaceae) are eaten by birds, which are thought to pollinate it. Insects also collect nectar as a ‘liquid reward’ a category that may include stigmatic secretions; these may be involved in insect nutrition as well as in pollen-tube germination. The extent of nectar production is apparently associated with pollinator size and there is variation in its sugar content and dilution. In dioecious species, the sugar proportions are different in male and female flowers. Humming-bird flowers have high sucrose/hexose ratios, while passerine (sunbirds, white-eyes, honeyeaters and honeycreepers) flowers have a lower ratio these birds also take fruit-juices, which are highly hexosedominated. Hexose-dominance is found in bat flowers in the Americas though is perhaps less obvious in the Old World: again there is a similarity with fruit sugars. Moth flowers are sucrose-rich and narrow-tubed butterfly flowers are similar but ‘bee and butterfly’ flowers with shallow tubes are hexose-rich. Bees may get sucrose- or hexose-dominated nectars, but this is complicated by the fact that some plant families have either sucrose- or hexose-dominated nectars. The attraction for the bees may be conditioned or due to‘taste’ but it must be noted that nectars contain things besides sugars, particularly lipids, amino acids and proteins as well as alkaloids, non-protein amino acids and phenols. An example showing that such categorizations and generalizations are perhaps unwise is that of Inga vera var spuria (Leguminosae), which is first visited by moths and humming birds (high sucrose), but 4 hours later produces a sour odour attractive to  bats, perhaps due to fermentation by micro-organisms, the resultant diminution of sucrose making the ratio suitable for the bats. Several Passifloraceae present pollen and nectar at different times of day and share the same pollinators, while certain nectar-less Bignoniaceous lianes mimic nectar producers, by flowering at the same time as, or just after, those that are pollinated. Mistletoe flowers appear to mimic nutritionally rich fruits, the fruits of the previous season being more or less contemporary with the new flowers. Again, Epidendrum ibayuense (Orchidaceae) produces nectar-less flowers all year round in Panama, apparently mimicking the flowers of Lantana camara (Verbenaceae) and Asclepias curassavica and attracting Monarch butterfly pollinators. On the other hand, the ‘robbing’ of nectar, familiar in temperate plants is also prevalent in the tropics and bees may attack bird-pollinated flowers. Although it has been argued that nectar might contain repellents to ants that otherwise predominate on sugary substrates in the tropics, it is found that ants will take this nectar when it is presented to them, though the floral parts of such flowers may be less palatable. Indeed, pollen exposed to ants for a short time has reduced germinability and shorter pollen-tubes: such pollen leads to lower seed set. It has been suggested that in their nest-building and brood-rearing habits, ants secrete large amounts of antibiotics, which check pathogens and it is these that affect pollen, while bees and wasps do not, so it is not surprising that ant pollination systems are rare. Myrmicacin is found with plant hormones in a secretion produced by the thoracic gland which disrupts the flow of components to cell walls and cell division is disturbed. However, some of the many other glands and secretions on ants may also be involved. Bees (Apidae) Probably the most significant of insect pollinators are bees. Within a single tree family, there can be a wide range of bee pollinators, as in the Lecythidaceae of Amazonia, one of the most important families there, with different morphological flower types and rewards associated with different bee sizes. The most primitive state is where the stamens are united basally and are numerous, curving inwards in a symmetrical flower as in Gustavia spp., some of which are self-sterile; small to medium-sized bees like species of the stingless Trigona leave pollen on the stigma and become dusted with new pollen from the stamens where they forage. In Cariniana, there are similar pollinators but the androecium is somewhat one-sided, while in Couroupita, it is very irregular in that, besides a ring of stamens with fertile pollen around the stigmatic surface, there is a one-sided ligule bearing stamens with sterile pollen curved back  over the others. These flowers are visited by larger bees such as species of Xylocopa, which land on the hood-like ligule and forage underneath it for pollen. In so doing, bees rub their backs against the stigmatic surface and effect pollination and also collect fertile pollen. In the Brazil nut, Bertholleria excelsa, and Eschweilera spp., the hood is pressed down on the fertile stamens and bears only staminodes with nectar at their bases: only a strong bee can lift the hood — species of Xylocopa and female euglossine bees. Most specialized is the condition in Couratari spp., where the hood is coiled under itself, concealing the nectar, which can only be reached by the long-tongued female euglossines. Generalist bees are usually faithful over short periods, one species of trigonid bee near M anaus for example visiting 33 species in 21 plant families in 1 year, though at any one time, over 60% of the individuals of the species had only one pollen type and over 23% had only two. Trigonids are very common in south-east Asia and tropical America. They can make up to 141 foraging trips a day, comparing favourably with commercial honey bees, which can manage 150. In Malaysia, they have pollen sources throughout the year, mostly in the understorey; they have a memory for food sites, can forage up to 1 km from base and can recruit other foragers. Trigonafulviventris usually forages alone but, if rewarded several times at a site, will bring recruits, their number dependent on the molar concentrations of sucrose — the first bee marking the surroundings with an oily pheromone from its mandibular gland. The recruits recruit others, colonies sometimes fighting over a resource, though individuals of this species usually give in to those of other more aggressive Trigona species. In Amazonia, bees collect pollen from some species that have ‘buzz’ mechanisms as in Mouriri spp. (Melastomataceae). The bees shiver their indirect night muscles, which (‘buzz’) vibration promotes the expulsion of a cloud of pollen grains from the tips of the anthers over the insects. Such systems are known in at least 6–8% of all angiosperms and are represented in 71 plant families with poricidal anthers, those notable in the tropics being Solanaceae. On Barro Colorado Island, Drymonia serrulata (Gesneriaceae) produces more nectar per day than has been reported from any other bee-pollinated flower. The effective pollinators are a pair of Epicharis spp. but there are glandular trichomes inside the corolla, secreting oils that are deposited on the anthers, but this is collected only by Trigona pallens, an ineffective pollinator. However, the oil helps pollen adhesion on other insects and this may be important in ‘buzz’ flowers as well. Several plants, especially Malpighiaceae and Memecyloideae of Melastomataceae, offer oils from  glands on the calyx (these are vestigial or absent in Old World plants). The oil is collected by Centris bees and is full of glycerides, which are later mixed with pollen in the hives. Such oil flowers and their bees are most abundant in neotropical savannas and forests and are known in 79 genera of plants in 10 families. The oils are energetically twice as efficient as carbohydrates and, although the bees are highly specialized, flowers very like modern Malpighiaceae, complete with oil glands, are known from the mid-Eocene. Most remarkable, perhaps, are the euglossine bees, of the neotropics, of species of which, mark-recapture studies show that the solitary males of Eulaema spp. can live for 2 months. Males and females can be kept in captivity for several months, the males surviving without the lloral fragrance compounds to which they are attracted. They ‘trapline’, moving directly from one food site to the next, apparently remembering them from previous days, and are fast fliers, visiting plants producing (few) flowers over long periods. Some captured males with orchid pollinia are believed to have flown some 45–50 km in seeking the orchids. The males have dense tufts of hairs on the tarsi of the forelegs, picking up oils by capillarity; the hind tibia, corresponding to the pollen basket of the female, serves as a storage organ for scent. The odours are the sole attractant for the bees and this can be detected up to 1 km away across water, though perhaps less in forest. The scent is transferred to the tibiae in night, the bees re-alighting and collecting for up to 1 hour. Particularly important for these bees are certain groups of orchids, each species of which may offer 2–18 (mean 7–10) different compounds, some of which are unattractive on their own; however, eugenol, methyl salicylate and vanillin are highly attractive individually. The attractants appear to change geographically and seasonally, while it is perhaps the blending of compounds that restricts the number of bee species attracted, although there are overlaps between them and the bees' choices also vary geographically and seasonally. The geographic differences may be genetic or reflect the age of insects or the availability of resources. The seasonal and geographical differences in orchids on the one hand and bees on the other are incompletely congruent. On Barro Colorado Island, pollinator specificity occurs in fewer than half of the orchid species and host specificity of the bees is also rare. There are other fragrance sources and it is argued that the relationship is not mutually obligatory but as all the euglossine genera are involved, it is suggested that the orchids have exploited a pre-existent behaviour pattern in the bees. The scents are possibly modified to pheromones in mating, for bees carrying scent apparently attract other  males, so that about five display together whereupon the female chooses her mate. The flowers of some plants, e.g. some Calathea spp. (Marantaceae), do not open spontaneously and may be opened only by euglossines. Some Eulaema bees regularly pollinate, while others learn to trip the flowers without effecting pollination. Of orchids, euglossines visit some 625 species in 55 genera, especially in the subtribes Stanhopeinae and Catasetinae; they also visit some Gesneriaceae and a number of Araceae as well as rotting logs, to which they are possibly attracted by fungi. In many of the orchids, the bees slip and fall through the flower or into a trap, for example in Stanhopea candida in Amazonia, pollination is by Eulaema moscaryi, which ‘falls through’ the flower after collecting the scent; in so doing, it brushes against the pollinia and in the next flower these are lodged in the stigmatic cavity. Eulaema ignita also collects scent but, being the wrong size, does not brush against the pollinia and is therefore a robber. Not all bee-pollinated flowers are obviously pollinated by bees. Bagging experiments in Panama on Luehea seemanii (Tiliaceae), which has! lowers opening at night, suggestive of a nocturnal pollination syndrome, showed that diurnal visits by bees were responsible for higher numbers of fruits and seeds set. Whether such, perhaps resulting from crosses with male plants not far away, would have survived competition with those possibly derived from crosses with more distant fathers, in a mixed infructescence is not clear but this example and several others show how unrestrictive certain ‘syndromes’ are. Thrips, beetles, flies, butterflies and moths Of dipterocarps, trees in many genera are first visited by Apis bees, later by meliponid bees, and then by various other insects. In Shorea sect. Mutica, a single tree can produce 4 million flowers over 2 weeks. The thrips eggs are laid between the petals and the larvae feed on these organs. By the time of anthesis, there is time for four generations and a single insect can by then have given rise to 4000 juveniles: they get trapped between the anthers and the petals as the! lowers open and, as adults, feed on the pollen. They carry on average only 2.5 grains each and, as the corollas fall in the morning, they ny back up to the canopy, where they effect pollination, any slight wind drifting them to other trees. Of beetle-pollinated plants in the tropics, the aroids visited by scarabs are thought to have near-specific volatile attractants like those used by the euglossines. In Amazonian Annonaceae and Nymphaeaceae, beetle pollination tends to be fortuitous by contrast, e.g. scarabs on  Nymphaea spp. in lakes, though in Victoria amazonica, there are four species of dynastid beetle attracted by scent and temperature (11° above ambient): these become trapped for 24 hours and feed on starchy carpellary appendages before leaving with pollen. In Annona sericea, the flowers have thick fleshy petals that never quite open. At about 7 p.m., the temperature rises more than 6CC above ambient and there is a strong smell like ether and chloroform attractive to chrysomelid beetles, which push their way to the stigmas, pollinating them. The stigmas fall, the stamens moving into their place, dehiscing and powdering the beetles, which may be copulating; then the stamens fall as do the petals, one at a time, releasing the insects. In many palms, there is also a rise in temperature at the beginning of anthesis, associated with beetle pollination: in Astrocaryum mexicanum at Los Tuxtlas, there is a wide range of pollinating species, besides many other herbivorous visitors and this suite is shared with other palms in the same and different genera represented there. The babassu palm (Orbignya phalerata) in Brazil is pollinated by a beetle, Mystrops mexicana, perhaps supplemented by wind. Several cultigens are similarly flexible, e.g. coconut, in that pollination is thereby ensured in both open and closed habitats. In Amazonia, flies pollinate flowers of species of Aristolochia (Aristolochiaceae) and some orchids, and midges pollinate cocoa, in the decaying fruits of which they breed. This also occurs in other Sterculiaceae, notably Sterculia chicha. In northern Borneo, Rafflesia pricei, a species in a genus including the largest-known flowers, R. arnoldii (R. titan, Rafnesiaceae) up to 1 m across and all its species parasitic on lianoid species of Tetrastigma (Vitaceae), is pollinated by carrion flies (bluebottles), attracted by sight and scent. The flowers offer no reward and deceive the insects by appearing to offer food and perhaps a brood place, so that the plant is doubly parasitic on the liane and on the bluebottle. The flies, mainly female Lucilia papuensis, visit male flowers, enter the anther grooves on the central column of the flower, the pollen being precisely positioned on the thorax. In female flowers, the flies are wedged in tightly, the thorax pollen being rubbed off on to the stigma. Lepidoptera are frequent understorey pollinators as we have seen, butterflies by day and moths at night, e.g. within the family Chrysobalanaceae in Amazonia, butterflies visit Hirtella spp. (flowers opening in the day, many with a showy appearance, usually pink or purple, stamens few) whereas the related Couepia spp. are moth-pollinated (flowers opening at night, few at a time, white, stamens numerous and more copious nectar). Moths can be strong fliers, hawkmoths in Costa Rica, for example, travelling up to 15 km with pollen and can live more than 2 months. Long-tongued species are particularly well-represented in Madagascar, and about 10% of all the orchids in that island, i.e. some 70 species, have nectar-spurs, up to 8cm or longer. Five angraecoid species were found to share the same pollinator, Panogena lingens, but ethological and mechanical mechanisms apparently restrict interspecific pollination despite mixed pollen loads. Fig-wasps The most celebrated ‘one-to-one’ interactions involve the genus Ficus (figs) and its pollinators, the wasps of the Agaonidae, related figs having related wasps. They cannot exist, or at least, procreate, without one another , and in some senses approach a dual-organism, like a lichen. Very rarely is there more than one species of wasp involved with any particular fig species, an exception being F. ottoniirolia, apparently visited by different wasp species in forest and in open country in West Africa. One or more females, possibly attracted by a pheromone, enter the young fig (an inflorescence known as a syconium), losing wings and antennae, and possibly fungal spores as well in forcing an entry through the tiny ostiole at the fig apex. The female removes pollen from pollen pockets and pollinates up to hundreds of stigmas; she attempts to oviposit down styles and then dies. In the oviposited flowers, the ovules are stimulated to produce only endosperm on which the larvae feed, a process not unlike more exposed gall formation in other plants. The CO2 content is higher within the syconium than outside it and its level is believed to control the hatching of the larvae; it is affected by bacterial activity and this in turn is affected by nematodes in the syconium. The males, which are wingless and with reduced legs and eyes, emerge as the seeds mature, locate the females, copulate and help the impregnated females out of their florets. The females then fill their pollen pockets from newly-opened anthers and leave through holes in the syconium wall cut by the males, who then die. The co-operation is understandable in evolutionary terms as the males and females in a single-female syconium are brothers and sisters. If there is no pollination, the syconia (except in cultivars) are aborted. In isolated trees, however, intracrown asynchrony could lead to (self-) pollination. During the early male phase of Ficus religiosa (India to south-east Asia), the internal atmosphere has 10% CO2,10% oxygen and some ethylene and the male insects are active under this regime, the females inactive. After puncturing the syconium wall, the atmosphere returns to normal, the males are inactivated and the females emerge. The change in atmosphere ensures development of both fig and pollinator: in other species, e.g. F. carica, the  domestic fig, copulation takes place under normal atmospheric conditions, and in yet others, the females emerge while still enduring relatively high CO2 levels. In short, there are many variations on the theme set out in the last paragraph. The system may have developed from seed parasitism, but it itself is now parasitized by other wasps ovipositing through the syconium wall. Some other wasp species, apparently derived from pollinating agaonids, enter through the ostioles but do not carry pollen, though they have pockets; there are also weevils and moth larvae. In consequence, between 20 and 80% of ovules are killed by pollinators and other insects. In South Africa, ants visiting Ficus sur to tend homopterans deter parasitoids of the figs, thus enhancing pollination success, but some ants feed on arriving pollinators, while some birds eat them as they emerge. Moth and beetle larvae eat developing and mature larvae respectively in the fig. However, pollinators arrive and leave en masse, unlike the interlopers, who may thus suffer more from the predators than the pollinators do. Pollinators trapped on Ficus retusa in Costa Rica, showed 99% fidelity, giving strong support to the idea of there being a pheromonal cue. They arrived in a l-day burst coinciding with the presence of receptive but unpollinated syconia. That dispersal agents can travel further than the pollinators can be attracted is the explanation for the Ficus pubinervis population of Krakatau, where it is a canopy dominant, never setting ripe fruits. In New Zealand, the introduced Australian F. rubiginosa produced no ripe fruits for many years, but its pollinator has now been introduced, perhaps by wind, and fruits are set. Whatever the volatile attractant to the syconia may be, it is likely that the parasitoids find it attractive too. 6.3.2 Bird pollination (ornithophily) Bird pollinators include unspecialized nectar eaters, which opportunistically visit many different kinds of flower, generally small ones, and specialized nectar eaters, which concentrate on a few kinds of flower, mainly larger ones. Nectar never provides a complete diet for any of these birds, which also eat insects or other animals but, as nectar is replenished as it is removed, birds may defend clumps of nectariferous flowers. In different continents, different groups of birds are nectarivorous — largely hummingbirds in the New World, sunbirds and sugarbirds in Africa and honey eaters in Australasia. There is little overlap in the families of plants the different  groups visit and, in those families, the flowers may look very different. For example, in Australasia the flowers are of an open type compared with the tubular form, brush-type or explosive mechanisms of bird-pollinated flowers elsewhere. In short, it would seem that the relationship must have evolved over and over again. This is borne out by work on more temperate plants, for many of the hummingbird-pollinated plants of western North America belong to genera that are predominantly (and it is believed more anciently) insect-pollinated. That bird flowers are similar in colour and nectar to fruits might suggest otherwise, however. It is often repeated that hummingbird flowers are red, part of the ornithophilous ‘syndrome’, and indeed, red does seem to be preferred by these birds. Nevertheless, it may well be that such birds are conditioned to this colour and it has been shown that nectar quality can overcome colour prejudice. Again, it has been argued that colour contrast and other factors may be important because red contrasts well with green and many hummingbird plants with bluish leaves have yellow flowers, the complementary colour. In Puerto Rico, long-tubed flowers with high nectar levels are associated with long-billed hummingbirds, while short-tubed ones produce enough nectar for small birds, but not big ones. Any amino acids in the nectar are probably of little importance and nectars high in them are avoided by the birds. The nectar is merely a high-energy source. Hummingbirds are large pollinators and potentially, therefore, very destructive: mechanisms reducing damage to the flower include the development in many groups of the inferior ovary, concealing the delicate ovules well away from probing beaks, as in Fuchsia (Onagraceae), and the red fruit-like spurs in Norantea guianensis (Marcgraviaceae) in Brazil, the rest of the flower being inconspicuous. The unspecialized hummingbirds range over herbs to trees, which produce many nowers with little nectar to attract pollinators. In a mass, however, the birds sometimes defend the nowers and thereby reduce cross-pollination. Few canopy trees in Costa Rica are bird-pollinated and those that are, are visited by passerines such as orioles, which travel in groups: hummingbirds would turn trees into individual feeding territories and thus reduce pollination. The specialized hummingbirds do not normally maintain feeding territories or defend patches of flowers but ‘trapline’ to flowers on other plants of the same species. These plants are mainly large herbaceous ones or lianes or epiphytes, mostly different in form, then, from those attracting unspecialized hummingbirds. In the more seasonal forests, hummingbirds may be migratory, but in all forests they tend to breed at the time when the flowers on which they depend  are most abundant, though as with the thrips and the Shorea species, there is some staggering of flowering times and avoidance of competition for pollinators between plants. Bird nectar thieves like the flower piercers are found in many species, but the bromeliads with thick protecting bracts are almost immune to their attacks. It has been argued that the dilute nature of the nectar in such flowers deters some bee robbers that may be unable to concentrate it: the birds would prefer concentrated sugars. It has more frequently been suggested that dilute sources will promote visits to many nowers and thus out-crossing, though it is difficult to see how such a mechanism could arise, and perhaps it is more satisfactory to surmise that visits by a pollen-dusted vector to several flowers on one plant are promoted, leading to cross fertilization of more. Nectar flow in the red-flowered Brownea rosa-de-monte (Leguminosae) of the Panama forests is known to be influenced by interference from stingless bees and lepidopteran larvae, though, in general, flow in this species decreases through the day during which any flower is presented. Although the inflorescences last just 1 day, their production tends to be synchronized within localized groups of trees. Other nectar-thieves include tamarin monkeys in north-eastern Peru: these feed on nectar of the bird-pollinated Symphonia globulifera (Guttiferae). In Erythrina spp. (Leguminosae), the differences in the morphology of the flowers and inflorescences are associated with the different, passerine or hummingbird, pollinators. Flowers visited by passerines are twisted such that they face back to the peduncle, on which the perching bird stands: hummingbird flowers differ in being tubular and sticking outwards making them readily accessible to hovering birds. The passerine species have nectar with low (about 7–10%) sugar content, while hummingbird flowers have up to 38%, though the passerine ones have higher amino-acid concentrations. A very specialized example is found in passerines in India, where Dendrophthoe (Loranthus) longiflora (Loranthaceae) is pollinated by sunbirds. The nowers remain closed until the bird squeezes the bud, which explodes open, offering nectar (but possibly no insects unlike most sunbird flowers) and is pollinated; if not visited, the flowers fall off. 6.3.3 Bat pollination (chiropterophily) Bats visit a range of plants and these are visited by a range of bats; plants transferred from the New to the Old Worlds and vice versa are visited by the local bats. Of those that pollinate a small percentage of tropical rain forest trees, a minority feed exclusively on floral resources. Of these, in West Malaysia, two species roost singly in trees and ny short distances to  feed upon trees which produce a few flowers all year round, and the third, Eonycteris spelaea, roosts, in large colonies in caves and can ny up to at least 35km from them to feed and take food from a wide range of flowers scattered in space and time. Flagelliflory, the presentation of flowers on long peduncles, occurs in several unrelated groups and is generally associated with bat pollination, but a whole family of plants in a wide range of habitats in tropical America has all its species bat-pollinated with the flowers projecting above the canopy; namely the Caryocaraceae. Within a genus exhibiting flagelliflory, Parkia (Leguminosae) has the greatest variation in its pantropical range in tropical America. The unit of pollination is a capitulum of flowers; of the 11 species studied, nine were bat-pollinated, the capitula with flowers opening for 1 night, secreting copious nectar and being bright red or yellow or both, with characteristic scents: they are visited by eight species of bat, some of them nectar thieves. One section of the genus Parkia has no nectar-producing flowers and is probably wholly entomophilous: the capitula are visited by insects, especially trigonid bees. The internal classification of the genus is founded on the arrangements of the nowers: heads of only fertile flowers for one entomophilous section; similar but with a distal zone of nectariferous ones in another; the distal ones are fertile and separated from the proximal staminodal ones by a zone of nectariferous ones in a third. These latter two are bat-pollinated and the capitulum can be pendulous or erect; the staminodal flowers sometimes form a fringe acting as a landing platform for the bats. They land head downwards in America, upwards in the Old World (it would be interesting to know the behaviour of bats in America when confronted with P. globosa, long ago introduced from Africa). Red capitula held against the sky appear black to the colour-blind bats, while yellow ones (seen as white) are those displayed against the foliage. Of sympatric species, those flowering together deposit pollen on different parts of the bat body, thus avoiding interspecific pollination, and some have staggered flowering times. Concurrently, though, the destructive bruchid beetle populations which damage seeds moved from one fruiting species to another. It would therefore appear that the ensuring of successful pollination must override the importance of losses due to seed predation. Indeed, such compromises may be widespread. Bat-pollinated plants, e.g. species of Oroxylum (Bignoniaceae) and Duabanga (Sonneratiaceae) in Borneo, are possibly most conspicuous along river banks where, incidentally, wind-pollinated trees such as species of Octomeles (Datiscaceae) and Casuarina (Casuarinaceae) are also found. Wind pollination in Peninsular Malaysia is rare and the introduced  wind-pollinated Pinus caribaea does not set seed there, except on mountain ridges or on the coast. This is reflected in the pattern of distribution of the indigenous Coniferae, viz. species of Ayathis, Dacrydium and Podocarpus (sensu lato), which are concentrated in such places with one species of Podocarpus on the tops of steep limestone hills. These are the only places with regular air movements, though this raises serious questions about how the trees of the gymnosperm forests of the past were pollinated. 6.3.4 Other mammals Non-flying mammals have for some time been suspected to be pollinators in a number of vegetation types outside the tropics and, in recent years, this has been proved to be so in both South Africa and Australia. It is now known that three species of forest plant in the Amazonian forest of southeast Peru are visited by up to seven species of diurnal and six species of nocturnal non-flying mammals in the dry season. Heavy deposits of pollen were found on the facial fur of these animals. They might be considered likely to feed on flowers at a time, such as the dry season, when there is a scarcity of fruit. Of the species observed, the canopy liane, Combretum fruticosum (Combretaceae), was seen to be visited by primates including the pygmy marmoset, while the tree, Quararibea cordata (Bombacaceae), was visited by large primates, opossums and kinkajous. It was notable that in the Peruvian forest some four genera of marsupials were involved, members of the group that comprises the non-flying mammalian pollinators of Australia. Three species of rodent are reported to pollinate Blakea species (Melastomataceae) in the cloud forests of Costa Rica: the nocturnal anthesis and nectar production suggests bats but the lack of scent and cryptic nowers hidden in the foliage do not and, indeed, the nowers are not visited by bats in the harsh, windy environment. 6.4 The milieu for ‘mutualism' The intergrading interactions between plants and animals, herbivory, dispersal and pollination, present several conflicts summed up as defence versus attraction. For example, in Parkia (discussed above), the sequential use of pollinators versus the sequential susceptibility to bruchid attack on the seeds. In continuously flowering species such as Muntingia calabura, trees are attractive to beneficial agents, pollinators and dispersers, at the  same time. The potential conflict in this species is removed because the flowers are pollinated above the branches by bees, the pedicels lengthening and becoming erect, to be lowered in fruit, when bats disperse the fruits from below the branches. This tree is one of the most commonly planted shade trees in India and elsewhere, yet only very lately has its phenology been fully investigated. The various animal-plant interactions cannot be isolated from one another, therefore. In reviewing some of them in this book, it has been found that several complicating features arise, beside the straightforward failings of human beings wishing to pigeon-hole phenomena or experiences into neat categories: ‘strategies’ or ‘syndromes’with classical-sounding names. Firstly, then, as we have seen, tropical rain-forest ecology is fundamentally dynamic; it is not ‘stable’. Even in the short term, dependent on local circumstances, the numbers and behaviour of dispersal and pollination agents can change such that short-term observations are sometimes very misleading. An example of dispersal agents, which is the male toucan in Costa Rica, which defends sections of fruiting trees against all other frugivores besides his mate, displacing them by threat; however, when food is abundant, this does not occur. Again, the behaviour of predators may affect the pollinating activities of animals such as bats, encouraging them to make short visits repeatedly, rather than long ones. The ramifications in terms of outcrossing are clear. Pollinator assemblages for any particular plant vary in space and time, both seasonally and year by year, which is perhaps not surprising in view of animal cycles and the fact that the environment ‘perceived’ by a plant species is irregularly and somewhat erratically structured, i.e. has a strong stochastic component. The inevitable consequences in terms of the frequency of pollen deposition on stigmas, the numbers of grains and the ‘quality’ of those grains from the ‘point of view’of the maternal genotype may lead to selective abortion of embryos. In a Mediterranean example (Lavatera latifolia, Malvaceae), Hymenoptera delivered more pollen-grain more often than Lepidoptera or Diptera; Lepidoptera tended to ny longer distances between consecutive flowers than Hymenoptera or Diptera. Bees pollinated frequently and with large loads but generally promoted geitonogamy, whereas butterflies pollinated less often and with smaller loads but usually cross pollinated; flies pollinated infrequently, with small loads and generally promoted geitonogamy. Within each group, however, there were exceptions. In years with more bees, there is clearly a different quality of pollination and this varies with the time in the season considered, but poorer quality pollination at other times is better than none, so that specialization with one pollinator per plant species is unlikely to evolve. Nevertheless, specialization in some groups of plants does occur, as it does in some of animals, such that the broadly different ‘syndromes’ of pollination and dispersal have evolved repeatedly in different families and genera of plants and are apparently incipient even within some species. However, when observed over long periods, many species are found to be generalist in that individuals of them are capable of taking advantage of ‘specialist’ interactions at any one time: the ‘anachronisms’show this, as do the generalized pollinators on islands where plants have ‘left their pollinators behind’, e.g. a cetoniid beetle, Mauseolopsis aldabrensis, visits 58% of all flowering species, native or introduced, of all colours and morphology, on the coral atoll of Aldabra off the African coast, but it shows a remarkably high degree of constancy in its foraging flights. Secondly, many of the ‘interactions’ are actually mediated by other organisms, usually micro-organisms, whether they be involved in allelopathic phenomena in succession, or are gut microbes in primate stomachs, or mycorrhizae, or fixing nitrogen, or living in ant nests or fig syconia or the guts of termites, or perhaps involved in promoting pig migrations. Clearly we need to know more, for example, it is reported that the red leafmonkey (Presbytis rubicunda) in northern Borneo, like other primates, eats soil, usually from termite mounds, but the soil has been analysed only chemically with no clear-cut conclusions: what about the micro-organisms and their products? Thirdly, is the inevitable consequence of good arrangements the presence of cheats, including mimics, thieves, parasites, parasitoids, nectar-robbers, toxin-users, and, of course, the whole pyramid of carnivores based on the herbivores, some of which (as in the case of the hapless fig-wasps) have been mentioned above, notably birds and ants. The relationship between ants and other animals, particularly their farmed Homoptera feeding off the host plants is complicated in itself but, in the Old World Tropics, mosquitoes of the genus Malaya are associated in their habits with certain ants, which run up and down tree trunks carrying the honey-dew they have taken from their aphids. The mosquito hovers a couple of centimetres from the trunk and suddenly alights in front of the ant. It does not touch it but vibrates its wings: in response the ant opens its jaws, between which the mosquito pushes its proboscis and steals the honey dew. And what eats the mosquito'? So far as ants are concerned, a single pangolin can eat up to 73 million of them, or termites, in 1 year, while ant eaters on Barro Colorado Island attack termite and Azteca ant nests; of arboreal nests, 91% of the termite ones and 37% of Azteca nests are attacked each year. In addition some 16% of the termite nests are abandoned annually, usually following tree falls. A much-investigated system is that of the fig syconium, which is a microcosm until its wall is punctured. Few systems are closed for so long: bromeliads, epiphytes of the Neotropics, with ‘tanks’ of up to 2 litres can contain up to seven species of algae, as well as bacteria, protozoa, rotifers, flatworms, oligochaetes and other invertebrates such as crabs, insect larvae etc. as well as tadpoles. Nepenthes pitcher-plants bear pitchers with fungi and slime-moulds, protozoans, desmids, diatoms, rotifers, oligochaetes, crustaceans, insect larvae and even tadpoles, with spiders positioned above the liquid awaiting a catch and the small primate, Tarsius spectrum, in Sabah, feeding off trapped insects. Some animals live only in the pitchers, others (a minority) are also found living elsewhere. Misumenops nepenthicola, a spider, lives there and captures flies; if these are distasteful they are (sometimes) thrown back into the pitcher; if disturbed, the spider goes down into the liquid on a thread, its armour and a bubble of air making it immune to the digestive juices there. But most of these ramifications are beyond the scope of this volume, though they provide the ‘milieu for mutualism’. To take a final example, leaf-cutting ants have been extensively investigated but Atta nests have conspicuous mounds of refuse nearby and this is derived from the fungus gardens; when the nests are near river banks, streams are used as disposal sites. In slow-flowing streams in the seasonal areas of Costa Rica, the debris accumulates and affects the frequency of the characid fish, Astynax fasciatus, a generalist feeder. Pools with the detritus would be expected to harbour more fish, but then predation from the belted kingfisher, Ceryle alcyon, increases. Conversely, refuse on the surface occludes predator vision and predation can sometimes be low. The ripples from each ecological ‘splash’ overlap and intermingle, the ripples varying in speed and height with time. Nevertheless ecology has started with that which is obvious to the eye and is increasingly concerned with what is not. Until recently, the ecological significance of pheromones and olfactory clues in insects, as in the pollination systems of figs and orchids discussed above, was little considered. However it is not merely the invisible that points to our ignorance. Our knowledge of the basic natural history of some groups is still lamentable. For example, some of the most memorable features of fieldwork in the Old World Tropics from Madagascar eastwards, leeches, are so little known that their behaviour towards animals other than humans is unrecorded.

Seeing mum. something erm next week. So you don't fancy this afternoon? In the morning. Oh yeah well  yeah I mean if if they if  Cos as I say if we did see Sefton Avenue or New Drove today. If there's nothing available. That's what I meant. Oh yeah, there's plenty of time. I don't really want to go on a Saturday. Saturday afternoons with mum. Saturday afternoons with Helen. well I wouldn't be absolutely  if, if I had to go out then I'd have to go out. Then there's always Saturday morning  see Helen but then Stuart likes to sleep in. But no I think Saturday's out really. It's not a day for viewing houses. We could go out Sunday? And mum could come as well. I don't know whether they work   Oh yes. People at work all the week don't they? Yes. Gets dark in the evenings then then then  definitely. That's the only time you can view a property. I mean unless somebody's living in it you can't go in the evenings in the winter can you? And I don't  fancy a house that somebody's actually living in. Cos then you've got ta wait while they Yeah. And it can all fall through because theirs is falling through or they can't get out when you want and  that can go on for  Can it not? Yeah. Sometimes it just can't be helped cos there's nothing  in your price range you know that you like that  isn't empty but  I would prefer  an empty property so that when we decide and then whatever just  Certainly if we'd see something that would do this afternoon, or  New Drove  today, that's fine. No problem. Two of them at New Drove are downstairs and one is an upstairs. The one upstairs, because it hasn't got a bay window Yes. is larger. The upstairs one is slightly larger. The upstairs one's larger? number seven which is an upstairs one  hasn't got any bay windows. It is  larger than the two five and six that are downstairs. Who's selling that one? Well one's Cornerstone. One's Cornerstone  So one's Cornerstone and two are the other  Two are Hansard  Yeah. I think it's Cornerstone one that's  the larger of the two, the three. Six  seven. Hansard. Hansard. They're doing five and seven so they've got one above each other. So they've got  one  one's doing two and one's doing one. One's doing five and seven which is  this is for two and one's doing six which is this one. Yeah. Seven is definitely slightly bigger than six and five. I checked it out. The lounge is fourteen by ten. The bedroom is thirteen nine by nine  instead of eleven by eight. That kitchen's thirteen by five, that totals eleven by seven. Neither here nor there is it? No. None of it's much difference. It's only a diff er it's a matter of two feet here and Yes. But then I don't mind . I don't mind living upstairs or on the ground. Well I mean if they've got the key to both might  haven't decided on both of them you might as well go and see them. Yeah. Both of them. See which one you like the best or if you like them at all. But as it's  got that financial package That's Cornerstone? Yeah. Don't know whether the same applies to the other two. it. The financial package . With Cornerstone? Cornerstone. Doesn't actually say that in  Pantiles  No Oh. Just have to ask . Yeah. But actually the one at Cornerstone is fifty pound cheaper than the both of them at Hansard. It is! Fifty pound. One's nine nine fifty and one's nine nine five, yeah. So it's forty five pound different. Well that's a good way, if you think about it he's got, he's got four flats there  hasn't he? Oh yeah. Four flats at thirty thousand. That's a hundred and twenty thousand for two houses. They could be sixty thousand apiece. Yeah. Whereas if he had, if he sold them as separate houses he'd probably get forty thousand apiece. Yeah that's just  Yeah. Forty five thousand even apiece. Yeah. But he's making the money by selling them as flats. Yeah. The only difference is he's had a few thousand extra because it's got two kitchens and two bathrooms. partitions and  Yeah true he's had that yeah extra fittings. But apart from that oh an extra bath instead of the other bedroom Yeah. Yeah. and erm another kitchen instead of a dining room or something and that's the only difference. Say three four thousand probably. For the extra bits and pieces that's all. Yeah. I don't know how many of them there are. Whether they only had four flats or whether there's a  flat on another block and another block of fours down the road. I mean I don't know. Only assume there's  you've got that one block. Well there might be  four blocks of four or  I du n no. No I don't think so. Not enough space for them. No I don't know. I mean you know the area better than me. Unless they've knocked them garages down or something  I've no idea . I know them council houses aren't usually  but I mean I can't visualize how much land there is. I only know that by going to school and   Yeah. where they are. Yeah. Probably should have gone the other way into town but that Eh? Neither here nor there. Well you could have gone sort of like round the Rainbow and  that way on. That's what I meant. the bypass  that end of town  would have been perhaps a little bit clearer. If you look at the first it might help you to decide whether you like  That's it. Whether you wanna go and see it. Whether you wanna go and see them or not. Whether you like the positions. I mean we know where Sefton Avenue is and we know that's Well we know where it is. a nice house. Well we don't know really. We haven't seen it have we? Well I mean  I mean  Yeah but we haven't actually looked ins  No but I mean I know which house it is with that  one, and you do don't you? I think so yes. Well I think so as well. But it would be nice just to go and have a quick  check. Oh I think, just to make sure that   Just to make sure I like it. Or  it is the house that we're thinking about. We think it is. You may not like it. I said as soon as I see it in the paper oh that looks nice. Where's that? I mean  not sure. is it? Or is this the one round the other end? It's that one. It's up here. That one there right on the corner yeah? Yes. That's it. I thought there was a separate  but it's not, no it's not is it? Think it is. It's an older property. Got the double glazing. Alright. Looks nice. Nice house though isn't it? Yeah it's an older, more solid house. You know sometimes I like as I say they've got  Yeah. Yeah Yeah true. Very true. they've got erm Very true. Yeah it's a nice house. And this is a back, the back door  Oh I see. Yeah. this one because you, there's the back view look I mean that's  that's a back door isn't it? So you have the downstairs back and the the front stairs go up to the  can't actually see   That's definitely the back door. There's a parking space as well. Oh yeah it says allotted parking space."

Similar but not the same. No not the same, that's true. Mind you I suppose out of a catalogue it's  at least you can feel them and see them  all that. Oh and I'd rather Only on   see the whole roll. I'd rather go in the shop and see it  cos sometimes, especially if it's got a pattern on  turn out to be better than the catalogue  cos when it comes, it don't look the same, and then the same colour do you? Cos a  reproduction's never  perfect is it? No. In a photograph it's never  true  then you go in a shop and what you see is what you get.

So that's why  we haven't, we haven't been in touch with you at all  No. cos, do you want this ? Yes. Well  Yes. the weekend though. Okay. Have a look at this and I'll speak to you  Right. Okay. about it later on. Do you go to the dentist locally? Aha. At  Hill. At  Hill? Mhm. I know they're excepting patients for checks there, because they sometimes say  they're still busy That's right. so the last thing they want is extra children to come in. Who do you see there? Erm, erm Mr ? Mr  Yeah Mr . Right. He's got red hair. That's  Yes. right. Mhm. Okay. Mhm. Have a word with them the next time you're in Right. and see if you can take the children in. So that's why the checks are . Yes, really. Isn't it? That's why it was handy at the primary school. That's right. Well we won't  Mhm. be taking the mobile   but if you have problems and you find getting the children over to  Hill is difficult, cos it's not always easy to . Mhm. Erm, do you get a half day off ? Friday  Mhm. today. Right. Mm. You may be able to get them down today. But if you have problems do come back and see us, and if there's nothing  Right. left. But if you don't wanna  of course. No. And will you both come in together? Or do you want to come in separately? We'll come in together? Mm? We'll come in together. Right. Okay. Together. In you come. Right. On you go. Who's going to go first? I am. You're first. Mm. Oh."
FIC FIC-AC2-008 2.66 "The drinks party was evaporating slowly as guests said their goodbyes. Clem Bunker was talking to Mark in the garden. ‘Lovely home, Mark,’ said the union man. ‘Will you be able to keep it?’ Mark stopped in his tracks. ‘So you've heard already,’ he said. ‘Bush telegraph still as reliable as ever.’ ‘Never fails,’ Clem replied, adding, ‘Don Peters told me. He shook his head sadly. ‘I really am sorry, Mark. Do you know who is replacing Peters?’ ‘Not a clue. Hasn't been announced yet.’ ‘Another American, I suppose?’ said the union man. ‘Bound to be.’ They sat at a circular wrought iron table shaded by a willow. ‘Do you really think the Division could go out as a result of this latest strike? Or is it just another ‘Cry Wolf situation?, asked Bunker after a long pause. ‘The Division's been going out for the last fifteen years; slowly but surely.’ said the ex-management man. ‘This is the last straw.’ The union man winced. ‘To be honest, Clem, it started to go out twenty years ago when we failed to join the Common Market at the outset. All the new industrial investment was switched to the continent. The UK was effectively a back number from that moment. The new plants on the continent then did a better productivity job, and that was that. The more the UK Vehicle Division  restricted output, the more sure it headed for the final chop.’ Clem Bunker was shaking his head, sadly. ‘You know, Clem,’ Mark continued, ‘if we ARE going to fight our way back to the top again we are going to have to do it by our own collective efforts. Nobody else is going to help us. The Americans? Ha…. That's a laugh…. The Russians? Now there's an alternative for you. The Workers’ Paradise that still can't feed its own people.’ Mark raised his glass in salute. ‘We've been fighting each other like spoilt kids instead of fighting the real enemy, our international competitors. That’ s our stupidity,’he said sadly as if unburdening himself of a great guilt. ‘People like you and me,’ Clem replied with a smile, raising his glass. Mark nodded and smiled back. ‘Yes, I suppose so, Clem. People like you and me. At least we are builders, not bloody wreckers,’ he added in mitigation. Bully for us. Let s drink to that, Clem said. ‘To the builders of this world.’ Andrew and Vicky appeared on the terrace. ‘Don't tell me that you two are talking shop,’ Andrew said. ‘Don't you ever switch off?’ ‘Andrew, my dear boy, your father and I are talking matters of great pith and moment,’ replied Clem. ‘Ask your mother and Gwen to join us in the garden, will you Andrew?’ Mark said. ‘And bring another bottle with you. This stuff is very more-ish. Clem and I are getting addicted.’ ‘Daddy tells me that you were apprentices together at United Motors,’ Vicky said. She half-turned as her mother and Georgina joined them. ‘Amazing isn't it, Mummy? They even look alike, don't you think?’ ‘Yes, I suppose they do….’ Gwen Bunker looked from one  man to the other, cocking her head to one side as she appraised the merchandise. ‘Do tell us about your apprentice days, Daddy,’ said Vicky. ‘What was it like? Did you fight over the same girl friends? ‘No’ said her Mother. ‘They kept the fighting till later when they sat on the management-union joint negotiation committee. I used to hear all about it. Mark said this and I said that.’ ‘Nostalgia ain't what it used to be,’ interjected Andrew, quoting the latest college graffiti. Clem grinned. ‘Do you remember, Mark when you had to strip naked and tie that sack around your waist?’ he asked. ‘Do I remember! How could I ever forget!’ said Mark, holding a hand over his eyes. ‘Whatever happened?’ asked Vicky. Punctuated by interjections from Mark, Clem told the story of how Mark had fallen into a barrel of high viscosity oil while standing on the lid to get at another barrel with his hand pump. He had been stripped naked in the oil store, where the incident had occurred during their very first month as apprentices, and his clothes triumphantly borne aloft to the plating shop to be washed in one of the hot water tanks. When the news hit the factory floor, young girls were sent off to the stores with requisitions to get a good look at the loincloth apprentice. One young girl who had stood giggling at the hapless Mark for more than ten minutes was told that she could go back to her department as she'd waited long enough. When she objected that she shouldn't be sent back empty handed, she was shown what had been written on her requisition. ‘Please supply: ONE LONG WEIGHT’. ‘But how did you come to go your separate ways?’ Vicky asked as the laughter subsided. ‘What influenced you both?, ‘Well,’ said Clem. ‘I know what influenced me. It was a man named Arthur Billstock. A toolmaker. I was put to work with him on the same bench and he not only taught me toolmaking, he also taught me about the trade union movement and the kind of society he wanted to see.’ ‘Ah, the local militant,’ said Andrew. ‘No, not at all,’ Clem replied. ‘In fact he was really a very quiet and rather reserved man, who preferred to keep in the background rather than hog the limelight. We talked a lot during those months on the same bench together, and it was his influence which set me on the trade union path. If it hadn't been for Arthur Billstock, I would probably have taken the same road as Mark. That was the road we apprentices were expected to take. Must have been crazy not to do so. Might have ended up with a house like this,’ he added with a laugh. ‘He's always been a bit funny in the head,’ joked Gwen. How about you, Mark? What influenced you? she added. ‘Well,’ said Mark, topping up their glasses. ‘I suppose I should have followed Clem into the trade union movement. We apprentices were never short of advice on what was wrong with society and the system. But I found it all too negative and depressing. Success was supposed to be reserved for those with silver spoons in their mouths. I well remember the words of an old foreman who said to me, Son, even if you have the talent and ability to take you to the top, there is still no guarantee that you will ever get there, or even half way. But as sure as God made little apples, you certainly won't get there if you don't make the effort.’ That clinched it for me. I suppose that simple precept from that old foreman stood me in good stead for thirty odd years, until now.’ ‘Why until now, Dad?’ enquired Andrew, unaware of his father's predicament. ‘I suppose I should have said up to now,’ Mark replied disarmingly. ‘Perhaps it will help me over the next thirty,’ he added as an afterthought. ‘But you are both very similar men, from similar backgrounds and with the same basic objectives in society,’ Vicky said, with the air of a very puzzled young lady. ‘Don't you still want the same things? ‘Oh, but we do,’ her father told her. ‘We both want to improve things; to build a better world. I thought that I could make my contribution by joining the Trade Union movement, and improve things from there.’ ‘And I thought I could make mine by designing and making better products, and selling them to the world,’ said Mark. ‘Now how about something to eat? I'm starving.’ A few days later the national press carried the headlines that the UM plants in the Midlands had now been made idle as a consequence of the Merseyside strike. The flow of supplies into the Midlands from the Merseyside works had dried up completely and with no apparent end to the stoppage in sight, lay-offs took immediate effect. Feelings were running high at all plants, but for different reasons. The news that Don Peters was being replaced had been received with great disappointment and alarm throughout the Midlands by management, unions and employees alike. Disappointment that they were losing the best American M D they had ever had, after less than one year, and alarm in the knowledge that his demotion almost certainly meant the end of the recovery and expansion plans, and possibly the end of vehicle manufacture in the UK. Such was the state of concern at the Midlands plants that conveners and local members of Parliament were demanding intervention at Government level. Some of the thirty thousand workers employed at the Midlands plants, incensed by the idleness forced on them by the Merseysiders and alarmed at the bleak prospect ahead, stormed through the streets to Clem Bunker's regional office demanding action to get the Merseyside plants back to work. Bunker was jostled, heckled, spat upon and sworn at as he tried to keep some semblance of order to explain the action he had already taken. After two very noisy and unruly hours, with the local police trying to keep law and order, the angry mob reluctantly dispersed. On Merseyside, the plant had split into two factions over the strike; those who supported Clasper in his demand that the strike be continued until the sacked shop steward had been reinstated, and those who took the view that Clasper was playing power politics with their jobs at stake. The latter demanded that the strike be called off to avoid even worse news. This view represented the thoughts of an ever-growing majority whose intuitive feeling was that the Merseyside plant was heading for total and irreversible closure with the loss of  ten thousand jobs. Clasper was becoming more isolated, with his dwindling support coming from a small core of left-wingers who considered the fight to be a question of principle, namely union solidarity against management. Bunker's early efforts to bring about a settlement had been angrily brushed aside by Clasper, who told the regional officer in no uncertain terms that his help was not needed. The Merseyside members would resolve the dispute in their own way without his help. Bunker knew instinctively that Clasper could not, and would not, resolve the dispute himself and that the effects of the stoppage would very soon be felt far beyond the confines of United Motors as one supply industry after another experienced a precipitous drop in demand. He also knew that if Clasper was to be toppled from his influential position as plant convener — which was essential to the long term recovery of the plant — he would have to be seen to be toppled by his own members, acting in their own interests. He therefore resolved to keep out of the way and let Clasper hang himself. The Midlands' plants had been putting great pressure on the Merseysiders to call off the strike, as a result of which a mass meeting at Pier Head, Liverpool, had been demanded to vote on the question of a return to work. Although this had initially been rejected out of hand by Clasper, he had been left in no doubt that his members would hold their own mass meeting without him if he chose not to call it. At the same time, hundreds of workers in the Midlands plants who had heard about the Pier Head meeting on the grapevine now decided to drive up to Liverpool to influence the return to work vote. Confident that Clasper would be brought down by his own members without any interference from him, Bunker concluded that his best course of action would be to emulate Brer Rabbit on this occasion, and ‘lie low and say nuffin'.’ Mark's address to an international audience at Trinity College, Dublin, came as a shock to European Commissioners, Government Ministers and their academic  advisers. He had been invited to speak on the factors which influenced investment location decisions as seen from the viewpoint of a European Industrial Planning Manager. He was the fourth of twelve speakers over the three day conference, the others being Ministers, Commissioners, Economists and Academics, and had been introduced by the Chairman as ‘The Man at the Sharp End’. He had based his paper strictly on his own practical experiences, working within the labyrinth of conflicting laws, rules and regulations imposed by individual Governments within the EEC, EFTA and East Europe. He sought to show how the laws imposed by certain countries to attract internationally mobile inward investment could only operate to the detriment of other states. He exposed the many devious ways in which Governments bent the rules of free trade in their favour, while flying the free trade banner. He described how the Japanese used a laser beam strategy within a poorly drafted law to penetrate the European market while protecting their own domestic market behind a dynastic organisational structure which only permitted import access when the dynasty deemed it politically expedient to do so. He itemised the steps by which East European Governments gained access to the free markets of West Europe, while denying the same freedom of access to West European manufacturers, and revealed how reciprocal trade deals negotiated with the multi-nationals resulted in unsuspecting third party EEC Governments being saddled with the import bill. He then went on to describe the very considerable commercial and economic disadvantages experienced by peripheral industrial countries compared with the enormous advantages enjoyed by the privileged centrally placed Golden Triangle countries and called to question the entire concept of a European budget which incredibly penalised the poorer peripheral countries instead of applying the penalty the other way round. He concluded his forty-five minute address by commenting on the political factors which influenced investment location decisions and emphasised that future multi-national planners would do well to have a much more sensitive appreciation of the social and political implications of their  actions. Government intervention would inevitably follow if Governments had reason to believe that their interests were not being fairly served. He sat down, knowing in his heart of hearts that for as long as Randy Mueller had a major part to play in UM's corporate planning, his basic criteria would be: ‘Is it good for the Corporation? Is it good for the United States? And, above all, is it good for Randy Mueller?’ Delegate after delegate during the three day conference subsequently referred to his address to confess that the real world of the International Planning Manager was a totally different world from that perceived by politicians and their academic advisers. One distinguished-looking delegate, who Mark recognised as the Chairman of the British Conservative party, introduced himself to say that people with his experience should put themselves forward to serve in the European Parliament. ‘I am going to put your name on the list we are drawing up,’ he said grandiloquently. ‘I feel sure that one of the industrial constituencies would be interested in a chap with your industrial background.’"
FIC FIC-BPA-002 0.89 "The destination of John Delaney was a room in the subterranean complex beneath the square, featureless block that was the Ministry of Defence, in Whitehall. His car, led by a police escort, swung in past the craggy statue of Field Marshal Montgomery. Cleared with the security guards at the desk he went into the lift that would take him down to a depth below the level of the Thames. The area he was entering was guarded by an advanced intruder detection system which included thermal sensors, vibration detectors and infra-red closed circuit television, all integrated into a computer system. As soon as he stepped out into the fluorescent-lit corridor, he was met by an official who hurried him into a briefing room. An air of emergency was reflected in the men busy at the large illuminated translucent plot that dominated the end of the room, at the messengers disappearing through doors and at telephones giving out their muted urgent calls. Several men, navy with gold braid in evidence, turned towards him as Delaney walked over, eyes automatically glancing at the geography and configurations on the plastic: Atlantic, beyond the equator. ‘Ah, John.’ The tight-lipped, sandy-haired man holding out his hand was well known to Delaney. William Connors had briefed him many times in the past, yet Delaney even now, was unsure of just where Connors fitted into the scheme of things. But he accepted it was all part of the deliberate fuzzing that went with G9. Delaney shook Connors by the hand. ‘What have we got?’ ‘Come over here.’ Connors led him away from the others. Mystified, Delaney, still trying to take in more details of the map, followed. He waited as, unusually, Connors seemed to experience difficulty in putting the words he wanted together. ‘It's a thirty thousand tonne container ship. One of ours. Something funny's happened. Had a weird, rambling emergency call from the radio operator. Then absolute silence. Not a peep from her since.’ Connors paused momentarily and looked  straight at Delaney, before he continued. ‘She's dead in the water, and out of range of our conventional rescue forces. We want you there to check out what the hell has happened. And secondly, we want you to stop anybody boarding her under pretext of rescue — or salvage.’ Delaney raised a critical eyebrow: His one question went to the heart of the matter, since he could think of no other reason for the involvement of G9. ‘Cargo?’ Connors' lips tightened even further as he nodded. ‘Exactly, but I'm afraid it's on a need to know basis. And it's been decided G9 do not need to know. Nor for that matter do I.’ Delaney, searching in his pocket for his pipe, shrugged. That sort of thing wasn't unusual. It helped if you got caught to know as little as possible. ‘Unfortunately, the nearest surface units are elements of the Red Navy,’ Connors continued, ‘and to complicate matters they've got a sub even closer, capable of reaching the area sometime after dawn. We know it's already heading that way. Apart from our Nimrods, there has been at least one overflight by a Tupolev.’ He gestured towards the situation map, almost apologetically. ‘Nasty one. Maritime job. Desperate rush. Going in at night. But we want you in there fast !’ Delaney was puzzled. ‘Why G9?’ he asked. ‘If you need an instant military presence, why not the marines? The SBS would love this one.’ Connors shook his head. ‘It's not that simple. The ship's not publicly connected with us. In fact, it's flying a flag of convenience.’ ‘I see.’ Delaney sucked thoughtfully on his empty pipe. G9 was designated civilian — on its own if anything went wrong. They were used to clean up any unpleasant incidents from which HM Government needed to distance itself. And the Americans. It was funded jointly. ‘Maybe it's already crawling with Reds. Too many for us. What do we do then?’ Connors gave a sympathetic shrug; but it was a steely look. ‘Simply blow it out of the water,’ he said. Delaney's eyebrows shot upwards. ‘And us with it?’ A ghost of a smile, without humour, flitted over Connors' face as he slapped Delaney on the back. ‘You people know how to survive. And it will only be forty-eight hours before relief arrives.’ His face clouded. ‘Whatever has happened to that ship — Titron — it's weird. The Nimrods have gone in low, and taken photographs before dusk. Here, take a look.’ Connors splayed out some large black and whites on a side bench. Delaney bent over them, adjusting a lamp and using a magnifying glass. ‘Not a sign of anybody on the deck. Through the wheelhouse windows — nothing. The lifeboats are intact, and on their davits.’ Delaney found himself looking at a cargo vessel with a very high superstructure three-quarters aft. Each side of the funnel was a lifeboat, and at the stern was a stores davit and capstan. Running forward were a series of derricks. The bow was bulbous. There was no sign of life on the deck between the stacked containers. She looked enormous. He examined several photographs in shades of green, obviously taken after nightfall with a light intensifying lens. The greenish hue added to the mystery, making Titron look like a ghost ship. Delaney lowered the last photograph. ‘Bigger than I thought.’ Connors lit a cigarette and nodded as he inhaled the smoke. ‘She's got a capacity for two thousand three hundred containers, and is almost as long as the QE2.’ ‘Maybe the crew are being kept prisoners,’ Delaney offered, straightening up. ‘Nobody allowed on the decks.’ Connors looked at him intently through the smoke haze as he reached out and switched on a tape recorder. There was a hissing. The voice was weak, and barely audible. ‘… MV Titron…repeat Titron. We are experiencing difficulty…’ The hissing returned, stronger this time, drowning everything out. When it faded again the voice was garbled, rising hysterically. ‘…the stars are getting bigger…pulsating…and the sea…it's beginning to boil…’ The voice became high-pitched, crazed with fear. ‘…the sky's turning green. Everything's changing…the ship…’ Background noises, like screaming, welled up, as did the hissing interference. When it faded once again there was nothing. Connors, whose intense gaze never left Delaney, switched the machine off. ‘That's all.’ Somewhere in the silence between them a telephone began its urgent, persistent ring. It served to stimulate Connors. ‘There's one other thing you should know. The Soviets have got some sort of space experiment going on. Not the usual thing. Telemetry data and photographs are still being analysed by US intelligence agencies, but it may be their much-vaunted fighter spacecraft. The point is, they have got a kind of recovery fleet out, about two hundred miles from Titron. One of the ships is the Gargarin.’ When Delaney continued to look blank, Connors explained. ‘Weird looking top-heavy craft with four huge radar dishes and a massive navigation b ridge.’ ‘Let's get this straight,’ Delaney said, perplexed. ‘Are you suggesting there is any connection between the Soviet space shot and what has happened to Titron?’ Connors took his time to answer. ‘My guess is no. There is a mystery, but I don't think Ivan is behind it…at least, not deliberately.’ Delaney looked at Connors, searchingly. ‘Accidentally?’ Connors shrugged, and turned his attention back to the tape recorder. ‘Want to hear it again?’ Delaney nodded. When it came to an end, Delaney shook his head. ‘The man sounds crazed…mad. That bit about the sea boiling — what do the met people have to say?’ ‘Come and hear for yourself,’ Connors said, pointing across the room. The meteorologist's briefing on the weather in the operational zone for the previous twenty-four hours left no possibility of hurricane force winds. ‘At no time were the wind speeds anything but light,’ the meteorologist confirmed, as he lowered his clip-board. ‘I can guarantee that sea conditions were calm. However…’ He looked apologetic. ‘…since nightfall, the wind has backed around to the south, with sea swells of some ten to fifteen feet. Gales of force eight gusting to storm force ten can be expected in the area well after dawn.’ Delaney transposed the ten to fifteen feet into a visual image of the wave motion down the side of the hull. In less than six hours' time — and there it would still be night — he would be attempting to scale the steel wall, trying not to get crushed against it. ‘What about that bit in the tape?’ He glanced  at Connors to ensure that the met man knew what he was talking about — Connors nodded. ‘About the sky turning green. Any possible meteorological explanation?’ The met man removed his glasses and, with his white handkerchief, commenced to polish them vigorously, considering the question for a moment. ‘There are, of course, all possible reasons for lights in the night sky, the aurora borealis being the most famous. There are fireballs and electrical storms, or some sort of celestial display. Meteors…or something.’ He shook his head. ‘Frankly, I don't think so.’ Delaney persisted. ‘Electrical storms. Do you think that could be the interference on the radio transmission?’ The met man was adamant. ‘Definitely not. It would have to have been one hell of a continuous storm, and there is nothing in my readings, satellite scan or computer print-out, to suggest that.’ Thanking him, Delaney and Connors walked over to the main plot. ‘Do the radio people think it was deliberate jamming?’ Delaney asked. Connors shook his head. ‘Just couldn't say with any certainty.’ When they reached the plot, a man wearing  earphones turned to Connors, slipped off the headset, allowing it to rest around his neck. ‘Received a report from the Nimrod. Overflight by a Tupolev took place again just after nightfall. They weren't absolutely sure, but for a while afterwards they appeared to have a small surface radar contact one nautical mile east of Titron. Then it just disappeared.’ Connors and Delaney eyed each other. ‘You thinking the way I am?’ Grimly Delaney slipped the pipe back into his pocket and nodded. ‘They've had a go at getting on her.’"
FIC FIC-BPA-009 0.87 "They searched for over an hour, following at first some vague footprints in the smudged, dark liquid. But they petered out in the maze of corridors. There was no trace of Silk. No response from his two-way radio. ‘Dead or alive, he's got to be somewhere.’ Forster was restless, not unlike a caged tiger, as he crossed and re-crossed the wheelhouse. ‘He can't have just disappeared,’ Nell said. ‘He must be in one of the containers down there.’ Delaney turned from the rain trickling down the window. ‘We'll do what we can, but let's not forget we are here to secure the ship, and the best place to do that is from here. We can't afford to get cut off and pinned down in the hold.’ When nobody spoke he broke the accusing silence. ‘Gene, let's go and find that lost radio room. Maybe we can beat the interference; get more information on what's been going on out here.’ ‘If they wouldn't tell us the first time, why should they do so now?’ Nell said, looking drawn, tired, with dark rings forming under her eyes. Delaney remembered again that look in Connors' eye; and knew Nell was right. But he said nothing, and as he led the way, Forster followed him. It was slow work, moving all the time with extreme caution, just the two of them, their beams of light, the ever-present blackness, and the half-seen outlines just beyond the light. They checked every door and cupboard in the superstructure. It was only when they came out of the rearmost door and found a temporary hut facing them with Radio Room marked on the door, that they realised why they hadn't found it the first time. At a nod from Delaney, Forster gently turned the handle. Then Delaney rushed forward, shoulder first, bursting the door open as he rolled in, with Forster's light beam sweeping way ahead of him. The room was empty. They stared around them in disbelief. Although Grant was the expert of the group, they both knew enough to realise that the equipment stacked around was sophisticated, and far too much for Titron if she had been but an ordinary container ship. And by now they knew she was not. A red light above the panel showed the equipment was on, supplied by automatic power, probably from batteries. Forster moved further into the room. ‘Looks more like the communications centre of a nuclear sub.’ They searched carefully until they were satisfied that the sensitive area was not armed for self-destruction, as many were. Delaney finally thumbed the button on the speaker set. The static roared out from the earphones, stronger than ever. He held the headset away from him, using only one ear as they tried several wavelengths. It was hopeless. Delaney gave up, shutting it off and swivelling out of the chair. ‘Something else is running on emergency power and producing that interference. Let's go and find out what it is.’ Forster held up his transceiver. ‘We could try tracking it with this.’ They went outside, Forster turning around with the set switched on, and finding the direction where the static was the strongest. ‘It's coming from the stern.’ They worked their way past the starboard lifeboat, and down another short ladder. Against the lighter foaming sea was just visible a large windowless domed structure. They paused, weighing it up. ‘Radar?’ Forster questioned. ‘Or some sort of electronic counter measure?’ Delaney nodded. ‘It wasn't obvious on the photograph they showed me.’ As they drew nearer they became conscious of a high pitched humming noise. Forster tried the transceiver. The interference was total. They walked around the outside. There was no visible way in. Forster scratched at a riveted panel without success. ‘Must be reached from another deck level. Underneath.’ Delaney nodded, sinking to his haunches. From one of his pouches he took what looked like a package of grey plasticine. Removing the wrapping he began pressing the plastic explosive tightly around the rivet line. Forster grinned. ‘Going to blow it up?’ Delaney didn't look up, but carried on with his preparations. ‘Those people at the MOD haven't played fair with us, so I owe them nothing.’ Forster chuckled. ‘You're probably going to set the taxpayer  back a couple of million, unless these things are made of plate steel.’ Delaney inserted the detonator pin attached to the timer, primed the circuit, and set ten seconds of fuse. Legging it, they got down behind cover just as the last second ran out. The night was split by an orange flash that lit the stem of the ship. It was followed by a hammer blow that echoed like thunder through the steel hulk. Dense, acrid smoke swirled unseen in the night wind, a choking mixture of burning chemical and insulation material that forced them to re-don their respirators. They moved back nearer, getting to windward. The domed structure was wrecked, smashed open at one side like an eggshell. Inside, the blaze was already fierce, fanned by the high wind, the heat building up so that they could see the metal beginning to glow. Forster's grotesque rubber mask nodded at the inferno. ‘Aluminium.’ Delaney agreed. ‘Now let's give this a try.’ He pulled off his mask and used his transceiver to call the bridge. Nell answered loud and clear. ‘What the hell is happening back there?’ ‘We're having a firework party,’ Delaney drawled, ‘with a bit of suspicious equipment. No contact — human or otherwise.’ His attempt at a joke misfired. ‘We're going back to the wireless room. See if you can raise Silk on his radio. He may still be alive.’ It seemed foolish, such a suggestion. There had been so much blood, but… Forster pointed at the fire. ‘What about that?’ ‘Nothing we can do but check it now and then,’ Delaney said, shrugging. ‘If the worst happens and it spreads I reckon help should have arrived before it gets serious.’ They turned back into the swirling smoke, and up the ladder to the superstructure, regaining the door to the wireless hut. Delaney went in, and pulled up as if he had been hit with a magnum at close range. Facing him was a man — white, shaking and terrified. Forster crouched in. ‘Jesus!’ The man screamed, leapt back, smashing over a chair. It was then that they saw the grenade in his hand. Gradually, Delaney opened his arms, finally holding his Uzi wide from his body. ‘Easy,’ he said quietly, ‘we're here to help you.’ Forster straightened up slowly, moving gently aside so that they were not a grouped target. Whimpering, the man cringed, hands shaking as he raised the grenade in front of him, one hand on the pin. Delaney's eyes never left those of the man as cautiously he tried again. ‘We're friends. Sent from London. There's nothing to worry about. Whatever happened here is over now. We can take you away.’ Forster, still inching aside, murmured sympathetically. ‘What's been going on? Pretty rough, was it?’ The man was sweating profusely, and suddenly a dark stain spread on the front of his trousers. Delaney and Forster exchanged quick, worried glances, for the man seemed to be on the verge of total derangement. Delaney realised that their respirators were dehumanising and frightening, thus preventing his facial expressions from communicating confidence. He began to move his hand towards his mask. ‘We're men from the Navy. You'll be  all right now. I'm going to take my respirator off. You'll see.’ As his hand closed on the rubber border, the man appeared to steady, staring fixedly as if fascinated by the spectacle. Delaney did nothing suddenly. He pulled the mask forward slowly, relying for his protection on Forster while he was temporarily blinded. Hair ruffled, his face came clear. Delaney smiled encouragingly. ‘There…’ The man screamed, yanked out the pin and threw the grenade. The brown egg struck the wall behind Delaney's head with a clang and whirled back to bounce on the top of the radio bench. As Delaney and Forster hit the deck they caught a fleeting glimpse of the crazed man going for it again. Still rolling, Forster shot from the hip. Instantly, the reaching figure became a puppet, jerking backwards in a pirouette that suddenly collapsed with the abrupt finality of cut strings. The brown egg spun on its own axis, became a bead of intense brilliant yellow that immediately filled the room. The explosion blew out the windows and door, and shattered the banks of units, sucking  up a whirling storm of glass and wires that whiplashed their arm-covered heads. It took seconds for the last bit to drop. The silence was deafening. They got cautiously to their feet, surveying the wreckage and carnage. Delaney looked bitterly at the shambles. ‘It's ripped the guts out of the radio.’ ‘And him,’ Forster nodded, looking down at the shattered, eviscerated remains of the man. Nell Anderson, Grant and Lawton listened while events were recounted. Delaney appealed to her. ‘Honestly, Nell, we did nothing sudden. It was as if he was utterly mad. Frightened beyond any recall.’ Forster nodded. ‘Maybe we should have jumped him, then perhaps you could have injected him with something.’ She shrugged non-commitally. ‘What could do that,’ Delaney wanted to know, ‘to drive a man so insane?’ His voice trailed off helplessly. Nell looked thoughtful. ‘Before we came aboard this ship I was thinking of the possibilities.’ Delaney eyed her speculatively. ‘Ergot poisoning. It would explain why the crew were not present…had possibly jumped overboard as mental disintegration deepened.’ ‘You're saying that this crazed man fitted the picture?’ ‘He would, indeed,’ Nell confirmed. ‘It is one of the reasons advanced for the solution to the Marie Celeste mystery, that the flour might have been contaminated with ergot. It produces weird hallucinations. Several so-called religious visions of the Middle Ages have since been attributed to it.’ Her face became troubled. ‘Only…’ Delaney grimaced. ‘Only what, Nell?’ She shook her head slowly, just the once. ‘It doesn't explain our mysterious man in the hold.’ There was a depressing silence. ‘An hallucination didn't kill Barry Silk, did it? Theo saw an exceptionally tall figure. And we haven't drunk or eaten anything from on board.’ Lawton shuffled uneasily, but didn't try and contradict her or go back on his description. ‘The gas?’ asked Grant. Nell shook her head. ‘Nobody else experience any ill-effects.’ ‘What she didn't say and was too embarrassed to talk about was an uncanny feeling that she had only recently become aware of, but now realised had been growing in her ever since she had set foot on Titron. It was as if a crumbling away of the carefully built-up layers of education, technical training, so-called civilisation, was taking place, leaving her stripped of all her carefully acquired adult assurance. Deep inside her had been awakened a nameless, primitive fear that at first had ached away in the background, but slowly had grown more evident, more pronounced, like a stared-at, half-perceived figure in the shadowy corner of a bedroom. The same feeling when, as a girl, she had woken from a nightmare, and sat in the dark, not sure if she was really awake; really alone. Titron she knew, with female, celtic instinct, was truly evil. And the nightmare was only just beginning."
FIC FIC-BPA-012 1.37 "The uncharacteristic profanity brought him around in the chair. ‘How long have they been gone?’ Nell finished pouring the boiling water into a mug as Grant checked his watch. ‘About half an hour. They went to find the entrance to the complex. Reckoned it was in the superstructure below somewhere.’ Delaney gratefully accepted the mug of  tea from Nell. ‘Why didn't they wait for me?’ Grant glanced at Nell. ‘We had no idea how long you'd be out,’ Nell explained, her face suddenly tensing. ‘Look!’ Down one of the corridors appeared a black-clad figure, face covered by his respirator. But they all knew it was Lawton. Another figure slipped down the other side. Delaney set the mug of tea down. ‘What the hell's got into them? See if you can raise them on the radio.’ Grant spoke swiftly into his transceiver, twice calling for Lawton or Forster to respond. The only reaction was from the latter, his masked face suddenly turning in the direction of one of the cameras. He gave a thumbs up sign. Grant shook his head. ‘Probably can't make us out. Distortion from all this steel.’ Delaney got to his feet and reached for his Uzi. ‘They'll need more back up.’ Limping, Grant made to follow. Nell brushed past him. ‘I'll go.’ For a second Delaney hesitated. Nell's chin came up. ‘You're suspect medically. And Martin's leg is no better. Besides he's better with the electronic wizardry.’ That clinched it. ‘Come on.’ Delaney and Nell ran down the stairs, ignoring precautions. The entrance was on the second deck, a large double door now wide open that Delaney remembered from before, thinking at the time that it led to a storage area. They pulled up, suddenly cautious, and looked in. It was a white, featureless corridor with a blank ‘T’ junction facing them. Nell glanced towards Delaney, feeling the unease rise in her like a fanned fire; the feeling that the white, ordinary-looking corridor with its strip lighting and featureless walls led down to…what? She was fearful. It was a fear that she sensed not with her intellect, more with her body, as though the very cells themselves had a collective memory. She shivered at some ill-defined idea, drifting past out of reach, in the foggy recesses of her mind. But she had no more time for abstract thoughts. Delaney snapped on his gas mask. Nell reached for her own, and began to pull  it over her head. The claustrophobia took her unawares. Not since the first time in the gloomy training tunnel deep underground had the panic risen in her as the rubber closed around her nose and mouth, momentarily sealing off her breathing, like a parasitic thing covering her face. She got control of herself, found Delaney pausing, and looking around for her. The brighter light reflected on his glass eyepieces, gleamed on the moulded side muzzle of the respirator. She shuddered. The freakishness of their own appearance seemed entirely appropriate. And ominous. Grant saw them immediately, traversing the same passage they'd seen Forster and Lawton follow. He snatched his gaze back to the latter. Lawton had just appeared in what looked like an operating theatre, standing motionless in the corner as though an actual operation was in progress and he was an unwelcome intruder. Forster slipped in beside him, looking around, and moving to an anaesthetic machine. Grant could make out some pretty sophisticated-looking electronic hardware massed down one wall in addition to a cardiac visual display monitor and the usual paraphernalia of an intensive care unit. Lawton finally moved, crossing to double doors on the opposite side of the room. He looked through the small windows, then motioned for Forster to join him. Grant instinctively moved closer to the screen, sensing the excitement in Lawton. He glanced quickly across to check on Delaney and Nell, and was turning his attention back to the others, when he frowned. On the flickering screen, one of the cell-like doors was ajar, yet he was sure they had all been shut. He watched the screen, struggled to get the frame-hold to work, all the while keeping an eye on the scene in the operating theatre. Lawton and Forster finally passed from view through the doors. Grant glanced across, and saw that Delaney had reached another ‘T’ junction. The black-clad figure hesitated then turned the corner. But whereas the others had gone to the left, Delaney went to the right. Half-heartedly, Grant used his transceiver, and called them. It was no use. As Nell followed, the rows of screens for the first time were blank, showing no signs of life. Grant turned his attention to the flickering one — and gaped. The cell-like door was now open. Wide open. Delaney realised they were lost when finally, after innumerable turnings in the maze of corridors, they came to a dead end. Nell nudged him, and pointed to the door behind her. It was a lift. Delaney nodded, and thumbed the button. Immediately the doors drew open. Inside Nell took a position by the panel as Delaney shot a last glance around the corridor; then followed her in. Forster stood before the row of suits, hanging like a lie of petrified robots, and immediately recognised them for what they were; instantly realised the enormous risk they might all be running, at least below decks. Grant saw the lift door open and Delaney and Nell step cautiously out, directly under the camera. He could see the surprise, the awe, as they stopped, looking at something he could not see. But the camera was designed to guard the lift entrance, and not show what lay beyond. On the flickering screen just to the right, light suddenly reflected from something in the black hole of the cell-like room. Even though it caught his eyes, so that he was actually  watching when it happened, the figure that leapt from the blackness was only a silvery blur, moving with breathtaking and unreal speed. Grant, stunned, sat staring at the cell entrance, not sure if he had imagined what he'd seen, or not. ‘It's a submersible. For really deep work.’ Delaney stood with one foot on the hull of the craft that looked as if it owed more to space technology than to marine engineering. Silently, Nell regarded the white, steel tube with a sphere at one end and set with two ‘V’ observation ports surrounded by remote control grab arms, and saw only an insect-like thing, a huge preying mantis. Delaney heaved himself aboard, the vessel moving gently on the only-black water of the dock. ‘I wondered why my ears popped in the lift.’ He surveyed the section of Titron's hull that housed the submersible. The roof above was the false bottom of the hold. ‘This part's pressurised. Keep the water out.’ He pulled off his mask and looked down into the open conning tower. The mass of instruments was like the cockpit of a seven-four-seven, even down to a control column. He stepped back on to the deck. From the water lying everywhere the storm had obviously battered the unattended diving area. ‘So that's what all the research is about. Some sort of hush-hush oceanography, probably for oil. Something like that.’ Nell, relieved to be rid of it, followed his lead and pulled off her own mask. For the first time she could smell the dankness and the odour of rotting seaweed. The place was like a cave. Her brooding sense of unease wouldn't be placated by his explanation. Living things inhabited caves, didn't they? A large wave passed. As Titron lifted, the black water in the dock sucked away, opening up a drop of several feet, only to be followed by a surge upwards. The submersible rose higher in the dock, the overflowing sea rushing like a tide over their boots. Pumps cut in, clearing the water through drains. Delaney splashed across to one wall where a mass of underwater tackle was stored. There were racks of wet suits, dry suits, helmets, air tanks, helium, oxygen and others he did not recognise. Pinned to the wall was a huge contoured map, with alongside it, in graph layout, a profile of the depth of the ocean floor. His finger found a precisely outlined section delineated in red marker. He whistled. ‘That's some depth they've been working at,’ he said. ‘Wonder how the hell they got anything up from there.’ Nell stood beside him. ‘Perhaps they’ re not bringing it up. But putting it down.’ Delaney turned to look directly at her. ‘Why would they need to dump out in this God-forsaken place? Nuclear waste is disposed of at much shallower depths. And it's no secret.’ Nell shrugged. ‘Just a suggestion, that's all.’ She moved on, leaving him looking thoughtful, to stand in front of a hugely monstrous brilliant orange diving suit, the helmet a streamlined dome with built-in lamp, camera, and gas pressure and communication lines. He came and stood at her side, pointing at two circular hatches in the floor flanked by handrails, with massive spheres secured nearby. ‘They have everything. These deep suits are probably used in conjunction with those diving bells.’ But Nell, transfixed by the giant suits before her, was hardly listening. ‘John,’ she said, ‘could that figure they saw have been somebody in one of these?’ ‘No way,’ he grunted. ‘If it was, the man could hardly have moved, and would have been almost totally at the mercy of Silk.’ Nell nodded. But the thought persisted, and wouldn't go away. And after all, what other explanation could there be? Grant saw Forster and Lawton reappear, moving back the way they had come. For a shocked moment he thought Forster was carrying a man over his shoulder, then he saw what it was, and understood why Lawton was weighed down with cylinders. Nervously his eyes flicked over the screen. There was no sign of the silvery man-like thing. Forster and Lawton passed from view, soon to reappear in another corridor. Grant scanned the still empty passages behind them. They were getting well clear now, even allowing for its unnatural speed. His concentration was broken by a sound. A light, tinkling sound. Grant glanced round to see the clipboards on the wall jingling as if in a breeze. He checked the two sliding doors into the wheelhouse. They were still tightly closed. He turned back in time to see Nell and  Delaney step out of the lift. Anxiously he watched them, acutely aware that they were no longer alone in the maze of corridors of the system. At least there was no sign of the creature. Grant pushed out his lower lip. Creature ? What did he expect? Something out of the comic books? The clipboards tinkled again, but he didn't bother to turn round this time."
FIC FIC-CDB-002 1.24 "The picture, very like the one Rufus Fletcher had taken in the summer of 1976, occupied the screen for about fifteen seconds. The whole item was allowed no more than four times that in the BBC's Sunday evening news broadcast at 6.30. The other forty-five seconds were taken up by a policeman talking to a reporter about having nothing to say except that there would be an inquest. But Shiva and Lili Manjusri saw the picture and so did Rufus Fletcher. Adam Verne-Smith, unwinding in Puerto de la Cruz, did not of course see it. He did not even see an English newspaper. They were expensive to buy and came a day late. He did not want to be reminded of home and the only paper he even glanced at was the International Herald Tribune , a copy of which Anne found on the beach. His father, at home in Edgware, said to his wife: ‘Good God, Wyvis Hall, as I live and breathe.’ Beryl Verne-Smith peered, but the picture immediately vanished. ‘Yes, I suppose it was.’ The policeman talked, the reporter trying to jog him into revelations and failing. In the background, autumnal trees could be seen and a church on the summit of a low hill. Lewis Verne-Smith sat shaking his head, less as a gesture of denial than of a generalized despair at the state of the world. It was not that unpleasant memories were evoked, for these were always with  him, his existence was inseparable from that old bitterness, but that a sight of the house, even the glimpse of a photograph, revived the precise feelings he had had — why, it must be getting on for eleven years ago. ‘Ten and a half,’ said his wife. ‘I shall have to get in touch with the police. No two ways about it, I shall have to get in touch with them.’ ‘Not this evening, surely?’ said Beryl, who wanted to watch Mastermind. Lewis said nothing. The room in which they were sitting underwent the curious shrinking process to which it was subject whenever he was reminded of Wyvis Hall or his Uncle Hilbert or even if the county of Suffolk were mentioned. Suddenly it grew small and poky. The brick side-wall of his neighbour's house seemed to have moved itself four or five feet further towards the dividing fence, so that it loomed offensively. Lewis got up and pulled the curtains across with a pettish jerk of his hands. ‘Shouldn't you wait until Adam gets back?’ Beryl said. ‘Why? What would that be in aid of?’ Beryl meant that Adam had been among the previous owners of Wyvis Hall while her husband had not, but she knew better than to point this out. ‘There is no one living knows that lovely place better than 1.’ ‘That's true.’ ‘I shan't wait till Adam returns,’ Lewis said in that manner that had once led his daughter to call him the Frog Footman, ‘but I shall wait until tomorrow.’ Men and women do not usually put their baser feelings and intentions into words, not even in the deep recesses of their own minds. So Lewis did not say, even to himself, when he was privately considering trying to get hold of his son in Tenerife, that he disliked Adam and would have been pleased to spoil his holiday. Instead, he rationalized his thoughts and justified himself Adam probably — indeed, almost certainly — knew  nothing about the find in the pine wood, but Adam had once owned the house and had thus taken on a responsibility. He could not shed that responsibility just because he had sold the place. Lewis would have agreed with Oscar Wilde that our past is what we are. We cannot rid ourselves of it. Therefore it was Adam's duty to come home and face the music, even though this might be no more than a short blast on a tin whistle. But he had no precise idea where Adam was and he did not think Adam's travel agent (a personal friend of the young Verne-Smiths) would tell him. Some excuse would be made for not telling him. Lewis's bark, anyway, was always worse than his bite. He had virtually no bite, as he had once overheard Adam say to Bridget, and heard it with helpless chagrin. ‘A bloody good thing or our childhood would have been a misery instead of just a bore.’ Lewis walked into his local police station in Edgware on Monday morning. They seemed surprised to see him but not astonished. The Suffolk police had begun hunting up previous owners of Wyvis Hall and they had been alerted that a Verne-Smith lived in their area. There were, after all, only two in the London phone directory. This might be a bonus. He was asked to wait and then shown into a room where a detective sergeant prepared to take a statement from him. With busy pomposity Lewis dictated it to a typist and would have gone on and on had he not been diplomatically restrained. ‘Wyvis Hall, Nunes, Suffolk, and the twenty acres of land surrounding it were the property, through his marriage, of my uncle, Hilbert Verne-Smith. They came into the possession of my son Hilbert John Adam Verne-Smith under my uncle's will, bypassing myself, though my son was no more than nineteen at the time of my uncle's death. Being an undergraduate at the time, my son naturally never considered actually residing in the house. He was in agreement with my suggestion that the property be sold and before he returned to college in the autumn of 1976, he took my advice and placed house and lands in the hands of an estate agent. ‘Country properties were not selling well at the time. £45,000 was the asking price and I was not surprised that the sale, so to speak, hung fire. However, in the spring of 1977 an offer was made, which my son accepted. This sale later fell through and it was not until the following August that Wyvis Hall was finally sold to a Mr and Mrs Langan for the much improved figure of £51,995. ‘As far as I know, my son's personal acquaintance with Wyvis Hall was confined to my uncle's lifetime when 1, my wife and son and daughter frequently stayed with him. After my uncle's death in April 1976 he visited Wyvis Hall on perhaps two, or at the most three, separate occasions simply for the purpose of looking it over and reaching a decision about the disposal of furniture and effects. ‘I suppose it is possible that squatters or other vagrants took possession of the house between the time of my uncle's death and the sale of the property. Certainly my son never let it or allowed anyone to occupy it on either a temporary or permanent basis. ‘My son is at present on holiday in Tenerife with his wife and daughter. I cannot say precisely when I expect him to return, though I should suppose in about a week from now.’ It was all very small and quiet and low-key. The snippet in Rufus's Monday morning newspaper measured just an inch in depth. It answered the question he had asked himself and told him that the bones of a very young child had been found as well as those of a young woman. This was not a shock. How could it be otherwise, since this was Wyvis Hall and the pine wood and the animal cemetery? To photograph the house for the news last night the cameraman must have stood just where he had stood himself, on the edge of the lawn with his back to the cedar tree. A popular. mass-produced camera he had used, but quite a good one. One thing about Zosie's pilfering, she never stole rubbish. He had taken a picture of her after that and one of the animal cemetery. ‘Why is the grass always so short up here?’ Adam had asked. ‘Rabbits, I expect.’ ‘Why can't bloody rabbits come and eat my lawns?’ Adam always referred to ‘my lawns’, ‘my house’, ‘my furniture’. It had got up Rufus's nose a bit, though Adam had a perfect right to do this. It was his, all of it, and it went to his head rather. Nineteen-year-olds seldom inherit country mansions, after all. It must have been some time in August when I took those pictures, Rufus thought, and a couple of weeks later it was all over. Coincidentally, as the community and their lives together broke up, so did the weather. It was raining intermittently all the time they were in the cemetery, the pines bowing and shivering in the wind. Sometimes they had had to stop and take shelter under the closely planted-trees. If the weather had held and still been hot and dry would they have dug deeper? Probably not. In spite of the rain, the earth was still as hard as iron. A sheet of rain had come down then, a hard, gusty shower, while they were laying the squares of turf back in place, and Adam had said something about the rain making the grass grow quickly, the rain being on their side. ‘We should all go our separate ways as soon as we can,’ Rufus had said. ‘We should pack up now and go.’ The spade and the fork they had hung up among the other tools in the stables. They had packed and Adam had locked up the house. At some point Rufus himself had taken the things out of the fridge and left the door open to defrost it. Adam closed the front door and stood there for a moment as if he could not wrench himself away. So much of its beauty had been stripped from it by the whipping winds. And by the neglect of the long hot summer. A sudden gust of rain dashed against the red bricks that were already stained in patches by water. The house that when he first saw it had seemed to float on a raft of golden mist, now lay in a wilderness, amidst ragged grass and straggling bushes and trees dead from the heat. Dirty grey clouds tumbled across the  sky above the slate roof, now the only thing that shone, glazed with rain. But Rufus admitted to himself that the beauties of nature and architecture had never meant much to him. It was the heat and sunshine and privacy he liked. And now he longed only to get away. They all got into Goblander and he drove away up the drift, Adam next to him, the others in the back. The drift had become a tunnel of overgrowth that dripped water on to the roof of the van. None of them allowed their eyes to turn towards the pine wood. At the top they came out into uncompromising, bright grey light, the bleak, hedgeless lane, the flat meadows where here and there stunted trees squatted like old men in cloaks. Adam's simile, not his, thought Rufus with a grimace. No one asked where he was taking them. No one spoke. Adam had Hilbert's old golf-bag stuck between his legs and Rufus guessed the gun was inside it. They must have gone a good two miles before they met another car. Rufus overtook a bus going to Colchester and dropped the two in the back so that they could catch it. He took Adam on to Sudbury for him to catch a train there and at that point they parted. Adam got down from Goblander and said, ‘For ever and for ever, farewell, Rufus.’ Which was probably a quotation from something, though Rufus did not know what and thought fastidiously that it was in bad taste, histrionic, though just like Adam. ‘Take care,’ said Rufus, and not looking back any more than he had done when they returned from the cemetery, drove off round the town he had got to know so well, over the Stour bridge, into Essex, heading for Halstead and Dunmow and Ongar and London. He never had seen any of them again. There had been no need to pretend, to turn aside. Briefly, starting his fifth year in medical school something over thirteen months later, he had wondered if Shiva Manjusri would be one of the incoming freshmen. But no, his intuition had been accurate. At any rate Shiva's face was not among the several brown faces. As for the others, avoiding them had presented no problems. Would they get in touch with him now? No contingency plans had been made for this eventuality. So long as there was no hunt for a missing girl they had felt themselves reasonably safe. Their minds had not reached out to the terror of what had in fact happened. None of them had been the kind of people who could have imagined devotion to a pet animal or according to it funerary rites. It was Shiva who had proposed the site. They had congratulated him on his ingenuity. Ten years… An ovarian cyst, nothing to get upset about, Rufus told Ms Beauchamp. She was thirty-two, an editor with a distinguished publishing house, married to an investigative journalist. As yet they had no children, but she wanted four, she told Rufus. ‘No reason why you shouldn't.’ He had another glance at her notes. ‘In fact, a peculiarity about this condition is that it seldom if ever occurs in a woman who's had a baby.’ ‘My God,’ she said, putting her coat on,. 'and there was 1, making my husband's life a misery, sure I'd got the dreaded C.’ They all thought they'd got the dreaded C, poor things. You couldn't blame them. Rufus took her £40 off her by the reception desk, having set in train the arrangements by which she would be admitted to a fashionable West End clinic, with Rufus, her surgery and her hospitalization ultimately paid for by some provident association to which she and her husband subscribed. Rufus shook hands. He walked back to his consulting room, dying for a cigarette. This was unlike him. He could usually get through quite easily until after lunch. He thought, I know what my idea of heaven would be, if by heaven we mean a place of bliss in which to pass eternity: a sanctuary where one might chain-smoke without impairment of breathing, destruction of the lungs or damage to the heart, light each fresh cigarette from the glowing butt of its predecessor, and drink ice-free but hundred-proof chilled vodka laced with two drops of angostura and a gill of newly opened Perrier endlessly, with increasing euphoria  until a peak of joy and ease was reached but without any sub-sequent nausea or pain or dehydration or oblivion… Sitting alone, he lit his cigarette, the first of the day, and there came that faint swimming in the head, a tautening of the gut. He closed his eyes. If it comes to light that I was in that house with Adam and the others, he thought with cold clarity, if someone tells the papers, or the police and thence the papers, that I was there during the summer of 1976, living there, it will be all up with me. I will lose my practice and my reputation and everything that I have and can look forward to, if not my liberty. And without the rest I shan't care about my liberty. It would be bad enough if I were a G P or an expert in some other branch of medicine, an orthopaedic surgeon, for instance, or an ear, nose and throat man, but I am a gynaecologist , and it is the bones of a young woman and a baby that have been found there… What worried woman would come to me? What Mrs Strawson or Ms Beauchamp? What GP would send her to me? If I were innocent, thought Rufus, I know very well what I would do. I would pick up the phone and phone my solicitor and ask to come and see him and get his advice. He might advise me to make a statement to the police which I should of course do under his guidance. But I shall not do this because I am not innocent. I shall sit here and wait and sweat it out and look the facts in the face, trying to anticipate the worst that can happen."
FIC FIC-CDB-005 0.9 "With the specialist's contempt for the layman's ignorance, Rufus read accounts of the inquest in two newspapers. More prominence was given to the evidence of Alec Chipstead than to that of the Home Office Pathologist, Dr Aubrey Helier. The stuff Rufus wanted to know would be beyond the average reader's comprehension. He should really have gone to that inquest. That could be remedied, he could acquire a transcript of the proceedings or simply a copy of the pathologist's findings, but he did not dare, he was not prepared to show his hand to that extent. Instead he tried to guess what might have been said. He put himself into the pathologist's shoes and stood in the witness box. He spoke of how he had established the sex of the larger skeleton. A fragment of the uterus remaining perhaps? It was this soft part that often persisted longest. ‘Having established that the larger skeleton was that of a female, I set about making an estimate of the subject's age at the time of her death. It should be explained that between the ages of twelve and thirty the union of the epiphyses of most of the long bones with the shafts takes place, and by the age of twenty-four most of the epiphyses have united. In the case of the subject I shall henceforward designate as Subject A I found that the medial end of the clavicle had not yet fused, though fusion had taken place at the acromion and verical border scapula. The bones of the arm had for the most part fused but fusion had not yet taken place between the radius and ulna, which would be expected to have occurred by the age of twenty-one. The heads of the metatarsals were fused, which one would expect to be accomplished by nineteen years, but fusion had not taken place in the secondary pelvic centres. The sutures of the skull remained open on their inner aspects…‘ Something like that it must have been. He would not have been able to put a precise age on the skeleton. Between seventeen and twenty-one, say. And the cause of death? Rufus had another look at the paper. The pathologist had said it was at this stage impossible to give an opinion but the report also said the police were treating the case as murder. There was nothing about how the pathologist had reached the conclusion that death had taken place some time between 1974 and 1977. Rufus guessed again. ‘Certain highly technical factors, intelligible only to the expert and with which I will not take up the time of this inquest, have led me to conclude that Subject A had been dead for more than nine years and less than twelve. Suffice it to say that I reached this estimate on the basis of the preservation of a vestige of the uterus and as a result of obtaining a chemical  reaction for blood from periosteum. I should not have expected to obtain such a reaction if more than twelve years had elapsed since death.’ It was only conjecture about that bit of uterus. Rufus wondered if he might have invented that part because he had so much to do with wombs in the course of his own daily life. He knew very little about tests done on blood from bones, only that they could be carried out. Identification of ‘Subject A’ would be a more difficult matter altogether. There was no mention of hair, though Rufus knew hair could persist intact for far more years than those bones had been in the grave, and there was nothing about clothing. Would ten years in the earth have destroyed that cotton shroud? He imagined a policeman with nothing more to go on than a tiny, once brightly embroidered, label, a square inch of bloodstained, earth-stained, half-rotted cloth, hawking it round boutiques in Kilburn and West Hendon, narrowing the field, finally coming to an importers' warehouse… But no, she hadn't been wearing that dress, of course she hadn't. He asked himself how accurate his memory in fact was, how much time and a desire to repudiate the past had blocked off. He ought to try to remember, he must. There were ways of bringing memories to the surface and he must use them to protect himself. It was imperative too to keep cool and not allow things to get out of proportion. Most likely they would proceed no further than they had with the identification of ‘Subject A’, especially since there was no one(apart from themselves) to miss her and she had never been missed. In the case of a person missing ten years before who had never been reported missing, what hope was there now of establishing identity? It might be somewhat different with regard to the other occupant of the grave. Rufus became the pathologist again. ‘Now to the remains of the infant I shall call Subject B. Examination of the pelvis usually allows sex to be determined with great confidence in very young children and even in the foetus. I found in Subject B the greater sciatic notch to be wide and shallow and the ischial tuberosities to be everted, the ilia  inclined to the vertical and the brim of the pelvis almost circular in outline. The sub-pubic angle was rounded and somewhat of the order of 90 degrees. I can therefore state with total confidence that Subject B was of the female sex. ‘The age of Subject B I estimate to have been more than four weeks and less than twelve. The skeleton in toto measured 22.5 inches. The anterior fontanelle was open. There was no appearance of ossification in the humeral head, though the cuboid was ossified…‘ Rufus was getting into unknown terrain here. He had very little idea of how the baby's age could have been estimated. By the fusion of joints, certainly, it need hardly matter to him which ones. How old had the baby been anyway? Very young, without teeth. ‘A primary deciduous dentition had not yet commenced’, was no doubt how the pathologist would have put it. But what of Subject A's teeth? That was primarily how dead bodies were identified, by their teeth. On the other hand, if the particular person had never been missed or reported missing, their existence scarcely recorded in the great reference log of National Insurance and medical cards, passports and driving licences, if the chance of their even being named seemed thin, what obscure dentist was going to rise up suddenly producing the relevant chart? A certain assumption might of course be made. ‘There is considerable danger here of drawing the conclusion that because the two sets of bones were found in conjunction and on the same date, they must have met their deaths at the same time. Although this is probably so, I am able to offer no evidence in proof of it. Nor have I come upon any factor to prove the truth of another assumption which may be made: to wit, that Subject A was the mother of Subject B. Experience and probability point to this being so but that is all. ‘I am unable to state with any certainty the length of time which has elapsed since the death of Subject B or offer any suggestion as to the cause of death.’ That was something which could never be established after this lapse of time. Unfortunate in a way, Rufus thought. It  would be an ironical stroke if investigations into the affair resulted not in the discovery of those happenings in which they had been guilty but only in those where they had been blameless. The inquest had been adjourned. No doubt they were still digging up the little graveyard. Rufus was not squeamish, he had not been one of those medical students who become nauseous at their first sight of surgery, but, curiously enough he did not much like to think of all those odd little bones, so alien to him, so unidentifiable, being dug up and sorted out and sifted through in case there should be a human fibula among them or a vertebra. Rufus did not even know if animal bones shared the same names as those of humans. Did dogs have fibulas? He was surprised to find himself shuddering. If there was no shot in or among the human remains, in the cavities of the skull for instance, would it be possible to find it in the soil, among the sand and gravel and pine needles? Bird shot it would have been or somewhat larger. Rufus had only seen it while eating partridge which had been winged instead of shot in the head and had nearly broken one of his teeth on the tiny ball of lead. He imagined gravel being sifted, all the particles, the minute stones, being picked over by some policeman whose job it was to do that, the tiny flints laid in one tray, the wood fragments in another, and then, in a third, the shot. He could remember so much, he had clear pictures of whole days spent at Ecalpemos, whole conversations recorded that could be rerun in his head. Why was it then that he couldn't remember where she had been shot? In the heart or the head or the spine? His mind blanked over that and there was a complete loss of recall. When he tried and saw the sky covered with rushing clouds, the lawn that had become a hay-field, the cedar's wheeling branches, the gun levelled, there would come an explosion in his memory like the firing of that shot-gun, a redness in front of his eyes with splintered edges, then black-out. The gun he could remember, both guns. And the gun-room and the first time he went in there with Adam. They had eaten their lunch down by the lake. Two pork pies and a can of Coke each but not the apples which were imported Granny  Smiths and bruised, and anyway they had strawberries. They must have each eaten about a pound of strawberries, for they kept going back to the fruit cage for more. Some time during the afternoon they decided not to go back but to stay overnight. That meant there was no hurry, they could have lain out there in the sun till the pubs opened. But Adam had this idea of phoning his mother to tell her he wouldn't be back that night. Rufus wouldn't have bothered, he came and went as he pleased, and anyway didn't believe parents should be pandered to in this way. Of course it wasn't quite pandering with Adam. He didn't want to get on worse terms with his mother, from whom he hoped to get a loan for his holiday in Greece, nor did he want the kind of thing that might have happened, his mother phoning hospitals or getting the police because they could have had an accident in Goblander. As it turned out he didn't make that phone call until the evening and they found a call-box outside a pub in one of the villages, for Great-Uncle Hilbert's phone had been disconnected. But once they were indoors again they resumed exploring, found a genuine butler's pantry with a lot of silver in it packed away in canteens and boxes and green baize, and opening the next door, came into the gun-room. Adam, as a child, had been strictly forbidden ever to go in there. Anyway, the door was usually kept locked. Presumably, in pre-Hilbert days, during Bereland squirearchy, it had contained an armoury of weapons, for all four walls were hung with gun racks. However, only two types of firearms remained, both shot-guns. There was a row of hooks for hanging up jackets and waterproofs and one of these hung there still, Hilbert's old shooting-jacket, tweed, with leather pads on the elbows. A glass case on the windowsill contained a fat stuffed trout, another, on the circular table, a turtle — this certainly not of English provenance. The front half of a fox, paws and all, its rear end replaced by a shield-shaped slab of polished wood, appeared to be leaping out of the wall just below the picture rail, in the manner of a circus dog emerging from a paper hoop. ‘Those aren't the sort of things you shoot, though, are they?’ Rufus had asked. ‘You most definitely don't shoot foxes.’ Adam said this in such a snooty, lord-of-the-manor way that Rufus yelled with laughter. He took one of the guns, the twelve bore, from the wall and Adam had another go at him, this time for pointing it in his direction. ‘It's not loaded, for God's sake.’ ‘Never mind. You don't point guns at people.’ It appeared then that Adam had actually been out shooting the last time he was here. He had only been fifteen and had been given the four-ten, the so-called lady's gun, which Rufus gathered had rather gone against the grain. Since then he had often recalled what Adam said next, had taken the gun from him and remarked that it was a pump-action shot-gun. ‘What does that mean?’ ‘You don't have to keep reloading. It's got a repeating action. You don't have to put a cartridge in each time before you fire.’ And Rufus, who didn't mind appearing ingenuous in this area, said, ‘I thought all firearms worked like that.’ One of the drawers in the pine cabinet was stocked with cartridges, red ones and blue ones which Adam said indicated the size of the shot they contained. ‘That's amazing, me inheriting a couple of guns as well. We might even get some shooting.’ ‘Not in June, squire. Even I know that.’ Was that the first hint, no more than a joke really, that they might stay at Wyvis Hall, that they might live there? And Adam had said: ‘I didn't mean now.’ ‘I thought –you were going to sell the place.’ Adam didn't say any more. They went back down the garden and after that out to a couple of pubs where they drank a lot and Rufus had to drive back to Wyvis Hall with one eye closed on account of getting double vision. They slept it off, not  getting up till around eleven next morning, Rufus in the principal guest room, Adam at the other end of the house in what he christened the Pincushion Room because it had a picture on the wall of St Sebastian stuck full of arrows. Rufus looked out of the window and saw a man trimming the grass round one of the rose beds with a pair of long-handled shears. He was elderly, bald, very thin, wearing a striped shirt of the kind that have detachable collars. It was the sound of his clipping which had woken Rufus up. The sun was blazing down and there wasn't a spot of shade anywhere till you came to the wood below the lake. Rufus, who hadn't much appreciation of nature usually, nevertheless found himself gazing in something like wonderment at all the roses, yellow and pink and apricot and dark red, a hedge of white ones, a cascade of peach-red that covered a pergola. The man with the shears laid them down on the grass, took a handkerchief from his pocket, made a knot in each of its four corners and placed this improvised sun-hat on his head. Rufus had never seen anyone do that before, though he had seen it in pictures on seaside postcards. He.was entranced. He put on his shorts and his sandals and went down. By the time he got outside Adam was already there, telling the man in the handkerchief hat that he didn't want him to come any more, he was going to sell the house. ‘This old garden'll go to rack and ruin then. I been coming down here watering most nights.’ ‘That's not my problem,’ said Adam. ‘The people who buy it will have to handle that.’ ‘It do seem a wicked shame.’ The gardener opened his shears and wiped the grass clippings off the blades with his forefinger. ‘But it's not my place to argue. Mr Verne-Smith paid me up till the end of April, so that's seven weeks you owe me — let's say six and a half to be fair.’ Adam looked rather shattered. ‘I didn't actually ask you to come.’ ‘True, but I come, didn't I? I done the work and I'll want paying. Fair's fair. Look at the place. You can't deny I done the work.’ Adam couldn't. He didn't try. In the cagey, suspicious way he sometimes spoke he said: ‘How much in fact would it be?’ ‘I come twice a week at a pound a time, so that's thirteen, say, and then there's all the times I've come with me cans. Fifteen I reckon would cover it.’ It was ludicrously less than Rufus had expected. For all that labour it was ridiculous. But this was the country, this was horticulture, and they ordered things differently there. He and Adam went into the house where they managed to scrounge up fifteen quid between the two of them, leaving them with just enough to cover the petrol for Goblander to get home on. Adam paid the man and he went off on a bicycle, still wearing the knotted handkerchief on his head. It was only after he had gone that they realized they had never asked his name or where he lived. ‘You could have kept him on for two quid a week. It's nothing.’ ‘I haven't got two quid a week. I'm skint.’ And it was lack of money that stopped them going away. He, Rufus, could have got just about enough together for the petrol en route and maybe his own food. If Adam had had an equal amount they would have managed. In another year, at almost any other time, Adam would have touched his father or more probably his mother for a loan, but in June 1976 his father was barely speaking to him, and his mother would have been scared to go against her husband. Of course if Adam had invited his parents to make themselves at home at Wyvis Hall, use it as a hotel, while he was away, they would have lent him any amount, but that was the last thing Adam would have done. He did ask his sister for money. Bridget had been one of those teenagers who work all through their school holidays in restaurants or in shops or cleaning houses and she always had cash. But she would not lend him any. She was saving up to go skiing the next January and she knew there wasn't much chance of Adam repaying a loan by then. It was ironical that Adam, who was the owner of that big  house and all that land and the contents of the house, nevertheless went down to Nunes the second time with less than a fiver in his pocket. And that was everything he had. Instead of Greece they went to Wyvis Hall because Adam was broke and Mary was close to broke because that first time it had been so beautiful and peaceful and private there that you could hardly see what advantages Greece would have had over it. They had intended to stay a week. Rufus had suggested to Adam that he sell something out of the house, a piece of china or some silver. There were almost more antique and second-hand shops in some of those villages than there were houses. He had counted six in the place where they had gone to the pub. They talked about it on the way down in Goblander. It was funny how good Adam had been at naming things, the rooms in the house, the house itself even, or at naming the idea of it, the concept, Ecalpemos. Goblander was not just an anagram on old banger, it really expressed the way that decrepit old van had of gobbling up petrol as it chugged through the countryside making awful noises because it needed a new silencer. ‘You'll never even get near Greece in this,’ said Mary. ‘It'll just collapse and give up the ghost somewhere in France. I'm warning you.’ Her father was a life peer who had held some sort of office under a Labour government. It must have been the boarding-school she had been to which determined her voice, affected, sharp, shrill. She found fault a lot. The car was wrong, Rufus's clothes were wrong or funny or somehow unsuitable, he smoked too much, he was too fond of wine and his whole lifestyle left much to be desired. She started on Adam for taking up that shameful suggestion about selling what she called the family silver. How dreadful! What a desecration! He ought to have a feeling of reverence for the beautiful things his great-uncle had entrusted to him. ‘He's not coming back,’ said Adam, ‘to see how I've discharged my duties.’ ‘He'll turn in his grave.’ ‘No, there'll just be a small upheaval in his ashes.’ He told her Great-Uncle Hilbert's ashes were the contents of an urn-shaped Crown Derby sweets-jar that stood on the drawing-room mantelpiece. Maybe she believed him, for Rufus had once caught her lifting the lid and looking into the jar at the wood ash Adam had scraped up from the site of the handkerchief man's last bonfire. Mary was rather difficult but she was also just about the most beautiful girl Rufus had ever come across. It gratified him to be seen in her company. He had always been a bit that way had Rufus, manifestly to be seen to be doing all right for himself, successful, forging ahead, accompanied by the best-looking girl possible. Mary was spectacular to look at and her own knowledge that she was made her capricious and difficult, expecting the best of everything. All that was her due because she looked like the young Elizabeth Taylor, had dark brown curly hair nearly to her waist, large, dark blue eyes, creamy velvet skin and a wonderful figure. It was 20 June when they went back, all Goblander's windows open, the weather being perfect the way you expected it to be that summer, as if it were southern Europe where you woke up each morning to sunshine and unclouded skies. By that time, as Adam said, you would actually have been shocked if the temperature had dropped or a shower of rain fallen. ‘It makes you think there mightn't be an awful lot of point in going to Greece,’ he said. ‘I mean, this could be the best summer ever and we'd miss it. It's always like this in Greece.’ They'd brought food with them, quite a lot of food. Adam said the first thing would be to get old Hilbert's fridge going. Of course it was his own fridge but he was still in the habit of speaking as if , as Mary had inferred, his great-uncle might return. It must have been a strange experience for him, Rufus had thought, knowing he owned all sorts of things but not knowing quite what or where they were. They were the sort of things too which the parent generation owned, those old people that Adam, until Rufus laughed at him, had inadvertently called the grown-ups: sheets and blankets and knives and forks and pots  and pans and more complicated appurtenances of living that if one ever thought about at all one supposed one would have to get together for oneself eventually. Someone else had got it together for Adam and there it all was. They found some sheets in a walk-in cupboard, linen ones with LVS embroidered on them. The sheets felt a bit damp so Mary spread them out on the terrace in the sun to dry. They ate out there too and drank one of the bottles of wine they had brought. It was an amazing amount of wine they got through down at Wyvis Hall, and not only wine. But that first day they had only been able to afford two bottles of Anjou rosè. Later on they went all over the house, assessing what they might be able to sell, finding out just what Adam's inheritance amounted to. Rufus had been astonished by the quantities of junk in that house, the ornaments and knick-knacks and stuff like vases and candlesticks and ashtrays and glass and brass that Hilbert Verne-Smith and his wife had accumulated over the years. Mary got stroppy about it and said it was wrong what they were doing, it was a desecration. But Adam had retorted quite.reasonably that it was his now, didn't she understand that? It was as much his to do as he liked with as the sandals on his feet and the change from that fiver he had in his pocket after buying the rose. And then Mary said she felt as if Hilbert were there with them as they rifled through chests and drawers and cupboards, she could feel his presence standing behind them, looking over her shoulder. By then it was dark, it was night time. And at Wyvis Hall, below the woods and above the river, with the nearest road half a mile away and the nearest house twice as far as that, total silence prevailed. The sky was clear, the colour of a very dark blue jewel, and on the surface of the lake the stars were mirrored. The house was full of moths because they had left the doors and windows open after they put the lights on. Mary screamed when a bat flew close to her, she said bats got in your hair, a bat had got into the hair of some relative of hers and bitten her scalp. Mary's scream sounded particularly loud in that dark silence. There was a loud echo in the grounds of Wyvis Hall, Mary's scream ringing back from off the wood and walls and  starry waters, and Rufus, a town dweller who had never spent much time in the countryside, expected alarmed or annoyed people to arrive or the disconnected phone to start shrilling with complaints. Of course nothing happened. They could all have screamed the place down, Mary could have been bitten to death by bats, and no one would have come. That was part of the trouble, that was how it was that events were set in motion. If Wyvis Hall had been less isolated, less silent… Rufus had come a long way since the Goblander days and the car he got into to drive himself to the hospital he attended two mornings a week was a Mercedes, not yet a year old. At the garage where he bought petrol they offered him a complimentary sherry glass because he had bought more than thirty litres. Rufus refused. He already had two of the things clinking about on the back seat. But the sight of the glass took him back into the past again, the past which he believed he had exorcised but was now fetched back in fragments and longer scenarios by every possible association. He had sat in that locked room talking, therapist and patient both, had talked it over and over. To the site of his trauma he had returned and re-lived it. He might just as well not have bothered, for it was there still, it would be there for ever, unless one day they found how to cut memory out of the brain with a scalpel. On the back seat the two sherry glasses clinked as Rufus took a left turn rather too sharply. What they had eventually decided to sell before they went to bed that night (or the following morning really) were Great-Uncle Hilbert's do–en Waterford sherry glasses. As Adam said, none of them drank sherry and he didn't know anyone under fifty who did. Having wandered about all over the house, they had ended up in the dining room where the cabinet full of glass was. In another cupboard they found half a bottle of whisky and a dribble of brandy in the bottom of a Courvoisier bottle. There had been something extraordinarily delightful and exhilarating about sitting at that big oval mahogany table drinking whisky at two  o'clock in the morning. The moon had come up and laid a greenish iridescence on the surface of the lake. It was so bright it made the stars disappear. They had to close the window because of the insects. Then they turned out the lights, the great brass chandelier with its false candles, and the moon's lemony radiance lay as still as cloths draped over the shining wood. Adam set the twelve sherry glasses that were cut in a greek key pattern round their rims in the middle of the moonlight and said he would put them in a box tomorrow and try to sell them in Sudbury to the man who had the antique shop in Gainsborough Street that they had passed. There had been a kind of innocence about them at that stage, Rufus thought. On one level they were just marking time, spending a few days in the country at a friend's house. On another they felt (as Mary put it) like burglars, prowling about the house, discovering treasures, half-expecting the true owner to return and surprise them. ‘Suppose old Hilbert's face were to appear at the window now,’ Adam had said as they went up the bask stairs to bed. There was a window at the top, on the landing, but outside there was only the blue jewel night. They had all slept heavily, the sleep if not of the just, of the innocent and artless. None of them doubted that they would eventually get to Greece. In those early days, that last week of June, it was merely a matter of raising enough money. Not that this had been easy. The Sudbury man was not forthcoming, he had been suspicious, wanting all sorts of information about them and the glasses. ‘He thinks you've nicked them, doesn't he?’ said Mary, who hadn't come in but stayed outside in Goblander. ‘And of course he would . I mean just look at you!’ Adam's cut-off jeans with the fringed hems, she meant, and his yellow and red headband that he insisted on calling a fillet as if it were a bit of fish. And their long hair and bare feet. ‘You reckon I should put on one of Hilbert's suits, do you?’ Adam said. He never did that. Instead they drove into Hadleigh and found an antique shop man who offered to drive to Wyvis Hall  and give Adam a valuation for some of the furniture, the chandeliers and the ornaments. Two days later he actually came, an oldish man, at least sixty, and valued two of the cabinets as worth £500 apiece. When Adam heard that, he didn't want to sell, he was sure they must therefore be worth far more. The man bought a brass lantern and two little tables with the surfaces carved with flowers and fruit and the sherry glasses, giving Adam £150 for the lot. Rufus could not remember the man's name, only that he had been the second visitor to Wyvis Hall, the gardener being the first. Would he remember? If still alive, he would be in his seventies by now. He had a confused impression of coming into the dining room while the man was there and hearing him rather grudgingly assess the value of the glass cabinet. The man had said good morning and Rufus had said hallo and had returned to the task he and Mary were embarked on, covering the flagstones of the terrace with quilts from the bedrooms. The terrace faced south and got the full sun, so it was too hot to be out there by day, but in the evenings and at night it was wonderful. They fetched a lightly padded patchwork quilt from the Centaur Room, a pink candlewick from the Room Without a Name, two of white cotton from the Room of Astonishment and a counterpane of heavy yellow satin they found in a cupboard in the Pincushion Room. Mary arranged some pillows out there and cushions from the drawing room and by the time they were finished the antiques man had gone. Leaving them with £150. So that evening they went out to spend some of it. Had they been noticed and noted as they drove through the village of Nunes? Rufus had always heard that nothing can go on in a village without the gossips knowing. Perhaps this would apply if they had walked along that village street or sat on the green or drunk in the local, but they had not. For some reason they had not much liked the look of this pub, called the Fir Tree, and though he had slowed a bit as they came to it, they had not stopped. He had seldom been to the village and only once on foot but he could remember the layout of it with surprising clarity. A church that stood upon a grassy hill and to which you mounted by a flight of steep stone stairs. An avenue of yew trees. Behind it one of those screens of elms, all dead even by then of Dutch elm disease. A village street of houses and cottages, a garage, a grocer, but not a single antique shop. The green an isosceles triangle without a tree to it, but trees around the pub, the same kind as in Adam's pine wood, Rufus supposed, or very like, which the licensee or the brewery had probably thought its name required. There was the inevitable council estate, the houses painted pale green, blue, pink, as in some child's drawing, and then, round a bend in the lane where you might have expected open fields, half a dozen houses of 1950s or '60s provenance, lavishly appointed, glamorously gardened, with big garages and big cars outside them. ‘Hampstead Garden Suburb comes to Suffolk,’ Adam had said. Later on they had seen the coypu man's van parked on the front driveway of one of those houses. And they had had a discussion about it, speculating as to whether he actually lived there or was there to kill something, rats, moles, any sort of infestation. Snobbish Rufus had not thought it possible for someone like that to live there, but why not, after all? There was money to be made out of the destruction of pests in a country place. Rufus had an out-patients' clinic and then a ward round, in the afternoon a very frightened woman to see in Wimpole Street, a woman who needed his kind reassurance, his urbane ways, the proffered cigarette, the support. His first cigarette of the day he smoked while he waited, extinguishing it two minutes before she was shown in and he had to tell her that her cervical smear had shown pre-cancerous signs. Who would reassure him ? Comfort him ? No one, he thought, and despised himself for what was to him an unnatural need. The police would not necessarily assume that the bones in the graveyard were of people who had lived at Wyvis Hall, nor that those who had brought about their deaths had lived there. But it was likely . It was most probable. The existence of the cemetery was not generally known and on the lane side of the pine wood the trees were separated from the grass verge by a dose-boarded fence. They would ask a lot of questions in the village. They would make enquiries at Pytle Farm and the house called the Mill in the Pytle. By some means they would discover all the people who were likely to have called at Wyvis Hall in the capacity of tradesmen or service operatives: dustmen, meter readers, gardeners, antique dealers, perhaps — why not?— the coypu man. Adam would be questioned, was possibly being questioned at this moment. Unless he had changed a lot he would not make a good impression. Had the time come to forget the promise they had made each other, the guarantee they had given never to meet or speak? Rufus reached for the blue phone directory and turned to the V's, to Verne-Smith-Duchini, and had actually begun to dial when his patient was announced. He put the receiver back and created, forcing his lips to perform, a wide smile."
FIC FIC-FAJ-012 2.77 "TWENTY-THREE Mr Shah's fax machine has been working overtime. Faxes have arrived at all hours from LA and London. As I pull up at the back of the hotel Mr Shah is waiting with a folder full; his expression, although friendly, contains around his mouth a little reproach that I should have been away from the action for so long. ‘I've been up to my ears,’ he says. There have been many diversions. It took us some time to get to Kitumbeine and the district officer had knocked off. We found him drunk in his bungalow. With the promise of money he accompanied us to his office for the forms. He had trouble finding them and managed to catch his finger in a filing cabinet. There seemed to me no chance of the necessary chain of events being completed. The office, which displayed portraits of both the last president and the new one, was filled with stale air. It was air into which farts and old food odours had been released, but which was completely inert, as though in some way lacking ions or ozone, because the air conditioner had not worked for years and the windows were sealed. If the telephones had rung you would have taken fright. They were Bakelite and dusty. Bundles of papers and box files were stacked on termite-proof metal shelves but their labels had faded. Paramat stood by the doorway with the attitude of a tourist at the shrine of an exotic religious sect. He was both eager to adopt the right stance and unnerved by the strangeness of it. The lodging of a compensation form, a simple enough matter, here required a respect for ritual. There had to be more to it than simply filling in a few spaces with a ballpoint; greater symbolic weight was required. The money dispensers in the capital could only be approached through their acolyte, whose job it was to demand some offerings and make the  right moves to ensure success. The district officer wanted to know if suitable precautions had been taken to avoid the elephants. I enquired about the nature of these precautions. ‘They are ferocious beasts,’ he said, ‘and these people sometimes are ignoring the law of the jungle. Some of them are even looking out for compensation.’ Eventually the police certificate was accepted, the forms were filled and stamped, and placed in a tray marked ‘out’. I felt they might have a better chance of getting to the capital if they were folded into paper aeroplanes and launched out of the door. So I have been away longer than I said I would be, and Mr Shah is a little surprised at my dereliction. To him the outside world, in particular Los Angeles and London, is humming with importance. I would hate to have to explain to him the true state of affairs. He hands me a brown manila file, and a handwritten invoice which I imagine he is giving to me now while the connection between the reams of faxes and the many noughts, in local shillings, of his invoice is still fresh. He asks me about my safari, but I know that what happens out there is of no interest to him. Out there — not so far, as from it happens the centre of the town — a realm of nothingness exists. From out there, however, the view is very different. There are some new faces in the dining room, a Danish family of mother, father and four small children. The sun has crabbed their gaze so that when they turn to me I see a row of puppies squinting. When I returned to the laibon's village with the paperwork, he was looking out towards Ol Doinyo Lengai waiting for the sound and the dust and the cries of his cattle coming back. We handed over the stamped forms, which he gave to the koko for safe keeping. The newly born goats were kept  in a pen under her bed. I wondered where she would keep these papers. ‘Fahfakhs is coming,’ the laibon said in Swahili. I didn't know if this was a question or a prediction. I had told him that I had met Fairfax. He wasn't surprised that Fairfax was still alive. Now I have his message: ‘Glad to help if I can. Stop. Memory not what it was. Stop. Please contact me at Muthaiga. Stop. Thomas Fairfax.’ So perhaps the laibon's pebbles, worn smooth by his hands and his predecessors, right back to the great Mbatian, had told him. The laibon asked me to sit in the boma, and pointed to my tape-recorder. He had much on his mind. I lie down on my bed and remove my socks before looking at the folder. Letterman would like to see a first draft by the time I meet him in London. My legs are shaded by the dust which has gathered over the past few days, so that the contrast is like a Coppertone ad, with the puppy pulling a little girl's knickers off. I look at my legs critically. God knows how much time we spend in our lives scrutinizing our bodies. My legs are now pleasantly brown, quite well formed, I believe. I am happy to see them in this workmanlike state. It confirms to me that I am far from the northern climates, the habitat of the Brussels sprout, where something sickly was spreading over my relationship with Victoria — just like the smell of overcooked vegetables. When I think of Victoria, now not very often, I no longer think of her lips in fellatio with a stranger in a hotel room; instead I remember their former,framboise state. I don't feel that churning, dread longing any more which seemed like a curse from an irrational and limitless supply of malevolence. I couldn't bear to be in its thrall for another day. I had to go. I don't suppose she will understand this, or the connection I am making, tentatively, with Claudia's fate. Here in Mr Shah's hotel or out on the plains I find myself making all sorts of airy leaps and connections effortlessly. I  seem to be free of mundane anxieties. I can see now the attraction of those religions which exalt the achievement of personal tranquillity above ail else. Really they are invitations to live the life of the mind, however ill-equipped the mind may be."
FIC FIC-G01-011 1.49 "50 It was smaller than a man's thumb nail and Nicholson held it between the thumb and finger of his right hand with surprising delicacy. The microchip was square and the entire complex structure was encased in smooth plastic. Nicholson laid it on a piece of black velvet that lay on the work top, allowing his visitors to get a better look at the tiny object. ‘Is this some kind of joke?’ Fairham asked. ‘Why should it be?’ the Governor asked irritably. ‘You promised to show us a way of relieving overcrowding. Is this meant to be it ?’ ‘The idea was first perfected in America. A number of states are already using it,’ Nicholson declared. ‘But that didn't work,’ said Fairham. ‘Ours is a different system. The microchip is inserted into the gastrocnemius muscle of the prisoner's leg.’ He looked at Fairham with scorn. ‘The calf muscle, to keep it simple.’ He held the other's gaze for a moment then continued. ‘The operation takes less than fifteen minutes. It's carried out under local anaesthetic, there is no pain to the prisoner. No side effects.’ ‘What does it do?’ Clinton asked, his eyes fixed on the tiny square. ‘Once inside the prisoner's leg it gives off something called a Synch-pulse,’ Nicholson said. ‘A tiny electrical charge which in turn produces a signal that can be picked  up by monitoring equipment here at the prison. It's like a tracking device.’ ‘What range has it got?’ Merrick asked. ‘Fifteen miles at the moment,’ the Governor told him. ‘The modifications that are being made to it will probably increase that range by anything up to thirty miles.’ ‘And what is the object exactly, Mr Nicholson?’ Anne Hopper enquired, looking at the Governor. ‘An end to overcrowding, Miss Hopper,’ he said. ‘The thing you all seem so concerned about.’ ‘How the hell can that,’ Fairham jabbed a finger towards the microchip, ‘help with overcrowding?’ ‘The device is placed in the leg of certain remand prisoners,’ Nicholson explained. ‘They can then be released from Whitely and monitored on our electronic equipment here. We know where they are twenty-four hours a day.’ ‘And what if they move outside the range of the tracking device?’ Clinton murmured, his eyes still fixed on the device. ‘We don't allow that to happen,’ Nicholson said. ‘The prisoners are picked for the operation according to the severity of their crime. Everything is explained to them, including the fact that if they do travel beyond the range of the device they'll be re-arrested and prosecuted for attempted escape. They usually co-operate. It's in their own interests to do so. Many of them prefer this to being stuck inside for twenty-three hours a day. Some are even working while they're on the outside waiting for their trials.’ ‘Do I detect a note of compassion in your attitude, Mr Nicholson?’ said Fairham, contemptuously. ‘You actually sound as if you care about what happens to the men who undergo this operation.’ ‘It gets them out of my hair, Mr Fairham,’ the Governor said. ‘It means that my officers have fewer prisoners to deal with.’ ‘How many men has this been tried on so far?’ Clinton enquired. ‘Ten,’ Nicholson said. ‘And all of them have been successful.’ ‘And what is your definition of success, Mr Nicholson?’ Anne Hopper wanted to know. He looked at her impassively. ‘Not one of them tried to escape,’ he said. ‘They all reported to the police station they'd been assigned to and they all went on to stand trial.’ ‘When is the device removed?’ Clinton asked. ‘As soon as the trial is over.’ Clinton stood back and nodded, looking at the microchip then at Nicholson. ‘Well, I must say I'm impressed, Mr Nicholson,’ said the MP. ‘Me too,’ Merrick echoed. ‘It seems a great step forward.’ Fairham merely prodded the device with one index finger. ‘Who does the operations?’ he wanted to know. ‘There are a number of doctors involved,’ Nicholson told him. ‘None resident at the prison.’ ‘That's a pity,’ Anne Hopper intoned. ‘It would have been interesting to meet them.’ ‘The work is still in its infancy, Miss Hopper. They're not too anxious to be put in the limelight just yet,’ Nicholson told her. ‘Why? In case something goes wrong?’ Fairham said, challengingly. ‘As I said, the work is still relatively new. Until it's completely perfected we'd rather keep it quiet,’ the Governor said, glaring once again at the other man. ‘I can understand that,’ Clinton said, smiling. ‘It seems to be successful though, Mr Nicholson. Full marks to you. We'll be reporting this as very satisfactory progress when we return to Whitehall.’ ‘Satisfactory?’ Fairham snapped. ‘This man is using remand prisoners as human guinea pigs and you call that satisfactory?’ ‘I think you're being a little over-dramatic, Mr Fairham,’ Clinton said, smiling patronisingly. ‘It is preferable to the alternative of being locked up twenty-three hours out of twenty-four,’ Merrick echoed. Nicholson smiled triumphantly at Fairham. ‘What is your view, Miss Hopper?’ the Governor wanted to know. The woman shrugged slightly. ‘I suppose I would have to agree with Mr Clinton and Mr Merrick,’ she said. ‘As long as the patients are volunteers and the risks are explained to them before the operation, I can see no objection myself.’ ‘You appear to be out-voted again, Mr Fairham,’ Nicholson said, smiling. ‘I'd like to know a little more about the actual mechanics of the project,’ Clinton said. ‘How the tracking devices are built, what the operation entails, how the prisoners are monitored. That kind of thing. I will have to make a report to the House, you understand?’ Nicholson nodded, his ingratiating smile spreading. ‘Certainly. If you'd like to come back to my office we can discuss it there,’ he said, looking at Fairham. The other man was flushed with anger. The Governor turned to lead the small procession out. ‘We've only seen a small part of the hospital wing,’ Fairham observed. ‘I'd like to inspect the facilities here before we leave.’ Nicholson retained his air of calm. ‘Of course,’ he said, leading them towards a door at one end of the room. It opened out into the infirmary: There were half a dozen prisoners in the beds; other men in white overalls moved among them, performing their duties. One was mopping the floor, another dispensing pills. A third man was pushing a trolley, collecting dirty laundry. Patients and workers alike gave the Governor and his visitors only cursory glances. More lingering looks were reserved for Anne Hopper. A warder stood at one end of the infirmary, standing by a thick metal door. Nicholson looked towards him, hoping that none of the visitors noticed the look of apprehension on his face. He stood back as the visitors moved among the men, speaking to them where possible, usually meeting with only perfunctory grunts in answer to their questions. The Governor caught the eye of the warder at the far end of the infirmary and the man nodded almost imperceptibly. A silent answer to an unasked question. The Governor licked his lips, aware that they were once more dry. Come on, hurry up and get out of here. One by one the visitors returned to join him. They're not going to ask. Fairham looked to the far end of the infirmary. ‘What's through there?’ he asked, pointing at the door. ‘The morgue,’ Nicholson said quickly. ‘It's where we keep any prisoners who die until they've been identified, or until arrangements can be made for their burial.’ Fairham nodded slowly. Come on, come on . ‘I think we've seen enough now, Mr Nicholson,’ Clinton said. Fairham was still gazing at the door. The Governor licked his lips again. ‘We'll go back to my office, then,’ he said. At last Fairham tore his gaze away and filed out in front of Nicholson. The Governor glanced back at the solitary warder and nodded. As he walked out he let out a sigh of relief. He would return here as soon as the delegation was gone. For now, at least, it was still safe."
FIC FIC-G01-036 0.72 "74 The door crashed shut, the loud clash of metal on metal reverberating inside the cell. James Scott stood in the centre of the small room for a moment, looking round, then sat down on the edge of the bottom bunk. He felt numb, as if his entire body had been pumped full of novocaine. There was a lead weight where his heart should have been. He felt as if every last drop of feeling had been sucked out of him. The past two days had passed quickly, so quickly in fact that the events of those four days were somewhat hazy. And yet still he retained memories of that time. Like splinters in his mind. The journey to the court. The police had brought a suit he'd requested from his flat and he'd changed into that, shaved and smartened himself up. The trial. He had decided, as advised, to plead guilty and proceedings had moved with dizzying speed. The gun had been produced as evidence. Pictures of the dead men had been circulated around the jury. Scott could remember one of the jurors in particular. She had been in her mid-forties, a smart, efficient-looking woman who had hardly taken her eyes off him throughout the trial. And he had seen hatred in those eyes. When sentence had been passed he glanced at her and was sure he could see the trace of a smile on her lips. Scott had heard little of the Judge's summing up or, indeed, of his comments after the life sentence had been passed. Just the odd word here and there, like ‘horrendous’, ‘brutal’, ‘cold-blooded’ or ‘dangerous’, had filtered through the screen that seemed to have erected itself around him. He felt as if he'd been inside a cell ever since his arrest, imprisoned within his own mind. He had spent much of the trial gazing around the court room particularly into the public gallery, but not once did he see Carol. Bitch. God, how he needed her now. If only he could have spoken to her one last time before he'd been taken down. Touched her. Kissed her. But that was not to be. She was gone now, out of his life as surely as if she were dead. After sentence had been passed he had been taken to the cells, then back to Dalston in a black van. From there he'd been taken in a police van to Whitely by two police officers. The journey, despite the distance between London and the prison, had taken a surprisingly short time. Or so it seemed to Scott. It was as if time had lost all meaning, as if even that were conspiring to hasten him to this place where he would spend the rest of his life. The rest of his life. The finality of the words hit him once more; only now, within the confines of the cell, they had an almost deathly abruptness. He looked around the room, at the bunks, the other small bed on the other side of the cell. At the thick metal door, the wooden table and chairs. The slop buckets. There was one single window set about seven feet up the wall, covered by wire mesh as well as being barred. Freedom was now only something to be glimpsed through steel. Death must be similar to this feeling, he thought. The four walls of the cell might as well be the  wooden sides of a coffin. There was no such thing as life within prisons, only day-to-day existence. Passing time. Waiting for the only real release, which would come in the form of death; the actual termination of life, not the living death of captivity. He had been shown which locker in the room was his and told that one of his cell-mates was on work detail, the other in the exercise yard. Scott didn't really care. He unzipped his bag and took out what few possessions he'd been allowed to bring in to the cell: a small cassette-radio and a few tapes. The towels were prison issue, along with the roll of toilet paper and the clean white T-shirts and underwear. He crossed to his locker and opened it. From the pocket of his overalls he took a photo of Carol. She was smiling out at him, her long blond hair tousled. She was wearing jeans and a denim shirt (which he'd bought her). He looked at that smile. A mocking smile? He wanted her badly. Bitch. He needed her. She had betrayed him. Perhaps she would visit him. He wedged the picture inside the locker door and stood staring at it. No, she wouldn't visit him. Perhaps she'd write. He looked at the photo. His jaw was clenched tightly, his eyes narrowed. Why did you betray me? I love you. ‘Fucking bitch,’ he snarled and drove his fist against the door, against the photo. When he looked at it, there was blood oozing from two split knuckles. Red spots had splashed across the picture. Across her smile. Fucking bitch. ‘I love you,’ he breathed softly. The blood dripped from his gashed hand."
FIC FIC-J54-016 1.14 "It's not good enough,""Lizzie, said, plonking a cup of tea in front of Sara. ""We're not straight yet. Miss Jenny ought to be more thoughtful instead of causing extra work.""  ""She won't be much extra work,"" Sara protested mildly,""and we have plenty of room. Don't fuss, Lizzie.""  ""I'm not fussing!""  Lizzie was indignant and padded back to the kitchen mumbling to herself. It was late afternoon. School was over for the day and Sara had expected Jenny to arrive before this. She awaited her coming with mixed feelings. Once she would""only have been pleased to see Jenny and welcomed her company. Now her presence at Moorlake was going to be complicating for both of them. Her own attraction to Matthew she had pushed to the outermost edges of her  consciousness. She did not want him in her life. She did not want to be hurt by him. She did not want Jenny to be hurt. Yet she could see nothing in the future but hurt for both of them. She felt disloyal in not telling Jenny of Matthew's inconsequential fickleness, and yet Jenny would probably not believe her if she did tell. And she knew, too, that having this queer ambivalent feeling about Matthew herself, her motives in bearing tales would not stand examination. So Sara, troubled, sipped her tea and waited for Jenny. She arrived at last an hour or so later, swerving up in her blue sports car, its boot piled with a large amount of luggage. Pulling off her bright headscarf, tossing off her jacket, she threw off apologies at the same time. ""It was Daddy. I had the most awful time with him. He doesn't approve of me staying here at all.""  ""He's lonely without you,"" Sara said. ""Oh, it's not that. It's Matthew he  disapproves of, even though he doesn't know him properly."" Sara suddenly felt pity for her stepfather, bereft of his only, well-beloved daughter. She was too young to be away from home; he should have been sure of her company for a few more years yet.  ""I've got my own life to lead,"" Jenny said. ""He must understand that. Anyway, I've promised to go back to London at the week-end. It was the only way he would let me come. We had the most terrible argument.""  ""I'm sorry,"" Sara said.  ""It must be hard for him.""  She hesitated a moment and then said,""Matthew asked to see you as soon as you arrived. I got the message at lunch time, so maybe to-morrow would do now.""  ""Matthew?"" said Jenny sharply.  ""How—"" she began and then bit her lip and said, ""I'll have some supper and then go up and see him.""  Over the meal, she became a little more cheerful and relaxed and made Sara laugh with her tales of her sojourn in Rome. But as soon as the meal was finished, her animation left her. She became silent and fidgeted about the room, halfheartedly helping Sara to clear away.  ""Don't worry,"" Sara said,""I'll do the washing up. You can go and see Matthew now if you want  ""Can't Lizzie—"" began Jenny.  ""I've sent her to bed,"" Sara said, ""She works too hard as it is, for an old woman her age,""   ""Well, if you're sure""  ""Of course, there's practically nothing to do, anyway. Off you go!"" Jenny sped away with relief. Upstairs to tidy herself up, and then out to re-enter the house by Matthew's door. Alone, Sara switched on her radio and did the washing up. It did not take long, and afterwards she went round the house and saw that all the doors and windows were barred. Since the burglary, she had been extra-careful. Then she went to her office and prepared some work for the morning. Still Jenny had not returned. She had been gone nearly two hours and Sara  decided that she was not going to walt up for her. She felt tired, and Jenny had a key and could let herself in. She and Matthew must have plenty to talk about. Or perhaps they were not talking. Sara's heart twisted a little with unhappiness. Not for the first time, she wished Great-Aunt Alicia had never set eyes on Matthew Preston. The next morning Jenny was up early. She yawned over her breakfast.  ""I didn't sleep very well,"" she said in explanation.  ""What time did you get to bed?""  Sara asked.  ""Not very late,"" Jenny said a little defensively, and added,""Matt's got a big job on and is going to be very busy, he says. He won't have so much time for the horses, so I'm going to be useful at least.""  ""And what about Bunny Chaloner?""   ""What about her?"" asked Jenny sharply.  ""She was upset that Matthew hadn't told her you were coming back.""   ""Matt will calm her down,"" Jenny said carelessly, and helped herself to more coffee. Matthew evidently did calm her down, for Sara continued to see Bunny worKing around the yard or riding out. Her threat to leave the job had been an idle one, and whatever ill feeling there had been between her and Jenny must have been papered over. The two girls sometimes exercised the horses together and seemed on amiable terms. They both came under the orders of the elderly Lambert, who seemed to have taken over the running of the stable almost entirely from his master. Little was seen of Matthew by anyone. Sara, busy about her own affairs, and always up early, occasionally caught a glimpse of him driving off in his estate car in the morning. He had begun the clearing and draining of the Fairfax land and was helping with the actual physical labour himself. He came home late and, according to Lizzie, had a bath and went straight to bed. Certainly Jenny did not see him for  the first few evenings she was at Moorlake. She was disconsolate in consequence, and seemed to find time hanging heavily on her hands. At the week-end she drove back to London to stay with her father, and Sara was left alone again. She was in her bedroom on Saturday morning making a list of the errands and shopping she had to do when she became aware of an excited chattering in the courtyard below her window. It sounded like a flock of children. She looked out and saw that it was a flock of children, of assorted sizes, and both sexes, ranging from ten to fourteen years of age. There must have been about forty or fifty of them. Each child had a hold-all and there were two adults with them, a man and a woman. The children in small groups went inside the stables while the others waited. They were orderly but noisy and were occasionally called to order by the adults. Bemused, Sara stared down at them What on earth was Matthew up to now! Her question was answered a few minutes later when Matthew himself came outside  and saw her at the window. He grinned at her and called up, ""Like to come for a picnic?""  Sara could not help smiling back at him, he looked so incongruous surrounded by the children, who did not seem to stay still for a moment; the whole group bubbled and rippled with continuous movement.  ""What are you doing?""  Sara asked.  ""Going for a picnic,"" Matthew said. ""Come on, join us. It's a beautiful day,"" It was indeed a beautiful day, one more of this beautiful summer. The sky was cloudless and the air still, and as yet it was not too hot.  ""I've got too much to do,"" Sara said.  ""I can't just drop everything and go off on a picnic.""   ""Why not?"" asked Matthew.  ""What's so urgent it can't be left till Monday?""   ""My week-end shopping.""  ""For one? Rubbish. Lizzie will do it. Come on now. You'll be perfectly safe. Well chaperoned."" Matthew waved his arm at his audience, who were listening to this exchange with come interest. Sara realised then that he was perfectly serious in his invitation. At first she had thought he was joking.  ""You are really going on a picnic?""   ""What does this look like?""   ""A conducted tour of the Moorlake stables.""   ""Come on down and I'll explain.""  Sara moved away from the window and curiosity took her downstairs to the courtyard. Looking down at her, his dark eyes twinkling, Matthew said,""It's really an outing to the school forest. I don't suppose you've met Don Halpin, the local forestry officer. He's an old friend of mine. We were at university together. This is his baby. This is a special outing and he was supposed to be here to take charge of this lot, but the poor fellow's down with jaundice and I'm standing in for him. He didn't want to let the kids down. It's a kind of review of the year's work and a lot of trouble had been taken by everyone. It would have been a great disappointment if someone hadn't taken Don's place. The  visit to the stables is just a bonus. One of the kids asked about the foal and it suddenly occurred to me they'd like to see all the mares, so I had them brought inside specially for visitors' day."" He laughed.  ""Where is the school forest?"" asked Sara. He really was a dear man with his enthusiasms, she thought. ""About thirty miles away, up in the Forestry Commission woods round Whitecross. Come with us, Sara. It will do you good, and Lizzie's packed enough food for a whole squad, let alone two of us. Be a devil and stop being so staid and doing only the things you've planned to do.""  ""I'm not staid,"" Sara protested looking at him, tempted by the thought of a day in the open air and in his company. Weakly, she gave in to temptation.  ""When are you leaving?"" she asked.  ""In about half an hour,"" Matthew said, looking pleased. Sara discovered that they were to travel in two large buses which were parked outside the house. The two teachers went in one bus, she and Matthew went in the  other. As she filed into the bus with the girls and boys, Sara almost felt back at school again herself. The high spirits surrounding her were infectious and she had an insane desire to giggle. It was absurd for her to be going on such an expedition She and Matthew sat at the back of the bus, and while they were bowling along into the country, with a beautiful view of the landscape, Matthew explained the history of the school forest.  ""It's the old story of catching them young,"" he said. ""Most people have an affection for trees and think they're beautiful and necessary to the landscape and so on, but it's important that we also realise their value as a national asset. We need trees—as shelter for crops and stock; they prevent erosion of the soil; they play an important part around reservoirs by purifying the water we drink. And in spite of all the synthetic man-made materials, we need wood as much as ever we did. At the moment, about four-fifths of all the timber and timber products we use have to be imported. The aim of the Forestry  Commission is to make the country less dependent on timber supplies from overseas. ""It's a long-term project, and to help it there's got to be a forest sense among the general public. How better to inculcate it than in the young?"" And so the idea of the school forest was born. This particular comprehensive school had taken over its forest—a plot of land in one of the Commission's forests—five years ago. The plot had a stream and a little natural woodland in the form of mixed oak, birch, alder, ash and sycamore. The boys and girls had cleared the land and planted larch, spruce, pine, silver fir, cypress and redwood. All the planting was recorded on charts and records were kept of growth and development. The forest had become like an open-air classroom for the study of subjects other than the trees themselves—nature and bird life, animal and insect life; aquatic studies based on the stream; map-reading, the study of rocks and soils; drawing from nature and even gardening came into it. Naturally, the school worked in the forest the year round. This trip, with its mixed classes, was in the nature of a special outing for the summer term, to show the forester the work done during the year, to formulate new projects, to hear his comments. Matthew, standing in for his friend, had promised to give him a full and complete report. The buses turned off the main road on to a forestry road running through the woods, and in a little while they arrived at their destination. The buses were parked and the children filed through the gate which led to their own fenced-off domain. They followed a sandy path through the young trees all of which had been planted by earlier pupils, their predecessors. In the old natural woodland which had been there originally, in a small clearing, a log cabin had been built and thatched with heather. This was the head-quarters of the picnic and here everyone dumped their  hold-alls and the teachers the equipment which had been brought. Truly, the cabin was in the heart of the forest. Trees surrounded it on all sides. It could have been a wood-cutter's cottage in an old fairy tale, Sara thought, or the first house built by a settler in the Wild West. The children surely enjoyed their forest. The children were dividing themselves off into small groups. Each had its own project to attend to…checking on nesting boxes they had some months earlier put among the trees…on the stream…recording the height of various trees planted the autumn before…and there was also some weeding to be done, as always, among the ranks of young trees. The children were all intent and serious. So was Matthew. Sara, watching, and listening to him, felt her heart expand with sweetness. How nice he could be, she thought, as she saw his manner with the children warm, yet not in the least condescending with too much bonhomie. She felt very much an ignorant outsider, but unobtrusively attached herself to  charge. He took no special notice of her, but she felt welcome, and when he was explaining some method of or reason for the cultivation of certain trees, she sensed he was talking to her as much as to the boys and girls around them. The groups of children were soon swallowed up among the trees, and the sounds of the forest overlaid their fading voices and laughter, the soughing of the wind in the canopy of branches above their heads, the calls of the birds and the rustling and murmuring in the undergrowth. Matthew and Sara and the children with them came out of the old woods into the new plantation, where rows of conifers, dark green, were interplanted with small spindly brighter green beeches. It was hard to imagine the leggy beeches would some sixty years hence be tall majestic trees. Then the conifers would have long since given up their job as nurses to the beeches and ended in a timber yard. They were on the brow of a little hill  and Sara walked farther on to look down on the county spread in front of her, idly trying to recognise familiar landmarks—It was a travel-ad view —neat lush fields, trim hedgerows, a farmhouse nestling in amongst its windbreak of trees, a sheet of yellow on the far hills where a field of mustard was in bloom, and for the rest, a thousand different shades of the greens of high summer, a piece of England basking in the sun and as beautiful as any foreign strand. Matthew came up beside her while the boys and girls were busy with their charts among the trees. They stood there for a moment without speaking. Sara felt a strange contentment creep over her. She didn't want to talk or exclaim on the beauty of the view, and as though Matthew was also aware of their silent communication, he laid his hand gently on her shoulder. He broke the silence first.  ""I want to say something to you,"" he began, but Sara never heard what it was. An interruption came from one of the  schoolboys who had walked up behind them and had some question he wanted to ask Matthew. At midday, everyone returned to the cabin for their lunch. Sara and Matthew ate theirs companionably with the two teachers and the bus drivers sitting outside in the sunshine, sharing Lizzie's meat pies and coffee and chocolate cakes.  ""Mrs Mott's brownies"" , said Sara when she saw them emerge from the picnic basket.  ""Mrs Mott's what?"" asked Matthew laughing at her.  ""Your Mrs Mott's brownies,"" Sara said.  ""She gave Lizzie a lesson on how to make them.""   ""And Lizzie learnt her lesson well,"" Matthew said.  ""She and Mrs Mott seem to like each other.""  ""Yes said Sara. She had not thought of Moorlake or Jenny for the whole morning. Now they came again to the forefront of her mind. She looked across at Matthew. She should not have come on this picnic. She loved Jenny, and Jenny loved Matthew. But, a small voice whispered, that does not make Matthew Jenny's property. He belonged to no one. Matthew looked up from the picnic basket as though aware of her intent, serious gaze. Their glances met, and for a moment Sara felt as though she had been swung out into space. She dared not believe in the warmth and tenderness she saw in Matthew's eyes. With an effort she looked away and made some remark to one of the schoolteachers and became consciously absorbed in the conversation which followed. Going home later in the afternoon, Matthew said, ""Unfortunately I'm going out this evening, otherwise we might have had dinner together.""   ""I couldn't,"" Sara said hurriedly, and added, lying, ""I'm going out too.""   ""And to-morrow?""   ""To-morrow I've promised to take Lizzie to see her niece the other side of Bridgeborough,"" Sara said quickly, glad of the genuine excuse. Matthew looked at her quizzically but said nothing more. Their bus dropped Matthew and Sara at Moorlake before taking the children on to their school, which was the collecting and departure point. Sara and Matthew stood outside the house waving while a loud chorus of goodbyes fell around them. The day was over and Sara could not stifle her regret. She had learnt to know Matthew a little better. She had seen another side of him and one she had not even dreamt existed, a kind, sweet, patient side. She had been impressed by his knowledge and his observation and she loved and admired him a little more. She felt very unhappy as she entered her own part of Moorlake."
NWS NWS-A1E-012 4.62 "Commodities: Reading higher prices in the tea leaves By MICHAEL PREST SINCE we are in the middle of the International Coffee Organisation meeting -how do they pass a week without a visible result?— I thought it appropriate to think about tea. It is not such a perverse idea, because a lot of people have recently become interested in that noble beverage. As always, the interest is not unconnected with a little matter of price. At last Monday's weekly London tea auction, prices reached their highest for three years. Many in the trade expect prices to go up further today, and possibly for quite a few auctions to come. Richard Howell of Sheppards, the London stockbrokers, has been following tea and plantation shares for 20 years. ‘My anticipation is that we will certainly see a rise on Monday — not of the same proportion, but there's clearly going to be a rise. What's developed in 1989 is a genuine shortage of teas of all grades.’ Over the past 12 months the price of lower medium quality tea, which is the main ingredient in the British cuppa and imparts that unique lorry-driver flavour, has almost doubled from 78p a kilogramme to 135p. Medium qualities have also risen noticeably, from 98p to 145p, over the same period. But quality teas, the best grade, have hardly changed at around 200p a kilogramme. The rise is particularly interesting because it confounded expectations. The Economist Intelligence Unit concluded in its World Commodity Outlook 1989: ‘Short of climatic intervention — to which tea is less vulnerable than most other major crops — a continuation of the downtrend seems unavoidable: we expect London auction prices to average £1/kg, or even less, in 1989.’ At the beginning of the year, however, the trend argument was much more plausible than it is today. World production of tea (black and green) grew from 2.27m tonnes in 1985 to 2.34m tonnes in 1987, and rose again in 1988. Whereas, according to the United States Department of Agriculture, world production rose by 4.5 per cent, consumption, on estimates by the International Monetary Fund, went up by only 2.6 per cent . At the same time, the main import markets continued to decline. In 1987 imports into Britain fell by 12 per cent, although with around a fifth of the market we remained easily the world's biggest tea importers. The Irish, however, drink an average of 3 cups a day, fractionally more than the British. But beware of extrapolations, my daughter. Expectations were upset for three basic reasons: First, the long Tamil insurgency in Sri Lanka has finally taken its toll of the tea estates. Exports from that lovely island could be 40 per cent lower in 1989 than in 1988. Since Sri Lanka previously exported about 200,000 tonnes of tea annually, only a little less than India, the biggest exporter, the loss is crucial. Second, there was a climatic disaster. Malawi, which exports normally about 40,000 tonnes a year, has suffered from a serious drought. Only a good crop in Kenya has saved Africa from another disaster. Third, Indian exports have been depressed by a combination of politics and nature. The political factor is the imminent general election. Fearful of the consequences of higher tea prices, the government has sought to stabilise them by fiddling the weekly Calcutta auctions. In alternate weeks the auction is wholly devoted to domestic buyers or to foreign buyers. Since the bulk of the tea at the Calcutta auctions is low medium quality, the dual auction has a disproportionate impact on tea prices generally, and on London prices especially. This effect has been compounded by the natural factor, a disappointing crop in southern India. There are other elements in the price rise as well. At the end of last year, again largely for political reasons, the Pakistan government granted licences to importers to bring in tea. Pakistan is now a net tea importer. In a different and much more alarming category is the fate of the Soviet industry. The Soviet Union used to produce about 150,000 tonnes of tea a year, making it one of the biggest growers. But nuclear power changed that. According to Mr Howell, all the bushes in Georgia were polluted by radiation, and have been destroyed. For the first time that anyone can remember, the Soviet Union has been buying at the London auction. Mr Howell is convinced that the tea market under-supplied for several years. ‘This genuine shortage is occurring for the first time ever. This is the great genuine move in the tea price.’ There is evidence to support the case that prices will remain high for a while. Despite the withdrawal of the Indian army from Sri Lanka, peace may not be established. Even if it is, some estates could take years to rehabilitate. A tea bush requires constant attention: if not plucked for a year it can take two years to return to normal; if bushes have to be uprooted, new ones take seven years to come into production. Despite the relative growth of consumption and demand in the mid-1980s, the market for black tea alone was finely balanced at around 1.67m tonnes. Moreover, the four biggest growers and exporters — India, Sri Lanka, China and Kenya — also have large populations and /or high birth rates. As the Indian example shows, domestic consumption is a vital factor. Yet one must be cautious. Historically tea has been a fairly dull market, dominated by trade interests — two arguments against the London Fox's efforts to excite interest in a tea futures contract. A balanced market, by definition, can swing surprisingly fast in the opposite direction: the chances are, for example, that Malawi will not have a drought next year. But for all I know, the ICO could still be meeting then."
NWS NWS-A1J-033 4.45 "The Labour Party Conference: Policy review throws a spanner in the Whitehall machinery By COLIN HUGHES, Political Correspondent AN INCOMING Labour government would turn large areas of Whitehall upside down— but the party's policy review barely considers the implications of its plans for restructuring government departments. Scattered through the policy review are proposals to: Drastically alter the status and organisation of the Department of Trade and Industry; Create two departments — a Department of Consumer Affairs, and a Department for Legal Administration; Create a Department of Environmental Protection within the existing Department of the Environment; Set up a plethora of new commissions and executive agencies; Set up a Women's Ministry. Those are only the most overt changes advocated in the review papers. The only department which explicitly escapes unscathed is the one which Conservatives would most like to abolish: the Department of Energy. In virtually every case the aim of causing upheaval is explicitly declared, because Labour's aim would be to upset the bureaucratic order it inherits. New departments and quangos would, according to the review, be designed to act as irritants and antagonists within the Civil Service system. But the policy review nowhere considers the overall effect of the individual changes proposed, or how they might be co-ordinated. Nor does it contemplate the knock-on consequences for Labour ministers of attempting to implement their programme while rebuilding the governmental machine. The ‘medium term industrial strategy’ which would form the centrepiece of Labour's economic policy would, according to the Productive and Competitive Economy review group, be ‘administered by a transformed Department of Trade and Industry’. The review adds: ‘What we now seek is a DTI which will have an equal, if not superior status, to that of the Treasury.’ That approach would seek to knock out a keystone of Civil Service tradition. Labour policy has long sought to challenge the Treasury's dominance in government. But its last effort — the Department of Economic Affairs, set up by Harold Wilson and headed by George Brown — ended in futile departmental and ministerial infighting. There would in addition be a minister for Science and Technology at the newly supreme DTI, with responsibility for determing investment in research. There is no mention in the education policy of how that might affect the Department of Education and Science. But while the DTI would override the Treasury, a new ‘powerful Department of Consumer Affairs’ would antagonise the DTI. It would be headed by ‘a minister of Cabinet rank’ and act as ‘the consumers’voice with other government departments'. Its remit for inter-departmental intrusion would be wide, with ‘a watching brief over government action’ and the ability to initiate consumer legislation. Only the Women's Ministry would be given equal license. It would be able to ‘require each government department to review its policies, practices, and existing and proposed legislation’. While new departments are born and others extended, one of the oldest — the Home Office — would become a shadow of its present self. Labour's proposed Department for Legal Administration would take over responsibility for courts and tribunals; court procedures; organisation, training and appointment of the legal profession, magistracy and judiciary; legal aid; legal services; and the Sentencing Council. That would leave the Home Office with policing, penal policy and the criminal law. Responsibility for the Sex Discrimination Act, the Equal Pay Act and the Equal Opportunities Commission would be given to the Women's Ministry. The concept of a minister having Cabinet rank — and therefore implicitly not being a member of the Cabinet proper — crops up again on environment. A ‘new Minister of Environmental Protection’ would operate inside the DoE. That could work — though it is easy to imagine conflicts of interest with the housing and planning functions of the department. More problematic will be Labour's plan for the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food. ‘The priority of MAFF must become food, not farming,’ the policy review says. ‘Its main concerns would become food and the people who consume it, not farming and those who produce it.’ But the regulatory functions over the food industry, now split between MAFF and the Department of Health, would transfer to a new Food Standards Agency. That is the first of many agencies, executives, commissions, and other quango-like bodies recommended by the review. In some cases Labour's quangos merge existing ones, or replace well-established bodies. The funding of higher education would become the responsibility of one body, rather than two. Labour's Quality Commission would replace the Audit Commission. But there would be new regulatory commissions and consumer councils for every utility, along with ombudsmen, and public interest commissioners appointed by the Secretary of State. There would be Skills UK — a locally structured training commission — a Fair Wages Commission, a Health Technology Commission, a Health Quality Commission, an Education Standards Council, an Independent Sentencing Council, a Children's Commissioner, an Environmental Protection Executive, and a Social Insurance Fund administered by…‘an independent commission’."
NWS NWS-A1M-002 8.8 "The busy sex life of the nice male: Chris Barnard explains why patting children on the head could help a man curry favour with their mother By CHRIS BARNARD I REMEMBER once seeing a small girl remove a tin of soup from halfway down a display stack in a supermarket. The predictable, and very satisfying, result attracted the attention of a nearby assistant, who strode towards the offending infant with an expression of undisguised anger on her face. Suddenly she caught sight of the child's mother. Immediately, her expression and pace of approach changed and instead of the lambasting, or worse, she had seemed about to deliver, she gave the child a tolerant smile and began to pick up the scattered cans. Most of us have experienced similar examples of such ‘audience effects’ on behaviour: playing a game to perfection (or otherwise) when the team selector is present, for instance. What you do depends very much on who might be watching, often with good reason. Prudently taking cognisance of onlookers also turns out to be important in the social behaviour of other primates. Frans de Waal, in his book Chimpanzee Politics, relates a number of instances among groups of captive chimps. One of the most striking concerned a male called Yeroen which was hurt in a fight with another male, Nikkie. For nearly a week after the injury, whenever he was in Nikkie's field of view, Yeroen would hobble pitifully, generating an air of pain and dejection. As soon as he moved out of Nikkie's view, however, his demeanour changed and he walked normally without discomfort. What Yeroen hoped to gain by his play-acting is not clear, though it may have helped to defuse further aggression. What is clear is that his behaviour was geared to the available audience. Some recent work on green vervet monkeys shows that audience effects can be important in other contexts in which their functional significance is a little easier to identify. Anne Keddy Hector, Robert Seyfarth and Michael Raleigh at the Universities of California and Pennsylvania have been studying parental behaviour among captive vervets to see if males' parental ability affected the females' choice of mate. Their argument was that a male's potential quality as a parent might be important because, in many species of Old World monkeys, males form strong protective relationships with females and their young, which are crucial in reducing the amount of harassment and competition the young suffer from other members of the group. In a number of species, bonds between males and infants within a group may influence the chances of males mating with certain females. In baboons and Japanese macaques mothers resuming their sexual cycle are more likely to mate with males who have formed a relationship with their offspring. Demonstrating parental behaviour towards infants may be a ruse by which low-ranking males are able to gain mating opportunities. If this is true, then males should respond differently towards an infant depending on whether or not its mother is arou.d to be impressed. Keddy Hector, Seyfarth and Raleigh tested this in an ingenious experiment. They looked at the behaviour of a male and infant under one of three conditions. In one, the infant's mother was placed behind a clear screen so that the male and infant could see her and she could see them. In a second, the screen was replaced with a one-way mirror so that the mother could see the interacting pair but could not herself be seen. In the final condition, the mother was hidden behind a metal screen so that she could neither see nor be seen by the pair in the observation room. After half an hour in each case, the mother was released to join her infant and the accompanying male. The experiment revealed a complex interaction between male and female dominance rank and visibility of the mother in determining male responses to infants and female behaviour towards males. Males of all dominance classes (alpha, subordinate and newly introduced) were less aggressive towards infants when the mother was in sight. Alpha males were consistently friendlier than others towards male infants but were particularly nice if there was a chance that the infant was their own. Subordinate males, on the other hand, were friendlier towards the infants of high-ranking females, perhaps because their own rank might increase if they managed to associate themselves with such females. They were also friendlier towards female infants and those not fathered by the current alpha male. Newly introduced males were the least friendly to infants. If being nice to infants is a way of currying favour with females, the benefits ought to be discernible in the way males were treated once the observer females were let loose. This seemed to be the case. Overall, females were friendliest and least aggressive towards alpha males, regardless of their treatment of infants. Since females reap substantial protective benefits from associating with alpha males, this is perhaps not surprising. When it came to subordinate males, however, there was a strong relationship between how nice males had been to infants and how likely they were to be attacked by the female: nicer males fared better. In the one-way mirror treatment, when males were unaware they were being watched, they were more aggressive towards infants than in the clear screen treatment and as a result they received a drubbing from the female. The experiment thus suggests that while alpha males can trade on their superior competitive ability to obtain mates, subordinates may have to wheedle their way into favour. Judiciously patting junior on the head when mum is watching may be a useful way of doing it. Dr Chris Barnard works in the Department of Zoology at Nottingham University."
NWS NWS-A1M-004 4.83 "Science and Technology Viewpoint: Checks for man-made genetic time bombs By TOM WILKIE PLUTONIUM, more than any other element in the periodic table, is capable of arousing strong public emotion, bordering at times on hysterical fear and loathing. Yet plutonium has been intensively studied, is well understood, and it decays away into harmlessness with a half-life of about 240,000 years. Consider instead, living creatures. They interact with the natural world in complex, ill-understood ways — ecology is the youngest science. Individuals may die, but plants, animals, and micro-organisms, are capable of reproducing and increasing their numbers. It is surprising therefore, that there has been so little public interest in this country in proposals to release into the environment living, man-made creatures. Genetic engineering has reached a point of such sophistication that there are clear benefits to be gained by releasing from the laboratory living organisms upon which have been conferred characteristics they could never have acquired through the normal processes of evolution or selective breeding. For example, it is possible to snip through the genes of the vaccinia viruses (one of which is the basis for the vaccine against smallpox) and stitch in some threads of DNA from the rabies virus. To the immune systems of the animals that it may infect, the resultant mutant virus will look as if it is rabies and so will trigger antibodies and generally stimulate immunity against the disease. But because the virus is ‘really’ vaccinia, the infected animal will suffer none of the ill-effects of rabies while becoming proof against infection by any ‘real’rabies virus. We stand to derive immense benefits from such releases of genetically engineered organisms into the environment — providing they do what we expect them to. But there is a risk. What if, by some unforeseen mischance, the vaccinia-rabies hybrid turned into an organism that actually spread rabies -a disease that has always been comparatively difficult to catch — with smallpox-like contagion? This scenario is unlikely in the extreme. But research over the past 40 years or so has revealed some great surprises in the natural world. Genes -for resistance to antibiotics, for example— can be swapped between micro-organisms of completely different species naturally, in the wild. There are almost certainly other surprises out there which, by definition, we cannot speak about today. We must try to ensure that, as a result of our own genetic manipulation, they do not turn out to be unpleasant surprises. So the civil servants in the Department of the Environment are to be congratulated. They have recognised that the laws to protect our environment need to be extended and revised to cope with the situation genetic engineering presents. They have, sensibly, realised that the benefits from proceeding with caution outweigh the risks and there is no case for banning the practice outright. They have recommended that anyone who intends to release a genetically manipulated organism into the environment should first seek consent of some ‘competent authority’ which must be satisfied that the proposed release is as safe as reasonably practicable. Release without consent will be a crime, regardless of the innocuousness or otherwise of the organism. So far, so good. But the civil servants have been vague when it comes to the detail of who is to be the competent authority, who is to foot the bill for its work (and any extra studies it may require before giving consent), and how much of its deliberations are to be made public. Moreover, it seems as if the Thatcherite revolution has still not penetrated the dark towers of Marsham Street. For there is no mention of how capitalism or the consumer can play their proper roles in determining the future of genetic engineering. This is a serious omission, redolent of the old habits of thought that if only the public will trust Whitehall, all will be well. One of the first commercial products to derive from this biotechnology is likely to be genetically engineered tomatoes. By manipulation of the tomato's genetic blueprint, scientists can alter the rate at which it ripens. This reduces the wastage due to damage in the journey from greenhouse to supermarket shelf. There is a dual benefit to the consumer: because there is less wastage, the genetically engineered tomatoes ought to be cheaper; and they ought to taste better too. Well then. Let the consumer make the choice. Let us make sure that the law to be put before Parliament this autumn requires genetically engineered products to be clearly labelled as such. All the submissions to the Government from the biotechnology industry have called for greater public information about genetic engineering, so no one can object to giving consumers the chance to make informed choices as they push their supermarket trolleys. It is also right that consumers should pay the full price of the advantages they will enjoy as a result of genetic engineering. The market has a mechanism for ensuring even that the potential risk of damage to the environment can be costed. It is called insurance. Before the ‘competent authority’ sanctions any release into the environment it should stipulate that the releaser has to take out an insurance policy that will cover it for any consequential damage to the environment and necessary clean-up operations. The cost of the premiums would, of course, be passed on to consumers in the price of the products. After all, I am not allowed to drive a motor car without having proved my ability to a ‘competent authority’— the driving test examiner. But once I have passed my test, I am not allowed out on the road without insurance. If such stipulations are made for so mundane a practice as motoring, they would seem to be reasonable precautions for protecting our environment for the rest of time from possible damage by man-made creatures."
NWS NWS-A1M-005 4.56 "How hot summers brought us stripped pines: Scientists now believe a dramatic loss of conifer needles which struck West German forests may have been caused by the weather, rather than pollution. Martyn Kelly reports By MARTYN KELLY IN THE mid-1980s press stories about coniferous trees in German forests losing their needles were at their peak. Half a decade on, global warming has become the biggest environment story. However, the cause of tree blight has remained the subject of intense speculation, being variously attributed to ‘acid rain', ozone, a mystery disease, or any combination of these. But now scientists believe the root cause of Germany's problems could simply be drier weather, albeit aggravated by acid deposition and by the growing tendency for forests, like farmland, to be planted as monocultures. In German forests, there was a consistent pattern of damage to Norway spruce, the main species affected, beginning with a yellowing of the upper surface of older needles and progressing to the death of the needle and a marked thinning of the crown of the tree as dead needles dropped off. The colour change from green to yellow suggested that the key may lie in chlorophyll, the compound responsible for photosynthesis. They followed this up to show that affected leaves had lower concentrations of magnesium, an important part of the chlorophyll molecule. The disease theory was discounted early on by Reinhart Huttl of the University of Freiburg, who grafted affected shoots on to otherwise healthy trees. The mystery virus, it was thought, would spread into the healthy tree, causing that too to become diseased. In fact, the opposite was the case; the grafts became green. If disease was not responsible, then perhaps the answer lay with a physical cause such as air pollution. There were two contenders for this: acid deposition (in all its various forms) and ozone. Bernard Ulrich and colleagues at the University of Gottingen had proposed that deposition of sulphur and nitrogen compounds (originating from industrial activity and power generation) led to the release of aluminium from minerals in the soil. This, in turn, was toxic to the tree roots responsible for uptake of nutrients such as magnesium. Meanwhile, in laboratories in Essen, Bernard Prinz was suggesting that forest decline was caused by damage to foliage by ozone, another gas produced as a by-product of industry. However, Siegfried Fink, a colleague of Huttl at Freiburg, found that needles exhibiting the symptoms of forest decline showed changes initially in the vascular cells of needles, which transport nutrients from the roots. From here, damage spread to the cells responsible for photosynthesis. A needle exposed to gaseous pollutants such as ozone, on the other hand, showed signs of damage first in the more exposed photosynthetic cells and only later in the better-protected vascular tissues. Scientists working for Britain's Central Electricity Generating Board also found flaws in the experimental techniques used by Prinz and his colleagues. The Germans used a machine which converted oxygen in air into the ozone which they used for their experiments. However, Drs Keith Brown and Mike Roberts found that nitric acid was produced from atmospheric nitrogen at the same time and that this was responsible for most of the damage. When they repeated their experiment with ozone produced from pure oxygen they found very little effect. Mike Roberts and colleagues at the CEGB's research laboratories now think that air pollution plays only a minor role after all (Forestry, vol 62, pp 179-222). They agree that yellowing needles are caused by magnesium deficiency. However, they are not convinced that the primary cause of this is toxic concentrations of aluminium released into the soil as acidity increased. Instead they see low concentrations of magnesium as a natural phenomenon exacerbated by air pollution. The prime cause, they believe, was a succession of dry summers in the mid-1970s. Drought resulted in decreased root growth and slower breakdown of soil litter, an important source of magnesium for forest trees. A further factor complicating the story is the trend towards monoculture of timber trees such as spruce. This increases soil acidity, and encourages trees to form shallow roots, which are less efficient and more prone to the effects of drought. It was a slowing down of the spread of forest decline in the late 1980s that first pointed the CEGB scientists towards climate as the cause. In 1984, foresters found that 20 per cent of the Norway spruce in West Germany's forests had lost more than a quarter of their needles. By 1988 this had dropped to about 15 per cent of spruce, and other species such as pine and fir showed similar improvements. In other words, the symptoms were at their worst during the hot, dry summers of the early Eighties and started to improve in subsequent wet summers. It is, cynics might say, exactly the conclusion one would expect from scientists in the pay of the CEGB. However, Mike Roberts, now director of the Natural Environment Research Council's Institute of Terrestrial Ecology (South), is quick to point out that acid deposition does exacerbate the problem, in particular by washing magnesium from an already nutrient-poor soil. Deposition of nitric acid in particular may contribute to the equation as a fertiliser as well as a pollutant per se. This is because the increased supply of nitrogen may encourage tree growth at a faster rate than the amount of magnesium in the soil can support. The mechanism which Roberts proposes might be expected to work anywhere that spruce is grown. However, forest decline was far more extensive in Germany and continental Europe than, for example, in Britain and Norway. This he attributes to our oceanic climate. Proximity to the Atlantic means rainfall in Britain contains quite a lot of dissolved salts from the sea. So although the wet climate in the west of Britain causes more magnesium to be washed from the soil than in Germany, this amount is far less than that added to the soil each year from rainfall. The conundrums surrounding forest decline were many. Why was it so regional in character? Why did pollution-sensitive lichens survive on affected trees? Demonstrating climate to be the primary cause clears up many such problems. At the same time, it gives foresters and the power industry a much clearer picture of how their activities are affecting the trees. Ironically, Mike Roberts is one person who welcomed the drought earlier this summer. The extra stress that it will have caused to forest trees in Britain and the continent will provide one of the first tests of his new ideas."
NWS NWS-A36-006 4.61 "BOOK REVIEW /Sisson: poet and commuter analyst: C J Fox welcomes the scorn and vigour shown by the memoirs of C H Sisson: ‘On the Look-Out’— C H Sisson: Carcanet, 14.95 pounds By C J FOX C H SISSON — poet, translator, novelist, critic, polemicist, former Whitehall mandarin and the candidate who should have won Oxford's Chair of Poetry — has finally unveiled his life's story, most of it told, with typical unconventionality, backwards. It begins in 1964 and works back to the author's birth. ‘If anything can be concluded from this book, it is that I was born,’ writes Sisson after touching on that event, which occurred 75 years ago in a building since occupied by the Bristol Rovers Supporters Club. The author notwithstanding, many conclusions can be drawn from this steel-trap of a book; about Berlin in Thirties turmoil, for example, as observed by a keen-eyed young loner from Bristol. Certainly it can be concluded that the circumstances of Sisson's early life fuelled his salutary hatreds and helped form the outsider's perspective which now makes him a scourge of the age's insidious orthodoxies. So it's with added comprehension that a reader of On the Look-Out can approach the taut ferocity of Sisson's early poems and the sombreness of those more recent, the jarring plainness of his Divine Comedy and other such translations, the savagery of his two gaunt novels, and the war against fashion-induced mediocrity waged by Sisson the literary critic. More comprehensible too are his Seventies revolt (fatal to his Whitehall career) against the trendy refurbishment of the Civil Service and his scorn for Official Culture and for further dilution of the Anglicanism he cherishes. Sisson's background, as now revealed, was the stark world of an artisan family stuck in down-at-heel Bristol. ‘The whole country was hostile…its shabbiness I took for granted,’ Sisson recalls about his school-age surroundings. ‘I must have gone to and fro in great concentration of spirit, always anxious to get on.’ The ‘concentration of the spirit’ enabled this solitary youth to achieve a prodigious amount of literary self-education. He thus arrived at his city's University in the Depression, well primed for encounters there with the suspect notions of Eliot, Pound and T E Hulme. But Bristol wasn't Oxbridge, which compounded his sense of alienation from the left-wingery of those high-flying Young Gentlemen, Auden, Spender & Co. Still, Sisson managed a ‘Herr Issyvoo’ sting of his own in the Nazified Berlin of 1934 and watched ideological street-squads slanging one another in Paris the next year. The German sights in particular— torchlit orgies of Nazi triumph, Hitler ranting in Stuttgart, storm-troopers stamping out the last flickers of academic freedom in Freiburg — showed him what lay in store for Europe and are vividly recounted here. Though he took his professional plunge into the Ministry of Labour soon afterwards, Sisson also began writing, taking the outsider's route by contributing to obscure journals of the heterodoxy. His subsequent Wartime lot was equally offbeat though hardly agreeable, contending against boredom and filth along the northern marches of India. Re-immersion in the Ministry followed this prolonged servility, but a breakthrough came with the Fifties publication of An Asiatic Romance, a satirical fantasy explosively pointing up bureaucracy's absurdity and irrelevance in a world reduced to violence and cannibalism. By 1960, Sisson was a top Civil Servant ('civil to everyone, and servant to the devil') and had published a treatise called The Spirit of British Administration, memorable for its irony as well as its broad view of the subject. (Of Pontius Pilate: ‘The steps he took to still a particular local clamour were more or less what the service required, and he washed his hands with a civilised regret.’) The collections of his poetry began to appear, notably a searing logbook of life as a commuting careerist, The London Zoo. The floodgates were now open and it is from here that the reverse sequence of On the Look-Out commences. This ‘partial autobiography’ bristles satirically. Manchester, for instance, is deemed ‘one of those disgraces by which the human race advertises the squalor and turpitude of its mind.’ Of parish-pump politics in his old suburban nesting place, Sevenoaks: ‘While everyone would pretend that a solution was what was wanted when there was a problem, in fact what most people wanted was trouble… The fatal addiction of the human race to trouble is something which, even at 50, has not ceased to amaze me.’ The technique of reverse narrative is nothing new for Sisson. His novel, Christopher Homm, took its forlorn hero from septuagenarian death back to his doom-shrouded entry into life. On the Look-Out derives extra momentum from this eccentric procedure. But Sisson, in addition to bringing his story up to date with a final chapter, interjects halfway through a lengthy segment on his war. With its subject-matter mainly the crushing ennui of that experience, this section hampers the flow of the overall narrative somewhat, despite the crispness of its recollections. Much more telling as a crystallization of the Wartime ordeal is ‘In the Raj’, included in that lynchpin volume of Carcanet's big Sisson list, the 1984 Collected Poems. But as if to prove his powers of condensation in the autobiography, Sisson exercises remarkable reticence on matters of personal and family sentiment. Yet throughout he brandishes a fearless and confident individuality of judgement. There is exhilaration to be had from his fresh vistas, vigorous assertions as they are of a truly independent mind."
NWS NWS-A4D-001 4.44 "On the horns of the Bull Ring dilemma: The people of Birmingham should be allowed to vote on the future development of their city, Jonathan Glancey believes By JONATHAN GLANCEY BIRMINGHAM'S infamous and exhausted retail hub, the Bull Ring, just 25 years old, has been placed on architecture's death row. There will be no stay of execution and few mourners for this spoiled concrete child of the Sixties. Old before its time, the Bull Ring has been accused of the systematic rape of the second city. It also stands accused of murdering the much-loved area around the old Bull Ring market that had grown up in piecemeal fashion over the 800 years since Birmingham was granted a market charter in 1150. This had survived the worst the Luftwaffe could do, but was no match for ‘comprehensive redevelopment’. The Bull Ring, completed by Laing Developments in 1964, rammed together four levels of shopping, a market hall, a multi-storey car park, an office block, a bus station and a banqueting suite all in one vast complex. Snaking between its constituent parts was the controversial and overwhelming city ring road designed by the successive and all-powerful city engineers, Herbert Manzoni and Neville Borg. The most militant fan of Sixties architecture would be hard pressed to support a last-minute appeal for the Bull Ring, although crocodile tears will be shed over the probable demolition of the Rotunda, a monumental steel and glass phallus, that, in the absence of a sky-piercing cathedral, acts as the city's one instantly recognisable focal point. But what is going to replace the Bull Ring? Given the stupendous costs involved, should the city be looking to powerful private developers working with big firms of commercial architects to take the lead and replace like with like, albeit in a more acceptable architectural garb? Or should development be given over to a broad church of interest groups and realised by a catholic mix of architects working in a number of complementary styles? The debate in Birmingham has reached something like fever pitch, now that the city council is faced with two rival development schemes. On the one side is the developer, London & Edinburgh Trust (LET) and its architects, Chapman Taylor Partners. On the other is the pressure group, Birmingham for People, championed by local architect Joe Holyoak. LET is in a strong position. It has owned the leasehold of the Bull Ring and surrounding sites since 1985. As LET's partner in charge of the Bull Ring project, John Newman, says: ‘We don't have to develop the Bull Ring. We could just sit back and collect rents from an ever-decreasing number of tenants. Instead, we're willing to take the risk and give Birmingham the retail centre it deserves and needs if it is not to be completely undermined by rival out-of-town attractions.’ The LET scheme is, in outline at least, straightforward. It envisages replacing the Bull Ring development with a vast new shopping complex, almost free from the graffiti-sprayed subways that have characterised central Birmingham since the mid-Sixties. Shoppers approaching what LET have named The Galleries from New Street and High Street will be channeled along a brand new street flanked by granite and stone-clad pseudo-Classical shops and offices, entering the new mall under a vast glazed dome, second in diameter only to that of St Paul's Cathedral. From this generous lobby, looked down on by diners perched high in the dome's galleries, shoppers will be able to pass either directly down to the open-air market in the shadow of old St Martin's church, explore the curving three-storey shopping halls or snack in a galaxy of glitzy cafes. The attractions of LET's scheme are easy for city councillors to appreciate. The Galleries will act as a one million sq ft magnet to six million shoppers, not just from Birmingham, but from the entire West Midlands conurbation and beyond. Birmingham is well served by public transport, while its frequently denigrated ring road system allows traffic to flow at a remarkably fast pace (17.5mph in rush hours compared to central London's 9 or 10mph). Parking for 3,500 cars, either underground or else in a well disguised Post-Modern palazzo, will encourage shoppers to steer away from rival retail developments in surrounding Solihull, Leamington Spa and Kidderminster, along with the out-of-town Sandwell Mall and Merry Hill Centre. The Galleries will bridge the snarling ring road, which will be buried in decorous tunnels. Rodney Karen, the affable architect in charge of the design of The Galleries, guarantees that they will have a truly urban character. This will not be theme park shopping, Karen insists, nor will The Galleries be closed at night. They will form a integral part of the city, opening up new pedestrian routes, while upgrading existing ones. But Joe Holyoak and the Birmingham for People group believe The Galleries will simply repeat the mistakes made in the early Sixties, but on an even bigger scale. Holyoak's attack, published in a recent issue of The Architects' Journal, is based on two premises. First he takes the city council to task for presenting the LET scheme as a fait accompli, criticising it for ‘accepting without question LET's objective of redevelopment in the form of 500-metre-long, inward-looking building’. Holyoak gleefully points out that architect Tony Ridell, of Chapman Taylor Partners, has, rather unfortunately, described The Galleries as ‘a huge aircraft carrier settled on the streetscape of the city’. Second, Holyoak attacks the monumentality of The Galleries which, in his words ‘is the latest in the big developers’ move to privatise city centres — to eat up public space and reshape it as internalised, homogenised, security-patrolled private space'. Instead, Holyoak proposes a People's Plan for the Bull Ring. This consists of a return to traditional principles of town planning, of conventional streets, markets and shops. The People's Plan includes houses, which the LET scheme expressly discounts. ‘A healthy city,’ says Holyoak, ‘needs a diversity of uses as well as diversity of design.’ But, more than that, the People's Plan is an attempt to allow for incremental growth and change. ‘Its development,’ says Holyoak, ‘would not necessitate the great cataclysm of demolition; the plan is designed so that parts of it can be built independently in phases.’ Holyoak has another trump card up his sleeve. ‘The removal of through traffic, pedestrianisation, new public spaces, new mixed uses, living in the city, environmental quality, removal of subways: all these aspects of the Peoples’ Plan are city council policies contained in the City Centre Strategy published in 1987.’ Holyoak believes that the council has been bamboozled into adopting LET's monolithic scheme which has had outline planning permission for the last year. ‘If,’ he says, ‘the city council grants full planning permission for The Galleries in the next few weeks, it will not simply be shooting itself in the foot but blowing off its entire leg.’ John Newman of LET is unrepentant. ‘Holyoak talks about building houses in the centre of Birmingham. But who wants to live there? Would you? I think he's lost in a Victorian vision of Britain.’ But what about using a variety of architects and splitting the scheme into a number of smaller related parts? Newman explains that LET works with big practices of commercial architects because time and time again they come up with the goods, on budget, on time and with none of the tantrums of the prima donna. LET's experience of working with ‘name’ architects has not been very fruitful. ‘Chapman Taylor on the other hand,’ says Newman, ‘understand exactly what the retailer wants.’ Chapman Taylor architect Rodney Karen thinks Holyoak's scheme is a case of ‘fiddling while Rome burns’. He warns: ‘Birmingham has to compete with outlying attractions. At the moment all the centre offers is anxiety. I see The Galleries as a focal point, a powerful force aiding the city, a proper part of the centre designed to enhance its life and character.’ But what sort of character? Whether Birmingham city council should push ahead with the LET scheme or stop to consider Holyoak's counterblast must turn on what sort of centre the city wants. Does Birmingham want a centre where people live and work, or a shopping complex that draws in people who live and sleep at the end of the bus routes? Do they want to plan for organic change or reap the fruit of a retail giant that might, no matter what the quality of the architecture, be redundant in another 25 years? It is difficult not to sympathise with the People for Birmingham's scheme. It might be quixotic, it might be full of contradictions and loopholes (how will the traffic flow if the ring road is downgraded as Holyoak plans? why save the Rotunda, when trying to recreate a traditional city centre?), but it does recognise that a city centre works best when it is the sum of a number of interrelated parts. The people of Birmingham ought to be allowed to vote on this all-important issue. Are they, and do they want to be, urbanites or suburbanites? Both Joe Holyoak and his rivals really ought to know."
NWS NWS-AA3-001 5.31 "Another disturbing chapter in the history of the DTI Notebook. By Alex Brummer THERE will be those who portray the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration on the Barlow Clowes Affair as a triumph for the British system of financial regulation. Yes, of course, they will say, there is clear evidence that the Department of Trade and Industry fouled up badly — maladministration as the Ombudsman likes to call it. But what is really important, it will be argued, is that the system triumphed. As a result of the Ombudsman's vigorous and admirably speedy deliberations, the hapless 18,000 investors who put their faith in the DTI imprimatur will be fully compensated and the integrity of the UK's investment apparatus has been preserved. Moreover, if there was maladministration it is of little consequence now in that the new regime established by the Financial Services Act of 1986 has rendered the DTI's role in this matter redundant. Such muddled thinking partly explains the complacency of the Corporate and Consumer Affairs Minister, Mr John Redwood, who accepted the findings ‘without prejudice.’ This cool response almost certainly reflects legal caution, but also a bland faith in the regulatory system. Even before the report went to the printers, the Ombudsman, Sir Anthony Barrawclough, was told by the DTI's most senior officer that it intended to give its own view, in a separate document, on the responsibilities of regulators. This is the kind of self-righteous behaviour at which Mrs Thatcher's Government excels. The DTI's record in regulatory matters is not an honourable one. Few drivers who bought car insurance policies from Dr Emil Savundra's Fire Auto & Marine in the mid-1960s will forget the culpability of then Board of Trade. Nor will those investors and depositors who in the mid-1970s found themselves caught in a hurricane sweeping throught the secondary banking system after the collapse of Gerald Caplan's London and County Securities. Suffice it to say that the DTI was the supervising authority for such fringe banks. More recently its inconsistent behaviour over the publication of DTI reports into important City scandals has also raised questions of judgment, undue political influence and its due care to the public interest. Tiny Rowland may have become a bore with his obsession over DTI's failure to publish the report on the House of Fraser — but on this occasion he is on the side of the Gods. There can be no sense in the DTI's refusal to publish the House of Fraser report on the grounds that it might prejudice a Serious Fraud Office inquiry when it took the opposite course over Blue Arrow. And while one is busy throwing the rotten eggs, who can forget the duplicity of the DTI over the disposal of Rover to British Aerospace. It would be nice to write that despite these lapses of judgment, not to mention the occasional maladministration, investors and other stakeholders in business do not have to worry because of the safety superstructure which has been built since. But there is little in the current regulatory structure which is designed to inspire the confidence of investors. Indeed, even if supervision of Barlow Clowes had passed seamlessly from the DTI to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (FIMBRA) there can be no guarantee the warning signs at Barlow Clowes, from intermingled funds to accounting inconsistencies, would have been unearthed. With its unwieldly band of almost 8,200 members FIMBRA is an organisation in serious distress. It is engaged in internecine warfare over the general provision of indemnity insurance for investors. But this dispute, which has seen FIMBRA's Lord Elton off the field, is evidence of systemic problem. The organisation, concerned with financial probity, is continuously in debt because its members refuse to pay the bill for self-regulation. Moreover, its attempts to weed out the next Barlow Clowes are not considered impressive. When suspending members for alleged wrongdoing it tends to act in the dark of night, refusing generally to explain its actions. FIMBRA's incontinence is evidence of a system of self-regulation under stress. With the populous FIMBRA offshoot of the Securities & Investment Board (SIB) bucking against the post-Financial Services Act regime, the whole concept of self-regulatory organisations is brought into question. The Stock Exchange, for instance, has been remarkably successful in doing its own policing — witness the quick action taken in the case of the alleged share ramp at Williams Holdings. But in contrast, the DTI has not been notably successful in bringing prosecutions against insiders based on the dossiers provided — as the Geoffrey Collier case demonstrates. Even the SIB itself appears to be having self-doubts about the unwieldly monster it has created, particularly at a time when the City's self-regulation will have to be grafted on a more legalistic European Community framework. The most interesting observations by the Ombudsman in the Barlow Clowes report concern the DTI's vision of regulation. It points out that the licensing functions were lowly regarded and observes that protection of investors by definition requires a ‘rigorous and inquiring approach’. Such comments about the DTI's effectiveness as a corporate policeman could have been made almost at any time over the last 30 years and in a multitude of cases. Similarly, successive attempts by the City to regulate itself have, as in the case of FIMBRA, ended in disappointment. It is easy to forget, for instance, that the Bank of England is still nursing along the remains of that 1970s darling, Slater-Walker. Financial shenanigans clearly will not be eliminated by new, even tougher legislation to protect investors. There is more than enough statutory law around. What is needed are effective regulators and that is the common thread which runs from John Bloom and Bernie Cornfeld to Peter Clowes and Guinness. Investors deserve a stronger, simpler and more tenacious system of enforcement than self-regulation can provide. It is up to government to finance and provide it — but as far from the DTI as possible."
NWS NWS-CFC-175 4.22 "Hell on earth for war rape victims Captive forced by attackers to lick her own blood EVIDENCE is emerging that thousands of women have been systematically and brutally raped in the conflict in former Yugoslavia. CHARLOTTE ADCOCK spoke to a woman who has interviewed some of the victims. (Readers may find parts of this account upsetting) R ape in warfare has often been overlooked. Widely considered a routine, if regrettable, fact of war, it has rarely been prosecuted. Reports on the armed conflict in the former Yugoslavia, however, suggest not only that rape and the sexual abuse of women have been carried out on a massive scale, but that it has been systematic and organised. Evidence is now emerging that women have been detained in order to be raped and even impregnated, and that political and military leaders knew, but condoned it.One woman who can testify to the existence of rape camps and the suffering of women, is Francoise Hampson, senior lecturer at Essex University and an expert in the law of armed conflict. She has just returned from interviewing rape victims in Bosnia during a nine-day mission led by the International League of Human Rights.While European Community officials estimate 20,000 women have been raped, Francoise Hampson says quantification is impossible. ‘The only value in the figures is the indication of the scale and an adjective would be better. The word I would pick is ‘widespread’.’ Human rights organisations remain wary of publishing figures because they have been widely used as propaganda. Amnesty International has, however, released details of individual accounts to ‘illustrate at least part of what has occurred’. The accounts include those of Moslems from Kljuc. One mother described how her daughter was locked up and she was raped by three drunk, uniformed men whom she knew. Another woman in her mid-sixties said she had been one of eight raped by ‘Serbian irregulars’. ‘Three of them raped her, one first forced his hand into her at knifepoint and then made her lick her own blood. Two of the women had their throats slit after the rapes,’ the report states.Victims have been assaulted in different situations, said Ms Hampson. Women have been randomly raped by individuals, gang-raped by uniformed men, and raped in detention centres either by the guards or people let in by the guards. There has also been a high incidence of murder following rape.Allegations have to be handled with care, but there is clear evidence that rape camps have been set up. ‘I interviewed someone from a rape camp in Doboj. It was unequivocally a place where women were held in order to be raped,’ she said.Observers have also identified a specific category of women raped in order to be made pregnant. Rape has happened on all sides and across the sexes, but according to Ms Hampson ‘the overwhelming majority of the rape victims are non-Serbs’. Several factors have made the abuse particularly cruel and degrading. ‘The fact that it's so systematic, going effectively unpunished and often performed by people known to the victims makes it more horrific. It's been made even more humiliating by the circumstances in which it's been done like public rape. ‘In no case where we interviewed had the woman only been raped by one man. Plenty of them had only been raped over one period of 24 hours but never less than by six or seven men. Two women passed out when raped by number three so they don't know.’ The effect on women, in a Moslem culture which perhaps considers rape more dishonourable than murder, has been profound. Victims have been openly accused by their husbands of being ‘Chetnik whores’. Some have been abandoned by their families and others forced to leave. ‘There isn't even guaranteed support from other women because it's seen as so shameful. Some haven't told their mothers. They believe they know and look at them differently, and it's avoided as a topic of conversation.’ Resources are scarce, medical treatment limited and abortions not always available. Many victims are also having to come to terms with the trauma while looking after children and the elderly in overcrowded refugee camps.Whether rape has been singled out by military commanders as a weapon of war remains open to question, but victims' testimony suggests the abuse is part of a wider pattern of warfare and ‘ethnic cleansing’. Ms Hampson believes the abuse is more than an incidental or sexual act. It is clearly being used as an instrument to achieve a military purpose. ‘People aren't raping for rape's sake. In some instances where villages are being ‘cleansed’, rape is being used to terrorize and humiliate communities.’ There is evidence that rape, regarded as good for morale, increased after a military setback and that peer group pressure is strong. ‘Clearly the authorities know the rape camps are there and what they're being used for. A lot of people who haven't previously raped must be going around raping.’ She admits in the final analysis she finds it difficult to make sense of the ‘gratuitous savagery’. ‘I'm left with extremely uncomfortable questions about what makes men tick and I don't see any reason to believe that men in the former Yugoslavia are different from men elsewhere. ‘That doesn't mean I think all men are rapists but…it means a significant proportion of the men around us in that situation of social breakdown would rape and I can't even begin to digest that notion.’ What she is clear about is that rape is a war crime and ought to be prosecuted. Rape clearly contravenes international law and she cites the 1907 Hague Conventions, the '49 Geneva Conventions and the '77 Protocols to make her point. It is not new laws that are required but enforcement of existing ones, she says.The International League is now calling for effective individual accountability for serious violations of the law and the creation of a war crimes tribunal. ‘Reconciliation requires a coming to terms with the past not its burial or denial,’ it states."
NWS NWS-K5C-072 5.4 "Twisted trails of blame David Ott examines the UN's tortuous route to secure the prosecution of those committing atrocities in war-torn Bosnia ADVOCATES of the rule of law in international affairs must welcome the decision of the UN Security Council to consider establishing a war crimes tribunal in the former Yugoslavia. But if this is to prove more than gesture politics, a number of challenges must be faced. Some of these are obvious. How will prospective defendants be caught? Will people be prosecuted when their co-operation is needed to implement an eventual peace agreement? On the other hand, can peace really be allowed to depend on the goodwill of people who have already shown their contempt for even basic considerations of humanity? And what chance will peace have if the enraged victims see the criminals escaping scot-free with the spoils of their crimes? None of these problems should be minimised. But even if they are overcome, other more fundamental difficulties will remain. The first of these is crucial: will the prosecution and punishment of Yugoslav war criminals be fair? Predictably, the leader of the Bosnian Serbs, Dr Radovan Karadzic, has already cried foul on the ground that war crimes in other parts of the world go unpunished. Though not without merit, this argument is weaker here than it might be elsewhere, since the UN plan appears designed to punish all war criminals in the former Yugoslavia rather than to impose international law on one party only. It will not be a case of ‘victor's justice’. But problems remain in connection with the scope of the tribunal's remit. The UN Security Council resolution 808 concentrates on ‘violations of international humanitarian law.’ That is much narrower than the jurisdiction given to the Nuremberg tribunal after the Second World War, which was allowed also to consider crimes against peace and crimes against humanity such as planning and waging of aggressive war and genocide. If the Security Council excludes from the new tribunal's jurisdiction such larger crimes, which are perhaps more likely to be committed by higher state officials, the resulting trials may end up dealing only with the small fry while the big fish get away. This in turn impinges on the problem of deterrents, a point which the French authors of resolution 808 were keen to emphasise. A war crimes prosecution in which high-ranking commanders and political leaders were likely to escape justice would hardly deter people in such positions from continuing their outrages and it could encourage them to press their sometimes morally debased followers to obey orders regardless of their illegality. The plan's success as a deterrent depends as well on how vigorously the UN will back it up with action. The UN must now put its money where its mouth is. Otherwise, raising the issue in the first place could in the end prove counter-productive: if an international war crimes tribunal is clearly revealed to have no teeth, potential offenders may be emboldened to do whatever they like. Punishment of convicted war criminals is also problematic. The Security Council has wisely ruled out the death penalty, however much it might seem justified as retribution. This leaves the problem of where and under what conditions prisoners would serve their sentences. Would those convicted have to be held in the national prisons of UN members? This could expose willing states to charges of being unduly harsh or lenient in their treatment of prisoners and open to acts of reprisal or terrorism from sympathisers of those imprisoned. SOME of these difficulties might be avoided if the United Nations would broaden its approach to consider the possibility of punishing what are now called international crimes. A relatively new concept in international law, this involves the guilt not merely of the rulers and agents of a state but of the state itself. Although proposed by the UN's International Law Commission, the idea has been widely criticised as legally unsound and practically unworkable. But it does have the advantage of operating on a level where guilt or innocence might be easier to establish and where punishment could be imposed on a state basis. Thus if Serbia were convicted of aggression or ethnic cleansing, its punishment might include enforced disarmament, the disgorging of illegally-seized territory, the payment of reparations, and the application of self-determination within its own borders. This would seem to be a more constructive approach than simply locking up individuals. It would also deal with the danger posed by ardent nationalists or super-patriots who might willingly run the risk of themselves being prosecuted for war crimes if they thought their state would gain some permanent benefit from their actions. If these problems can be overcome by the planners who are now setting to work under the direction of the UN Secretary-General, the Yugoslav war crimes tribunal could be an important step in strengthening international law."
