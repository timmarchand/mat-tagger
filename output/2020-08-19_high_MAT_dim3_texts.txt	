HOC HOC-AR 6.73 " During their existence the RUC had to deal with many accusations made against by the Nationalist and Republican communities in Northern Ireland and their supporters elsewhere. Now that the terrorists have got their demand to disband the RUC, the are still not content. I feel that this report is just an ongoing attempt to discredit what was, in my opinion, the most effective policing service in the world. I can only imagine how those RUC officers who were on duty in Omagh on the day of the bombing now feel by the accusations made in this report, after helping to lead the rescue operation and pick of the bodies of the victims that day. It frightens me to think how many more people would have slaughtered by terrorists over the years if it hadn't been for the bravery and efficiency of the RUC during this time. This report is a serious attempt to deflect where the real blame for the Omagh atrocity lies, and that is squarely on the shoulders of the so called 'Real' IRA and their associates in other Republican groups.      As a lawyer specialising in regulatory matters I am deeply disturbed at the Ombudsman's apparent failure to give those whom she wished to criticize adequate time to comment on the facts as she found them and on her conclusions.      Instead of Sinn Fein crowing on the sidelines about the alleged ineptitude of the RUC, perhaps they would assist its successor, or indeed the Garda in helping to bring convictions. The fact that Sinn Fein is on public record in ruling out any cooperation whatsoever makes, in my opinion, that party as complicit in the Omagh tragedy as the main perpetrators.      Surely such a damning report on the conduct of the RUC regarding these events should have been more thoroughly investigated than it appears to have been. It will also do nothing to ease the suffering of the victims of this atrocity. Please, let's not turn the blame on the RUC. It lies firmly at the feet of the murderous scum that planned and executed such an unforgivable act.      Attacks on the Chief Constable and his officers who fought bravely for thirty years against tyrants and murderers in the North show how insensitive and ignorant Mrs O'Loan is, not only to the families of Omagh but also to those individuals who fought in vain to preserve life on that horrific day.      Does anybody really think Omagh was the primary target for this Real IRA outrage? I doubt it, what political gain would there be? After all Omagh is a mainly Nationalist town. I can remember distinctly the day of the Omagh bomb. I was driving the sixteen miles from Dromore Co. Down to Lisburn, Co. Antrim, and was stopped by the security forces on no less than three occasions. There was a very high state of alert. Perhaps the target was changed at the last minute by the murderers due to the high security force presence.     This appears to those outside the divide in Northern Ireland, that Sinn Fein supporters are engaged in political point scoring. It looks biased and unfair. Put a neutral officer in charge and investigate all the circumstances. However if that investigation reveals that Ronnie Flanagan is not culpable, then Nuala O' Lone should be sacked for such blatant misrepresentation. If she is prepared to attack the Chief Constable then she has to be prepared to put her own job on the line. Only in Northern Ireland could the diversionary propaganda be put forward in such a way that suggests the RUC were somehow to blame for letting the bomb through. The Real IRA blew up 29 people, now it appears that they want to finish the job they intended, by causing as much damage as possible to the new PSNI.      As the Real IRA perceives its struggle with the UK as a war, can't we start treating it as such? If we did, known guilty parties could be tried under military law, rather than civilian law, which doesn't really take into consideration the severity of these people's crimes. The Real IRA benefits from waging war on a sleeping country that is obsessed with being politically correct and following civil law to the nth degree. Our government doesn't fight for the rights of the UK civilian because it is obsessed with bending over backwards to give these terrorists what they want.      All such reports should be preceded by information regarding the background of the person compiling the report, who was consulted, who was invited to give an opinion and who actually gave an opinion. This information is important owing to the effect a report of this nature can have on society      This looks like just the kind of news NI does not need. But at least ineptitude and incompetence are not as bad as cold blooded murder. Clearly a lot of work needs to be done in the police service, but I'll wait until the Police have had a chance to reply to the report.      I think the ombudsman's report needs to be thoroughly investigated, perhaps by an outside chief constable. However no matter what the report says one thing must be remembered. The RUC did not plant the Omagh bomb.      What is evident from the Ombudsman's report is not that the Omagh bombing could definitely have been prevented, but that the Chief Constable and special branch attempted to prevent both the Omagh Investigation team and the Ombudsman's investigators from gaining access to the information that special branch had. That the internal RUC Review of the investigation was also ignored is a damning indictment of the power special branch has within what is supposed to be a Police Service. The fact that the Ombudsman has been able to uncover all of these facts is a tribute to the thoroughness of her investigators and to the office she holds. Far from vindicating Sinn Fein's refusal to endorse the new structures the transparency that the Ombudsman has brought to the workings of the PSNI underlines the fact that we are already at a new beginning to Policing here.      Getting the bombers to justice is only part of it. What we need to do is see what lesson this sad and tragic incident has taught us and ensure that the lapses are not committed again. The public first expects prevention and secondly detection. Bringing the individuals involved in this dastardly act of terrorism to justice is not only a must but a duty on every police force.      THE RUC did not bomb Omagh. It wasn't Special Branch who devised the idea of planting a car bomb in a crowded town centre on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Nor was it Ronnie Flanagan who parked that car that day and gingerly pushed the door to and then walked off down the street past the women and the children, the elderly people and the babies, knowing full well that they and hundreds of other innocents like them were now in the most grievous mortal danger.      It's important to remember these things because in the midst of all the high emotion and anger expressed this week, it has seemed at times as if we lost sight of that one overriding fact - that it was the Real IRA who bombed Omagh. And while it may be difficult for the rest of us to imagine ourselves inside their minds to try to fathom how in God's name they could conceive and perpetrate such evil, it is all too easy to guess how they feel about the row over the ombudsman's report.      They and their counterparts in other republican and loyalist terrorist groups must be gloating and sniggering over every delicious moment of it - at that unlikely turnaround which now sees those who have saved so many lives being tainted with blame for the worst atrocity of the Troubles.      This week, without a trace of obvious irony, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which planted many a similar car bomb, was calling for an independent inquiry into the police actions over Omagh. It was a bit like the political representatives of the Taliban demanding a public inquiry into the NYPD's inability to prevent the al-Qaeda attack on the Twin Towers.      The relatives of Omagh deserve justice. But the police who lost over 300 officers in the fight against terrorism deserve fair play too. The bitterness and acrimony of the current row should not be allowed to obscure the fact that whatever the failings of the system, the police were trying to save lives - unlike the men who drove that car that day into Omagh.      You can imagine the outrage if someone was to reason that it was due to the ineptitude of the CIA etc that the attacks on the Twin Towers occurred. Surely we must never forget that it was the police themselves who were on the front line and that the information available to them was scant at best. It could equally be argued that if there had been more co-operation from the nationalist community maybe the bomb would not have occurred. However, the reality remains that the motivation for it was with the Real IRA - a group of cold evil inhumane killers who were hell-bent on murder.       No one can dispute the fact that the Real IRA are responsible for setting off the bomb and for murdering and maiming innocent people, they did an evil thing and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. What is also indisputable is that it is the responsibility of the police ombudsman to investigate the police response to the bombing in light of accusations of wrongdoing. She did her job and found that certain information was not given to the people who could have made a difference and possibly prevented loss of life. If she buried the report or never did the investigation then the same thing could happen again. Hopefully this will improve the ability of the officers in the Police Service to get the information they need to better do their jobs. "
HOC HOC-AX 7.37 " It is going to be up to the British and the European Union to help it succeed. There are no idealists in Washington right now. No-one, it appears, is interested in ""nation-building"". The EU has been trying to establish itself as a political/military force without US leadership. Here is a perfect opportunity. It will be harder to rebuild Afghanistan than it was to defeat the Taleban. There are many potential dangers. But there is also a tremendous potential to do good.      I congratulate Dr Abdullah and the younger breed of Afghan politicians for having the dignity and brevity to agree to a power sharing interim cabinet. I think Afghan politicians should from now on think twice before disagreeing with one another and always have the plight of the long suffering Afghans on their mind before walking out of a meeting.      This new government will succeed because the people of Afghanistan want it to succeed. Make no mistake, the Taleban are gone for good and there will be no return to violence for those people who have been linked to Taleban. Hamid Karazi and Dr Abdullah and others who are in this government are not puppets of the west but in fact they are patriots who fought the evil Taleban for years. My message as an Afghan to other so-called Muslim brothers and sisters who would rather see our people under the Taleban regime is simple - mind your own business and let us rebuild our shattered country. We don't need your help or your criticism. May God help and protect Afghanistan.      This agreement is for the newborn Afghanistan. Now if the Northern Alliance put down their weapons, I guarantee that we will be able to live in peace.      This interim government will be successful for sure, because it is well balanced. There is only one danger. Every time Pakistan has been involved in Afghan affairs, it has had a negative effect on the Afghan people. Pakistan should now learn to mind its own business. My best wishes and prayers for the innocent Afghan people.      If the government lasts for longer than four weeks after its de facto installation, I shall purchase a hat and eat it.      I think this is a starting point towards peace in Afghanistan. Let's not forget that this is an interim government. We cannot expect a perfect government by end of this month.     The interim government will only succeed when all the Afghan politicians and warlords put the interests of the country ahead of their own interests. The Afghan people appear to be highly supportive of the interim government. The only problem now will be the warlords. If this is solved then everything will clear up and the interim administration will lead Afghanistan for first time in more than 20 years into a new era of peace and hope.      For a country which has been so thoroughly traumatised by over 20 years of non-stop war, the leaders of Afghanistan and all players involved, need to focus on peace for the sake of the children and subsume their personal and ethnic ambitions.     Let us hope the current agreement lasts longer than the earlier ones. We have seen in the past that a government constructed according to the interests of foreign countries never works, particularly when the country concerned has witnessed a disastrous civil war and horrendous killings by some factions who are well represented in the current administration. The sight of Northern Alliance soldiers killing and torturing their Afghan brothers to appease the Americans and consolidate their political position in any future government will remain in the minds and hearts of many Afghans for generations to come.      The people of Afghanistan want peace and quiet. They just want to get along with their lives. The groups and tribes trying to gain power will make that difficult. I won't be surprised if in a few years another war happens over there again.      Like many people in the Muslim world I honestly believe Americans went into Afghanistan not to help build a peaceful nation but to avenge the events of 11 September, and as soon as they achieve their aim they will disappear. The only hope for Afghanistan is for other peace-loving countries including members of the EU to stay and help them build a peaceful nation with a well represented government.      I am very optimistic about the Bonn agreement but there is an urgent need for a peacekeeping force and United Nations administrative support mission, which supports the new interim administration financially and technically and prepares the ground for election. A United Nations mission does not just bring in a huge amount of money but also lots of international citizens from different cultures with different mentalities. It could definitely change the current Afghan culture, which is the culture of the gun, to a culture of democracy, development and freedom.      Your comments before we went ON AIR      Nothing succeeds like success. An interim government for six months is a step in the right direction. Splendid job and I must congratulate all involved particularly the diverging forces who saw more reason and accommodation than brute force in resolving their differences while pursuing their interests. It will allow the environment that has prevailed for the last 20 years to cool down a bit. Afghans are wise enough to sort out the mess with the cool heads of Jerga.      I am very pleased that the Taleban regime is over. I was however highly traumatised by the sight of Northern Alliance soldiers beating up captured members of the Taleban. What assurances can they give us that human rights and civil liberties will be fully respected under the new administration?      This is not the perfect solution but I think it is the first step in the right direction for the past 23 years. I hope they are going to re-establish some form of functioning government in Kabul and pave the way for free elections so all Afghans will have a voice in electing their own representatives and leaders.      I believe the real government and the real leaders who deserve to run Afghanistan are not included in this new western-constructed puppet government. The Afghan people deserve the right to be able to elect their own leaders.      It has a better chance of succeeding than the Camp David Accords.      The US coalition has tried to do for the Afghan people what they themselves have been too weak and disorganized to do - to get foreign malcontents out of power and to put Afghans back in power who actually care about the future of Afghanistan and its people rather than just themselves.      That is not an easy thing to attempt.      They'll do fine for a while - until the international community tires of this particular pawn and abandons them again. Then we all go back to square one until the next September 11th.      Let's all pray it works.      Here they are again, the doom-mongers and the nay-sayers who think anything that can't be resolved by next Wednesday will never be resolved. Afghanistan has taken the first crucial step towards peace and stability. There will be many more steps. It may take another thirty years before these things are fully achieved. There may be some backsliding. But the process has begun and, for now, that is what matters most.      As much as we all would like this agreement to work, we do have to look at the reality of it. Afghanistan is made up of different factions who all would want a equal say and power. Can you see all the different parties in the UK sharing power?      The US must pray that the Bonn agreement is workable, because it is its last hope for any sort of moral legitimacy in this war. The Americans have failed to show that Bin Laden is responsible, the civilian casualty figures are starting to look enormous, and the fact that American bombs have been and still are destroying food convoys, hospitals, refugees and killing allied fighters is unforgivable. It doesn't seem any more likely that they will succeed in their professed war aims now than two months ago, and the recent decision to back atrocities against Palestinians weakens their moral position further.      The puppet government will never last. Afghanistan has to be ruled from within and not by western-appointed powerless figureheads.      The landmark agreement at Bonn will hopefully prove to be a harbinger of the peace and security that has deserted Afghans for over two decades. Mr Karzai is humane, principled intellectual with a unifying capacity, enjoying the respect of the majority of Afghan public. Let's hope that the men and women around him play a supportive role they owe each other and the Afghan people. The notion of disarmament is akin to world peace - great idea but some would argue unrealistic. However with western money pouring in, a genuine and promising attempt could be made at this, the crux of the new council's attention as far as security is concerned.      A new interim government - so far so good. But Afghanistan is one of the world's most divided countries, and I don't see any agreement on who will control the different territories. If you don't do that you can welcome a new government and a new round of fighting.      The selection of just two women is a start but a token gesture. Women's role in Afghanistan will no doubt be to help traumatised and hungry families, providing support services, education and the means to financially support themselves. This is of paramount importance as it concerns all the people of this war torn country      This interim executive council will not be able to function, at least in the long run. Afghanistan is a tribal-based society headed by warlords. Any attempt to simplify the issues surrounding the country's socio-economic and political complexity will result in the total collapse of a council that has been built virtually overnight. When will western politicians learn that in order to eliminate problems that they have created, they must first ensure that they decommission all weapons in Afghanistan, apart from the military personnel. Disarmament is an inevitable component if there is to be any kind of stability in the country. It is an absolute prerequisite for the ratified peace deal to work.      I sincerely hope that there is a general election as soon as possible to ensure that the Afghan people's choice of government ends up in power, rather than a puppet government prodded into power by the all-powerful western nations.      If they uphold secularism, pluralism, women's and minorities' rights as well as democratic ideals with separation of religion from state, Afghanistan can become a paradise state. But the question is, will their neighbours let them do so?      No it cannot succeed and we shouldn't expect it to. Can we really expect that the government of a given country can be attacked and replaced with another government successfully simply because America and the UK prefer it that way? No, this is totally unjust, illegal by international law, and furthermore the people of Afghanistan will never accept it. We cannot expect any success from this motley crew of western-selected power seekers. I don't think that we can so easily divide and rule Afghanistan as we have done to other countries. Rather, I envisage a war without end.      Congratulations to all factions involved. I'm very optimistic about the results achieved at the Bonn meeting. Afghanistan is on its way to enjoying a new peaceful future. Let us all wish them the best of luck and let's take care of them and not repeat past mistakes. Afghanistan is now reborn.      The Bonn agreement will only succeed if the Taleban are effectively neutralised to prevent a resurgence of conflict on the level of terrorism that we are now seeing in Israel. All extremist factions of that type appear to operate in the same manner. They create terror to win over the terrorised, the way mobsters would extract protection money from their victims. The tragedy is that there is no better answer.      If the agreement doesn't succeed, will the USA provide the huge amount of aid needed for the displaced people and the country ruined by this latest war?      If our neighbours stop interfering in Afghanistan's internal affairs and the Americans and British keep their promise of not walking away from us this time, it will definitely succeed.      The talks in Bonn are very promising and every Afghan is looking forward to having peace in their country. It is now very important that a UN peacekeeping force moves into Afghanistan to maintain this peace.      I think there is a very good chance of the agreement succeeding seeing as all the groups have come together and agreed on a way forward. Compare this with the trouble in Israel where it is just tit for tat violence.      I feel that there is always the chance of good happening when you can persuade people to sit around a table and discuss things. However I am not sure whether the groups in Bonn are representative of the Afghan population by a long way. At the beginning of the conflict it was stated that the Pashtun's equalled over 65% of the population. Recent figures suggest 38%. Where did these people evaporate to? If the representation is unfair then civil war and/or ethnic cleansing by the minority rulers could ensue.      It will be very difficult to find an adequate solution with neighbouring countries trying to influence the talks for their own purposes. It is important that the people of Afghanistan find a common ground on which they can build their future.     Unfortunately, the Afghans have lived a violent life for many generations. Before the British in the 19th century, before the Soviet invasion and American involvement, they were already fighting and dying. There must be a complete change of heart in the Afghan people otherwise, the best of intentions in talks and negotiations will be for naught.      It is great that the parties sat down to agree on a new government for Afghanistan. What is needed now is the restoration of the rightful ruler King Mohammed Zahir Shah to his throne. The same thing happened in Cambodia in 1993 when King Norodom Sihanouk was restored triumphantly.      Unless something is done about the masses of weapons left in the country and the production of opium instead of wheat and other food crops, there will be a return to the anarchy of the past. There must be no aid money until those two problems are solved.     When will the vested powers think hard and positive towards Afghanistan? Why is it being used as a testing ground?      Although I have great faith in the almost boundless power of dialogue, these factions have been bickering almost constantly since 1989, when the Soviets left. I fear final resolution may not come during this round of talks.      No politician or the UN have even commented on the disarming of the factions. Slight disagreements may ignite the situation resulting once again, in the start of a civil war. Remember both Rabbani and Hekmatyar are ambitious and dangerous and will not allow power to slip away so easily. A demilitarized Kabul and disarming of the factions,with financial and humanitarian assistance tied to it as an incentive, is the way forward. This has to be discussed in Bonn if the process of reconciliation is to succeed.      I hope that the conference in Bonn will bring about an acceptable solution for everyone and that it will create a government or board which will represent interests of all the people. I think the West should bear in mind that Afghanistan is a different country with different traditions and with different ways and traditions and understanding of human rights, women question etc...      The new government will succeed because it is democratic and will give freedom to men and women equally.      First of all I congratulate Mr Hamid Karzai as leader of the interim government, and hope that he will bring peace and stability to Afghanistan. We are Afghans living in Norway and we support Mr Karzai now and in the future.      I don't think that it will work. Changes in this area are necessary but major changes are usually not accepted by the society as a whole because the people are afraid for the future.       This interim government will never work out because Pashtuns are not well represented. Without proper Pashtun representation, no government will be able to run the country effectively. "
HOC HOC-BQ 9.4 " I have been a teacher in inner city comprehensives for ten years and wanted Labour to shake up education and address the real issues of pay and pupil discipline. I have now lost faith in the system and will be sending my child to an independent school, like most politicians do.      Our schools don't need more 'freedom' or 'flexibility'; they need more staff and resources!      My wife is a schoolteacher. Before introducing 'innovations', schools first need some obvious basic measures to be carried out. These are: to pay teachers a fair wage compared to other professions - in order to attract and to keep good staff - and to give teachers sufficient time to spend on teaching instead of continually changing things and introducing new tests and paperwork.      I think this is a great idea. Educators are generally the ones who have direct experience of children, schools as an institution and educational philosophy. There are too many people giving outdated opinions about the education system, supposedly justified by the fact that they know all about education simply because they went to school. Times change. Educational standards should be high but achievable for the majority. I bet there are kids who still leave school with nothing because they were bored or didn't have the skills to pass exams.      Learning should be fun and useful. Kids should foster a real appreciation and love of learning with a relevant curriculum based a lot on what interests them. Let's give teachers more say and allow for creativity and initiatives within the classroom. Perhaps then we'll produce responsible citizens who can go out and live into the world rather than fight against a system in which you are judged on GCSE and A level grades.      More freedom sounds good at face value, until one realises that it is just another way for the government to abdicate its responsibilities and hand over power to big business via PFI.      This is simply applying fundamentalist capitalist ideology to the general education of future generations - it's just another way of making some schools better than others. Creating elitism and advantage for a minority of already advantaged schoolchildren from a very early age is a disgraceful way of creating showcase schools in the name of government propaganda.      I feel the continuous changes in the education system have completely destroyed my son's education. He had so much potential a few years ago, but now seems to have gone off the rails. I have half a mind to keep him at home and teach him myself.      A good school will not necessarily get the best results in the league tables but will inspire its pupils to be imaginative and creative. Yet again pupils are going to suffer because of government ideology which is designed to further weaken the unions. Schoolchildren are just being used as political footballs.      Hang on a moment, innovation is great and will teach the kids lots, but would longer school years mean dumping even more work on teachers who are at breaking point as it is. I think we need to have a rethink on this one.      I think it's about time politicians stopped messing about with education and left the people who know what they are doing to get on with the job. For too long now (at least 30 years to my knowledge) there have been endless changes of emphasis and new ""initiatives"", most of which show anything but initiative. For once, politicians on all sides should lay off the education system and stop seeing it as an opportunity to make a name for themselves.      I am a school governor, so I know that schools are currently hard pressed. If I really believed the government was sincere in what they say I might support it, but the steady expansion of prescribed activities (literacy hour, numeracy hour and so on) demonstrates that what the government really want is absolute control, while retaining the ability to blame the teachers if things fail. The only bright spot is that at least the current government believes in state education to some degree. My training is in control systems. I see education as a complex multivariable system with many unknowns and several very long time delays. Common sense dictates that you control such a system by applying very small control inputs. Constant, rapid changes to inputs will result in chronic instability. Perhaps the Department for Education would do well to hire a couple of control systems engineers who can explain this to them in simple terms.      Who will do all this innovation? - yes, yet again, the hard pressed classroom teacher.      Many of the government's flagship schemes and policies for UK education have only been implemented in England. There is no national curriculum in Scotland, Ofsted and specialist schools aren't found in any other part of the UK. Yet despite this 'disadvantage' standards in these countries are rising. In part due to the fact that they offer higher pay and better conditions. Will this latest scheme lead to improved conditions and standards or just be a case of style over substance or change for changes sake?      Enough! In the last couple of years, We've had Key Skills come and go, GNVQs being phased out, new GCSE and A Level syllabuses to get to grips with, Curriculum 2000 for KS3 to implement, literacy and numeracy strategies, etc etc. Haven't you got anything better to do, Estelle?      As an educator, this smells of two-tier education. Those that can raise money get more, those that struggle are left to suffer.      The Labour government has lost its way with education. Teachers don't want private initiatives; they want fair pay and even more, fairer conditions. What other profession, having studied for a minimum of 4 years, will earn #28K per annum at most and work 60+ hours per week, suffer abuse and ridicule and be condemned by most politicians? None.      Yes - free up schools - let them become independent, run themselves and succeed - or fail - on their merits. An end to fixed pay scales for teachers, a rigidly fixed curriculum and the failed ""one-size-tries-to-fit-all- but-really-fits-nobody"" approach of the bog-standard comprehensive. Go to it - your children will thank you for it!       If we designed cars the way we educate people we would ban the designers from seeing the longer-term successes and failures of car design. As with designing cars, why not select the most successful part of society and the most successful generation within that part of society. Ask them what education they had then do our damndest to copy it widely - regardless of whether they enjoyed it or not. I believe we would have quite a few surprises, but would improve our education system rather than satisfy the 'bright ideas' fraternity's desire to make their mark. "
HOC HOC-CM 6.81 " Kosovo's independence would set a dangerous precedent. Namely, that any minority with a regional demographic majority can seize and claim a country's sovereignty. Milosevic is no longer in Belgrade. His special forces are no longer in Kosovo. They have been replaced by a democratic, peace-loving government in Belgrade that the whole world recognises (apart from the Albanians of Kosovo). This shows that if they really believed in democracy, they would embrace Yugoslavia's new regime. Their refusal to do so means only one thing and that is that their only belief is in an ethnically-pure Greater Albania hiding under the guise of liberty. And their next port of call? Montengro and northern Greece.      The elections in Kosovo are the very first real democratic ones in the country's history. Two and a half years after the war, the country is rebuilt and people's lives are improving economically. These elections will help show the international community that Kosovars can, and must, make their own way into European institutions as a free and democratic state.      First, Kosovo is not under UN administration, but under administration of NATO/USA. Albanians are immigrants that made their way with aggressive expansionist politics, disregard for civil society and law. Unfortunately this election will attempt to legitimise the occupation of the country and the establishment of an occupying regime.      The Balkans will have peace, prosperity, democracy, and civil freedoms only when the current population learns to forgive. And, only when future slights are remembered only for 60 years, not 600!      Of the entire approximate Kosovan and Metohija population of 1.5 million, there are now roughly 300,000 registered eligible Serb voters - quite a chilling fact for those that claimed before the bombing that Serbs make up only 10 percent of the entire population. As for the elections, what difference does it make now, when most Serbs live like endangered species in protected enclaves. To me, it now seems that true democracy is the privilege of those who can purchase it.      I have just returned from a 10-day visit to Kosova. What I saw there was very encouraging. I saw a people with great entrepreneurial spirit ready to get on with nation building. I saw ethnic minorities, Roma, who are integrated into the society, but I also saw some potential divisions. Albanians from Gjakova take offence at Albanians from Prizren who still speak Turkish instead of their own language. The best thing that I saw is a nation of beautiful children who want a future, and it should be as Kosovars. Slovenia is a ""nation"" and no one questions that now, why do we not support the Kosovars fully? The Serbs who live in Kosova will fare better as part of a free Kosova than they have under their own leaders. It is a myth that Kosova is their homeland, the Illyrians have been there for 3000 years and they have stayed there under layer after layer of conquerors.      The elections will have the exact opposite effect of bringing peace and stability to the region. The Kosovo Albanians have shown themselves incapable of creating a free, democratic, peaceful society. They are Islamic fundamentalists and their intolerance of all non-Albanians is evidenced by the events of the past two and a half years. Since Yugoslav Troops left Kosovo in 1999, hundreds of thousands of non- Albanians have been forced to flee the province for fear of losing their lives, hundreds of churches, monasteries and other Christian monuments have been destroyed, the remaining non-Albanians in Kosovo live in barbed-wire enclosed ghettos and merely speaking Serbian or any other non-Albanian language in Kosovo is a crime that results in being beaten and possibly killed.      The same Kosovo Albanian leaders who have supported, nurtured, and rejoiced in that intolerant, fascist society are now the leading candidates in these elections. The elections will legitimise the ethnic cleansing of non-Albanians from Kosovo. The emphasis regarding Afghanistan is about creating a multi-ethnic government to succeed the Taleban. Why isn't the same standard being applied to Kosovo? These elections are not at all representative - no effort has been made to include the Serbs, Gypsies, Gorani, Turks, or other non-Albanians who have been forced from Kosovo in the past two and a half years. Without a representative government, there will be no peace and no stability.      The al-Qaeda-KLA connection is so obvious it hurts the eyes; and the foreign occupying force is organising elections? Elections, mind you, where at least 300,000 non-Yugoslav citizens from Albania and Macedonia will take part while the expelled Serbs, the domicile ethnic group, are denied the same right. Since 1990, Serbia has had three general elections - the Albanians have boycotted all three. Had they participated in the 1992 elections, they could've helped bring Milosevic down there and then but they had had other agendas, one of which we are witnessing today: an ethnically cleansed, mafia-run, law-free Kosovo & Metohia where heroin-smuggling and white-slavery will have no Serbian police and justice system standing in the terrorists' way.      Part of the problem is that the electoral system set up by the UN has institutionalised the ethnic divide, with ethnically based representation, and hence also ethnically based parties. It's similar to Northern Ireland in that respect. Better than war, for sure, but in the long run it can be an obstacle to the emergence of any other sort of politics.      Kosovo elections will create a legitimate basis for democratic institutions and self-government. This is a further step to make Kosovo a better place for all of those who live there, be them Albanians, Serbs or whatever. I am convinced that Kosovars will show once again that they are politically matured and that they deserve to live in freedom and to have their own institutions. This will be a relief for UN administration there as well, because from now on the people of Kosovo will take the responsibilities for solving their own problems.      Kosovo is yet another country where Islamic separatists, egged on by Saudi extremists, have wreaked havoc in the surrounding territory. Already, the activities of these militants have caused havoc and bloodshed in Macedonia. Here I confidently predict, lie the origins of a future European war, fuelled yet again by Muslim extremism.      By the very fact that they will bring about consolidation of democratic institutions in Kosovo, they will bring more stability and peace to the region as a whole. In terms of healing ethnic wounds, the only way this can happen is for the Serbs to not look BACK towards Belgrade, but look FORWARD towards PRISHTINA. To me, participation of the Kosovar Serb community in election and building democratic institutions, is the first step towards that process.      It is very natural (and important) that the will of the majority of the Kosovo population is respected. The sooner the international community understands this, the more peaceful and prosperous Kosovo will become. Last years municipal elections and this years election campaign were praised for their correctness and tolerance by the international community. They helped the refugees from the regions of conflict and helped broker peace deals. The crime, again according to international monitors, is on the low so there is no reason why these elections shouldn't bring more stability and peace to Kosovo and the region.      There will be no chance of these elections bringing peace to the region, certainly not in the long term. The Kosovan Albanians unfortunately see these elections as the road to independence (the UN promised Serbia that this would not be the case), which is dangerous because it will inevitably lead to a new conflict. Serbia will not want to let part of her homeland go to a people that already have a country adjacent to Kosovo called Albania.      Self-determination is a basic right of every nation. Why should Kosovars be denied that right? The 17 November elections are a step towards finally letting Kosovars make decisions about their own country, even though the UNMIK administration may impose a lot of restrictions. The peace and stability of this country does not just depend on Kosovar Albanians. It depends on the minorities' choice to see themselves as a part of it, and not of the neighbouring countries.      Congratulations. You have just made another Taleban country in the heart of Europe and I'm afraid you will live to regret it.      I'm all for free elections but only if everyone gets the right to vote and join in. Obviously, this is not the case. As far as an independent Kosovo is concerned I think it would be unwise. What will the Albanians in Macedonia do if their brethren in Kosovo get to have their own state? And what about Albania itself? Will we end up with three separate Albanian countries? Trouble seems to be far from over in this region.      Kosovars for the second time after the war are showing to the others that they want and they can be part of the democratic world. I think that the third time will make the EU and US accept them in their family.      Kosovo, this land right in the heart of the Balkans, is leading the way to the region's integration to the more prosperous Europe. This is a chance given not only to those who live there. It is also a responsibility to share by all parties involved. Let it be the first model to be followed by other countries and peoples of this comparatively backward region.     The November 17 elections are the first free elections that Kosovo has had in its history. With the will of the majority being respected, there will definitely be peace and stability in the region. The claims that Albanians in Kosova are immigrants with expansionist goals are just products of Milosevic's deadly politics that destroyed the Balkans. We need to see the reality, and myths are not part of it.      Today on 17 November the people of Kosova will vote for the parliament that was taken from them in 1989. These elections will bring peace and stability in the region since the Kosovar people will be independent in their decisions. We need to remember that peace and stability is built when everybody is equal and then we can build our relations with others like western countries do. "
HOC HOC-DG 6.48 " Prostitution takes many forms - in a large number of relationships it is a major component. The rich have prostitutes that never end up in court. The present law selects the poor and vulnerable for attack in a senseless and damaging way, making them feel marginalised. In fact they are, and always have been, part of the general system.      I'm all for the ""oldest profession"" being legal. I'll bet there are studies that indicate sex crimes have decreased in areas where it was made legal. Of course medical examinations should be performed frequently. And the added benefit is the taxation of the profession by the government.      I think that people are going to do this regardless of what the law states. To protect people that do this it should be made legal. No matter what stigma is attached, this is the way of the world. In some parts of society it will not be acceptable, others it will, time will tell.      I think that the government and magistrates should start thinking about the reasons that lead vulnerable young women (and men) into prostitution - drug addiction is one such example. The drug services available for prostitutes are virtually non-existent. If these men and women were given counselling, drug treatment interventions, and in turn their self-esteem was boosted then young prostitutes under 25 would most likely stop selling their bodies on the streets in return for drugs. Essentially, everyone has given up on this section of society and it's about time they received the time and attention they've needed for years.      Prostitution trade is as old as humanity itself. It prevailed through all ages and all societies, all religions and all restrictions. Legislating or policing or imprisoning may diminish it but will certainly not eradicate it. On the contrary, I believe it should be established as an acceptable normal activity just like any other profession. And it should be given a proper place in society to function.      In response to Rob, UK: Your argument sets out exactly why prostitution should be legalised. Yes AIDS has taught us much and with legal brothels and health clinics available to prostitutes then they can ensure that they practise safe sex and have monthly health checks to ensure that they are ""fit to work"". Yes it is dangerous, which is why it should be legalised to give prostitutes police protection and a brothel will act as a safe haven so the workers are not managed by violent pimps. And it is only demeaning and degrading to those who view it as such. People who capitalise on their singing voices aren't demeaned, so why should one view a person using another of their assets to make money demeaning? People will have sex, many people want to have sex and are willing to pay for it. It is a market economy that has been going on since the dawn of time so it is about time we recognise that these prostitutes are people and need to be seen as such. Backward thinking is far more dangerous in my view.      Rob, UK: Of course AIDS has taught us something. Hence the need for legislation that gets the whole thing out in the open and includes medical checks. I'd bet that prostitution related diseases are far fewer in Amsterdam than they are in London.      Typical. It's too hard to police so legalise it. What a flimsy, flabby, pathetic excuse for a society we have become. And it's not just 'consensual sex'. It's demeaning, degrading and frankly downright dangerous. Has Aids taught us NOTHING??      I just wanted to remind contributors to, and readers of, this Talking Point, that there are men working in prostitution and that, in London at least, male prostitution is a large chunk of the total sex industry. In my experience male prostitution in London is safer and offers better remuneration to the men providing the services than is the case with women. This is because very many male prostitutes operate via adverts in magazines and work for themselves in their own premises, rather than being pimped on the street.      To begin with it is no one's business what two consenting adults get up to in their transactions. But at the moment the law is grossly unfair to men as they can be sent to prison and their lives destroyed for attempting to pick up a prostitute, not the same for the prostitute though. That's like arresting the heroin buyer but allowing the heroin dealer off the hook. I say change the law and legalise prostitution, allowing women to pursue their career safely and allow men the opportunity to go about their business without fear of persecution.      I have occasionally used the services of prostitutes and think that anything to get the girls away from pimps and drug use is a good thing.      The ""ayes"" have it in this forum, and quite rightly: criminalizing prostitution is symptomatic of a society over its head in the delusion that ""distasteful"" aspects of human behaviour can be pretended away Pathetic.      I don't for a minute think that legalised brothels would make prostitutes safer. The minute something is legalised there will be taxes and fines and the minute there are taxes and fines there will be a black market - back to square one! Stop punishing the prostitutes. They tend to be society's outcasts and suffering greatly anyway. Make soliciting prostitutes illegal instead. Punish the demand and quite surely the supply will disappear.      For goodness sake, change the legislation. Make it legal for those over 16 (or 18) in registered houses to offer sex services. Locate them on industrial sites with plenty of parking, away from schools and homes where they upset local residents. Require them to pay tax and in return they get regular healthcare resource, an allocated police officer, a safe environment to work in and no pointless fines.      The law concerning prostitution is ridiculously outdated. Legalisation and regulation is the way forward. Instead of having girls on the streets, have ""safe houses"", so that clients go there instead of kerb crawling. Have community nurses/doctors who can perform Aids tests and provide advice and general health checks. Also provide education workers who can help the women study and/or find a way out of a life of prostitution. Simply banning prostitution or sweeping the issue under the carpet doesn't make it go away and it also wastes a lot of valuable court time.      There is no justification for prostitution remaining illegal. Many of the arguments that are offered in defence of its continued criminalization revolve around the fact that it is illegal. Drugs and violence are the by-products of the shadowy world that the prostitute is forced to inhabit. Legalisation will, if nothing else, increase the safety of sex workers. As for exploitation, who exactly is being exploited? I know 16-year-old girls working for around #4 an hour in a mind-numbingly boring job, robbing them of all self-esteem and ambition.     Why not follow the Dutch example where we have a free tolerance towards the safety of both the girls and their clients. This greatly reduces the chances of assault, or worse, on both parties, as well as instilling a developed culture of safe sex. It is after all the oldest profession, so let's try and follow sensible principles in order to allow it to freely, and safely, remain as a service.      I think it is high time we stopped having such a Victorian attitude towards what is essentially consensual sex. We are deluding ourselves to imagine this trade does not exist and it is high time we followed the example of our more liberated Continental neighbours by setting up legalised brothels.      As nasty as it might seem, the oldest profession is here to stay. No amount of law trying to curb it will succeed. The only way forward is controlled legalisation which is the only way to protect all those concerned in the trade, including the clients.      I think there should be some sort of overhaul, if only to protect the women who take part in this very risky business. Laws should be introduced to come down heavier on people who pimp women and use violence against them. Legalised brothels may be the way forward with proper protection and health care.     First, we need to ask why prostitution is so rife. Then ask why there are so many people willing to pay money for sex. The answer is simple, illicit sex is immoral and, therefore, attracts those who have no morals.      George Carlin said it best, ""Why is it illegal to sell something that you can give away for free?"" The whole notion of selling sex is pretty comical, but as long as there are people willing to pay there will be those that are willing to sell. It is pedantic to discuss and I sense puritanism's bony finger in all this.      While I cannot make a direct comment on the situation in the EU, I can say that here in Canada something as obvious as the legalization or decriminalization of prostitution will not happen. It makes so much sense when you look at it for what it is. Canadian courts play the ""prostitution shuffle"" with those that actually make it in front of a judge. If the laws and courts of the lands refuse to stamp it out, lets tax it, regulate it, make taxpayers out of the sex-workers, but most of all lets make sure the workers themselves are in a better situation.      Prostitution is often referred to as one of the oldest trades - if it hasn't gone away by now nothing is going to stop it. Properly regulated brothels would allow tighter regulation, less drug abuse, less STDs, less chance of under-age prostitutes and a chance for the government to earn taxes. Legalise the sex trade and you take a big step to ensuring the safety of the men and women who currently walk the streets and their customers.      If we aren't interested in legalising prostitution, then penalties for all involved must be the same. Clients, prostitutes and pimps should all get exactly the same sentences. Legalising and organising prostitution is probably a better bet. If someone is dumb enough to want to pay money for sex with a complete stranger, let them. Protect the prostitutes and work much, much harder on keeping children out of the trade.      Personally I find prostitution repugnant. However I have to wonder that if it is okay to sell things that I own, and it is okay to sell the skills I have learnt at school, why can't I sell the use of my own body?       Many prostitutes are prostitutes by choice, an in my view Steve, since any one can have and it requires no skill whatsoever to have sex, they are the laziest working people in the world. "
HOC HOC-GG 7.07 " Whilst I am against the UN acting as a world policeman, especially in a country out of the UN charter, I think the only logical and ethical course of action is by UN Peacekeeping forces. Admittedly, this is a far from ideal solution, but intolerable crimes against human rights, as well as a maniacal religious insanity, deserve a response that will work. However, I don't think this will happen.      The problem is not the Taleban but rather the greatest anachronism of the last and now present century viz. The UN. The UN is effectively controlled by the USA, France, The UK, Russia and now, also China. This structure was established out of World War II. India, the most populous democracy does not have veto power, nor does Africa. Isn't it interesting that Kofi Anan's appointment had to be sanctioned by the USA? When the World sees The UN as a body which represents all the people of the World, equally, then the actions of the UN will be honoured and respected. But then, UN resolutions will not be biased in favour of the USA and others. Shouldn't the overthrow of legitimate governments by The USA/CIA call for trial and possible imprisonment of the President of The USA?      Have we not learned from the Iraq experience that sanctions do not work the way the UN would like them to work? Honey attracts more flies than oil. Western powers should soften their stance toward the Taleban and engage them in useful, constructive dialogue. As much as America preaches democracy, they should respect non-democratic governments and work with them to show the benefits of a free society and not punish the innocent citizens of the country and force their own beliefs.      On May 23rd 2001 the Taleban authorities in Afghanistan confirmed that all Hindus will be required to wear a strip of yellow cloth sewn onto a shirt pocket in order to identify themselves. They claim that the measure is for their ""protection"". This is a chilling reminder of 1939.      The Taleban's record on respecting other religions gives great cause for concern. Their ultimate aim, upon which they are intent, is ""religious cleansing"". They have already demonstrated their disdain and intolerance for other religions and traditions by the desecration and destruction of the ancient Buddhist statues. We need some other options - how can sanctions work against a regime which appears to thrive on hardship. ""All it takes for evil to triumph is for good men to do nothing"".      How about we focus aid and investment in all of Afghanistans neighbouring countries... and then fund and arm a genuine resistance. The Taleban have no legitimate claim to power and should not be recognised.      The Taleban have generally bought peace and stability to the areas that they control. The western media and politicians portray a lop-sided view of the regime based on a deep-seated prejudice against anything Islamic. After years of war and an endemic gun culture people can at last walk the streets without the fear of crime. The sanctions are without legal or moral foundation and should be scrapped immediately.      Sanctions haven't worked against such regimes anywhere in the world. The common people suffer and are too afraid (rightly so) of doing anything against the regime in power. Other than sanctions, one can either ignore what's happening in the country or attempt a military solution. Personally, I think we should leave Afghanistan to the Afghans. The sort of aid that is directed towards Afghanistan will be much better received in some African countries.      It is somewhat hypocritical, though, that countries like the US make a big deal about human rights abuses in Afghanistan, while completely ignoring human rights abuses in countries like Saudi Arabia. If only Afghanistan had something of value for the US, it would be welcomed with open arms into the global community.      I think the sanctions should be removed, followed by the recognition of the Taleban Government, then engage them in a constructive dialogue. And then a more relaxed way of government could follow. How can girls go to School when there are no buildings or special facilities available for them? All these things require time, money and resources - hardly available under the present scenario. Instead more arms are being funnelled to the opposition to prolong the misery.      I don't understand the selfish attitude of some people, not so long ago these people were considered freedom fighters against the Soviet Union, and now they are portrayed as ""villains"". Why if Iraq is made to pay war compensation to Kuwait, then surely Afghans should be considered for compensation. Instead the opposite is happening.      In a country with over 3 million people on the brink of starvation, the UN was going to spend an enormous amount of money to repair some statues. FEED THE PEOPLE FIRST. And get rid of those sanctions while you are at it.      The Taliban rule through fear and cruelty and I regret to say they would not be in the ascendant if it were not for the short sighted stupidity of the West and Pakistan. Sanctions will only hurt ordinary Afghans. Those who created this mess should now clean it up. Bigots are bullies and they always pick on the defenceless; hence the disgusting treatment meted out to women and minorities in Afghanistan. A halfwit could have seen this one coming...      Here's a novel idea, let them run the country the way they want to. This is a country that is hardened by long drawn-out conflicts so will any type of sanction have an impact on those you want to hurt? Besides, in this consumer driven world what do the Taliban bring to the marketplace to warrant such action? Oh... human rights I hear you say? Hmmm I think that we should look at our own governments first.      The Taliban were effectively raised under a climate of hardship during the Soviet era. So what good are sanctions against people who know how to manage on limited resources? Kofi Annan is on the right track but it is going to be difficult to bring in a group which knows very little else other than war.     I am astonished by some of the pro-Taliban responses here. This regime is the most brutal and repressive in the world at present. There are no excuses for this evil dictatorship. It deserves utmost condemnation and no concessions of any kind.      Isolating the Taliban from the rest of the world will not solve the problem. We should work with them for a better change.      Sanctions are killing our people and they are not working. Instead the super-powers should put pressure on neighbouring countries to stop interfering in the internal affairs of Afghanistan. Afghans should be left alone to solve their own problems.      I don't honestly think the Taleban care less what the UN say or do, I'm just surprised they've not made the letters UN illegal yet.      Sanctions have the effect of stifling the economy of a country but the people who end up bearing the pains are the ordinary people. In a place like Afghanistan where the people are oppressed and suppressed by the leadership, we cannot expect a revolt from them regardless of the level of hardship they are forced to face. A gradual process of reform and reconciliation is more likely to succeed and if it doesn't, measures which directly impact on the Taleban leadership, not just the citizens, will have to be considered.      The first thing that that UN and all other countries need to do is to recognize the Taliban Government. It is height of arrogance that the world bodies do not accept the fact that the Tailban are ruling 95% of Afganistan. It is not question of agreeing with or liking the Taliban but of facing the reality. Once ground realities have been understood only then can any good come to Afghanistan.      History has shown numerous times that attempts to deal with fanatics is a total waste of time. Any approaches in this regard are seen as a weakness and are taken advantage of. Unfortunately the only way is to isolate such regimes until an internal uprising provides a solution. What the world must do is ensure the disease does not spread elsewhere.      Sanctions never work, cut the supply of money and the regime will spend what little money it has on weapons to suppress their own people not help them. Funny how military intervention is out of the question, would this be the same if Afghanistan had any resources of value? - then certainly we would see the capitalist nations get stuck in like in Angola and Sierra Leone. Prosperity is the only way forward if this country is to become stable; driving it deeper into the situation which brought about this regime as in many other countries is not the way forward.      Change takes its own course. One must realize that truth. I guess we need to play around a bit with the Taliban. We should sensibly go ahead and help them in every way (monetarily, trade wise) to establish good governance, increase trade. Human mind is such that this would cultivate a feeling of acceptance and respect in their minds which will go a long way in helping them fight their own thinking that ""they are the neglected ones"". Initially it would be a hard task but that's what going to sow the seeds of success. And I pity people who say that ""Afghanistan will be Afghanistan, no one's going to change that!""      I think the UN has now realised that sanctions and one-sided approach is not an answer to all this. Though the Taliban might be wrong in some accounts but not wrong fully as projected. Their authority on Afghanistan should be respected and pushing them to the wall and applying such sanctions neither worked so far and nor it will work in future. The UN should be realistic about the sufferings of the people of Afghanistan.      Constructive engagement methods with the Taliban will only lend credibility to their authority. This is an internal matter for the Afghan people to resolve. Minimizing the full impact might only prolong the duration of the suffering and ensure that more generations of people are subjected to their reign. The worst thing one can do is to supply arms and technology to the Taliban government. Their anti-educational policies will soon ensure that they will be unable to maintain that which they have. Then, if the people living under their rule are fed up, then there will be a more permanent change.      All the problems in Afghanistan with Talibans are only because of USA and UN. After breaking apart Russia now the USA has no interest in Afghanistan. Rather the USA is trying its best to destroy Afghanistan since they know that Afghanistan is the only country that can destroy super power. As far as Talibans are concerned they can be approached with positive attitude and good intention not with the intention of harming them.      I also think that sanctions will not work because Pakistan is supplying all kind of weapons to the Taliban. It is only a tool for the so called international community to use as an excuse of its failure to deal with the problem of the Taliban. The time has come for punishing Pakistan. Why must the Afghan people suffer? It is Pakistan that supports the inhumane forces of the Taliban perhaps with the US consent.      Any plan to resolve the conflict in Afghanistan has to be sensitive to the historical and religious forces at work. However any potential resolution which seeks to encourage rather then bully must surely be a step forward, and perhaps a strategy the UN could employ elsewhere.      Sanctions have never worked effectively. I feel that Kofi Annan is on the right track in attempting to talk to the Taleban. I do not agree with the all that the Taleban say and do, but I feel that convincing them is better than forcing them.      I think the UN should do something to help the people of Afghanistan. Surely the Taleban must realise that going back to the year 0000 does them no favours.      The UN ought to deal with this situation in the same way it dealt with the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia. There has to be a strategy which allows all citizens of Afghanistan to vote in a fair election. And, like Cambodia, the population must be told that it is safe to vote and they should be given every encouragement to do so. A democratically elected government will then be in place and the state must be left to govern itself and take its own direction.      Sanctions are the only way that the Taleban can be brought to account for what they have done. They have imposed a version of Islam that is anathema to the vast majority of followers of this great religion. They must be punished for their crimes against humanity. The peace negotiations over the last months have come to nothing. The Taleban would lose face if Pakistan and Saudi Arabia stopped supporting them. The UN must continue with all its efforts to bring this regime to see reason and to account for what it has done.      I suppose respecting the sovereignty of another nation may be a radical notion, but perhaps we should let the Afghans have their experiment. I don't see or hear them calling for world domination. Until or unless they do seek to export their brand of theocracy, I say let them be. The people will overthrow them (eventually) if they are not legitimate. And if you're a non-Sunni Muslim, stay away for your own good.      War crimes, crimes against humanity.... mmmmm, why aren't these being applied to the Taleban leadership? Whose decision is it to prosecute or not? - I hope it is not up to the politicians!      A more constructive policy by the UN could easily turn into a more destructive response by the Taleban. Afghanistan is another Israel - no matter how much you try to persuade, coax or force change, you'll be considered a meddler and you'll be ignored. Look at Iraq. Everyone's aware of political enforcement - but Iraq is not interested in listening, because of sanctions. Get real. Nothing will change, Afghanistan will be Afghanistan, no one's going to change that!      It's a tough one to call but a constructive policy must surely be worth a try. There is no suggestion that in the current climate the Taleban will become less extreme or unpredictable.      Passing comments is the easiest thing from the other end of the world. Ask the people of Afghanistan what they had gone through since the Soviet occupation of that country to the multiparty/groups government and the lawlessness of their regime which was the main reason of Taleban coming to power. Sanctions has never worked with any country whether it is N. Korea, Cuba, Vietnam, Burma and a whole list of countries in every continent. It has not and will not work on the Taleban.      Sanctions don't work. Governments would rather let their helpless citizens suffer than bow down to external pressure. It would be better to help Afghanis who want to leave get out of the country and Taleban can have who ever wants to stay. They will do as they please anyway. There is no reasoning with people who choose to be irrational.      Everyone should be free to believe what they want, but no group in power should be allowed to force religious laws on the people based on literature of dubious origin. The Taleban would be no match for an international task force dedicated to restoring democracy. Where do I sign up?      Perhaps just allowing them to continue as they are will show the entire world the dangers of what religious insanity can do to a nation. But if there is to be a real solution to dealing with this regime perhaps that should be left up to Washington. Remember it was the American leaders who aided the Taleban with weapons training and supplying them with weapons including Stinger Missiles which shot down civilian airliners. They learned their lessons so well that a few of the trainees blew up the World Trade Centre in New York with this training. If the American leaders wish to play Dr. Frankenstein then it is their responsibility to deal with the monster they created.      I suppose it's a question of rules and just how they are played by. The Taleban may be odious and repugnant to many but like it or not they are supported by many including Middle East countries and of course Pakistan which is not exactly a pillar of democracy. Stop the sanctions not only in Afghanistan but also in Iraq for instance and at least the immense suffering of the peoples can be alleviated. You will never get this bunch of extremists to change their views whatever you do so why should simple folk suffer? I am not for the Taleban in any way but I am for human rights and by making the people of that nation suffer for the weird ways of their leaders is making the sanctions makers just as guilty as the Taleban. Sanctions as a weapon is outdated and unnecessary in this day and age. "
HOC HOC-HG 6.45 " Speaking as a Muslim of Pakistani extraction with a British passport, I am still seen, as are other Asians and Muslims, as an outsider, a foreigner and as someone who is responsible for taking some British white working-class person's job, house and benefits even though I was born in Britain, my family are paying our taxes, are law abiding people who obey the laws of this country, are contributing to the economy of this country by being self-employed, have attended school-college-university and mix with British white people in this country. As long as the ignorant and racist attitude of the BNP and their type of thinking persists, there will always be problems concerning race relations in this country.      Re the comments made by the Labour MP, Ann Cryer, that there should be a test for Englishness (maybe there should be one for Yorkshire persons who I fail to understand) - it is these types of comments that not only stir up the Asian community as a whole (not just Muslims as she has directed so much focus on) but also are an incitement to racial hatred. Maybe the Indians should have said to the British, when they invaded India, that the British should learn to speak Indian? (Oh, I forgot, they did not have the choice to say that, otherwise they would have probably been imprisoned or murdered.)      Have the British people forgotten what the Indians contributed to their independence? A substantial number of Indians were killed in the 2nd World War - could they all speak English? ..emm, probably not. Indian people have made a substantial contribution to the British economy; given us some of the world's greatest minds, etc, etc. My mother cannot speak English - would that mean that people like her would not be allowed in the country?      Over and over, people in this comment area have said that immigrants should integrate into our society rather than retain their own. Would this be in the same way that the British have integrated whenever they go abroad? The British in India and our other colonies didn't bother in the last century, the British ex-pat communities around the world don't bother in this century. Why shouldn't an immigrant into this country be proud of their heritage? Sure, they should learn English and something of our values so that they can get along with us, but why expect them to do something few British people are prepared to do? In any case, which British culture should they adopt? Are the values of a farmer from Cornwall the same as those of a welder from Glasgow? Do the values of the early 21st century bear any resemblance to those of a hundred years ago?      This whole thing is a moving, constantly mixing area. We shouldn't be afraid to adopt others' ideas or practices just because they are not our own. I fear that this ""integration"" argument is simply an excuse for the ""I'm not racist but...."" brigade to justify their arguments that ""different"" is bad.      I ask the question why those involved in the riots haven't had their faces splashed across the newspapers in the same way the May Day rioters had?      Specific ways to improve race relations are (1) determine the overall rate of immigration, all categories included, at the most favourable absorption level for the community. (2) religion the great divider should not be taught in any schools (3) the English language the great communicator should be essential for all intended immigrants and compulsory tuition provided. A person who speaks not a word of English can hardly ever be expected to integrate. (4) encourage Asians etc to join the police force. (5) fear no one in introducing these policies      I am sick and tired of seeing poverty being blamed as if it was the sole cause of anything bad that happens. In reality social exclusion is often caused by anti-social behaviour. Many areas are poorer because people who can afford to move out do so because of anti-social behaviour. Similarly businesses move out because they feel under siege.      As for the racial divide it is not really racial but cultural. It is not about the colour of people's skins but different and mutually suspicious cultures. I'm afraid I believe that a truly multicultural society is an impossible dream, we need to integrate people into British life. By birth Asian youths born here may be as British as anyone, but that reduces centuries of culture to nothing, just where you are born. Which is at best idiotic and at worse plain insulting. We need some sense in this country, rather than blind faith in the ideology of multiculturalism, which is at least partly to blame for the mess we are now in.      I think that there will always be problems when any two cultures try to live together. Differences in religion and moral standards will always highlight the difference between the two groups. Eventually these differences will become lesser as the minority group starts to ""fit in"" more and lose their cultural identity - this would be helped by less segregation in schools, etc. But I don't think that most minority groups would want to forget their heritage.      I'm not against Britain taking in immigrants at all, but I think people who are perceived as different will always have a hard time. Maybe more should be done to help the countries that these people come from so that they have the choice of whether to be British or retain their own beliefs and have a decent standard of living either way.      I feel there is confusion over integration and assimilation. Integration means to amalgamate and mix a racial or religious group with an existing community. Assimilation means absorption of a minority group into the main culture. The overwhelming vast majority, 95% of Asians and Muslims, are integrated into British society and mix with the indigenous community. The Asian and Muslim communities in Britain WILL AND ARE integrated but insist in NOT assimilating. This is due to the fact that the overwhelming vast majority of Asians and Muslims want to retain and maintain their religion and outlook on life in Britain. We should not be asked or forced to assimilate. Despite BNP propaganda, the overwhelming vast majority of Muslims, about 95% of Muslims, are INTEGRATED into British society and interact with white people with the exception of those who can't speak English. Muslims insist in not ASSIMILATING and not abandoning and loosing their religion and outlook on life. Despite Atheist propaganda, people should have a right to retain and maintain their religion and outlook on life.      It is extremely disappointing that the debate on UK immigration is still framed largely in terms of what the UK does for immigrants. It is a pity that the Government does no research or publicity on what immigrants bring to UK. For example, independent research in the US suggests that immigrants, overall, contribute more in taxes than they receive in Government benefits. In this context, I was appalled to see Ann Cryer MP calling for restrictions on immigrant brides and grooms who cannot speak English.      My fiancee is Japanese and her proficiency in English is no business of the Government. Intolerant and ill-advised comments such as Ms Cryer's suggest that perhaps re-education efforts, starting with respect for individual rights, would be better deployed in Westminster than at Dover.      First of all the people responsible for this conflict must stand up and take the rap. These are the British Government, the Police and the Muslim community/ leaders in the UK. It is the present government and the police who have done nothing to control the BNP and other Far Right groups who have been allowed to run riot - how can you expect to foster relationships for the future when these people are busy breaking the bonds it took years to build, why are they permitted to do this? However the responsibility of the Muslim community and their leaders cannot be ignored because of political correctness, as is usually the way in the UK. There is no place for extremism in Britain no matter what colour or religious form it takes!      Race is a relatively minor problem. Language, knowledge and background culture are far more important. As an immigrant to the Netherlands, I have to speak Dutch to survive socially and professionally. A good accent and a wide vocabulary help a lot. At home, I can be as British as I like, but when mixing with others I am obliged to conform. Why not? The Netherlands existed before I came along as an immigrant. If our northern European countries had done more to help the assimilation of immigrants as they arrived, including free and compulsory language tuition, these problems wouldn't have arisen. Anyone born near Bradford like myself will understand that these problems of cultural segregation and racial tension have been building up for the past 40 years. Why are democratic politicians so slow, leaving action to the fanatics?      The violence in the North of England has been widely attributed to the actions of the BNP and NF, yet in reality neither of these groups was active at the scenes of the riots in any substantial numbers. The violence was the result of segregation which has become the norm in British society. We are so busy blaming the NF, the Bangladeshi community, the Pakistani commumity etc that we have forgotten that these are supposed to be Britons fighting Britons.      If people choose to come and live in this country they should make an effort to learn our language, integrate into our society and be proud to be British, rather than gather together in large numbers and recreate their homeland on these shores. That perpetuates a form of tribalism which is dangerous. Education is the key. I fear the proposed creation of more Church of England schools and those of other religious denominations will do nothing but deepen the divide in our society. By all means have separate lessons on a particular faith but otherwise if children from different ethnic backgrounds pass their school days together they will grow to understand each other. And understanding is sorely lacking these days.      This notion of passing the blame is getting us all nowhere. Since the trouble has begun this summer all we've heard is people blaming the police, Asians blaming whites for provocation etc. Doing this will only serve to worsen the situation. So, stop blaming everyone under the sun and look at the true factors which cause these problems such as poverty and the lack of social integration.      Sadly, I feel that those looking for a quick-fix solution imposed from outside a community are doomed to perpetual disappointment. I work in, and am a governor of, a secondary school in a majority Asian Muslim heritage area of inner city Birmingham. As in so many areas, all over the country, we are working with our local community to build the bridges of mutual trust on which the future of our locality must finally depend. As with all such work, most of it is unreported and unsung, is low profile and not as newsworthy as petrol bombs and rioting. But this movement for change is going on up and down the country, especially in the large metropolitan areas.      Most Asians in this country grew up with one or both parents who spoke little or no English. This didn't stop Asian children doing better than their indigenous white counterparts at school. It certainly didn't stop me getting a first class degree despite that fact that I spoke no English when I first went to school, being fluent only in Gujerati and Portuguese. What matters is the Asian ethic of the family and hard work. Our language is a rich part of our culture and if ignorant people like Ann Cryer stop criticising us for keeping our culture then we may yet salvage race relations in this country.      How truly and utterly amazing.....but not surprising! Two former Tory MPs make alleged racist comments earlier in the year and are forced to apologise. Labour MP, Ann Cryer, makes, in my opinion, very damaging comments about racial integration and the requirement to learn English....and absolutely nothing is said; it didn't even make the TV news!! If it was another Ann (Widdecombe) then we would see nothing else dominating the media for the next few days and SHE would be forced, by Labour MPs, to apologise for what she said! How many more double standards do we have to suffer??      I live in Preston, which is peaceful (so far) and work in Afghanistan - which is anything but peaceful. I recently returned on leave, and was saddened to find an atmosphere of negativism pervading all and sundry - the media, politicians, community members and leaders. I sat yesterday with one of the community safety officers from the local police force, and we mulled over events of the last few weeks. It was quickly apparent that his view was ""OK it's quiet now, but just you wait"". I said, let's look at it differently. We have no problem now, have not had a serious problem that anybody can call to mind for many years, and here we are waiting for the sky to fall on our heads. Why not, say I, look at why we have no problem, examine our work for best practice and good examples of doing things right rather than endlessly turning stones to see what we have done wrong.      Racism is alive and well in America, let us not kid ourselves. The answers have not been found in American society or politics. Instead, there is a great hypocrisy which claims equality and veils the insidious undercurrent of racial hatred. We all have much to learn in order to accept each other, but it is obvious the first thing we must do is to admit to the truth.      I think that the current policies towards racism in the UK are not working. As a result, there could be a backlash by indigenous Britons in the form of extreme right wing politics (we are already seeing it in the form of the BNP). It is my opinion that the UK government needs to get back to the basic principles of politics and take proactive steps to integrate non-indigenous groups into the mainstream of society. This forum has provided plenty of ideas on how to do that.      I'm all for integrating schools. At present it's easy for small-minded individuals to fight nameless faces from different cultures. It's a whole different story if you are fighting against friends and schoolmates. Logistically though, how could it be done?      As in England, we in America make a big deal about race. Where I work, people are encouraged occasionally to wear racial clothing to work; to show off their ethnicity and be proud of it. In other words, we ""stir"" the melting pot. I wonder if this is the right approach. Perhaps the pot should be allowed to simmer rather than be forced. We are also heavily into guilt in this country, and I am constantly told to feel guilty that I was born non-black, non-Asian, non-whatever. Something in all of this smells of politics and pandering for votes.      Here in Sweden we have nurtured the idea of integrating immigrants into the Swedish society, slowly and gently, so that one day they will be like us. But the fact is that even if immigrants learn local language, and local habits, they naturally want to keep their native tongue, their religion and their culture. Thus immigrants can ""become like us"" in their new environment only if they forget their identity. So the problem is not just integrating the immigrants. The society and its members have to be tolerant enough to understand these new members who have different backgrounds.      Ann Cryer MP really does have a point. How can anyone who speaks no English participate in - ie contribute to and benefit from - society which speaks only English? Point is, the UK is not a truly multi-cultural and multi-lingual society. It's not the product of disparate immigration as we see in parts of the US.      I think it is difficult to have an open discussion on any issue to do with race relations without being criticised or branded a racist. Ann Cryer's comments have been branded sinister by a member of the CRE. How does this help us discuss the issues if anytime anyone puts an idea forward they get it thrown back in their face? I'm not suggesting that her comments were either right or wrong, but we're getting to the stage were people are afraid to put forward any view at all.      My personal belief, as part of a so-called ethnic minority in England today, is that part of the failures of racial integration relate to the failure of this country to accept black and Asian people born here as English. If you constantly refer to people as Asian and Afro-Caribbean (when they were born and grew up here), you force them to seek their identity and culture elsewhere. In America, you are American irrespective of your 'ethnic' origin. How many white people can honestly say that, if they were asked to think of an Englishman, they would imagine a black or Asian person?      People need to accept the fact that the children and grandchildren of immigrants who have been here all their lives, are not some sort of 'special immigrants with permanent stay in the country'. We are just as English as white children born here. Until this disparity between our treatment and stature in the UK and the treatment and stature of white people in the UK is addressed, I can't see there being any hope for an improvement in race relations.      The problem with places like Bradford is that there is an enormous ""us"" and ""them"" culture, so they'll have to make a lot of efforts to mix the white and black communities. At the moment, it's too easy to treat the ""other half"" as if they come from another planet. It's not so easy to be openly prejudiced against black people if your white friends are friends with black people, or the black people you want to persecute are defended by their white friends (vice-versa for prejudice against white people).      We set ourselves up to fail sometimes, and need to look as hard at what we do right as well as what we do wrong, and tell all and sundry about it - don't go unsung and modest into the world. Be proud of success, share best practice. I sometimes think it's easier to deal with the Taliban than my colleagues back here in UK - at least with the Taliban you know where you stand, without the fog of political correctness to fight your way through to before you get to the issue!      I have worked with people of different races to myself. Some have the right attitude and get on with the job. Others take everything personally and if you dare to comment on their work they accuse you of racism. In many ways it reminds me of the sex discrimination problems - what one person sees as sexual harassment, another sees as friendly banter.      Recent violence is linked to two important issues: 1 social and economic exclusion/deprivation blights both sets of communities - there is little or no hope for young white and Asian youths. 2 generation gap - Asian youths are no longer going to sit back and tolerate racial abuse and violence. Whereas previous generations have remained on the periphery, young Asians are reacting to being targeted as scapegoats for society's ills.      I agree with John Spence that much of the racial disharmony is exacerbated by the racism industry. Every time a tiny minority's racist act is splashed across the media it reinforces the sense of isolation felt by the victims. It also makes every right thinking person feel defensive, ""I don't do that, I don't think that way, so why am I made to feel like the offender?"" It's a no win situation for everybody except the racism industry.      Unemployment and deprivation are the root causes of unrest not racism. Blacks and Asians feel their opportunities are limited; white able- bodied males feel they are always the last to be hired because of positive discrimination. The reality lies in the middle ground. Both are equally disadvantaged, so both should work together to bring about equitable and lasting change. Over to you, Tony Blair.      You can start by ridding yourself of ""positive discrimination"" policies that only breed resentment.      Schools need to be desegregated and religion taken out of the classroom and left at home or in a church/mosque. It's so obvious as to be blinding. But the Government will never do it because it will be bound to ""offend"" some minority group and New Labour seems, for some obscure reason, to take these minority groups opinions more seriously than the majority. Political correctness is the cancer that will totally destroy Britain sooner rather than later.      I heard on the news last night that, as usual, the blame for racial intolerance was being put on schools. Total rubbish! I went to a school in Bradford that had kids from every ethnic background, and racism was rare. Where it DID appear was in kids whose parents had taught them to fear, distrust and even hate those with a different colour, accent or religion. Education can play a big part in helping to correct these bad attitudes, but not if the education authority and the local government insist on allowing schools to be segregated according to ethnic origin and religion. Outside of school and work all ethnic groups should be encouraged to mix, not providing resources that are aimed at blacks or Asians. How are we ever to get to live alongside each other if we don't ever get to meet?      This whole issue has been instigated by the asylum issue. Having caused concern amongst the general British public, it has been a source of uprising for Right-Wing political groups. The incompetence of the British Government is only to blame.      Disband the CRE! As often as not they seem to be more part of the problem than the solution. They are an expensive drain on public money, are politically motivated, answer to no one (except Tony) and seem to pop up when least needed. I am all for good relations but my blood boils then the CRE start poking their noses in. They will soon be claiming that in Bradford we have seen an outbreak of ""institutionalised law enforcement"" within the police.      I work in an ""Asian"" state school in inner-city Bradford. There are only a couple of white children and most children in the school rarely travel outside their community, even to town. Mixed culture schools are the best answer, but short of running bus services to white areas or buses taking white children to Asian areas there isn't much else Bradford can do. You can't force Asians to sell their homes and move on to white council estates, or vice-versa      The recent unrest in cities in the north of England is a big concern for me as I live in Leicester - a city of wonderful cultural diversity, that makes me proud to belong. But we must be aware of how fragile this peace can be, and do our utmost to ensure it lasts. Perhaps Leicester has been peaceful because, although we lost our manufacturing base, many people still find work in hi-tech and service industries, meaning that for many the poverty and deprivation that divides the communities in the north hasn't happened here.      Did you say race? As long as you use that word, and as long as people believe in the objectivity of something called race, there will always be trouble. The only societies in the world that use the word ""race"" freely are the UK and the US. For the rest of the world the notion of race died with the Second World War.      The problem isn't race relations, it's poverty. Give people jobs and they will be happy. Instead of branding these people as mere thugs and hooligans in an attempt to absolve themselves of any responsibility (perhaps this is the real difference between New Labour and Old Labour), the government could be a bit more positive and try to set up incentives for companies to move into the area and provide employment.      I am fed up of seeing people like those in Northern Ireland blaming the police. Every time large groups take to the streets and trouble occurs they always blame the police for being heavy handed. The police do not start or incite violence. They are there to maintain law and order and when large groups of people take to the streets it has to be policed.      They are already effectively breaking the law by blocking roads! The very nature of that which causes people to form large groups standing for a particular belief or religion is a strong underlying emotion, and we all know that when emotions are involved people can get out of control. That is a hairline trigger and sensitivity by police should go without saying. However, there is NO excuse for any of these groups of people to break the law. The real issues are those which make people think that they have to take to the streets to make their point known in the first place.      Perhaps if people could see past the propaganda of groups like the CRE and Anti Nazi League, they would understand that these groups do not preach tolerance, but instead seem to try to stir up tension between different peoples by seeking to highlight differences, and censor debate. Unless we take urgent action to stop ""positive"" discrimination, and start to focus more on integrating different cultures into ""British"" culture we will surely fail. To live in harmony, all cultures must learn to blend, and stop trying to live in the past expecting special laws and treatments as a result.      I heard on the news last night that, as usual, the blame for racial intolerance was being put on schools. Total rubbish! I went to a school in Bradford that had kids from every ethnic background, and racism was rare. Where it DID appear was in kids whose parents had taught them to fear, distrust and even hate those with a different colour, accent or religion. Education can play a big part in helping to correct these bad attitudes, but not if the education authority and the local government insist on allowing schools to be segregated according to ethnic origin and religion. Outside of school and work all ethnic groups should be encouraged to mix, not providing resources that are aimed at blacks or Asians. How are we ever to get to live alongside each other if we don't ever get to meet?      Racism and/or intolerance is a problem worldwide. I think integrated schooling is a very good means of breaking down barriers. Back in 1974, when Judge Garrity ordered the bussing of minority students into predominantly white schools, the racial divide then was huge. Since then, racial problems seems to have dissipated as people of different races first got used to each other, and then as time went on, build friendships and bridges across cultural differences. Racism still exists, but it is no longer as hostile as it was back then. Just an idea. Only interaction will help to eliminate misperceptions of people who are ""different"".      We Americans went though this problem and have taken measure to prevent this madness. I am not claiming that ours is a perfect society or that you should follow our system, but look within you to form the new Britain. You have taken many right steps, follow though the ideas, include all and set up activities among yourselves. Diversity is not a weakness; it made America a great nation. It can also make Britain a great nation.      The North (in particular, certain regions) has been suffering high levels of unemployment for over 20 years. That takes its toll. The day there is a serious recession/ depression, everyone will see the myth of 'multicultural' Britain go straight out of the window! I hope that day is not soon, but with today global economies, we could simply wake up one day and be in a depression!      The recent troubles in most of these northern towns appears to have been started through well orchestrated plans by those in charge of BNP. Getting a small group of fascists to come in and stir up enough trouble to get the locals restless appears to have worked immensely well for them. The local Asians should try to understand that their rioting has played directly into the hands of these, much more dangerous, and now smarter-run organisations. The BNP is now fulfilling its desire to create a true division between the races in the UK. And worse, the recent rioting by Asians gives more foundation for the even harder-line beliefs of such fascist groups.      Seems to me like a lot of people are blaming organisations rather than individuals. It takes an individual to pick up a firebomb and throw it. It takes an individual to attack an old lady because she is of a different colour. This is not a question of large political and social themes - that lets everyone off the hook. Since when did being poor justify wanton violence? Since when did it become the school's role to teach kids how to treat other people? If all of us took the trouble to practice consideration towards others and took the time to teach that ethic to our kids, we would not have the problems we do now. We should not be blaming organisations for what is basically the bigotry of all us individuals.      Human nature is fundamentally tribal. Quasi-tribal groups form naturally and each group will tend to blame/exclude another. One only has to note the behaviour of football fans to see this clearly. When times are good the local groups in a neighbourhood will get along fine. Just a lot of good-natured banter. When times are bad they will blame and hate any other group for their woes. No surprise that these riots are associated with low incomes and unemployment. The real issue is prosperity. Give people decent opportunities and the riots will stop. The other solution is to wait for human nature to improve substantially.....this could be a long, long time.     Has nobody learned from Northern Ireland? Separate schools, two tribes against each other and both against the third tribe known as the police. Britain should get rid of all religious schools and allow only state schools. Religion is a matter for the home.      To educate people about love, (who is your neighbour?) will help to eradicate racism. Racism exists in two parts: in our hearts and physically. We can easily eradicate the outside racism but the one inside is the root and need to be dealt with.      The recent riots in Bradford were sadly predictable, and echo those that involved the Afro-Caribbean community in recent decades. Persecution by other ethnic groups and distrust of a police force that includes few members of the Asian community is a recipe for unrest and violence. It is all very well to preach to children in schools about tolerance, but they are the ones who are most tolerant anyway! When school ends and other issues such as housing and unemployment are faced, is when the trouble usually starts.      The best race relations that can be done at this moment in time is to lock up all the thugs that caused a riot last Saturday, to put the minds of all the local people at rest. It is these people that are causing strained race relations. Race relations would work best if everybody was treated equally, not treating one community better than the other. If the law is broken, get them locked up. Colour has nothing to do with it and neither have community leaders.      Racism is very rare in this country. We tend to live side by side and get on with our lives and our cultures. However there are racist Blacks, Asians and Whites who incite violence just for the kick.      Being born in England I considered myself as British, but was never given the chance to feel it. I was patriotic until hearing many insults to myself and my family. People need to stop insulting Asians verbally, because a person can only take so much. Living in America I can proudly say that California is the only true melting pot. The whites in California are my friends, because they understand that there are other cultures out there that are as unique as theirs.      Education is the way forward. The fact that we have a tolerant government in power is encouraging. What is needed is government funding into community projects, which bring together all communities, so that they may learn about each other. Only when ignorance is eliminated will inter-community misperceptions be eradicated.      Also, the police should make every effort possible to boost their ranks with a more representative reflection of the local community. This may mean that the police should recruit through religious centres and other centres of ethnic gatherings. The positive spin-off of such engagement by the police will be a lessening of the mistrust between them and the ethnic minorities. Britain remains the most tolerant nation within Europe, and the recent troubles should be seen as a minor aberration on the otherwise excellent landscape of British multiculturalism.      Having spent a number of years in other countries, I have always been told to respect the local ways of life. I can't help but feel this doesn't happen over here. I think immigration is good, but maybe some form of citizenship like the US would help create an identity which all people feel they belong to, irrespective of background or religion?      I think one of the problems today is that every facet of living is in the fast track and people literally have no time for one another and are never relaxed because of the pressure and hype of every day life. I think the fact that they are all fired up has a lot to do with the troubles in Bradford and other areas. They are psychologically insecure and inexplicably aggressive in their behaviour.      Attract more business and industry in order to provide more jobs. People get along with one another much better when they're all working.      Interestingly the one thing about cultural differences that came to light was religious schooling. It seems that all state funded or assisted religious schools must surely become 'non-religious' and have the full spectrum of society attending. With regards to policing, there surely must be a return to firm and fair application of the law. No section of society should have, or be seen to have, special treatment.      I believe the only way to improve race relations is to remove positive discrimination and dismantle the race relations industry as a whole. Positive discrimination towards one group of people by its very nature increases segregation in terms of opportunities, but also means that another group, namely the white population, is negatively discriminated against. This means that in working class communities, such as Bradford and Oldham, the whites, rightly or wrongly, feel that the ethnic minorities are getting more opportunities to improve their lot. Secondly, the race relations industry does, in my view, create more problems than it solves. It is constantly carping on about racism in this area or that area, and it seems to do so only to justify its own existence and the salaries of the likes of Herman Ouseley and his ilk. If race was not such a constant issue, I have faith in the majority of the population of Britain in that they would not discriminate on grounds of race in whatever area. I wish the government and others would have the same faith.      Youths in the northern towns where the rioting is taking place should stand back and look at the destruction that they have caused, look beyond the torn city amid the burnt out cars and damaged property. The real damage that they have done will last a lot longer. They have given extreme far right groups such as the NF a real boost. They have torn relationships between whites and Asians. They don't realise that what they are doing is going to have a very long affect on the majority of law abiding Asians in Britain.      Although many may argue that they are victims of racial hatred, tolerance and patience is what is required - just look at your parents as the best example. They came here in the 60's and 70's. They must have faced far more hatred and prejudice than we might ever have to. They tolerated it and thought of the future. They didn't go out on the streets and riot. Just remember, there are always two sides to every story but the media will never tell yours or mine. Just live and let live. "
HOC HOC-HJ 6.57 " For African Union to succeed, there has to be increase of democracy and participation of ordinary citizens in the affairs and governance of the continent. Without this, all the regional bodies (and we have had many) simply turn in to private clubs of the ruling elites. Furthermore, these elites, because they don't get their mandate from the African people, collude with multinational companies to rip off Africa with impunity. It is hard for the same people to be serious with an African Union without input from ordinary citizens who suffer daily in the continent.      If an African Union has specific goals - at first economic like the old European Union - with the aim of improving the living conditions and opportunities of its people, it will have a chance to succeed because it will have their support. Again like the European Union, if the primary goal is political union, it is doomed to failure. Ultimately no political organisation can succeed without the support of the people.      Regretfully, this will never come to fruition. Africa, which still bears the devastating effects of colonialism, ethnic and religious wars, famines, droughts, and so on, is just too vast, too poor, and too chaotic to ever unite as one.      We live in an era when many of our African leaders plunder our national resources for private benefit, exacerbating the myriad political and economic problems in the domestic sphere. One can't help thinking that a new, stronger ""Old Boys"" club will serve as potent catalyst for continued under-development. Or is it really different this time around?      We should support African Union. African intellectuals, you like to talk very much without practice. You should understand that any African can change the face of the continent. Think to go home and fight for democracy as Nelson Mandela and others did in South Africa. There's no doubt, African Union will work. The single example is what they said about land issue in Zimbabwe. It's a good example to tackle African problem.      This is indeed the best news coming out of Africa since the independence of African countries. I know that it will be a difficult task for the new president, but let's remember nothing is easy. It took years of conflicts and bloodshed for the United States of America to be one. I know that there are a lot of sceptics out there, but it is all right. In the end Africa will triumph.      My country is ravished by civil war, like many other countries in Africa. How can we even talk of this concept when we are killing each other? I could visualise several countries forming unions (French speaking nations or even like-minded religious countries), but never the whole of Africa.      The time has come for the people who inhabit the entire continent of Africa to work together. For over 1,000 years Africa has allowed itself to be divided mentally, ideologically and genetically. Shame on all the residents of Africa to emulate the chameleon that changes its colours according to its immediate environment. Shame on Africa for spending its mental and financial energies acting like chameleons. After all Africa is the only continent on our beautiful planet earth that is regressing; actually all African countries (with a few exceptions) are not even developing countries but regressing ones. Let all the residents of Africa focus on their many similarities and together they will overcome this shame of 1,000 years of being chameleons. Long live the new African Union. Long live Africa.      If there was success with the OAU then the AU will work but the beating heart of Africa is not the people living in it but the abundance of resources in it, as it has been the problem until now.      The African Union has a great potential in light of its stated objectives and goals. However, the realisation of what the Union hopes to achieve depends primarily on the political will of member countries of the African Union. Given the present situation on the continent of Africa where most of the countries are at war with each other, it is difficult if not impossible to make significant impact. Though it may be the brainchild of the Libyan Leader, it requires the support of all countries. But I am afraid that they all do not have the financial resources to finance this new undertaking. Therefore, the survival of the African Union depends significantly on the good will of all and sundry.      They were rather talk about ways and means to tackle poverty,diseases,conflicts throughout of the continent than continental parliament, central bank and common currency which seems as lofty dream at the present.      Africa, your time has come. They'll be afraid of you. Don't be surprised if the West does its best to keep you disunited. My African brother, my heart is with yours. An Andalusian friend.      The idea of an a.u is good. I pray that all the stake holders will do all they can to make it work because for along time now Africa stood by the edges watching the world cruise on and allowed western nations to fuel wars. God help Africa.      The goals of the African union are noble. However, the immediate benefit will be to bring rationality and harmony between the diverse countries in Africa. Right now, African leaders must complete the task of eliminating the remaining conflicts in Africa and lay a firm foundation on which democracy can be built.      Don't we already have the Commonwealth. Perhaps have an African sub-committee which non-Commonwealth countries can join. Modelling the proposed organisation on the EU seems like putting Fagin in charge of an orphanage      The realities of the global economy makes the idea of an African union most imperative and timely. The only worry is that Africa is not ready to pay the price for such an institution. It requires a lot of hard work and, to my mind, our leaders will have none of that. Perhaps they are misled in their imagination that the EU with all its structures emerged overnight.      African Union? I laugh? Except there wouldn't be any French-speaking countries in the union. Because any discussions will first be reported to France and if France does not approve they will definitely not be put in action.      The idea of a pan-African union is idealistic, but it has little chance of success. Africa is an arbitrary geographic unit, not a natural cultural or economic one. The Arabic-speaking countries of North Africa have more in common culturally and economically with Southwest Asia than they do with their southern neighbours. The peoples of sub-Saharan West Africa have a lot of common interests, as do the peoples of East and South Africa, if tribal barriers can be overcome. But forcing all of these nations into a procrustean bed will not help them much and will harm many of them.      I would like to wish the new African union the very best and to assure them they will be in my prayers. I love Africa and I long for the day when she can start to grow in strength both economically and politically. I also firmly believe that regional trading blocks are the only way poorer countries can protect themselves from the ravages of world trade which only serves to make rich nations richer      The OAU was born of euphoria. The AU, it appears, is the child of hysteria: leaders panicking at the sight of what their neglect, wastefulness and bickering have wrought while the world moved on. Yet, cloistered as they are in the tradition of pomp and appearance, trapped in their theatrical habits, they will not listen to the common man's voice.      The ideas are normally good for the majority of proposals made for the African nations, but personalisation affects the implementation, hence failure and conflicts.      Renaming OUA African Union is not the smartest thing to do. Efforts should rather be directed at finding answers to why OAU failed. Unity is necessary for the development of Africa but charity begins at home - they say. Let us get our individual homes (countries) in order first, because the senseless wars that are ravaging the continent are an impediment to the success of any organisation no matter how we name it.      It's not a luxury but a simple necessity. Africa does not have any other choice than UNITY. Let Africans focus on our similaritues and forget that which divide us.      This question poses a real dilemma. Of course, changing the name of an organisation can do little to change what it does. However, the new name really does have a certain ring to it: the African Union. Although there can be no real African unity until democracy is brought to the continent, this may be the first step in a long journey towards cooperation, justice, and freedom.      I think independence comes first before the union. Africa is not yet independent from indirect colonialism. Most of its leaders dictate to their nation under the commands and guidance of colonialists - be it in the form of inciting wars among neighbours, arms supply etc. It seems that Europe does not exist today because we start talking about uniting Africa.      It seems so easy to criticise our African leaders in their quest to unite Africans under one pan-African idea. The only reason for the initiative is to rid the continent of the many woes that have their roots in the colonial era. At the moment we all call ourselves Africans but unite under different flags. The time has come to take pride in our heritage as Africans, and join to achieve one nation and get rid of the geographic mosaic of the colonial era. I congratulate our leaders for the initiative that will over-ride the notion that Africa will always be the underdog.      Pan-Africanism should be encouraged. However, it would be foolish to force a superstructure on an area of the world that is already having difficulty in dealing with the original, indiscriminate drawing of their borders. When African unity occurs it must be because the Africans want it, not because they are forced into it by external pressures.      Many African countries are in the thrall of civil unrest - civil war etc. Until these internal conflicts can be resolved ""to general satisfaction"" I cannot see how an African Union can properly even be considered!      If it works it would be incredible for Africa. Africa has huge quantities of minerals and precious metals and also the labour force to harvest this. If they see that working co-operatively with each other brings better results than fighting then it could be a major step forward for them. I now that there's a long way until Africa settles a lot of the major problems that it has, however on the positive side this might be the first step. After all a few centuries ago England and France were constantly at war and now we are allied within the EU.      It is disappointing to read from my fellow Africans who seem to have an inherent belief that anything African will fail! This is Afro-pessimists promoted assiduously by a group of African intellectuals and elites whose world-view is shaped by years of Western indoctrination. There's no doubt that OAU had its failures and successes and history will judge accordingly. We must give credit to those who initiated AU in the realisation that OAU as constituted had ran its course. It had been overtaken by changes in the world from globalisation to end of Cold War.      Some like to cite that Africa is embroiled in wars, ethnic tensions, have serious diseases to contend with, that poverty is rampant and that leaders are dictators or crooks. Well some of those charges are true but most imagined, but that's hardly the main point. The main point is that we should always strive to promote African institutions and learn from past mistakes rather than dwell on them.      The whole is only as good as the sum of its parts. If individual states cannot get their act together, then the whole African Union will just be another OAU. Supporting Mugabe and his reign of terror instead of facilitating democracy in Zimbabwe is hardly the way to start and will just reinforce the outside view of Africa as lawless, corrupt and poverty-stricken.      As the saying goes ""Show me your friend, and I will tell you who you are"" or ""birds of a feather flock together""/ African Union, the brainchild of Ghadafi of all people? Has he got a moral base to start an organization worth writing home about? What role had he played, negative or positive in other African countries? The leaders supporting Mugabe for killing people and taking the law into his hands? I am sick and tired of these our spineless leaders who haven't the guts to challenge pariah nations. Leaders lead by examples.      To me, as an African, just the ""realisation"" by the leaders in Africa that WE need ""something"" more than the OAU is something to smile about!      African Union is the brainchild of Ghadafi who at one time made a futile attempt to unite Arabs. When Arabs refused to rally behind him he reincarnated as an African statesman. With such origins the African Union is doomed to fail just like OAU.      The move is very timely and the goals set forth are achievable. The thorniest issue in African affairs is sovereignty. The present attempt does not try to draw new boundaries. It focuses on economic integration which begins with a common currency, and a common central bank. A common assembly will, I believe rise above the whims of individual dictators, and enact and put in place statutes that could see better economic management of African resources. All one can hope for is that a few good men and women could be found to spearhead what I see as an Herculean task of repairing several years of abuse to a continent that has survived by an act of divine ordination.      It is good to have ideals of an African Union(AU). With modern changes on the international scene and colonialism being defeated in Africa there was need to re-define the objectives of OAU and hence the AU. But unless the leaders stop the rhetoric and embark on pragmatic solutions for alleviating poverty, there are slim chances of the AU standing the test of time. The first step for AU should be establish not only monitoring body for democracy but a continental body responsible for elections so that we can have unified standards of democracy on the continent before we can talk of a continental bank and many other things. With democracy enhanced then economic and social harmonisation will be easily acceptable      It is like building castles in the air, these gentlemen's wishes will never come to pass; because almost every African President does not trust each other! Trust is the key issue to the unity which they seem to be forging.      What a pessimistic bunch we who are far from home have become. I'd rather we give suggestions on how to make it work, rather than condemn it before it even sees the light of day. A little positive attitude here folks. Come on! We all have to make it work, because Africa counts on each one of us to make her better.      Civilisation grows from two things. A stable food supply and a health care system. When the people have those then they will build for themselves without ""grand plans"". To imitate Brussels with its democratic deficit is not a course of action with many advantages.      Let's focus on the really important things first, like promoting freedom, democracy, justice, reducing the impact of famine and disease, etc. before pondering some fanciful socialist vision of an African version of the European Union. Beginning to create a African Union now will do nothing but give more jobs to wasteful bureaucrats. Until Africa possesses all the aforementioned things and if Africa indeed possesses freedom, democracy, etc. someday, it wouldn't ""need"" an African Union in the first place!      Given that most African leaders have contributed heavily to the impoverishment of the continent, we might be inclined to downplay the African Union. However, it is a major turning point in the history of Africa. Leaders who are backing this initiative deserve much praise. The African Union has a huge potential in that people and goods could move freely across current borders, conflicts between and within countries would be pointless as they would all belong to one bigger block, resources could be assembled towards large projects such as major highways, a communication satellite, professional soccer leagues etc. In practice, the African Union might succeed if the populations embrace the concept, demand accountability, resist corruption and ethnic discrimination, or it might fail if they just stand back and watch. The key to the African Renaissance belong to the population, it does not belong to the leaders.      Another European concept imposed on Africa? This doesn't bode well.      Is this another ""feel good"" idea? What strategies are being discussed to tackle the serious issues that face the continent e.g. lack of accountability in the leadership, HIV/Aids, etc. What are the timelines? How will we hold this organization accountable?      Work? When it's modelled on the EU? Don't make me laugh!      The African Union like the OAU will remain a myth so long as Africans fail to come to their senses and to learn to co-exist in very fragmented and enormously diverse socio-ethnic religious communities.      The Organisation of African Unity (OAU) and the African Union are two faces of the same coin.      The leaders and the other stakeholders must rather think about how to make things happen to the benefit of every African. I have come to know that most African leaders are lacking implementation skills, just because they came to power through the back door.      I don't think the so-called African Union goes much beyond being a club of rich and corrupt African leaders. I don't think it will go beyond giving Africa's leaders the opportunity to hold lavish and expensive conferences and shower luxurious vehicles upon themselves. The African Union will not make an iota of difference to the poor African ravaged by poverty, war and disease. It is not going to build schools for the poor African's children, nor provide hospitals for him to take them to when they fall ill.      My own view is that as long as democracy and accountability remain weak in Africa, so-called region groupings will remain nothing more than talking shops through which government officials can pilfer hefty allowances.      History has shown us over and over that European models do not work in Africa. We need to model our structures by looking at what works for us the best. Why should we always model ourselves, our structures, governments, societies and cultures after Europeans?      Isn't this all very typical of the ""leaders"" of my continent: Simply rename a pathetic and purposeless institution, and this equals economic development. Just what have these criminal gangs done in their respective countries to alleviate the untold suffering they have inflicted upon our helpless people?      While subscribing to the maxim that ""two heads are better than one"", I still retain a strong view that the ""heads"" must be clean. The proposed social, political and economic integration of African states could be a positive step towards achieving a self-contained region. However, as long as the evils of corruption, power hunger, violence and other vices continue to bedevil many an African state, the African Union will remain a pure theoretical concept.      Maybe I am just being hopeful, but Africa needs some extraordinary things to happen. Until someone comes up with a better idea, I strongly believe all African should give this endeavour their full support.      Each country should first be swept clean before talking about an African Union. If these African leaders could meet to discuss ways of eradicating authoritarian and dictatorial rule, they would be doing themselves a lot good. But to meet and talk about African unity at this stage, to me, they are just enjoying a jolly ride to the host country of conferences, wasting the already fragile resources that Africa has.      Most Africans still define themselves tribally: this is the most potent source of identity in Africa. What needs to happen first is for them to gain a sense of national identity. The idea of a union of African states will in effect simply be a collection of thousands of tribes competing for ever-diminishing resources. What Africa needs to do is to redefine its boundaries in terms of pre-colonial identities so that regions can consist of people who wish to work together rather than against one another for tribal benefit. Only then can Africa ever develop. African states per se are a western superimposition onto the continent. For this reason the new body cannot work: it is way before its time.      If we try to dissect every element of this effort, we won't have the opportunity to see if it will work for us as Africans. Even the US has had its failures but that did not stop it from progressing and trying other ways. For over 38 years it was the same old system with no real accomplishments. For God's sake let's gave them a try. No criticism!      What does the African Union hope to achieve that the OAU failed to do? The OAU has failed as an organisation and should have been dismantled years ago. Just look at the suffering of all the African people and countries. Coups, famine, starvation etc - the list is endless! What has the OAU done for them? Nothing. I wish the AU all the very best, although I can't really see it achieving anything!      How long did it take the EU? EU members are democratic countries and the people put their country's interest before their own personal interests. Do you think most African leaders will do the same? As many people have commented, the best way for Africa is to be fully democratised. There should be a parliament genuinely elected by the people. Presidents or PMs should only serve for a limited period. We have a lot to learn from developed democratic countries.      We Africans should stop dreaming and start to work together as one nation. As we all know, our continent is on the verge of devastation. We have no time to debate the Union, it is the only way forward and we need to get it started. I think the leaders in Africa finally came to their senses when they endorsed it. We should all stop the negation and help them build our nation.      It appears good in theory but it is hard to implement practically because of political and economic differences from Cape Town to Cairo. However, it doesn't hurt to come up with something to keep those OAU bureaucrats in Addis Ababa in jobs. Probably, Nelson Mandela can rise to the occasion and be an honorary leader of Africa and challenge repressive regimes to reform their political views and steer Africa to sanity.      This 'unity' is a mere foolishness. Our so-called 'leaders' ought to bring unity in their own countries first before trying to install it in the rest of the troubled continent. They should begin from their own homes by bringing in democratic changes and solving their internal tribal conflicts and power struggles. It would only be a repetition of past mistakes to try to unite Africa without a major overhaul of current dictatorships in almost all of the member countries.      It is disappointing to read a majority of e-mails from Africans in the Diaspora with negative impressions about the newly coined African Union. Let us give Salim Ahmed Salim and progressive Africans a chance to embark on this new development - it might end being more successful than some of us think!      If all African nations were democratic, then the union would have made sense. But as long as dictatorship and lawlessness are present in the African political arena, the UNION will just be a five-letter word with no real meaning.      One day in the mid seventies in Uganda, Amin decreed that the Uganda shilling should now be called the Uganda dollar. He thought that calling it a dollar would boost its value. Do you get the message?      The whole idea of the Pan-African Movement of the creation of an African Union brings the dream of a common African currency, foreign policy, defence structure and economic programme closer to reality and is superb. But we must remember that people like Yoweri Kaguta Museveni are hypocrites, and he can do anything to materialise his every wish of selfishness so that he can get credit from his masters.      It is just as conceivable for the African Union to work as it is for the European Union to work. It has no need to exploit foreign, weaker cultures or to meddle in the affairs of other nations like the West. Its only challenge would be to control its own resources and to withstand the negative propaganda and military intrigue of the West.      Whatever name, be it OAU, African Union, United states of Africa or united in hunger, underdevelopment and disease cannot change the reality of our situation. Our real problems are: corruption, hunger and disease, underdevelopment, wars and rebellions, lack of education, lack of commitment, selfishness and greediness etc.      I am personally not against changing the name but will that help Africans leaders from overstaying their time in office, or will it prevent them from enriching their pockets at the expense of the poor masses?      One only has to look at the current situation in Africa today to know that the idea of an African Union is a dream meant only to appeal to the kind of poor, clueless leadership that the continent has been left with since the deaths of the Nkrumah and Lumumba. How can you have an African Union with one currency and one defence force, when the continent has not been able, over 38 years of independence, to have regional trade and social integration and co-operation? In East Africa, for example, a person from Tanzania has to have a passport or visitor's pass to visit Kenya or Uganda.      What Africa needs right now, instead of this idea, whose time has certainly not come, is stable regional co-operation and new leaders who can see beyond their own bank accounts and look towards the dreams and hopes of their pitiful peoples. Maybe then, the talk of an African Union will be in order. Until regional co-operation and integration is achieved, the idea of a union will be, just like everything else in Africa, a good idea that is guaranteed to go bad.      I think the union should be called African Robbers Union - robbing from the poor to feed the corrupt few tin pot dictators who are killing the African dream. In fact this union is a proxy for the so called free democratic society who has turned a blind eye to the sufferings of the ordinary Africans who have been put into the Dark Ages by their so-called leaders.      I would like to believe that it will work better than the OAU. We should not also forget that, without real change within member countries such as democratic reform, peace, justice, and freedom of expression, it will be very difficult to see any change to come to the new African Union. What they have done is simply change the name from OAU to African Union. Additionally, the people who did this are people who have been in power for over ten and twenty years. Some of those leaders are Mugabe, Moi, Ghadaff and Mubarak. African leader must work harder in their countries to bring change for their people.      The African Union is actually a new name for OAU. I'm not a pessimist but what does the African Union have that will make it perform better than the OAU? In any case, OAU has been a toothless dog and giving it a new name will not make it any strong.      The challenges facing the continent will not be solved by replacing OAU with the African Union but creating a forum where the problems affecting Africa are discussed and addressed. We do not need an African union to be united.      The change of OAU to AU makes no difference to me as long as the executive remains the same. I have to wait and see what the same people will do in a different name. It is like the same king wearing a different royal garment.      I wish Africa would integrate as the EU has done. However, I abhor to say this, I don't think so... because the most African leaders shouldn't qualify to lead the country. Their qualification is promoting animosity and anguish to the their own people.      I would love to see a strong African continent, and see my fellow Africans take their rightful place within the international community! I would love it if our continent could be economically strong, able to provide the livelihoods and opportunities that its peoples deserve. But I think that an African Union is just too much too soon. Many governments are stretched just trying to keep control over all parts of their countries. I have no doubt that one day we will have an African Union, but maybe we should start by creating regional states and see how they go.      To change a name of the same organisation does not constitute its ability to work better. Whether it is OAU or AU, African leaders need to follow through what they say or promise to the people.      OAU was a well intended creation of its patriotic founding fathers but was dogged by the Western induced conflicts, poverty and disease now ravaging the African landscape.      Is there a single African leader who cares for his people? Look at them all. They dwell in the past by blaming colonisation for evils in Africa. The white evils have passed away, it is black evil that is tearing apart the peoples of Africa.      The African Union is not a bad idea, but, like its predecessor, it will certainly fail. Until we rid ourselves of tribalism, social injustice; until our corrupt leaders stop being stooges of their powerful masters, this is just another venture into futility. Khadaffi, of all people, who pushed so hard for this Union is a classic example of why this creation is doomed for failure. The man has held onto power for over thirty years crushing all forms of dissent giving credence to the fact that once in power, African Leaders cling on forever.      It would be foolhardy for any forward-thinking individual to assume that a mere name change will transform a flagging organisation such as the OAU. Any sober person will tell you that OAU needs a fundamental change rather than what seems to be cosmetic makeover. Lets be realistic: exactly what will the AU accomplish that OAU couldn't in three decades? This, in my humble opinion, is an insult to Africa's collective intellect.      I don't see much change here -- the African Union is just a new name the ""toothless"" Organisation of African Unity (OAU).      If the African Union is to be truly successful, it cannot be a pan-African union, at least in the beginning, and certainly not one backed by Colonel Gaddafi! The success stories of Africa - Ghana, Mozambique, South Africa - should join immediately. Future entrants should be judged on their governmental and macro-economic policies. Let the union be a reward for a country that has decided to join the democratic family of nations. Wealth and societal improvement will surely follow. And the effect may just be contagious.      This is no different from the formation of the EU from a bunch of countries with ""conflict and wide economic disparities between countries"". Can it work? It does not work properly for Europe, so why should it work for Africa?      I think the idea is very sound. The problem with Africa, in general, is that many of the countries are invariably unstable, going from one dictator to another, each more or less brutal than the last. But more than that they are driven by personal wealth of the few rather than a desire to improve the country and the lot of the greater population in it. This is not true of all African countries but it is true of a lot of them. Until the leaders of these countries actually want sustained economic development instead of short term financial game for themselves then it will never work! It's sad but I can't see it changing for some time to come.      This merely demonstrates the extent to which these criminal gangs who call themselves ""African leaders"" are prepared to go in order to avoid the responsibility of alleviating the untold suffering they have each inflicted so needlessly upon our helpless people. Surely, one does not have to be blessed with the wisdom of King Solomon to realise that to have a central bank, for example, a country needs an economy. Apart from just one or two exceptions, which of these countries has anything close to one? Or perhaps it is the various ""central banks"" that these individuals own in Switzerland that will become the African central bank. Regrettably, only one thing is certain about these crooks: you can always trust them to be on the opposite side of common sense.      Will a united Africa really work? Of course it will. It will just take a long, long time, that's all. Help (not just financial) from the European Union and the various European commonwealths could speed up the change and let's face it, Africa deserves it after all those years of colonialism. "
HOC HOC-KX 7.46 " All politicians and government officials behave like demi-gods in India. Power, they believe, entitles them to be corrupt except they do not see it as corruption. The politicians, the bureaucrats and the police are of the opinion that there is nothing wrong in getting bribes. The Congress party which ruled India for for most part since independence allowed and indeed promoted corruption. The price is being paid by the common citizen of India. BJP should not resign, but the guilty must pay. At least set an example and prove that the politicians etc are not above the law. Failure to do so means that there is no one fit to govern India.      The question should be that what should the parliament do to rectify the corruption problem in India, which has been a part of the popular culture. ""Throw some cash around and the work will be done"", is the belief, and is not far from the truth. I am not doubting the sincerity of Vajpayee, but it takes more than one person to run a country. Resignation of the government at this time will not bring about any drastic change in the mentality of the offenders, as we know they reside by the hundreds in every political party. The people who have done wrong should face the consequences.      Corruption is universal in India.I don't think it can be eradicated in India. What bothered me most was the fact that the very people responsible for protecting the country have been dumb enough to keep talking to agents of a fictitious company. How do we expect these people to deal with countries like Pakistan and China?      The government shouldn't be dismantled because some of its elements are corrupt. Those found guilty should be brought to justice. We shouldn't try to replace the brain because there is a tumour in it. Lets get rid of the tumour.      Given that the whole affair is linked with the defence ministry, I think that the government should resign and a national government should be formed immediately.      Indian democracy suffers from extremes. It is the widest known fact that politicians in all political systems are corrupted by their power. The Indian system has the strength to expose its embarrassing failures, and yet will now suffer the dangerous consequences of those actions that sensationalise half-baked allegations based on information from immoral people. The Indian people alone should exercise their right to ""throw the rascals out"" through constitutional means. Chaos in parliament, and on the streets make Indian democracy a sham.      India's first priority is stability. India can not afford an election right now. Also it is not a question of removing bad government and bring a good one because its a selection between bad and worst! I think they should punish whoever was involved instead of bringing whole government down.      Corruption is endemic to Indians and politics is no exception. However you cannot help but feel that there's room for change, no matter how late or how little. I'm always very optimistic that things will get better. It's now or never, it's a beginning. OK, we learn from our mistakes -- the lessons are learnt hard. But so be it. This government has no ethical right to remain in power. One might argue, if not the BJP, then what? The Congress party is no less corrupt. But sorry, that is not an excuse for a party to continue to trade corruption as it has. The buck stops here.      Oh dear, oh dear! Imagine that, corrupt politicians! How fortunate we are to be able to look at the Palace of Westminster and see what fine, upstanding and total incorruptible people we have running our country! The words ""Throwing stones"" and ""Glass Houses"" spring to mind...      Vajpayee government must quite immediately. The proposed enquiry commission is only an effort to get some more time for his so called alliance making more money. Let them give way for younger generation.      I think there has been more corruption scandals in Italy. Where governments changed more than fifty times and there has been no discussions like this. Why for India?      This ""scam"" bears all the hallmarks of a political conspiracy. Assembly elections in five states are round the corner and the Congress party had no issue to fight on. By not allowing the parliament to function and behaving in such an irresponsible manner when the government has removed the people allegedly involved and also declared an enquiry at the highest level, is totally unjustifiable for the Congress Party. Incidentally the biggest scams took place under the aegis of the Congress Party and we did not see them resign or even take any action against the accused.      What the people are and should be more interested in, is in the guilty being brought to books. There is absolutely no need for taking any draconian steps like making the government to resign. Corruption is all-pervading in this world and targeting any one party for it is senseless.      For anyone who knows anything about Indian politics, this event should not come as a surprise. I think the correct move should be for the Government to stay in power until an independent investigation is complete. After all, a different Government would not be any less corrupt. I am also quite disappointed by the behaviour of the opposition parties. All parties should take this opportunity to rid the political system of corruption. Instead they have already rejected any kind of investigation and are more interested in snatching power themselves. India needs stability right now, not a political vacuum.      This problem is not going to be solved by playing musical chairs with the Government. It's only going to be solved when Indians put their petty differences aside and work to foster an atmosphere where people can spend their energies improving their standard of living through legal means - rather than grafts and bribes!      Mr Vajpayee is one of the stalwarts of Indian politics and the best man to root out all that is bad in the Indian political system. The roots of corruption are too deep and they cannot be cleansed overnight. And I think resignation of all the tainted ministers and suspension of involved officials proves Mr Vajpayee's sincerity.      The Government should not step down. With 1 billion population and different languages/ races/ sects/religions, the PM of India is the toughest job and Vajpayee has so far done well to manage all aspects. If he goes, who will be the next ""PM"" for India??      Let's say they step down. Who will head the next Government? Take a wild guess. Yes, of course...you don't have to be a rocket scientist to answer this one. And the answer is - another bunch of corrupt crooks, disguising themselves under the banner of the flag of the Indian National Congress! Come on, if it's going to be a game of yo-yo between two corrupt parties, in the interests of saving some valuable money and time, I'd say, let the BJP run its term.      To believe that bribes and corruption in government would vanish is wishful thinking. While not tolerating corruption, Vajpayee should rightfully cleanse the system as promised. Among the crop of politicians that we have got, Vajpayee is the best to see this through. To ask Vajpayee to resign at this stage is uncalled for.      The goverment should not step down. Corruption is endemic in India. Any alternate government is unlikely to be any less prone to corruption than the present. A solution would be for the judiciary to intervene. The Supreme court could set up an investigative committee on corruption. Along the lines of the Senate investigatory committee for Clinton's alleged pardon fraud.      I am at a loss to learn this episode. How come such smart people got into this scandal for such small sums of money? It should be thoroughly investigated and the guilty punished to maximum. I have no sympathy for corrupt people but let us take a deep breath and let the complete truth come out in public. In the end truth will prevail.      India's politicians should take tips from Bill Clinton on how to remain popular and corrupt at the same time. That way, there is no question for people feeling any need for changing the government.      The destruction of the Buddhas seems minuscule compared to the bribery scandal in India. The Taliban have destroyed treasures of art but the fundamentalist Hindu BJP have destroyed something that cannot be measured and that is ""trust"". Trust and faith of the Indian people.      Not at all. Asking for the Vajpayee government to resign, is the most stupid of things. The government has acted responsibly and seems to be honest with the whole business. It has now ordered for a judicial probe under the chair of the country's top court. This government is still better than what we had in the past.      How long we Indians accept this kind of corruption by our politicians. Our country is choking on poverty, while millions of dollars are looted every day by corrupt government agencies. Look at our elderly senior citizens going without proper health care or basic human dignity which is at least a free food coupon or housing shelter. We Indians do not love our country. If we loved our country with our natural and technical resources we should be a rich and prosperous nation. We do not have a single leader who could come even close to Mahatma Gandhi.      The government should not resign until the guilt is proved and only those persons should be removed from the government who are found guilty.      The amount of interest generated shows that nobody cares, the Indian system is rotten to the core. The BJP is no different to any other party, civil servant or judiciary in India. The new generation is born of a corrupt system in a corrupt way. India is slowly but surely going to the wall.      It is a stigma on India's face that even after 51years of Independence we have not been able to put our house in order. In the present circumstances it is the full responsibility of the government to step down immediately and pave the way for stronger leadership to lead the nation. Today we need people like Gandhi or Vivekanand to lead this nation full of corrupt politicians and bureaucrats. We need a leadership who can broom the ailing politics of India and cultivate confidence in the people. The average Indian is sick and tired of these everyday scams and scandals. The bug of corruption is slowly and steadily eroding the roots of Indian democracy and the soul of the nation.      India's web of corruption has integrated itself into the system for over 50 years. Is the BJP, who came to power only in 1998, supposed to eliminate corruption which has sadly become a part of everyday life? Think of how much progress has been achieved and how much we have to lose by seeing them off. Now the call comes for change, the BJP should capitalise to ensure that this decadent system of bribery should be dealt with strongly.      I don't see a reason for the government to resign. People fail to see that no defence deal has been okayed as yet. Money being given to politicians happens everywhere - U.S. & U.K being the prime example. I only say that even the most prolific scandal like Bofors has not legally brought those 'big guys' to justice. The government's involvement is yet to be proved. All I can say is this government is still better than what we had in the past.      The sooner the communalist BJP - our Indian Taliban that includes members who are charged with the destruction of the Babri Masjid in Senior Ministerial positions - and their allies are out the better. A new government must return the country to the ideals of secularism and an anti-nuclear policy.      The resignation of the government is no solution to the problem of corruption. I heard the self-righteous comments of the congress leaders, Pranab Mukherjee to name one, and thought let him who is pure throw the first stone. Congress leaders have amassed huge wealth at the expense of the country including the Nehru-Gandhi family by virtue of being in power for generations. One of their own, Narasimha Rao, stands charged for bribing MP's in order to win a confidence vote in Parliament and they have the righteousness to ask the government to resign. Two wrongs though do not make one right. Those guilty of corruption must be punished and quickly. It is well known that most politicians in all parties are not free of corruption. Yet, they are able to get away with it with impunity because the press which should be the watchdog for the people lets them get away with it. The system at present is such that it is difficult to not either be corrupt or aid and abet it. The solution is not a change in the ruling party, but a people's inquiry into the life of politicians and expunging those from public life who are found guilty of moral or monetary corruption. The only problem with this solution is, India may not be left with enough people willing to be in public life to fill all the seats in Parliament.      The government has lost its moral right to govern, they must resign. When film producers can be arrested just on the tapes then why not politicians? They all should be arrested and kept in jail (preventive) till the enquiry ends.      Indian government resign - why? Do what all democracies do. Set up an ""independent"" enquiry staffed by your clones and brush everything under the carpet! Isn't that already happening in India now?      I am not surprised at what has been discovered. My pain comes from somewhere else. We have inherited a land on which once Ram, Krishna, Buddha, Mahavir, Guru Nanak, Gandhi and likes of them have walked. Guru Nanak was imprisoned by Babar, Guru Tegh Bahadur was beheaded at the behest of Aurangzeb and Guru Gobind Singh's children were buried alive. Kashmiri Pandits have been killed and turned into destitutes in their own land. More Hindus in India are getting killed at the hands of other caste Hindus and Pakistan gets a bad rap. God knows that I am living in the USA because I feel so timid and helpless in the land of my birth. My father was let die in AIIMS hospital in the middle of the night, and to have his body moved to the ambulance, I had to pay a bribe. What must happen before we realise that we as a race are in a tailspin? There is corruption in every neighbourhood in our country. Don't people get a government they deserve? Why blame politicians? When will we learn to take responsibility and start blaming ourselves first? All I can tell my country folks is please don't let India die - not without a fight anyway.      India is just trying to match its style to that of America. No one criticizes the Bush dynasty for doing the same thing, do they?      This government is the only government that did something for Hindus in 50 years of so-called ""freedom"". Congress is losing it's grip from ruling India, so it's paying people to play games and take this leadership out. There are some bad people in the BJP. But still I am so happy with their work so far - no need to resign!      There should be a thorough inquiry. The guilty must be punished, not like the inquiry into Bombay communal rights.      What happened is nothing new. It has happened in multi-millions in the past. But this kind of exposure is required for the Indian politicians, so that they will thank ten times in the future. As far as the government's resignation is concerned: It is not required at this stage. As this government which is proved of taking 11 lakhs (about $2400) goes, the next which took 64 crores (multi million$) will come in to power. Vajpayee as such is a very honest man.      The BJP government should accept its misgivings courageously. It should accept the sins and faults of its government. They should call for a new mandate by the Indian people as they have seriously lost their credibility. The damage has been done. What the Tehelka people did is an eye opener for the Indian defence apparatus. If this could be done by two journalists then any foreign spy agency can make inroads into the Indian defence establishment with ease. If two naive guys could purchase sympathy of the BJP president by a meagre amount of one hundred thousand rupees then the same could be purchased by one hundred thousand dollars.      In the tapes, nowhere Bangaru Laxman has asked Tehelka to give money for the party. It is only Tehelka saying it wanted to give money for party fund. As a common man I don't find anything wrong. Even if you are running any welfare association and somebody is giving it as a fund you will accept it. Also the questions are with specific intent asked by Tehelka like ""Do you accept for this?"" which can have any meaning.      I am plainly disgusted with this BJP or NDA Government, by whichever name they want to call themselves. They came to power riding on the wave of religious bigotry, screaming shameful slogans like ""Garve se kaho, hum Hindu hain"". But what kind of Hindus are they? They have disgraced the good name of Ram and Laxman. And they greedily grab bribes privately for national security and defence, while on the other hand publicly tout their greatest strengths as the same national security and defence. They make our great India a laughing stock in front of not only the world but also Pakistan across the border. They are the greatest bunch of crooks and thugs who use Hindu Sadhus and the Hindu religion to win elections by using the backdoor methods. Bangaru Laxman is supposed to be the pillar of the BJP and is its Party President. He should be debarred from using the name Laxman. His name should be Badnam Bangaru. They should resign en masse and resign now. The BJP party stinks.      The only institution which I trusted in the whole of India was the defence institution, now it has been affected by cancerous corruption. First of all, the root cause of corruption in the armed forces is really sickening and those responsible and few others hiding uncaught should be sacked and heavily punished. To my knowledge, George Fernandes is one of the honest and great defence ministers in the history of the Indian army who is loved and respected by almost every guy working in some defence organisation. I have few of my friends working in defence organisation who say he is a humble, honest person who thinks and acts for the country's defence. Since some corrupt party leader and officers got some money he has been forced out of the government, it is a shame. Justice in its essence is to bring out the truth, save the genuine guys and punish only those who are guilty. The same can be told about Vajpayee who is honest, but the same cannot be told about few of his party men. Even if you topple the BJP government the only other nationalist party will be Congress which is the most tainted and is the prime accused in the biggest defence scandal (Bofors). And the wife of the culprit is heading the party. So an independent enquiry should be held and the cancer tumour in the defence should be removed instead of tearing the government apart.      Indian politics and civil service are riddled with corruption. It seems now that even the armed forces have been corrupted.      No, the Government does not have to resign. In fact, it must not. Rampant corruption is a problem that probably was, and is, endemic to all Indian governments. Corruption has to be dealt with by making government processes simpler and more transparent. If the present government addresses corruption as an issue and changes the system, it would do the country a great service. Quitting will only reduce the pressures to change the present system. As a result it may bring in a new government that may remain as corrupt as ever before.      The faith of the people in democracy and in the BJP is at stake. Vajpayee should resign.      No need to resign. Investigate the matter and get the culprits. Both parties now come together on a debate on how to get rid of the corruption. Also, the opposition should act more maturely.      Definitely not. Those posing as arms dealers should be arrested and charged for impersonation. Money was offered to the BJP Party, not to an individual. Impersonation to encourage anyone to commit a crime should be an indictable offence.      Asking for the Vajpayee government to pack-up, particularly with respect to the Tehelka episode - is the most stupid of things. The government has certainly acted responsibly and seems to be honest with the whole stuff. It has now ordered for a judicial probe under the chair of none less than the top of the state's court. A guy with some sense of reason and logic would wait for the findings and not rush to swift conclusions. Not just that, he would also doubt the veracity of the so called Tehelka ""findings""! These folks giving Rs.100000.- (hardly approx. US $2100, pittance), for which in return they were receipted too, and then calling it corruption is ludicrous and also clearly indicates their motive to make a case out of nothing, but only to serve an ulterior motive. If every other shady guy comes up with something like this, and if ministers and heads of parties are going to bow out, the result could only be chaos and not governance.      The resignation of a government will not change the system. The system of bribes and favoritism, best described as 'controlled anarchy', has to be abolished. I am very happy that tehelka.com has come up and has started exposing the corruption. I only wish that the message will reach the millions of illiterate people who make up the majority of the voting population. At last the internet has done something real good for India.      Resign for what? Let the inquiry be finished! This isn't Saudi Arabia. Did Tony Blair resign for the passport scandal? Please look at your own country, Jeff Scholey.      The BJP has no moral right to continue to be in power. This was the party which threw mud on opposition parties for corruption and it is a pity that it finds itself deep in corruption. And that too in the Defence Ministry which is the heart of security and integrity of any nation. Clean your house before you throw mud on others, Mr. PM.      This incident calls for self introspection. I have to admit that all of us Indians, myself included, are corrupt in some way or the other and one of the primary reasons is that we grow up in a morally corrupt and greedy society. As the saying goes ""Charity begins at Home"". Let us start by improving ourselves. All of us have to share the blame for what has happened. We elect our representatives who have no character. The way out of this mess is have a pre-election scrutinizing body who has to screen the candidates background namely formal degree education, criminal record, health, etc. before giving the no objection certificate. The reason for this is that most politicians file a false affidavit and get away. Have a look at our Lok Sabha/Rajya Sabha, full of criminals and cheats (people who have given wrong domicile to get elected to RS). The other thing that has to be implemented is an Ombudsman. This body should be able to swiftly punish/ disqualify the elected members of Parliament/Assembly for Corruption, Disturbing Law and Order, etc. Ministers and Politicians should not be allowed to get away because they have the required strength and muscle power.      The whole political and government system in India is corrupted. It's in everyday life. It's everywhere. It is very, very difficult to correct the corrupt system. My personal belief is that India has to come up with a very strong leader a total different party whose primary goal is to get rid of corruption. Though Vajpeyee himself is an honest man he is supported by all kind of distrustful people.      I really don't care if this government resigns or not. I want every on of those found taking money on the tape hanged. Probes and change of government will only bring misery to the people not the truth.      This whole thing is absolutely ridiculous: Generals and top government officials duped into accepted ""bribes"" from ""arms dealers"" who turn out to be tabloid journalists! An Opposition that is just as corrupt embarking on self-serving moral posturing to gain power for itself! And all in one of the poorest, most divided countries in the world - the question of our government's legitimacy has been answered yet again.      The tapes disclose corruption is endemic and permeates the whole ruling class. The Vajpayee government has lost its political mandate (whatever the legal arguments may be) and must go.      This is the price a coalition government pays when it has a conglomeration of several small parties not having a similar ideology. I do not think the government should step down. Look what happened in the UK. Because of the hasty unsubstantiated revelations of the British media, Tony Blair forced Peter Mandelson to resign. Now Blair looks a fool. Vajpayee should not have requested or accepted Fernandes' resignation. The government should hold on until a quick inquiry is completed.      All I can say is well done BJP, this scandal could not have happened to bigger hypocrites.      The whole affair is a disgrace, and the Government should resign 'en masse' immediately. There has been a strong stand made against the Government by all the opposition parties and the people of India. All faith has been lost and the damage is irreversible.      Corruption is common to all mankind. At least in India we have a free and bold media that is ready to capitalise on the follies of the politicians. Corruption is not ""endemic"" to Indians (as someone on this board has mistakenly said), but is to a certain section of the entire world's population. Haven't we all heard of the ""Watergate"" scandal in US and """"Hinduja passport row"" in UK?      The George Fernandes' action to resign is admirable. Not since Menon's resignation following India's pathetic showdown with China has any defence minister owned up to his failing with such forthrightness. But Fernandes is quite obviously not the man with his hand in the till. And his action is meaningless, if the real culprits are not brought to justice and held accountable. It has been over a decade since the Bofors scandal broke - but we are no closer to discovering who really benefited from that deal. It is common knowledge that corruption is widespread in India. It would be news if people were held accountable for once. And for starters let's begin with the Congress coming clean on the Bofors issue.      Should the present government resign? Not unless it is proven that the whole government was party to the scandal. Law and politics should be allowed to take their course; otherwise we would be throwing the baby out with the bath water. "
HOC HOC-MR 6.69 " I think we should develop homes that float in the atmosphere so we won't be affected by earthquakes.      We are constantly reminded of our shortfalls whenever a disaster occurs, be it earthquake, volcanic eruption, flooding or adverse weather. We as human beings have the intelligence to improvise but due to lack of funds and resourcing, few of our ideas are actually adopted nationwide if not universally. As most deaths in earthquakes are caused through breaking masonry what we have to guard against is the rogue builders who either knowingly build to substandard or build on land that is either unstable or vulnerable to floods.      The fact is that we are never going to be able to prevent earthquakes and it is just as unlikely that we will ever be able to detect them to any degree of accuracy. The only option is to ensure that the countries where earthquakes occur have sufficient funds to ensure that buildings conform to the standards needed to resist earthquakes. After all what price a life?      As a student, I learn in geography about earthquake prevention measures in various countries. Some places like Japan have earthquake-proof houses, which can stand all but the hardest earthquakes with little damage. In India, due to the size of the population and the general state of poverty compared to Japan, this may not be possible. I feel the best way to defend people against future disasters is an early-warning system and, as Saima Khan said, civil defence training. If everyone knows when something is going to happen and what to do, hundreds or thousands of lives could be saved.      We experience minor shakers every couple of months. Had a 6.1 a few years back. We have a metal roof and it sounded like it was raining rocks the vibration. Proper building codes and techniques help a lot in quake zones. I wouldn't want to be living near a swamp/ lowland or in an ocean community though.      In my view civil defence training is a must. Every man, woman and child should be given this training to cope with natural calamities. Unfortunately countries like ours don't seem pay much attention to this.      I find it interesting to note that we have advanced scientifically (sic) and still not found a close solution to the problem in predicting earthquakes. Billions of dollars are spent in space probes to detect extra-terrestrial life forms while citizens of the planet earth end up being crushed by nature and its forces.      There is not a lot you can do against the natural forces of nature. Some of the more well off countries use specialist materials to counter such quakes, but even then disasters happen. We are still awaiting the next San Francisco quake.      I think that the governments of the richest 20-25 countries should give away the equivalent of #1 for every person who is eligible for work. This is then put into a central bank. When a major disaster like the earthquake in India happens, there is millions of pounds ready in hand. This will save lives as the gap between the disaster happening and aid arriving will be reduced. Anyway, #32m is not going to dent the UK economy.      Though the earthquake was an enormous tragedy, it could be turned into an opportunity if projects for providing clean drinking water, sewage facilities, schools, hospitals and roads could be incorporated into the reconstruction plans of some RS 250 billion (preliminary estimates) that the Indian Chamber of Commerce and Industry is advocating. Damage to modern industrial structures (Gujarat is one of the most industrialised states in India) has been minimal. The high-rise buildings (often contravening construction regulations) are mainly confined to urban areas like Ahmedabad but death and destruction has not spared the rural areas with their ancient housing stocks. Gujarat can rise again phoenix-like just as Dresden, London and other European cities did from the ashes of World War II.      One lesson screams for attention. Do not conduct underground nuclear tests in fault line vicinity. Though this quake did not happen immediately after nuclear testing, it is hard to believe that the Pokhran tests were researched thoroughly for possible fallouts, considering they were conducted stealthily. Do not spend money on nuclear tests before you have any disaster management plan- not only for earthquakes - but also for floods (Orissa last year). Another lesson is the importance of infrastructure in its various forms and doing away with red tape. When we are faced with a natural calamity - all we can fall back on is the nearest communication infrastructure to get things done.      I am flying to India tomorrow on what was going to be a month's backpacking tour. With recent events, I was wondering whether my trip would be more worthwhile if I could help in the affected areas or would I just be in the way?      Unfortunately nothing can truly be done. The Kobe-quake of a couple of years ago hit a city that was very well prepared for it but it still wreaked havoc on the buildings and cost numerous lives. It does not matter how much money you put into systems and solutions, nature will outdo them any time. All we can do about the earthquake in India is give money and expertise and hope that nature does not outdo us too many times.      As a qualified geologist I would like to make it clear that there is nothing ""simple"" about predicting earthquakes. It's like the weather, it's a system where microscopic features lead to infinite complexity and therefore are completely unpredictable. The only solution to it is to work out the exact probability of an earthquake at any given place and act accordingly. If people don't act and they have the money to do so (Tokyo and Los Angeles spring immediately to mind) then I'm sorry but ? However, there will never be a solution to this. People will always die in natural disasters.      Since it is buildings, rather than earthquakes which kill, it seems better to address construction methods and the location of buildings. Civil defence training and preparation can help in earthquakes and floods. Every community should have a safe house, filled with water purification gear and emergency supplies. Why do we need to ship basic emergency supplies, like blankets, halfway around the world at every crisis? We need regional/ continental centres for training search and rescue teams and sharing the best in technology and methods.      Establishing and ENFORCING building regulations is the key to minimising casualties. As an example, in the summer of 1999 there were earthquakes in Turkey and California that were of a similar magnitude. Although both countries had very similar building regulations, in Turkey these were not enforced. The result was a death toll of thousands compared to tens in California. "
JOC JOC-15B-08N 8.24 "It is important to save life of people. So big and strong country which include Japan have to work together! There are many problems between America and Russian. But, I think that the purpose of them that eradication terrorism is same, so helping each other is needed to solve the problem.  This problem is very difficult. Why? Because, all nation have each thinking for themselves. I think that if this thinking didn't disappear dream wouldn't come true. However, this problem must be solved, so I expect all presidents.  Syrian problem is so difficult to solve. There is an antagonism between America and Russia in the background. America and EU have been supporting Free Syria Arab Army which is hostile to Syria's President Bashar al-Assad. On the other hand, Russia has been supporting Assad. Because of the lack of administrative authority, Islamic State appeared. They oppose to both Free Syrian Arab Army and Assad. They have destroyed a lot of remains of ancient Syria and killed a lot of innocent people. For a long civil war, many people in Syria have gone out of Syria and became refugees. Now EU is upset about refugee problem. EU welcomed ""Arab Spring"" in 2011. This refugee problem is due to ""Arab Spring"". EU and America are responsible for the refugee problem. But I don't try to support Russia which supports Assad. As Japan, Russia is unworthy of trusting. For example, Russia brought about Crimean problem. So I negatively support America and EU. I think that only supporting America and EU and overthrowing Assad and IS brings Syrian happiness. There is no other choice. Supporting Russia means death of America as a world's policeman.  A civil war in Syria has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Its cause is about religion. For Japanese, the problem about religion is unfamiliar because a few of us believes it so deeply. However, it is very important fact all over the world especially in the Middle East where a lot of people are Muslim. In Syria, over 110, 000 people are killed over the war because of the battle between the Assad government and its national people. Moreover, the joining of big two countries made this war more complicated. They are America and Russia. Then, now the civil war in Syria is regarded as not only the problem of Syria but also the problem of the world. Therefore we all have to think about this problem deeply and seriously. In my opinion, America and Russia must stop their selfish way of diplomacy toward the Middle East. Although I know that it is difficult to solve, everyone in this planet should try to settle it. What I would like to emphasis is that America and Russia have the responsibility of a series of events, and Syria is not their plaything. A lot of people became refugees and they have no choice to running away to European countries. In EU countries, they are also in trouble because there is not enough space to live all the refugees. Also there is not enough jobs for them. As a matter of fact, so many people are suffering from this civil war. So it must not be unsolved. Even for Japanese young people, like us, it is not unrelated events although the Middle East is so far away from our country as a point of view of distance.  I agree with your opinion especially in terms of the relationship between this conflict and our country, Japan, because Japan has friendly relations with US Japan also has hostile relation with China, Korea and Russia in terms of its territory, so if this conflict developed war, Japan perhaps would be fight not Syria but these powerful countries in addition. We must face this problem more carefully.  Syrian problem is important and difficult to solve. Refugee problem must be achieved to resolve in the world. Japan is also not in other people's affairs. Do not abandon the people that life has become severely by IS. However, it is natural countries refused the entry of refugees cause to fear that the security. It is wonder that it realize the world that all mankind will live a life safely in peace. The world has a lot of problems that countries cooperate to protect the lives of people.  I think Syrian refugee's problem by a civil war and problem of Islamic nation are a very difficult problem. United States of America and Russia are going to settle this problem by an aerial bombardment, but I think then a new war is just caused. But I think it isn't also tied with a solution of this problem to aid with funds like Japan. I think it's good to accept a victim like Germany and settle this problem peacefully.  I agree with you. religious issue is the most difficult problem. Because, there is not only one answer, and people who believes must not doubt what they believe. "
JOC JOC-15B-09N 6.26 "I think the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. People's lives are equal, so we can not decide it. China's Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. I think its reason was lack of persuasiveness. However, if we fall into such an situation, we should choose anyone. The best way is saving all of them, so we have to think this way every time.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised. This question is too ridiculous because we must have a complete grasp of the surrounding situation when we face such a situation. In my opinion, I choice the person who can't escape on his own. So I think it shouldn't appear in the exam because it is difficult to give the correct answer or solution to the problem. What is more, I can't understand why the person who doesn't help mother amounts to a criminal failure to act. As someone says in the article, people's lives are equal, and they should be treated equally by the law. I also can't understand why no-one on the Chinese Internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. I feel women's status in China maybe weak. This is a pity, so I want China to change such a world little by little.  I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. Our choice should depend on not blood relationship but the situation in which we are placed. So I think it is unusual that country is concerned with self-decision in that situation.  The question means ""rank the values of people's lives"". I think the way of thinking itself is fundamentally wrong. The question was made on the assumption that people's lives are not equal. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. If I were a one of the examinee, I might choose my mother too because of a feeling of gratitude for her raising me. However, I don't think it is a correct answer. To begin with, the question doesn't make sense. So in my opinion, it is not appropriate for the official judicial examination.  I was very surprised to read that the question, ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"", appeared in the National Judicial Exam. And I was also astonished to read that a son is legally to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think the question is ridiculous. There are two reasons. First, all people must be treated equally, so we should not think which person we should help on priorities first. Second, if we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be easily upset, and we will not be able to tell which is better. Therefore, it is no use to think about this question.  I considered about whom I will choose in such situation, but I couldn't make up my mind. I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. I can't understand why the choice of girlfriend will be a crime and the choice of mother is correct. It is not ethical. The people who make the National Judicial Exam should think about this question again.  I agree with you. The question does not have the answer. Although the Ministry of Justice said that saving parents over other people was the right answer, other people also have the life, so there is no reason to give up them. This question shouldn't have been on the exam.  I was so surprised and couldn't believe when I read this article for the first time. I think the question like ""whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" in a compulsory test is ridiculous, because people's lives should be treated equally. However, there is a sentence like ""I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own"". I think there is some truth in what one man said. When looking for the effective breakthrough, it might be the best way to help both mother and girlfriend. But I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it.  I think the ideal for this situation is leaving one's own thought, not decided by the law. However, we cannot act freely without the regulation by the law. In this case, we cannot criticized by the law if we save mother while dismiss a girlfriend. Of course, The people who related to a girlfriend in this situation will criticize to us. It's hard for us to choose which is justice, observing the law honesty or handling with our opinion and situation. By the way, in the first place, I doubt the thought that question is suitable for the national exam. Certainly, It's justice because this sentence is exist as the law. I think this theory is good, but they should've think it thoroughly in the process of making the questions. Also, to begin with, this question express the posture of China that they only think about man, I think they are still childish by the view of a one of the Japanese people.  Before mentioning the subject, I'm concern about that multiple choice test can decide who is proper to be a legal professor. Also, the subject whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime isn't the problem which is decided with such choices. I think that the question can be changed by time and each person has each own answer. Nobody don't have authority to settle the so difficult question, I feel because according to some famous persons such as Jefferson, Lincoln, and Martin Luther King Jr. , all people are equal. I now maybe save my father because my parents are the most precious persons for me. If the question are answered by not only trainee lawyers in China, but also people all over the world, regardless of sex, it become more important opportunity that everyone deeply think about human's value and sexual problems, which people cannot have solved.  When I first read this article, I was very confused and I couldn't make up my mind for the National Judicial Exam's Question. This question is that whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not. In this case, he saved his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, so his action amounted to a criminal failure. To be sure, we only have one mother and father, so parents are precious for us. So if I come across these helpless situation, I probably help my parents. However, girlfriend or boyfriend is also precious figure for us. In addition, people's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. From these reasons, I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. We should take good care of our parents and also treat friendship as an important matter. If we would fall with these helpless situation, we ought to make a good choice appropriately for the each occasion with the sense of ourselves. This is a debatable problem because we can think it from various point of views such as law and sexism. I also thought there are some difficult problem which we can't answer clearly and briefly.  Who would decide what life is more important than another? Nobody can rank people's lives, as we all know. I was so surprised to see the question asking such a thing that I could hardly believe it was from the National Judicial Exam. It is definitely ridiculous situation where a question like that has a certain answer officially, I think (as a Japanese) . But I must say China has traditional Confucian values, which has a doctrine ranking seniority above the youth. I think this cultural background is worth considering , when we discuss the problem. You cannot deny the fact that cultural (or historical) context differs from country to country, and that makes their own law systems effectively work. So , after all, what is needed now is Chinese's interest in the problem and their deliberation over it. Only Chinese could fundamentally settle the question that China faces.  I was surprised at this news. This question has serious problem. Ethical issues should be treated with caution. That they rescue girlfriend or mother shouldn't make to correct. Such as this question, I think we should not compare the human life. Creatures of life is something important equally.  It is very difficult question that ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"". It ask that ""what value do you put on?"" In the world, generally, it is said Europeans and North americans put value on his girlfriend, but Asian put it on his mother. It comes from difference of culture. European and North Americans think ""my mother enjoyed her life enough and now it is my turn so I have to get happiness with my girlfriend"". The other hand, Asian accepted influence of Confucianism tightly and it teaches ""Be good for older"" so Asian may think ""why I leave my mother?"". However, thought difference of difference, it is same heart that we don't want to meet these situation I think.  I was surprised at this news. The bar examination is a national examination. You must not make questions for the problem that you cannot judge the right or wrong in a national examination. Since China has a large population, it is unavoidable to make questions for a tough questions. However, it is unfair to make questions for a vague question. Since it is the examination that the results are decided on with one, there must not be such a situation. I think that they should increase the number of people who make questions for the bar examination , thereby they can make questions carefully.  I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen. If the situation happened and they didn't think about that, they couldn't cope with that correctly. So, I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. For sure, the test is good for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession. But, I don't want to imagine that situation like choosing to save my mother or my girlfriend. I imagine that situation, but I can't make an answer. The best thing is that it won't happen. I only pray that it won't happen.  I was surprised at this news because I didn't think that such situation is defined by the law. this question is ridiculous. This should not be defined by a law. It's an ethical problem. A person will became desperate only for saving a life in such situation. At first we should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. If I face the situation, it is very difficult choice. I think that I will help my mother. However, actually, I don't know what I would do unless I really face the scene. Reading this news, I came to think that I should be filial to my parents.  I disagree that the Ministry of Justice said the correct answer is a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. To begin with, I don't agree that the lives of parents are more valuable than the lives of girlfriend only because of blood relative. I strongly believe that we should treat the lives equally. In addition, it is strange that this question has a correct answer. Also, it is stranger that the question is presented as a national examination. Finally, we should not depend on one idea. If the national exam ask me an answer, I would answer that there are plural answers about this question depending on various factors such as closeness, love and situation. All in all, I strongly believe that we should make decision according to the situation.  This is a difficult problem. Whether law should contain ethics or not is controversial. Certainly, ethics are important, but law should not necessarily be influenced by them. Law should be a pure rule. If law completely contained ethical points, it would not be a rule. I think law paradigm should not contain ethical elements completely. However, law is made by people, it would be influenced by ethics to some degree. In this incident, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems. First of all, there is an ethical problem that I used to refer to. Second, this exam is sexily unfair. Third, China is usually irresponsible and cannot be relied on, so the exam would be groundless. Therefore, to look at this news from a lot of points of view, National Judicial Exam has a lot of problems.  I think that the people who make this question do not have the heart which man has. I do not know his feeling, and I do not want to know it, too. I study subjects of Judicial Exam because I guess that I want to be the prosecutor. I have the purpose of being the prosecutor. Two years ago, my grandfather is dead. The people who break the law of traffic run over my grandfather . I can't forgive him. I guess that I want to judge bad mans. Because of this incident, my thought for Judicial Exam is very strong. And, I think that people who have this thought are not a few people. If each people had different thoughts, people who study subjects of Judicial Exam would have very strong thoughts. However, this question makes fun of people who have it. Everyone can't compared their mother with their girlfriend. I think that my mother and my girlfriend are very very important people for me. I want to rescue both of them. this problem is not a judicial problem and is the different problem. I hope that the people who make this question want to make judicial exam with the heart which man have.  The question whether they save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is discrimination for girls. This means China is not interested in care about discrimination of sex. I think that this must be corrected. For example, if I were in the same circumstance, I could not choose.  When I read this article, I was very confused. The story that a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother is a criminal is so difficult for me to consider. If i were in such situation, I cannot chose one of them. As the article says, I also think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally b law. And, there is a problem in the question. The problem is that the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. I think the test should be reformed for both men and women.  I think so, too. The problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. When I fall into such a situation, I cannot choose one of them. I also think the best way is to save all of them. I want to consider the topic more deeply.  When I read this article, I really interested in the relationship between the society and the sexism. The question focuses on the emergency situation for male, not female. First, I think it is natural because most examination candidates in this exam are male, probably. However, if I was an examination candidate, I would confused when I encounter this question. I am not familiar with law so I don't know the right answer for the question but no one cannot find it, I think. The right choice changes depending on the background of the family, couple, and the condition of their health. By the way, thinking about this problem is so interesting. I felt that compare the one answer to the other answer is meaningful. Last class I heard some opinions about this question, everyone has different thinking. I didn't achieve the right one answer, want to continue to thinking. In addition to my opinion, I didn't know that the system of becoming a lawyer is really different from the country. In Japan, the bar exams yield the least number of successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam.  I was surprised the contents of the National Judicial Exam in China. This question which whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire is difficult for students. I wonder this question has right answer? The thinking which each peoples have are different. If I were a student who takes this test, I will answer this way. 'I will save my father. Because, my father is only one and he are older than my boyfriend. My boyfriend has more physical strength than my father. So I think there is a possibility of my boyfriend living. 'This is my thought. According to this article, some people think 'Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum. ' And some people think 'People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. ' I think so too. I can't decide one answer. But, I think this question is very interesting. I want everyone to answer it. Some days ago, my friend told me a funny story. She has a boyfriend. She asked him 'which will you save me or your mother from a deadly fire?' And he answered ' My mother. ' She was shocked this answer. I thought it is poor thing when I heard this story. People's lives are very important. This question was too difficult for me to answer.  I think the raw system in China is sometimes unreasonable. For example, only a child policy is very exorbitant. Whether we have a child or not and how many children we would have must be depend on us. However, Chinese government decided and direct its people. In this article, the question is really unreasonable. They asked us whether we help our mother or our girlfriend. Who can make up our minds? It is the kind of question that we cannot answer. Therefore it is ridiculous to ask such a question. I think there are a lot of other question which must be asked. Nobody can answer this question because both mother and girlfriend are important and every human lives have to be treated equally.  I saw this news and thought China reminds Confucian view. ""Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" Chinese think that they should save their mother because children must service for their parents in terms of Confucianism. But logically thinking, girlfriend and mother are equal. Chinese thinking is old, therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date.  Simply, if it were me, I choose my girlfriend. If saying the justice, they should save both, that is a hero, but mostly people can't afford it. As Chinese law says, mother and father are who raised us from our birth to this world. There are no doubt some parents who would long us to help them first, but taking future into consideration, we should first save our lover first. This problem doesn't only exist in China, but also all over the world. What should be most asked is not their choice of saving which life, but it is their courage. In a quite dangerous situation, whether they can think of someone's life first is significant.  I was surprised at the question. I think that the worth of all life is equal. So, that helping his girlfriend is crime is unequal. Besides, the expression of girlfriend or mother means that the hosts of The National Judicial Exam suppose that the examinees are male. I think this is female discrimination.  I thought that this question whether they save their mother or girl friend from death is terrible and sad, because it means to judge which value of the life is better. It is unbelievable question, I think. We should have recognition that all the life are equal all over the world.  It's difficult problem whether you should choose your mother or girlfriend. On the one hand your mother is the only one. You were born by your mother. And you were brought up with your mother when you were a child and young. Whenever you feel sad, lonely or sore, your mother supported you certainly. On the other hand of course your girlfriend is important for you. Your girlfriend is your partner. If you marry your girlfriend, you will spend a lot of time with your girlfriend. So generally you can't choose whether your mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an answer.  I think Chinese people usually help their father or mother' because of Confucianism, and I expect that students who took law tests are tried whether they had esteem to their parents or not. Added to this , in those days Chinese people have the general idea that are the same as European people , so some of those people who are tested may choose to help their girlfriend , I think. And , a strange point of this test is what do people who made this law tests need to answer . At the same time, I thought this problem is not relevant to laws. I could not understand the intention of this problem.  I agree with your idea. The problem , which person should help , contains ethics. I studied the difference between laws and ethics in jurisprudence. In fact, ethics are contained with how to think that has diversity. So ethics changes according to people , that is, every one has their original opinions. On the other hand, laws are the rules that are minimum. The laws are the minimum rules, so that people who break laws can be punished. For the ideas stated above, this tests contained ethics and laws , and laws and ethics should not be mixed I agree with your opinion. Needless to say, human lives are equal. So, I strongly believe that the correct answer by National Judicial Exam of China is not correct. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically.  I don't agree with your idea, but the way of your thinking is quite interesting to me. There are a lot of ways of thinking whom to be saved. Thus, the National Judicial Exam of China should not seek only one answer. Additionally, this exam should attach greater importance to the process of thinking rather than to seek only one answer.  It's difficult problem whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I can't answer easily. First of all, I think this question is discrimination. If girls answer this question, it will have to use boyfriend instead of girlfriend in this question. So, this question shouldn't be on the exam. If I answer it, I will give ""I save mother"" as an answer. This is because my mother raised me, often listens to my problems, takes care of me when I have a cold , teaches thing to survive like the way of making dinner, laundry and using money. I need to repay an obligation for my mother. so, I help my mother.  I think there is no right answer for the question. Thus, I do not understand why National Judicial Exam can decide whether people who chose their girlfriend is wrong. I would argue against if I were the one who answered girlfriend. It is because I think it means my thoughts are denied by an authority without justice. On the other hand, this article says it is interesting that nobody points out the sexual nature of the question as it assumes only male test takers. However, I do not think it is such a big issue. Men are usually considered stronger than women. It is not that stressful or difficult for women to think about this situation on the assumption that I were a man.  I was so surprised to hear this news in many points. First, it is inappropriate to make questions for a legal examination. this is a too ethical question, so I think more legal questions should have been on the exam. Second, it is a bad question in terms of its ethical and sexual lukewarmness. Our lives should be treated equally and questions of this test should not be made for man. When I read this news, I do not think it is rude so much. If I was a girl, however, I thought there is a feeling of wrongness in the question.  Firstly, I think that I can not understand the people who came up with the question. Think normally, this question does not have an answer. At the same time, people who aim to lawyers must choose. To sum up, they are forced to ultimate choice to choose either like this question. I aim at the lawyer, too. If I become a lawyer, not only lawyer but also people who became the legal profession, not uncommonly they are pressed for ultimate choice. Therefore, as I stated it first that I can not understand this question! But now, I think whether this question expresses the essence of the occupation called the judicial officer.  I am surprised to hear hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China have been asked in a compulsory test. I am of the opinion that this question does not have absolute solution. I guess that both girlfriend and mother are special for us, and we do not have alternatives. This is why this question does not have the right solution. However, we have to understand Chinese culture. In China its philosophy or thought is called thought of ""Ju-ka""(thought of Confucius). In the thought of Confucius, they have to cherish our parents, because they have a debt of gratitude to grow up. Based on this thought, China makes up history. This is why we do not need to decide whether we would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. However, we have to understand their culture of to think a great deal of their father and mother.  I think that this question is unsuitable for two reason. First, the answer doesn't have correct answer. Test takers spend in different home environment, so the way of thinking is different too. Second, law should be a logic that convince all people. Law forces all citizens to obey, so it mustn't contain individual morals. I think it is good that the question sparked on the Internet. Now is the time to discuss this problem.  I can not believe that such a question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think no one could say which is correct. If I am asked this question, I will not be able to answer. Our lives are equal, so we should not compare the worth of lives. And however there were female, this question assumed that examinees are male. I think this question is not appropriate for the National Judicial Exam.  I agree with your opinion partly. This situation may come true someday and we must select which life we should save, so it is a good idea to think about it. However, I think the question is too inappropriate to be on this important exam in terms of its sexism and immorality.  Oh my god! In the second line, I wrote ""this"", but I should write ""This"" because it is the first ward of that sentence. Sorry.  The problem is difficult and I think the problem is nonsense, because this situation cannot be occurred. Confucianism in China may answer that should be helped mother. But both girlfriends and mother are special for us and these situations are not thought various family environmental, for example be abused. . . Some of those people may choose to help their girlfriend but I think this answer is not mistake. I think this question should not set a student for the National Judicial Exam This is difficult problem whether we should choose our mother or girlfriend. On the one hand, our mother is the only one. We were born by our mother. And, we were brought up with our mother when we were a child. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our mother supported us certainly. Mother is an essential person for her child. On the other hand, of course our girlfriend is important for us. Whenever we feel sad, lonely or sore, our girlfriend supports us certainly, too. If we marry our girlfriend, we will spend more time with our girlfriend than our mother. So girlfriend is an essential for her partner. From the reason above, we can't choose whether our mother or girlfriend. I think this problem does not have an unapparent answer.  I agree with your idea. A few days ago, China decided to abolish the system of a one-child policy. These days, the economic situation in China is declining, so I think China ought to reconsider their own nation systems. In addition, I also think it is impossible to answer this ridiculous question whether you help your mother or your girlfriend . We human lives should be treated equal.  I feel a very strong anger on this issue. First of all, I think problems that correct answer is entrusted largely to the values of the individual should not be appeared in the National Judicial Exam. Then, I think it's also problem for China that the law which it is necessary to judge which her and mother is better is not yet abolished. The legislator in China should do away with the outdated laws. I can not make out why they don't do it yet. I hope law students who had worked on this problem will solve this issue very much.  I agree with your idea. If I were in such a situation, I could not choose whether I would save my mother or boyfriend. And I also think that the best way is to help both of them. Of course people's lives should be treated equally. So this question that demands that they decide to help only one is inappropriate, I think.  I never think of that idea. For sure, our parents is the ones who have raised us, and we should appreciate them. That is hard true. But, our girlfriends is also important person who may be a partner in the future. So, when we think of future, the choice we save our girlfriends may be better.  I read this article, then I feel so bad. Because I do not like China. I guessed that it is China issue again. However, I feel that the most bad thing is equal rights for men and women. Naturally, low students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is very bad issue. But, in the first place, why they chose girl friend? Why is it not boyfriend? It is assumption that it is object of man, not woman. At this time it is not equal rights of men and women. About the other, which people did you chose girlfriend or mother? They said, it is that all people are equal. But I think we are always partial in the world. It is properly. I help an acquaintance whether we help acquaintance whichever with a person not to know at all. Will there be the person who is not so? I think that no people who think help not know people. People always discriminate. So, they persecute or despise other people. It is not only Chinese issue, but Japanese issue. Of course I discriminate against such me. This is because it thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family.  I was surprised that this question appeared in the National Judicial Exam. I think the question doesn't have the correct answer. As equality is guaranteed by the Constitution of Japan, every life is equally important, of course. If I am asked the question in the test, I cannot choose whether saving our girl friend or mother from a deadly fire. I don't know system of Chinese law in detail. But, the lawyer needs some knowledge of seeing an issue from various perspectives and thinking equally. This is perfectly reasonable for lawyers in every country. So, it is unsuitable for entering the judiciary and legal profession must pass.  I agree with your opinion. I learned that ""all people are equal"" in my class. We are all equal, so we cannot decide which live is important or precious. I was surprised this question. If I was the person who take a test, I could not answer this. Does this question has right answer? It is very difficult.  I agree with you. the National Judicial Exam's Question is the question"" whether saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime or not"". His action of saving girlfriend is amounted to a criminal failure because Confucianism is the religion that children must serve their parents more than other people. However this custom is too bad and too old nowadays because now all people is equal to all people. Therefore the answer of the question""Whether people should save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" should depend on personal value.  I agree with your opinion and I think so too. I think it is impossible to judge which value of the life is better, and human beings are correctly equally. So we should share the thinking not to discriminate the human beings by sex all over the world! If I must choose my mother or someone essential for me in emergency, I think the choice is up to the situation. However, to tell the truth, I cannot decide to chose one and leave the other, so I cannot understand the judgment that saving a girlfriend, not mother is a crime. I think that all lives should be treated equally without taking it consider that mother is family and that girlfriend is not. In Japan, this point that a person in emergency decides who he or she should save rarely become a big problem. So what people regard as important is depends on the national characteristics. It seems that people in foreign countries tend to spend much time with their family while Japanese people spend not so much. I think Japanese are too busy for their work or disinterested in their family. Now this is also a serious problem.  I agree with your opinion. The question about choosing girlfriend or mother in the case of fire is so difficult, and nobody can find its answer, I thought. Also, in the same as your opinion, everyone on the earth cannot decide the value of others, I think. In addition, I felt the fact that the exam of public asks the question to examinees is specifically wrong. However, in fact, I might be forced to save someone instead of others someday, so I think that I continue to be troubled throughout all my life.  I think this exam is illegal for two points. First, human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. Second, anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind. By the way, I don't have girlfriend for now. Therefore I think this question is an incentive one, too.  I think so, too. Mother is our only one for everyone. Because she always support us when we feel sad, lonely and happy. She shear our feel at any moment. On the other hand, girlfriend is our only one, too. A girlfriend is a person that you love each other. And you find treasure. So this question is too difficult to answer.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. This problem is very difficult. I think this problem has no answer. Because human life is equal. The person who wants to protect mother should protect mother, the person who wants to protect girlfriend should protect girlfriend, The person who is not which should protect the person who was in the place. Now, I don't have girlfriend so my answer is protect my mother. But if I get girlfriend, I may cannot answer this problem.  I think this tests have two problems. One is that human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. Of course, I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. However it is the story in emergency and I think he should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing the girlfriend. What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. The other is that anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. Of course, discriminating men between women is illegal. A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind.  I also felt this question and the way examiners treated people who answered girlfriend are just ridiculous. If I were the one who answered girlfriend, I cannot tolerate for losing points with my answer. There are a lot of ways of thinking, and examiners should score with respect. The standard for scoring must be how logical the students support their choices. But before talking about the way they scored, I wonder if this is a suitable question when considering of rights of all the people. On the other hand, I think it is really natural that nobody cares about the sexual problem because the question is just on the assumption.  I was surprised at this question. I think the felling that he want to help his girlfriend is as important as want to help his mother. Preciousness of life is not changed for everyone. So, it is natural that this result is controversial. Furthermore, the gender discrimination problem is also serious. Women is not assumed that the answer. If there is a woman that if received the test, she would have thought uncomfortable. Also, in Japan, lawyers and doctors are likely assumed men. We need to go to change the consciousness for the society that women can success more.  I think so too. If I was faced with the circumstances his mother and lover is dying at the same time , it will can not help calm. So, this question does not have meaning to think. In addition, I think that it is unscrupulous itself that such a question in the national examination. They should reconsider the way of test.  I think so too. The problem choosing his mother or his girlfriend doesn't have the answer. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to decide. And, we of course want to help both of them. So, we should think how to help all if think.  I agree with your opinion. The answer of China's Ministry of Justice depends on personal sense of values. Certainly, we are brought up by mothers and have longer relationship than girlfriends. But, People's lives are equal. Even a girlfriend is the one of important people. Therefore, they should reconsider this question ethically.  You felt surprised when you read this article. I felt the same as you about that. You wrote that mother and girl friend are even ground. I thought that too!! Mother gave birth to me, so mother is person that it is very important for me. In contrast, girl friend is a favorite person. The nature fades especially in comparison with mother. But, I may become person that it will be important in the future. I do not think that all the people are equal. Some of them are important but others are not. But I am not available in girl friend with mother. China's institution is bad. We demand the change of the Chinese system. In addition, I think that there is a way in itself mistake of the Chinese country. For example, it is Disney, Doraemon, Konan, or etc. . . It is called by Pakuri. China should review all the society I agree with you. Needless to say, it goes without saying that human lives are equal regardless of age or gender. So, this question doesn't have the correct answer in my opinion. And, I take the opportunity of reading this article to want to know Chinese low system compared to Japanese. It is impossible that the government makes such an exam question in Japan because all people are equal under the low. I guess that it is not natural in China that human rights should be respected. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test.  I strongly agree with you. The question's way of thinking itself is fundamentally ridiculous. The question was based on the thought that people's lives are not equal. However everyone's lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. I can't understand why saving the girlfriend is a crime and saving mother is correct too. I think the question has no answer. To begin with, the question make no sense. So, I think it is not appropriate for the official examination.  When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, it is very wrong to compare the value of his girlfriend's life with that of his mother's one in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone want to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. Accord to the people in the article, ""the law was unjust or 'ridiculous', especially in emergency situations where many lives may be at stake. "" ""People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. "" ""I have no idea why giv up your mum is a crime, while giv up your girlfriend is not. "" I think also that it is not possible to compare the life of the lover with that of the mother, so even if a person cannot save either life in the emergency situation, the person should not be judged or other people cannot judge the person because nobody is bad. I think that the argument was caused by the difference in the each person's recognition to the equality right. So I would like to give some examples of other countries' constitutions which prescribe what the equality right is. The first example is Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. In the Basic Law, the universal content that all people are equal under the law is defined, and it shall not be possible for every person to suffer a disadvantage and to get the preferential treatment because of sex, family origin, race, language, homeland, origin and religious or political views. In addition, the equality of men and women have been clearly specified in the Basic Law. The second example is Brazil Constitution. In the constitution, it is said that all of the people are equal before the law without any kind of discrimination, and it is guaranteed inviolable rights to life, freedom, equality, safety and property rights under the follow provisions for Brazilians and foreigners to emigrate to the country. 1. In accordance with the provisions of this Constitution, men and women are equal in rights and obligations. . . . The final example is the United States Constitution. In the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, the content about the right of equality is written. Section 1. All persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the equal protection of the laws. Since I mentioned some of the constitutional items regard equality of other countries as above, next, I would like to pick up an item about the equality of the Japanese Constitution. Accord to the provisions of the Constitution of Japan, 1. All of the people is an equality under the law, race, creed, gender, by social status or family origin, in political, economic or social relations, not discrimination. 2. Peers and peerage shall not be recognized. 3. honor, awarded the Medal other honors is not accompanied by any privilege. Award of honor is, actually has this, or only one generation of the future which is person who receives, has its effect. This section is intended to define the so-called equality under the law (which is one equal rights for five rights). Respect for fundamental human rights coupled with, and is intended to constitute one of the principles of the Constitution, respect for basic human rights is, whereas the mean inherently guarantee of rights possessed by each person, and under the law equality is to intended to ensure the sufficient rights even in comparison with others. This section as the ""family origin"", as referred to in paragraph 1, it is considered to mean the pedigree or pedigree. Lords after the Meiji Restoration in Japan, such as the do not allow the presence of hereditary aristocracy, such as nobility was born to mother aristocrats. While not deny that you awarded the honor of honors, etc. , this is it is assumed that it finds as long as that does not result in a privileged position or hereditary position. By the Emperor and imperial presence of an exception provision is constitutional Chapter 1 of expressly for this section, be outside the scope. In addition, pursuant to the provisions of the Civil Code, but the Emperor of - laws also exist, -laws of the Emperor is not hit in the aristocracy. It should be noted that, on the relationship that prohibits discrimination based on family origin, to be established accord to the ""family origin"" as ""a son of a politician"" and ""candidacy restrictions to public office politicians"" in the law ""prohibits discrimination based on family origin"" as a violation of the Constitution has been, it is also the provisions of which are incorporated naysayer to hereditary politicians regulation. In the enactment process of the Constitution of Japan, Emperor Showa for the abolition of the nobility, it is said to have been pointed out that ""Dojo nobility or can not (aristocrats born of nobility) only to leave"", sufficient consideration of such a proposal has not been made . In fact, at the stage of the GHQ draft and constitutional amendment draft outline as it is in the history of the follow between the nobility one generation of his lifetime has become a form that allows the Eishaku, and Kiji Shidehara which was also the own Baron also strong in this clause Good but it showed [1], (one of the Ashida modified) Modify passed immediately discontinued in the House of Representatives has passed this on draft street which has been passed by the House of Lords is also the House of Representatives. Law applied equality theory the mean of ""equality under the law"", there is a concept of law contents equality theory (legislator restraint theory), the mean of equality there is a theory that theory that an absolute equality, the relative equality . In addition, ""race, creed, sex, social status or family origin"" limited enumeration and capture theory, there is a theory that in an illustrative enumeration. The Supreme Court, as long as it is not intended to be based on reasonable grounds in accordance with this provision on the nature of things, have construed the provisions of the intention to ban the legal discriminatory treatment. However, in Japan, there was an incident on the law that became unconstitutional by the weight difference between life, although the incident was a murder case. The case was in 1968, 29-year-old woman at that time killed the father at the time 53-year-old who had forced to incest against itself in Tochigi Prefecture Yaita. It is referred to as ""Tochigi father kill incident, "" ""Tochigi father murder"". Next, I describes the Chinese Constitution that came to make this test. It has established for equality rights, and any citizens are all equal before the law (Article 33), 18 years of age or older citizens, ethnic, racial, gender, occupation, specifically that it is not discrimination by the difference of the property, etc. set. In particular, the provision of the own protection provisions against ethnic minorities and women in China has been suppressed for a long period of time. However, even though it has already been defined for equality by this Constitution, in China there is inequality between ethnic groups. The problem is Tibet problem. Disputes Tibetans with the culture of church and state match has occurred for independence and a high degree of autonomy from China. Recently have international issues as a human rights issue but the suppression of religion, freedom of the Tibetan people by the Chinese authorities. Tibet became of China in the late 18th century Hunt, Q but has a suzerainty internal affairs was remained in a state of hold the Dalai Lama Government Office. Despite to have established in the Constitution for equality, China is a vague sense of equality because there is inequality between ethnic groups. There is another point that I could not be satisfied. I think that it is very wrong that no one on the Chinese internet appears to address the sexist nature of the question. The test clearly assumes the test takers are male. I think that this is an obvious gender discrimination that is happen in China. I feel that it is regrettable that this kind of men and women discriminatory test problem appears in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone want to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. In conclusion, by pick up the items on equality of Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany and Brazilian Constitution and Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and Japanese Constitution and Chinese constitution, I considered what is the equality. Then, I think that the exam question in National Judicial Exam is Inappropriate in terms of the equality of people's lives and gender discrimination.  I am opposed to your idea. They cannot certainly save both their mother and girlfriend under this dangerous situation. There is something in what you say. But, it is very important for lawyers to treat equally people's lives and right. They need to make a right decision according to each situation. So, I think this question is not proper as the national test of choosing the lawyers.  I was surprised to read this article because I have ever heard this question, ""Which of your girlfriend or mother do you save from a deadly fire? "", but I couldn't believe the official organization made this question in the official test. I think to make this question isn't correct. People may have their own opinions and answers as a lot of people discussed online. I think each person has he or her answers, for example ""I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own, "" and ""People's lives are equal, they should be treated equally by the law. "" However the official organization's deciding the correct answer is not virtuous. It is true that in China, there are teachings that you should make much of your parents, but that is no reason for the official organization's putting special emphasis on parents. Anyone has freedom of thought, so the official organization's controlling their minds by deciding the correct answer is illegal. If I am Chinese, I don't want people that passed the test as this article to become judicial officers.  Surely, at first, this premise that examinees are male is wrong, but Chinese posture that mother is prior to girlfriend is proper. Because, parents are regarded as important from the old in China. Of course, all people should be equal, but Chinese society is based on this system. I think it's good to keep this posture in the future.  I agree with your opinion on some points. "" human should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. Approving to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. "" - I agree with your opinion. All people must be treated regardless of sex, religion, race etc. . . . . This is an essential factor of modern society. This human right is a constitutional right. "" I may rescue my mother in the same situation because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. "" - I agree with this part of your opinion too. The proverb says, "" Children do not realize how much their parents love them. "" , I think so. My parents love me more than any other people in the world, so I want to repay an obligation by rescuing them. "" What is the problem is the law admitting distinguishing. In Japan there was a law about killing one's ancestor, but it is thought illegal for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I believe improving Chinese way of thinking about human rights as Japan. "" - I agree. When I heard this story about old Japanese law in another class, I was very surprised. I cannot believed such a law. That is unconstitutional clearly. Even if there is a strong effect of Confucian philosophy in China, I hope that Chinese way of thinking about human rights is changed. ""anyone should sit the exam to be a legal occupation freely. Such as the first point, human must be treated equally. "" - I agree. I think that more and more kinds of people should be a legal occupation, because they have to aid many kinds of the weaks (the economically disadvantaged people, the physically handicapped people etc. . . ). Thus, they have to have a right understanding of them. "" A person who prepared this question may assume male students. I think that if the person considered female students as well as men, he can't make such a question. What is suspected as a cause of this way of thinking is a low percentage of female legal occupation. I want women take the exam more regardless of opposing wind. "" - I agree. Though this test was checked by many many people, this question was not withdrawn. I cannot believe this. I want to be a lawyer in the future, but I am anxious about a male society.  I can not understand why they decide order. And I can not understand the criterions of this judgment.  This is so an interesting topic for us, the students of law faculty. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam heated arguments on online, for it is a little too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person. The Japanese constitution article 14 says ""all of the people are equal under the law and there shall be no discrimination in political, economic or social relations because of race, creed, sex, social status or family origin. "" This is true even for the people who are in close relationship to us. So we cannot answer the question in the respect of jurisprudence. The question is asked in the examination to be the expert of it. In addition, the test was held by the state. Therefore, it is inevitable for it to be criticized by many people. But, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficult problem they will faced with in the future. The students taking the exam were people who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very, very difficult to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make a fair one everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job.  At first, I was surprised and I thought its test was very very terrible. Because I think that people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion. If we choose to rescue the mother from burning building instead of the girlfriend means admitting discriminating persons with their attributes by the law. In the same situation, I think I will rescue my mother because I spend time longer with her than my girlfriend. But it is the story in emergency and I think the boyfriend should not be blamed even if he chose rescuing his girlfriend. In Japan there was a law about killing one's parent, but it is thought that is not permitted for now because telling murdering ancestors from others is against Japanese constitution. I wish to improve the Chinese way of thinking about human will change like Japan.  I think that I should not add a difference to life. Thanks to mother who gave birth to oneself, the love are great and are surely changed into nothing other. It is about normal exceedingly that I can think in this way. However, as for being one life even if it is life of mother, and being the life that received life again in the world, a girl friend is the same. She has mother and is born in the same way as all. Even if it is mother, life does not have the difference and thinks that you should not attach it. In addition, I think the examination in quest of such a problem to review it.  I agree with your opinion. I also think this question has serious problem and is ridiculous. If I were in this situation, will confuse which should I help. As you say, I also think that we should not compare the human life, because people's lives should be treated equally. But I think that is difficult. I don't think that life itself includes equality, inequity. I think that social handlings include inequity. For a viewpoint closely social as for it for life itself. When a person dies, everybody holds a funeral. By influence during the lifetime, it is different in a scale and contents. I think that the sense of the dignity for the life is the same. I think that after all, the life is not a thing that is not to be able to guess in equality or inequity. It can be only said that all life has a meaning. So, I can not understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it.  I am for your opinion. I think people should be treated equally regardless of sex, position and one's religion, too.  When I read this news first time , I was very surprised . This news point is that the story of a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother, saying his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. I think that this is ridiculous and unbelievable. The life of individual people is equal and we cannot judge which life : mother or girlfriend is more important. There are sentence of ""China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option four days after the exam, saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones"" in this news. But not every people were brought up carefully by own parent. So, I do not agree with this sentence.  I think this problem is very difficult and important to think about crime law system. Now I belong to the law department of Keio University and study law. So I know complexity of this problem and I also know both girlfriend's life and mother's life are so Irreplaceable that I sure they cannot decide which they should save. In the first place, all life is holy equally. But now, often the rule is broken in foreign countries. It becomes the problem about the human rights in every country. And the murder must be permitted in no country. It is not permitted morally. So Cruel organization including IS must not be permitted. On the contrary, saving life is very splendid, I think. The person saving anyone should be praised. In this case, though two people must have died, he was able to save one. When he gets rid of another one, he must be troubled and sorry very much. So we should not make pursuit. He is innocent, I sure.  When I read this article, I was very surprised at the point that law students told that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. I think this problem is difficult to choose which is a crime. So, I wonder why this problem was set question for the National Judicial Exam. Therefore, I want to think about this problem from two situations. At first, I suppose that I am in a position to run the bar examination. I think that considering about multiple choice options is important for the people wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession because the situation they have to judge can happen. If the situation happened and they didn't think about that, they couldn't cope with that situation correctly. And also, if they can't think about an unpredictable problem, they didn't work correctly as a lawyer, a judge. So, I agree to the opinion of state media that the test is most exacting. Secondly, I'm going to think about this problem as a law student. I think this problem is unnecessary. Comparing girlfriend's life with mother's life is totally useless, To begin with, we should not consider that which life of person is more important. In this situation, we didn't know why he decided to save his girlfriend instead of his mother. I think he chose the best way that time. He could not save both his girlfriend and his mother. I think that he helped her like a man in a trance. He did not have the fault. He was exposed to dangerous states, too. The man who saved his girlfriend instead of his mother didn't break law. I think this problem was not suitable for the National Judicial Exam. In this way, I think about it in tow situations. Personally, I prefer the opinion of law student. We should not compare the weight of life. I think this problem is unnecessary in the National Judicial Exam.  I was surprised to read this article. At first I don't understand why they put a question like this on National Judicial Exam. Because I do not think there exits the right answer. Also I don't think we should choose any of which because our lives are equal. I will never understand why they put those questions on the National Exam and they really should haven't. In addition to that Chinese people should complain about the sexist nature of the question. Since the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Chinese female should speak out for that.  I was very surprised when I read this article, because China give a quiz without answer in a national examination. It is different by a person which people help mother or girl friend. National examination is very important examination for keeping the security of the country. And the answer to this problem will be related to the sense of values of the country, so people cannot answer easily this question. Therefore I think that it not good to give a quiz without the answer in a national examination. However if this quiz is given me, I answer that I help my mother, because my mother brought me up and girl friend is still young.  I agree with you. I was very surprised and this news is bad. This question leads to the discrimination of the person. I think that there must not be the discrimination. And if this question is given me, I help mother, too. Probably many people will be same answer. However I think that we should not answer such a question. I wish that thought of China changes.  I agree with you very much. We should not settle the worth of others 'lives because our lives are equal. This question is terribly unsuitable for the National Exam in two points. First point is that the answer and thought about which is more cherished differ from person to person. Second point is that this question is a kind of sexist. I think China have to develop in the aspect of not only economic but also morality. Chinese people have to demand that the government respect the human rights.  I strongly agree with you. I also think that this exam asked the student how they do when they are forced to answer the ultimate question. They must have worried when they looked at the question at first, but this might be the just purpose of the National Judicial Exam.  I think that the test takers of this exam should consider another situation. Because in this modern society, many things would happen. So, lawyers takes many tasks which we cannot expect. In this exam, the test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Test makers do not consider woman's situation. If her house is burning, should woman save her husband, boyfriend, son, or grandfather? If we think about that problem, we have to consider the points which is different from men's situation. For example, in common sense woman is consider to be weak. So, her husband says she save herself. Or after this happening, many people say ""Why don't you save your daughter? As those many things change from his situation. Lawyers should deal with many difficult tasks. Let's look at Japanese situation. In Japan, the equality of woman and man is written in the Japanese law. So, above the law, if woman don't save her husband, nothing is problem. A statement of fundamental rights and privileges (especially the first ten amendments to the United States Constitution) is written in Japan too. As above, many things change in another countries. China has been a complex mix of traditional Chinese approaches and Western influences. Lawyer have to solve many difficult problem according to the custom of his county. The two major Chinese philosophical schools discussed below, Confucianism and Legalism, strongly influenced the idea of law in China. Briefly, under Confucianism, the state should lead the people with virtue and thus create a sense of shame which will prevent bad conduct. Under Legalism, law is to be publicly promulgated standards of conduct backed by state coercion. The tension between these two systems is that Confucianism relies on tradition to make the leader the head of household of all China, while Legalism makes standard law that even the emperor should be bound by. The common factor is that both endorse to different degrees a paternalistic conception of the state, which knows better than its citizens and makes laws to protect them. This concept persisted throughout the imperial period, into the republican period, and can still be seen acting today. I think this topic's problem comes from these Chinese tradition.  When I read this article for the first time, there were some points that I could not be satisfied. First of all, I think this kind of question is a bad question. Why do I think so? Because this kind of question's answer varies to each one's own. I think one's most important things is not defined by one things. Our treasure of life piles up by many occasions. For example, one can make person who can give one's precious love, one is blessed with children, and everyday petty concerns. In this way, our choice of most important things can be different case by case, so this kind of question force to choose only one thing. Therefore this question's answer cannot cast from a single mold. Secondly, this question was a question of national judicial exam. Originally, public examination's answer like National Judicial examination should be only one absolute answer. But as I mentioned before, this kind of question varies person to person, so we cannot make suggested answer by tangible standard. By the way I would like to look this topic from other viewpoints. Maybe among us there is people who are studying to pass the same kind of examination, so we should think enough about and discuss the question which we should give priority to our lovers or parents. And it is natural that this question asked in the exam was controversial on online, for it is too unique one for a state examination. Personally I think, this question is not substantial but must not be simply said to be ridiculous and must be think deeply. Of course, it is impossible to compare the importance of life of each person at ease. So, I guess that the purpose of this question was perhaps to ask the students how they think deal with the many difficulties they will faced with in the future career of lawyer, judge, or a jurist. The students took the exam were candidates who wants to be a lawyer, a judge, or a jurist and play an important part in the judicial world of the next generation. Sometimes they would suffer from the same type of the questions which are very difficult perhaps nearly impossible to make an answer. It is easier to have his or her own answer, but as a professional of law, they must make one fair tangible answer everyone can agree with. In this case, they have to think dispassionately using laws, and sacrificing personal feelings. If the question asked students whether they can do or not in this way, I think it is the greatly meaningful question. In fact, I do not know the real purpose of it, nor the question format. When it was asked by just selecting the two options, it was not so a good question. But when it was asked by description form (opinion question), I think it was an accurate one to know the students' spirit and resolution for their future job.  I have the same idea as yours. This question will lead to discriminate among lives. As you said, ""regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. "" The answer of this question is not important; this question's existence in itself is the important matter. What there is an answer is wrong. At the same time, I can't believe this exam assumed male examinees. Is it able to say to discriminate gender as the mother and the girlfriend? Although I want to be a lawyer in the future, I became afraid about equality. I'll keep my opinion in mind.  I think that this problem of Chinese bar examination is fantastic. I will do choice to help mother if I say forcibly. A woman called mother is mother all the time from now on. However, the girlfriend may not be so. Mother is existence of only the one in space. Furthermore, the correct answer seemed to be mother in the answer of Chinese Ministry of Justice. Still, this problem is very interesting because we can get a glimpse of the human's nature.  I agree with your opinion. I also think this question is very serious problem. We should not prioritize the value of life. Why did person setting this question set it? I can not understand it. However, there may be Chinese cultural background which Japanese can not understand. So, if we thought this problem deeply, we would need to know not only it but also Chinese cultural background. Personally, I have a Chinese friend. So, I want to ask him how he thinks about this problem.  I agree with your opinions. If I were him, I would get confused. Both of them are important people for him. I can not choose only one person. It is strange that mother should be saved over his girlfriend. Indeed his girlfriend is likely to escape the fire on her own, but we should not treat their life irrespective of position. Life is equal. We must realize again the importance of it I was surprised when I read your opinion, and I was convinced. After thinking it over carefully, it's a discrimination for girls. Surely, this article is lack of consideration. It was written in boys' view. We need a point of view of gender. For example, Boys don't necessarily save girls. So we need to consider some of gender problem.  I think that this question is too difficult. Our lives are equal and should be equal. So the question which makes students choice which to help is ridiculous and nonsense. And I cannot believe that China's Ministry of Justice said that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. They mean helping girlfriends over parents is illegal. However if I were in such a situation, probably I would choose to help my mother. There are some reasons why I think so. First, mother is only one. Nobody can take place of her and my mother raised me for a long time. The other reason is that girlfriend is younger than mother. So the possibility of escape of girlfriend is higher than mother. For these reasons I would choose to help my mother. However I hope this kind of situation will not come true.  I agree with you. This kind of question doesn't have genuine correct answer. Person's life should be viewed equally each person. If we come across this kind of ultimate situation, we should choose a choice which any regret doesn't remain behind our choice.  Lawyers and judges need to have knowledge and skills to deal with many legal issues. Trainee lawyers and judges might have to solve a life-threatening issues if they are able to be the legal professions. However, I think that those questions are not suitable questions toward trainee lawyers and judges, because this situation is very serious and they will probably lose their power of accurate and clam judgment in that situation. To be sure, the legal professions must have the ability to judge and make the right assessment under any circumstances, but I think that the judgment to legal issues and the threat to life of family are completely different. It seems to enjoy the reactions of examinees. In addition, this question lets examinees to be weighed the importance of life in a balance. That is an unbecoming way for the legal professions to behave. Therefore, no matter how many times I tried to understand the meaning of the question, I cannot get the drift. I thought a crucial choice does not need on a legal examination after considering that question and its main points.  I think that saving girlfriend instead of mother is not crime. Saving girlfriend itself is great thing, even if you can't save your mother. If I am faced with this situation, however , I will save my mother instead of my girlfriend. There is only one mother in the world, but girlfriend isn't only one in the world. If there is crime in this case, it is that you don't understand the importance of your mother . It is also true that father is only one around the world . so you should know your father is great and willing to save him instead of your boyfriend.  When I read this article, for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. And I feel it is very difficult to understand this problem. I feel that the lawyers and judges have to have many knowledges about strange case. But there are many points that I can not consent to. To begin with, the law which legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones are strange. Originally, people's lives are equal so everyone have tone dealt with equally by the law. So I think it is ridiculous to decide how to deal with this problem. But helping mother have a point in some aspects. There are many girls in the world, but my mother is a only one. So depending on the idea, this way of thinking is possible. But If i faced this situation, I would ask my girlfriend.  I think that China's Ministry of Justice is not right. It is mainly because people's lives are equal. If it was almost impossible to help mother and it was almost possible to help girlfriend, should I go to help mother although both mother and girlfriend would die? It is ridiculous that I miss the life of girlfriend, which I can help and try to help the life of mother, which I cannot help because it is illegal to help girlfriend Human should be treated impartially. It is wrong to compare the life of the person and to give an answer. I doubt Chinese sense of values.  I am against your opinion. Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us. However, this is an examination question to the last. In other words, a proper answer exists. According to Ministry of Justice, it is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that the person who chose to help the girlfriend is imposed for the crime by what ""Crime of non-action"" that is nothing did. Apart from the contents of the problem, I think that it is established as a problem for the time being as far as there is such a proper answer. Still, I can never deny the opinion that this problem is against morality.  I think it is so difficult to answer this problem so both my mother and girlfriend are valuable persons. But if I need to have this answer, I will try to rescue my mother from a burning building over my girlfriend. Certainly, many people may criticize me for sacrificing my girlfriend but I think it is the best idea which has a possibility to be able to save both lives. Naturally my mother is older and weaker than my girlfriend so the person who needs to help is my mother. Even if it is an all-or-nothing contest, I want to select the means which do not compare my mother with my girlfriend but sacrifice nobody. If I answer this idea, I cannot pass the National Judicial Exam because I don't choose either woman. But I don't think if someone rescues his girlfriend over his mother, the action is a crime. That is because there are many ways of thinking who should be rescue and we don't know which way is right. Though in Edo era, the idea that we should treat our parents respectfully than any other person was more deep-rooted than now, nowadays I think the idea that all people are treated equally generally become to spread. So whichever woman you choose, it is true. The important thing is that you have enough consideration to both women.  When I read this article first time, I was surprised that such a difficult and controversy question like choosing his mother's or girlfriend's life was included in the National Judicial Exam in China. However, I strongly believe that the question was very nice and worth question in that test. There are two reasons for my idea. First, questions that the public cannot decide only one right answer exist a lot in the world. If future judges and lawyers pass the test, they are obliged to deal with questions that we cannot decide one right answer. Second, although the question like choosing mother or girlfriend's life does not have only one right answer, judges and lawyers should hear and understand all answers. In addition, they judge that something is good or bad just only based on laws and their conscience. Next, I would like to talk about the rightness of the answer of the question. China's Ministry of Justice confirmed it was the correct option saying that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. I think this answer is out of date. Modern societies' paradigm is based on egalitarianism. According to legal equality, it is not forgiven for a son not only to be prior his mother's life to his girlfriend's life but also to be prior his girlfriend's life to his mother's life. Therefore, it is ridiculous that his not to rescue his mother from a deadly fire before others, including his relatives and loved ones, amounts to a criminal failure to act. As a result, I think it is natural that he is not guilty. By the way, the writer told us that the question included in the aspect of sexual discrimination. I strongly agree with this idea because the test assumes the test takers are male as the writer told. Of course, should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? Finally, I would like to talk about my choice for this question. Apart from legal reasons, I am prior to my mother's life basically. However, if I decide to marry my girlfriend, I rescue my girlfriend before my mother. The reason is the importance of my following life. I believe that my finance is more important than my mother for my following life.  I agree with your idea. As you said, the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lacking in persuasiveness. If China's Ministry of Justice mentioned enough reasons, this question cannot become a question, because people's lives are equal. If I faced such situation, I would try to help the both.  I strongly agree with this idea. I also believe the problem which chooses his girlfriend's life or his mother's life doesn't have only one right answer. People's lives are equal. Therefore, we cannot decide it. If we are such a situation as a matter of fact, we will be upset and be not able to determine. I cannot comprehend that people in China are legally forced saving their parents over other relatives and loved ones. Moreover, you said, ""the best way is saving all of them, so we have to think this way every time. "" I think that this idea is the perfect answer to the ultimate question.  I agree with your opinion. They lacked an important viewpoint of the equality of human life for this examination of China. They who made this examination should think about ethics once again. I think the true answer to this question should be logically explanation about equality of the life and this question was strange to ignore the ethic.  I was very surprised to read that the question, ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"", I agree with the person's idea who think that people's lives are equal, so they should be treated equally by the law. Of course ""Girls are everywhere, but I only have one mum. "" But, saving only mother from a deadly fire is not correct option I think. Regardless of whether he is only morally responsible or he has a duty to support, the two lives are equal and can't be compared in terms of the degree of importance. And, I cannot understand the reason why a question setting person sets the question like that. Hundreds of thousands of trainee lawyers and judges in China don't need it. Probably, it based on idea of Confucianism. It thinks that I make a great difference whether it is not a family or a family. As for making much of parents, this idea is great I think. But this question is not suited for in the National Judicial Exam, which anyone wanting to enter the judiciary or legal profession must pass. National Judicial Exam in China should change the way of test. People's lives are equal, so we should treat them equally. I think this question doesn't have a correct answer. So I think this is a ridiculous question. Chinese thinking is old therefore this must be changed in order to up-to-date If I encounter this situation, what I should do? I do not know. Well, I do not have girlfriend so this question may not relation to me.  I agree with your opinion. This test made in China is very strange and terrible, because the question ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" means to compare the value of one's life. I think that we should not do such a thing, and this test ""Whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire"" made the Chinese to do such a thing. So I think this test is strange and terrible. Then, I wish that Chinese have different way from this test to think about human's life, at first. After that I want to think this problem how to treat a life of human any more from now on. And we should think that how to spread one's mind or thinking to other people who has different opinions. It is always difficult thing, I think. But I want to exchange our opinion with people who has different opinions and foreigners more! I have never come up with that idea. They might be thinking by Confucian way. But you should not say that it is a old way to think, because there are a lot of things you can learn from they way people used to think. So I think it might be better if they put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism.  The most interesting point of this article was the difference between the ways of reading text of man and woman, I thought. This theme made me remember an event I experienced when I attended the class of Germany. In that class, teacher said ""Please translate this word 'niche meiner Schwiegermutter' from Germany into Japanese. "". This mean 'my mother-in-law's niece' in English. Of course I meant she is my wife's mother's niece. But my girl class mates meant her husband's niece. Though we read the same sentence, the different character we saw in the sentence! It's not a surprising thing generally at all. But, since I usually relatively deal man and woman as same thing, I strongly felt the difference of sex there. So, when I saw the opinion""The test clearly assumes the test takers are male. Should a woman save her father or her boyfriend first? "", I remember this memory.  When I read this article, I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So, I think that National Judicial of Exam should review their idea .  When I read this article , I was surprised at the thing which human is not treated equally. So I think National Judicial of Exam should review their idea.  I strongly agree with your idea that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have answer, and people's life is equal, so we cannot decide it. However, we must make an effort to understand the doctrine of Confucianism which is deeply connected with the Chinese culture. The Confucian has moral concept indicating that a child has to follow faithfully to the parent. This is in the root of the doctrine. This is why the answer that we have to save our mother in situations where the mother and girlfriend are drowning can be understood. I hear that teaching of this Confucianism parents unconditionally is based on the premise that love children. Based on this condition, in the situation where a child and husband are drowning, what selection a wife should chose? I agree with the points of that I cannot understand the intention of this question either, but I do not think that Chinese people usually help their mother or father because of Confucianism. Even if they have a religious thought of Confucianism, they might be not influenced by those religious thought. If they make decisions that they help their mother or girlfriend with the religious thought, and that seems to be considered the life of a girlfriend is not treated equally. That goes against the legal mind. I think examinees should think calmly and write an answer without any religious problems. However, this question probably does not have an answer. In addition, I do not understand what the general idea of the Chinese and European is. I do not think they have a specifically idea that they might help their girlfriend. I also think who need to know an answer of the question, but I thought people who made this examination want to know the response capabilities of the trainees in a serious situation.  The law is quite silly. The correct answer depends on many different factors. Do you and your wife or girlfriend have a child together? If yes you should save her before you save your mother. How old is your mother. . . . if your mother is over 60 you should save your girlfriend first. . . . She potentially has more years left to live. There are many other factors, like their health, how much you love them, and which one's death would affect less people in a negative way.  I disagree with your idea. It goes without saying that the problem and the answer exist. It is not logical that ""there is the appropriate answer because this is the problem of the examinations"" in your criticism for my having criticized the answer that China's Ministry of Justice thought about. You cannot understand my thought and what I want to say. On the examination of China's Ministry of Justice, the answer that they thought about is, not to mention, right, and in contrast, considering our ethic and moral, the answer is wrong completely. You should have the idea same as my idea because you said, ""Surely the life of people is equal, and there will not be the right to choose a life of either mother or girl friend as us. "" I want you to reconsider my opinion and this article well once again.  I agree with your opinions which the reason of China's Ministry of Justice is lack of persuasiveness. I can't understand people are legally obligated to save their parents over other relatives and loved ones in China. I think that there are rights to choose option.  Of course, I know, creatures of life is important and equal. However I think that thinking this question is not a problem because it is a mere question. So, I disagree with your opinion.  I think so too. I think we are not able to answer this question. Our lives are equal. In my opinion, the question which forces students to choose which person will you help is itself nonsense. However taking it into consideration that the question is made in China, it may be influenced by the thinking of the Confucianism, which say we should take good care of older people. I can not help thinking that the man or woman who made this question is so stupid.  I think that test makers have all responsible. This incident is, in summarize, that answer in the National Judicial Exam is against ethics. Moreover, there are several choices in question. Test makers should consider choices in question when they make exams and weren't criticized about choices in question from general people. Especially, the exam is the National Judicial Exam. Test makers should pay attentions very much and they knew that. If the incident occurred in Japan, it will become a very big problem in society. The incident occurred in China, needless to say, it became the one of biggest problems in China. By the way, why did such a incident accrue radically? Fault of the National Judicial Exam system? Lack of test makers? I don't think such reasons. I think that the reason is separation between law and common sense. Of course, in common there is separation between law and common sense, but it isn't allowed because it accrues such a big problem. It runs short of test maker's efforts only to solve this problem. All people who know law much must do their best to solve this problem. If they do, this big problem will be solved in future. Moreover, there is the problem in only China. The problem may occur in Japan and there is some possibility of doing. Not becoming so, we always pay attention for separation between law and common sense. I as one parson learning laws will consider this problem and this incident.  I agree with your opinion. Originally, we can't decide value of human life and all people's lives are equal. I can't choose girlfriend or mother. However, Chinese government decided value of human life by legislation. Chinese government's decision and the question were allowed against ethnic. I was very sad to think people answering the question which don't have answer in the National Judicial Exam. So I think Chinese concerned with law should protest Chinese government's decision and disagree with Chinese government's answer. Such incident may occur in Japan. when it occur in Japan, I will protest Japanese government's decision and disagree with Japanese government's answer. Certainly, law is a strong rule, but the most important thing is that ethics is one of the strong rules, too.  I can understand what you want to say, but just calm down and take a deep breath. I recommend you to reread this article again. The question is just the story of man. Is it right to say that the question is really sexism? I cannot think in that way at all. I am sorry to say, but you are a little too sensitive.  You are right. we would upset and couldn't make a good decision if we were in such situations. There is also the possibility that we wouldn't help neither of them. To summarize, the question is nonsense.  I disagree with your idea that the girlfriend is not only one in the world. Actually, it is sure that the girlfriend doesn't have her clones. Her individual life is the only one that no one else has. Then on the term of life value, you can't compare to each other. But i understand that understanding the importance of your father and mother is quite necessary. Without thinking about legitimacy or crime, we should maybe save our parents because they raise us with money that they earn. If we lost them, we would have to live off ourselves. On this point of view, we can't say that saving girlfriend or boyfriend is better.  have to live off ourselves. On this point of view, we can't say that saving girlfriend or boyfriend is better.  When I read this article, I found that all human being are not treated equal in China. First, China law says a man who chose to save his girlfriend from a burning building over his mother will be a criminal, and second, even though this is The National Judicial Exam, very formal, it clearly assumes the test takers are male and don't consider female. When I saw this problem at first time, I think it didn't have one answer but the reason is important. However, according to China's Ministry of Justice, 'A son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones. ' It is true that we should respect our parents who raised us. And I can understand the opinion that girlfriend is younger than mother, so she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own. However, I think it is wrong that the law decides and compares people's lives. By the way, our country, Japan had a similar law before. Parricide murderer was punished more severely than other murderer. But for a long time this law had been criticized that violated Japanese constitution which say people should be treated equal, and was finally annihilated in 1995. I hope China also will realize it is a serious problem that human rights are unequal.  I agree with your opinion that the problem choosing girlfriend or mother doesn't have the answer. If I were in the same situation, I could not choose answer. Ministry of Justice said to save parents over other relatives and loved ones was the correct option. However, I also think that its reason was lack of persuasiveness and it is not suitable for the important exam.  I can understand his opinion because many people do not realize the importance of their mother.  I think so too. We should treat our lives equally. The host decided the true answer was helping his mother. However, I think helping his girlfriend also respectful action. And I also think such question do not have useful to people who take the exam. They should learn more useful things for helping people by using law. I think, they should have a widely view.  First of all, I am thinking in this way. If there is a girlfriend I love for me, I choose the girl friend over my mother. Although, so many answer, so many people. I think China is backward on the legal field. In China, the traditional values of the Confucianism influence lows. However, this is not compatible with the new global standard. Looking from different angles, the law is a rule which lay down difference of value between ascendants and others. The present day, there is no this kind of law in developed countries. For example, Japanese current Penal Code replaced the provision about murder of ancestor in 1995. China should extinguish the law or change the legal interpretation. There is an opposition to Ministry of Justice, a Chinese lawyer said ""a son is legally obligated to save his parents. So if he doesn't help his family when his family is at stake while he can help him/her, he is accused of negligence. However, if he can help one before the other is injury, it will not be accused to put off the mother. "" I agree him. Finally, when I read the last paragraph, I couldn't understand perfectly the meaning. Isn't this by chance? I wondered. That's probably one of the evidence of that feminism is backward in Japan.  I disagree your opinion. But I think that your opinion is very interesting. I think that it is very difficult thing for everyone to see one's mother's die, because she has brought up us for a long long times. And mother is one person who is related to us by blood directly all over the world, so it is impossible for us to compare these two people and think whether they would save their girlfriend or mother from a deadly fire. I think mother must be one's only mother, and most valuable person.  I have some questions to your opinion. What do you think that they should decide criterion a of this judgment? This article is about the ultimate moral decision. There are questions and arguments that will never be solved or receive consensus from everyone. There are always being positive and negative stance and idea for any topic discussed. However, what I am talking about here is that the issue that includes a wide variety of opinions. In addition, the argument of the article, whether to save your mother or girlfriend, has neither majority nor minority stance. What I mean is that there are 50% for both opinions such to save your mother is right or to save your girlfriend is right. I thought about this issue for a while but never come up with a definite answer. And found out how silly this argument is. As I said, this argument is about moral of priority. China as a country states that your mother is more important that your girlfriend which is about the priority of moral. For example, I think saying something bad about someone pointing his or her back from behind is a bad thing to do. However, this kind of behavior usually is not counted as a crime. Of course, in some case when the situations are way too serious, that kind of act are counted as a crime and punishment will be executed. Other than those special situations, saying bad things about someone is very normal things to do for most people. Therefore, I felt the very awkward first time I read this article. There will never be a definite answer. The only way to end the discussion is to not to think about it.  I agree with you. I think the question doesn't have an answer. It is not suitable for official exam's question.  I have the same ideas on some points, but I disagree with your main opinion. As you know, this question is for the official judicial examination, so it doesn't ask us ""Which do you help?"", and ask people who will be lawyer/judge/public prosecutor if his actions amounted to a criminal failure to act. As far as there is the law, this case is possible to occur, and successful candidates have to work with the law. So, this question makes sense and suit for the official judicial examination. In my opinion, China should delete or change the law for both person to be judged and person to judge.  When I read this article, I was surprised that to save girlfriend became your crime. However, it is difficult to decide which is better. People's life is equal, but if that choice turn weather family or others, most of the people may save family fast.  At first, I was really surprised that Chinese people made the question at such a serious exam like the National Judicial Exam. And it is ridiculous that saving girlfriend instead of mother is a crime. We don't know who would be the first that we would save. It really depends on the situation especially in emergency situation. For example, in this article, one man said if his mother and his girlfriend in the burning building, he would definitely save his mother first. However, if his mother was still be able to walk very well and she was just by the front door and his girlfriend was in the furthest room from the front door, I think he would go to save his girlfriend first. It is okay that we discuss this question in private or not serious situation, but I thought it is very sad that many people have to choose one in the exam. We have no rights to judge people who said he or she would save his girlfriend or her boyfriend instead of mother. I really agree with the opinion in this article that people's lives are equal and the law should treat them equally. I think it is very inappropriate to ask many trainee lawyers and judges such question.  I agree with your opinion. Our choice depends on not only blood relation ship but also in the situation where we are. I think nobody wants to compare the worth of our lives but I think some people might say that he would save his girlfriend instead of his mother because he likes his girlfriend better than his mother. But of course people's lives are equal so it is wrong that many trainee lawyers and judges are forced to answer such question.  I thought it is true that the question made people compare the value of people's lives. It means the person or the organization which made this question don't think that people's lives are equal. We might not save both of them, depending on the situation but we can't judge.  Some years ago, there were TV show named ""Harvard intensive class"" (Japanese title: Harvard nekketsu kyoushitsu), which was hosted by some university professors and they gave some topic to audience and made audience think about that topic. I still remember one of their topic was ""if your train was about to crush into 5 people on the right side of the road and you found only one person on the left side, would you try to make train take left? in this situation, you would kill one person, but you would save five person. is it better? "" When I saw this news article, I suddenly recalled this program. I'm not sure what was the best answer, but professor on TV said it is the matter of whether we choose good result or good moral. I'm sure there is no answer and at the same time there are so many answers. Justice does not exist in only one way. and also what people think is Justice is not true justice sometimes. For example, I think the way of United States treat other countries especially communist countries is as if there are no justice without violence and war. It might be. but is it justice if it is filled with blood or death? what I wrote might get off the subject, but I wanted to say people should not decide what is 100 percent true justice and what is not. especially for the people who will judge people in future, they should not have one certain typical way of seeing something. if they label crime and justice, crime will not be understood why it is happened because people who judge it have ""typical cause and effect label"" In order to grow good layer, this exam question should be changed. and also gender slight should be lost as well.  I have belonged to the Faculty of Law Department of Law and I learn the laws, such as the Constitution, civil law and criminal law. The civil law and criminal law among them is easy to relate to us. Court give a variety of judgment by the situations in the case of performing the trial using the civil law. For example, judgment is changed by how many circumstances can the victim know in the fraud. But criminal law adopts basically nulla poena sine lege and court can't give a crime not to be written in the provision. Chinese criminal code adopts nulla poena sine lege too. Then, Japanese court give the judgment like above case in the Chinese criminal law? As a result of the search, the case taken up greatly wasn't exist but some people said it was exist. The people has a variety of opinion about a judgment court have ever give. But, even if we must help our mother to obey the criminal law, they are human. I am a civil service examination to become a government worker and some the problem of a examination let me answer what judgment the accused should accept. I don't want the problem like which case I accept a judgment.  I agree with you deeply. Who should be saved in this situation? I think the only answer is that it depends on the situation of their relationship. The relationship between the son and mother is not always deeper than the girl friend. And the condition of the two ladies does not expect from this document. So, I also think that this question is ridiculous.  I have a same opinion. This is a serious ethical problem. To take this exam, the new lawyers are decided. But, this question cannot answer unless they paralyze their fair feeling.  In addition to my former opinion, I didn't know that the system of becoming a lawyer is really different from the country. In Japan, the bar exams yield the least number of successful candidates worldwide. The old format of the examinations, last held in 2010 saw only 6% passing the exam.  It is difficult the simulation. I can't answer the question. I think that if I choose one, I regret the answer. So , the question is so difficult for me.  I think that it is so difficult question to answer. Many people think that both their own mother and girlfriend will be safe is the best way. In the article, there is an idea like that. """"I would definitely save my mother first. Apart from legal reasons, my mother raised me. Plus my girlfriend is younger, which means she has a better chance of escaping the fire on her own, "" one man reasoned"" (quoted from the article) This is understandable. Simply, this question is too extreme speculation. I can not choose which way is better , if really I were in that kind of situation. Law students are also same. However wise in the terms of law, it is difficult to answer and to think from the sight of lawyer. This kind of question is too difficult, but I think it is meaningful think this question seriously and consider over this question from a lot of sights.  I agree with your idea. The question's answer change the situation for example both people's damaged, age and location. Lawyers should treat equally people's life. The simulation is useful for lawyers because they can train themselves.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. It is unbelievable to ask such question in national compulsory test. I have ever heard this question by my friends and it was interesting to think about the answer. My friend said that she asked this question to her boyfriend and he said he rescue his mother first on the spot so she quarrel with him. I think this question is interesting to debate with friends, but this is not worth asking in official exam. This is proper for asking with friends or in psychological test. This question have no correct answer so it can not to be graded. If the right answer is fixed, this is immoral question because people's lives are all equal. Deciding order to rescue at fire is wrong. In China, people who enter the judicially or legal profession must pass this test but I think this question is no relation to a trial. On the other hand, sexual problem is serious in China. This question should be rewritten to gender equality form. China is too thoughtless in various aspects so they should be more careful to decide the question in national exam and sexual expressions.  I agree with your opinion. I also think that life of each person has same importance. We should not think which life of person is more important than others. Although the answer of this question is controversial, people have to notice that everyone has equal level importance of life.  I feel sad to read this article, because the people who took that exam had to answer this question which do not have correct answer. People's life is equal. The order to rescue people's life should not be decided before. When we faced such a difficult situation, we have no time to choose the person who are rescued. But it is sure that a son is legally obligated to save his parents over other relatives and loved ones is not correct. This answer will be changed by the situation. My image about China, Chinese people respect their parents so much. But I feel woman's social status is still low position. About the sexist nature of the question, I feel sad. Because it is the outcome of the delay of the social advance of the woman. I think woman in China should insist more their right and social status. If the way of thinking of people changes, such a question will disappear from a test.  I agree with you. This question is too ridiculous and no need to ask in national test. I think the best answer is to try to rescue both mother and girlfriend. It is very difficult to make decision that who to save on priority and it have no means for people. Make people who take the test think about to rank human lives is foolish idea. I think there is more important thing to ask in the test before asking such a question, for example, sexist problem.  I also think this question is too ridiculous. This question does not have the correct answer. We should praise the fact he saved human life even if he saved whichever of mother or girlfriend. People's lives are equal.  I do not agree with your opinion. Certainly, it is difficult for me to save both of them. But I can't be businesslike about a matter like you and think. When I have to make a decision which to save, I will upset. It is not good, but I can't choose which to save.  I am opposite your opinion. I felt the point is not that in this article. It is more important than to save mother or girlfriend that the question exists only for men. We have to recognize that seriously. We have recognized the wrong. Over the recent years, the Japanese society has come to gender equality. However, it has become a serious problem in the India. For example, situations such as marriage of women would buy with the money. Our eyes have to look at the world not only Japanese society.  I researched. The category of this question. It becomes ""Crime of Omission (crime of omission)"". The crime that is realized by not performing an artificiality act of the ""uniformity with the crime of omission according to Koujien. There is it with ""When I make it plain, it is a crime to happen by not having done something. For example, it is a plain example to let you result in death without mother giving a baby rice. In addition, I include that I give another person it in silence while knowing it with the drink which harm enters. Chinese Ministry of Justice disclosed an answer later. The answer to this question was ""mother"". According to Ministry of Justice, It is said that the examinee should prefer the duty as the child to romantic love, and it is said that it is imposed on the person whom I chose when I help her for the crime by what ""Crime of non-action"" that is nothing did. I receive questions and the answer to this problem, and there is various opposition on the net. The problem to choose person either other as with mother at the time of ""emergency is funny. ""According to the ""law, the son has a duty to help mother. However, time when there is jeopardized another person is not written down in the law in the same way there. ""There is the ""woman anywhere. But mother is only one. I surprised this news. The way of thinking in China is not good. These examination questions vs. did it, and had a question, and how long would there be the confused student? If I will solve this problem, I am confused and will not understand to hear the answer either.  I am against this test about the law of China. I think that it is strange that, of two acts to give priority to life of his mother or that of girlfriend, one becomes the criminal act, and the other is justified. It is not the figure which it should be of the law to regulate that you should give priority to the life of parents over other relatives and lovers. It is not the law that is suitable for the modern nation. In addition, I was surprised that a test to give such a nonsense question was ""one of the most exacting national tests in China"". It is not a bad thing to choose which choice, because the choice is decided by sense of values and subjective differences in each person. Therefore, the law should provide a flexible environment to accept the way of thinking of various people because the law should be existence not only to regulate the action of people, but also give freedom to the nation. The traditional custom and way of thinking are various in each country and area and local culture should be respected basically, but as a student learning law, I think that it is not good that such an irrational law custom exists. I want this old custom to be more flexible and rational.  I totally agree your opinion. how can put priority to human right? everyone must be equal and we cannot decide until we are putted in that situation. it is not matter what they chose and no one should be blame even that kind of situation was happened.  I definitely against your opinion. It is obvious that Confucianism is very old. Confucianism was completed in 13th. Although contemporary philosophy keeps evolving in 21th. Is there concept of equality between the sexes or comprehension to LGBT? Of course not. Actually, there are some important lesson - for example, we should look after our parents well. However, we can't ""put the concept of the equalization into Confucianism"". I seem that almost Chinese don't think it is a virtue to help their mother with victim of their girlfriend now. It is impossible to keep pace with modern society while they put Confucianism on the central part of their values. So I think it might be better if they get the new ideology with the essence of Confucianism.  I agree with your answer that the question doesn't have the answer. If we fall into that situation, we need to save people without adhering to the curious thought which we should parents firstly.  I agree with you. All lives are equal. We can not say the answer. I think that this kind of question goes too far. I understand it is interesting because this question is too extreme too answer. I suppose that the answer to this question is not so important but imagining the situation and thinking what should we do is important. I think the answer is only date but the time we use for thinking what we should do is very meaningful for us. Actually, if we were in that kind of situation, I think we will make effort to help the both of them.  I was surprised at this news. I think that there are not any collect answers of the question which was taken up in this article. I think it is an impertinent question. We should treat every people's lives fairly. However, some people who set this question, think that mother's life is more important than girlfriend's life. It is terrible. I hope that they correct theirs mistakes.  I think so too. I think this question is impertinent because it doesn't treat two lives fairly. If I come upon such as scene, I will not be able to select one. If I save one person, another person die. Of course, if I can't decide, two lives are sacrificed. In the end, even if we do anything in this scene, nobody knows correct answer. Yesterday, I found a site on the Internet. It was known as ""can see only once in a lifetime"". The site asks you to choose your mother or a strange child. I think many people choose their mother. Then a strange child die. Even if you reload the site, the site display a message ""There won't be a second time"". So, you can't save a strange child's life. I think we should treat all lives fairly. However, there are the scene that we must choose one answer, even so there are not correct answer. It is the most important that you believe yourself.  I was surprised at time when I read this article. This is because it is difficult whether I help a parent when oneself faced a crisis, or you help a lover. I really think that I cannot start answering that I do not face a crisis. This agenda was very difficult, and I thought that the conclusion was not given.  I agree with your opinion. The law's purpose is to judge the people but it doesn't force the action to the people. My mother and girlfriend are important for me and humans. I think the situation I can help only one person is the unusual one. If I can help two people, I will help the absolute two people. The problem I think this question isn't suitable as a question of judicial examination. "
JOC JOC-15B-16N 7.37 "I was very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time. Additionally, I was very surprised to hear that Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. If it is true, this decision should not be allowed and should be overturned. Recently, there was injustice such as emblem relating to Tokyo Olympic in 2020. I feel that there are so many injustice relating to sports. I strongly believe that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way.  Corruption of the soccer world is not to have begun in now. A bribe and the purchase of Juventus, put-up games are taking place many times. Because a demon of the soccer world appeared on the face in this way, you should stare at the soccer world taking advantage of this again.  I had shocked when I heard this news. I think the sport, from the soccer down, should not be used a dirty money. This is occasion of declining content. Soccer and baseballs bribe news reached our ears. Of course these sports are popularity so, reached our ears. But still this is not good situation.  When I read this news, I couldn't contain my anger. People who hold responsible posts should act rationally. If they receive a bribe, they lose their trust from people. I expect their future activities that get them regaining their trust.  When I heard this news for the first time, I was very shocked. Football is one of the popular sports, of course I like it. Hearing such the news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. This news is a good example, Due to some people's action, many problem is appeared. Actually, when I heard that the host country of 2022 World Cup was decided Qatar, I think that why Qatar were decided. However, being these problems, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Nowadays, there are many news of gambling. This move can connect decreasing the popularity of the sport, so I wish these actions would disappear.  I was quite shocked about a corruption problem of FIFA. Because FIFA is the organization of the very big soccer, and the soccer World Cup FIFA sponsors is a very popular meet as well as Olympics. Wonderful protuberance is also shown by World Cup in Japan. Such, I can't hide surprise from being corruption by the authoritative organization internationally. I'll reform the organization and want you to be the sound organization immediately.  I like soccer very much. I have practiced soccer for 12 years. So I'm sorry to hear the news like this. But soccer regularly captures headlines around the globe for its nail-biting action. But on Wednesday, May 27, the sport captured people's attention for a different reason. More than a dozen FIFA officials were arrested on corruption charges in Zurich, Switzerland after a four-year investigation by the US government. To begin with FIFA is the French acronym for the Federation Internationale de Football Association. In the U.S. , football is known as soccer. The organization, headquartered in Zurich, oversees 209 national soccer associations and puts together tournaments, including the World Cup. FIFA makes billions from this international tournament held every four years. Much of this money comes from TV broadcast rights and marketing deals. US officials charged 14 people with 47 criminal charges related to bribery. A dozen different schemes were included in the formal charges. Prosecutors said that hundreds of millions of dollars in illegal payments were made to unfairly influence media rights deals and the outcome of FIFA elections. ""We welcome the actions and the investigations by the U. S. and Swiss authorities, "" said FIFA president Sepp Blatter. ""[We] believe it will help to reinforce measures that FIFA has already taken to root out any wrongdoing in football. "" Blatter was reelected to a fifth term on May 29, despite calls to postpone the election amid the investigationss. I was surprised that though there was such a case, Russian President Vladimir Putin said that Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize. I think this is ridiculous. So that soccer continues being loved by many people, I pray for FIFA becoming the group deserving Nobel Peace prize truly without causing a corruption case in the future.  When I heard this news, I had a feeling like that ""I'm hearing such news relates corruption almost every day. "". I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a crime.  It is a pity that Sepp Blatter and MIchel Platini, who are the most influential persons of football society, acted bribery. FIFA is one of the biggest sports institutions of the world , and football is one of the most popular sports, so I want it act properly and improve environment of football. As it is professional, it is natural that it expects economic effect, but we mustn't forget that the role of FIFA is not only developing football but also becoming an element of cooperation between countries and nations. I like football very much and have played it for more than ten years , so I hope football society advancing more and more. This kind of matter can prevent football from advancing well, so I can't forgive any bribery.  Bribery and corruption are unavoidable throughout the world. Even in Japan, it is not only foreign affair but that exists in this country. However, FIFA is international association so that they should act quite fairly. As United Nation isn't working well, we have to organize many things in order and must clarify many evils. Football is popular sports all over the world, which means that there are many fans especially children in poor countries. Football is regarded as simple sport that anyone can play and require only a ball. It gives hopes and fineness to everybody, so there shouldn't be any corruption in that world.  I like football so I've heard the rumor of corruption before. But this was the first time to read on newspaper. I know Blatter has done so many great things by using football as a tool make two countries cooperate and so on. And he might have deserved to get Nobel peace Prize, if he had not done the bribery. There should not be money involved in any sports because it would make them so boring. I remember when Korea cheated in FIFA World Cup in 2002. Basically they gave money to the referee and that ruined the whole match in that World Cup. We should keep it clean by any means.  I am not the first time that I hear the news of this type of story. It makes us distrust about sports. Watching sports becomes lively simply because it is a fair fight, and the fighting person performs it seriously. These are basics of sports and are what you must certainly follow. So I think that corruption is often bad news when I heard this word. But, by this article Russian President Vladimir Putin said ""Blatter has done a great deal to develop football and cooperation between peoples and nations and, therefore, deserves a Nobel Peace Prize"". This remark is a remark to deserve praise for the corruption. I can not understand exactly if his contribution into the world's humanitarian sphere is huge as he was always trying to use football not only as sports but also as an element of cooperation between countries and nations. From this article we should learn a way of the right corruption.  I agree with your opinion. This kind of news often reached our ears. Sports such as soccer, baseball should be fair. There may be some people who lost the trust about sports. So, we should be careful not to get up by such a case.  I somewhat disagree with your opinion. Of course bribery is bad thing and never be allowed, but in many sports broadcasting in TV, money-making is one of the most important thing. The move of connecting sports and business is now prosperous. For example, there is an institution that forecast victory or defeat of football games, that is called TOTO. TOTO is popular gambling of sports. Sports and money can't completely cut off.  I got shocked read this article. But many soccer funs have been noticed that FIFA is corrupted and receive a bribe. So I was shocked but was no surprised. In the wake of this I hope that FIFA will be reborn and be a clean organization. By the way Not only in soccer but also many sports such as in baseball we often hear about the bribe. They people who are involved are rich enough. Why do they offer such dirty money? I cannot understand that.  I agree with your opinion. Like this gambling news in sport respect may be some people who lost the trust about sports. I suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA. Gambling and bribe is occasion of declining content. I wish these actions would disappear too.  I agree with your opinion. I was also very shocked to know that there had been a corruption in FIFA for a long time, hearing such a news, we can't enjoy the sport naturally, and soccer effects the global affairs by now. Also, watching Putin's action, it is clear that the presence of the intrigues is started. Like you, I also suspect that the FIFA's decision on holding the world cup in 2018 in Russia was done by corruption between Russia and FIFA, we have no choice but to doubt Platini and Blatter. I wish that people who are engaged in all kinds of sports activity should not work in a corrupt way.  I agree with you. Certainly, FIFA was corrupted and reserved many bribes. I have heard the rumors that other sport organizations is corrupted several times. I can't understand doing such a things, too. However, FIFA will try to become clear organization. About dirty of other sport organization, many people will know it in near future.  When I read this article, I couldn't hide my surprise. I like soccer very much, so I knew all the name which mentioned in this article. They were all fantastic football player in the pasty days. However, they breeded graft and corruption. Did they lose their sportsmanship? I think they should be strongly blamed for this corruption.  I felt the same as you. I was completely stunned by the news of FIFA corruptions. I have being a lover of football for a long time and always watch the game during the weekend. Therefore, I am very disappointed by this terrible news. I hope things will get better in the future.  It seems that I hear such news relates corruption almost every day. I think the only solution to this kind of problem is to arrest such people every time they commit a clime.  I haven't known that. For me, your opinion is so interesting. When I heard this news first, I felt that it is very rare case of Corruption of the soccer world. Because I have not heard yet in my life. In the baseball world or Sumo world, the corruptions happened often, however, in the soccer world that exist. The fact is so disappointed but I am glad to know the real knowledge about the soccer world.  I researched about this news because I was interested in. The result of research, according to the first page of this sight, ""Near the end of May 2015, fourteen people were indicted in connection with an investigation by the United States Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and the Internal Revenue Service Criminal Investigation Division (IRS-CI) into wire fraud, racketeering, and money laundering. "" Soccer is one of the popular sport so I want them to take back the position and the honor.  I read this news and I shocked that knew the fact. Therefore I want more information so I research the FIFA, football's world governing body, has been engulfed by claims of widespread corruption since summer 2015, when the US Department of Justice indicted several top executives. It has now claimed the careers of two of the most powerful men in football, FIFA President Sepp Blatter and Uefa President Michel Platini, after they were banned for eight years from all football-related activities by FIFA's ethics committee. A Swiss criminal investigation into the pair is also continuing. FIFA's president Sepp Blatter has always denied any wrongdoing - but in September, he too was made the subject of a Swiss criminal investigation, launched alongside the US inquiry. The scandal erupted in May, with a raid on a luxury hotel in Zurich and the arrest of seven FIFA executives - conducted at the behest of the US authorities. In May the US indicted 14 current and former FIFA officials and associates on charges of ""rampant, systemic, and deep-rooted"" corruption following a major inquiry by the Federal Bureau of Investigation . And in December, 16 more officials were charged following the arrest of two FIFA vice-presidents in at the same hotel in Zurich. Former Brazil football federation chief Ricardo Teixeira was among those accused of being ""involved in criminal schemes involving well over $200m in bribes and kickbacks"".  I think so too. I think sport is the thing which gives people dream and the courage to live. I don't want to see this kind of article. It was so shocking.  I think so that the corruption like this leads to unsporting behavior. In this case, there is a strong possibility that the host country of the World Cup is decided by dishonest means. The host country has a very important role, and people in the host country might be going to go wild more than anyone in the other countries. Therefore, there is no doubt that the host country and FIFA cease to be trusted by this corruption. They make a mess of the worldwide event.  I think this fraud of FIFA should be poised strictly, because top, famous groups' mistakes can cause great influence even if it is very small. "
JOC JOC-13B-10O 6.4 "Nelson Mandela was not only a patient activist but also a great leader. Although he was caught in prison for a long times, he led and acted for human rights of non-white people. After his releasing from prison, He became the leader of ANC. He led ANC powerfully and he and ANC succeeded to extinguish the apartheid regime. ANC was a very large organization, but he led the very large organization well. ANC didn't succeed to extinguish the apartheid regime without a great leader like Nelson Mandela.  I remember I was very shocked when I heard the news. Nelson Mandela, I think, is one of the greatest leaders of the history. He fought with the apartheid regime with a strong will, saved a lot of black people abused, and changed South Africa. I respect him very much, and believe his achievements will be praised forever.  When I was a high school student, I studied world history and learned about him so I was very surprised to hear his death. I'm sure that he had strong will because he didn't give up getting rid of racial discrimination in prison and just the will have changed the world. I think his life told us how important the world peace is. I really hope that all the human can live equally, regardless of their race, religion, sex and flesh color. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  Because of his credits, I think Nelson Mandela is great. He tried to resolve racial discrimination, and he success to decrease it. I respect him very much, and think that we have to do anything to get rid of racial discrimination.  After 27 years, his concern was not revenge for his mistreatment. It is surprised, 27 years are so long that people ordinarily get angry about the mistreatment. In short, his concern which was making sure the country remind together was strong, so we must not make his will useless.  I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved.  There are a lot of discriminations all over the world, and apartheid is only one of them. I think Nelson Mandela is great person in that he is the first president fought against apartheid, but we must make sure there are a lot of problems about racism to solve.  I agree with your opinion. Nelson Mandela was the great leader. His act helped many people, so we have to take over his will and be great like him.  I think that Nelson Mandela is great person. He embodied with racial equality. We should learn his actions and thinking. I hope the world will be without discrimination.  Nelson Mandela is one of the most grateful politicians in 20 century. South Africa should keep his dream and appeals to world about prohibition of discrimination. Moreover, They should thanks to Nelson Mandela.  I think so. I respect Nelson Mandela very much. We should not lose freedom and equal. Then, we should banish racial discrimination.  I really respect Nelson Mandela. I strongly think his action was brave even he was put in jail for a while. He continued to try to make the society right and seems to be afraid of nothing. I believe his achievement will continue to be handed down forever in the world.  What Nelson Mandela have done to us and our society should be highly respected. His brave actions gave us hope. His wise and thoughtful actions showed us the right model of a human being. He will continue to be our respected figure and legend who will also continue to give us influences.  I think that your opinion is right. Nelson Mandela's great work should be praised, but this is just the trip of an iceberg. We have to try to solve that problems following him.  Nelson Mandela was a great person. The first time I knew his was during a lesson in junior high school, when my teacher let us watch a movie called ""Invictus"". This movie is about Mandela who became the first black president of South Africa, who tries to put together the country by reconstructing the rugby team. This movie shows the true story of how Mandela tried to put together the country, but the way he did this was fantastic. For example, he hired a white bodyguard besides him to symbolize the society getting better. I was impressed to how great this person was when I watched this movie, so I was really depressed when I first heard the news. I strongly believe that this person is one of the greatest person of human history, so I hope people would always remember him.  When I read this article I surprised that people who work for politics is desperate. This article says the candidate is stabbed while campaigning for politics. When I asked ""please imagine life-threatening work"", I imagine firefight, police-officer, security, military personnel and so on. But this time candidate is stabbed. My recognition is mistake. There are a lot of politician who killed somebody. For example Lincoln and Kennedy are. They are assassinated by somebody. It is common that they work for opportunity that life of national can be better than then. Lincoln worked hard for democracy and realized. Kennedy worked for the avoidance of Cuban Missile Crisis and save a lot of life not only American but also Cuban. Henrietee Reker worked for huge influx of asylum seekers from Syria to Germany. But she was stabbed. I know if huge asylum seekers come to in Germany, Germany economic; living environment and social security will be bad. But I know some country or somebody should save their life too. I believe her working is should be respect. It is natural and good to present many different thinking in the country. But it's not to be allowed to absolute that thinking appeal in violence. I respect her and it is reasonable to she is elected mayor. "
JOC JOC-14A-12N 6.86 "When I read this article at first, I thought that it is unbelievable and horrific that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. But, thinking more deeply, I realized that this situation is no ""old-fashioned"" at all. We know that globalization has enabled us to communicate with people all over the world, every nation to ""connect"" with each other in terms of culture, economy, politics, social systems. But we often overlooked the fact that it has made a mechanism where rich countries force poor countries to produce things at very low cost. In such mechanism, it is very natural that poor countries are driven to using people as a cheap labor (and such people are likely to be those captivate or criminals). What we can do is to understand that globalization has pros and cons. we cannot be blind to bad aspects it has. And this news is one of the such aspects.  I was shocked very much. I have to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor to save them. However it's difficult for me to check the suppliers of what I buy, so I don't know what I should do.  Japan needs to think not only of overseas but also of a domestic forced laborer. Japan is estimated as Tier 2. It is because Japan is an international hub of human trafficking and child pornography. Moreover, the foreigner of the illegal stay is working in a horrific condition. Since TVPA is the report of study which the United States decided independently, it is not necessarily exact. Of course, Japan government, retailers, and supermarket chain must take action, in order to save people who be held against their will in Thailand or Qatar, etc. However, Japanese people must not ignore a domestic labor problem.  When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic and Egyptian bondage continued being left. I think that this is one of the problems that we should think about all over the world. Globalization advances in the developed country and becomes convenient with various aspects, but , on the other hand, it is surely a fact that such a thing is yet up in an invisible place. I think that it is to be wrong to treat the person of the underdeveloped country as a slave because a developed country holds down production cost and think that it is that anyone knows it. However, it is reality to have to work under such situation because life enters them. Therefore the people of the developed country pay its attention to such a bad aspect well and think that we should make an effort to be improved for them.  It is bad for companies in developed countries to take mean advantage of migrants' poverty. Human trafficking and slavery make light of human rights. Companies in a developed country often build a factory in order to reduce labor costs. It is no exaggeration to say they take advantage of poverty. Companies have to give employees fitting compensation for their labors. On the other hand, companies have to seek profit. A capitalistic economy caused this problem.  When I first read this article, I was very shocked and surprised to know the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions. We can get various food produced all over the world and such globalization made our lives more convenient. On the other hand, we have to try to change the situation for slave labors as soon as possible. The human trafficking is terrible thing and I feel very sorry for those who got degrading treatment. We often hear the commercials that say consumers can buy things at cheap prices, but such global retailers might cause more and more slave workers! I think companies in Thailand and Qatar are likely to focus on reducing the cost and seethed with anger at the Qatari government's attitude that they did not respond to a request for comment about the issue. This kind of news might have great effect on buying and I think we have to make better environment which allows workers to live as ""human beings"".  Reading this article, I was very shocked and was surprised the harrowing situation. It is not too much to say that this is the age of capitalism. So, on one hand i can understand the thoughts of the managers;on the other hand , in terms of humanitarian, I cannot tolerate their attitude toward the slavers. Like us, they are humans . We humans can only think of others with the kindly heart. And they all have the human right. So, to solve these problems, we have to turn our eyes on them no matter how terrible it may be.  Many people say "" the situation is horrible"", however, we must recognize that we have forced to make the situation. We have wanted low price products and forced producers to do so. We should blame not only producers, but also ourselves. Protecting the human right is very important, of course, however we should start from recognizing our responsibility. And I think the best way to protect people like written in this article is that the international organization like WHO enact laws legislate against labor force.  I was very shocked reading this news. I actually feel there are a lot of people who is used as a slave. Foods we have every day relate many slaves. A government should make strict law to top of the company which force them work under terrible condition.  I was surprised and shocked, as reading this article. Because I didn't imagine that slavery is still left . People who forced working conditions like slavery are too bad to live. I suppose these companies are going to hold down price of products, so they introduced slavery. But it is wrong to introduce slavery. I read the working condition of slaves, I think we should make a company cease to forced working under bad conditions as soon as possible. If companies want to cut cost of employees, they should think not to force migrant workers into work in the bad condition but to come up with other way to cut another point of cost. Although many countries know the news, the problem don't solve. I suppose that they should struggle to solve the problem in cooperation with each other. And we should tell the fact to many people in order to oppose to the company which introduce the slavery. Moreover governments make a strict rule of working condition to save human right. The economy and government are connected with other countries. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should tackle this important problem to solve , thinking as our problem.  I was surprised at the true that there is a terrible situation of forced workers. I cannot understand the manager's attitude toward the slavery. However, it is also a problem for us. The people of developed countries have to take action to resolve such a problem. I think that developed countries treat the people of underdeveloped countries as a slavery in order to they holds down production cost. We must treat the people all over the world as human beings. I have a strong desire that when we spend equally comes.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very shocked and surprised at the reality that there are still forced workers treated in horrific conditions like as slaves. This problem is related to Japan and also other countries. So we should consider the solution strategy of this problem and make world wonderful.  I was surprised at the fact that there were still people who worked in a severe condition. I think every workers should be treated equally. In Japan, we do not attach great importance to slavery, because we never have such forced labor and we think we have nothing to do with this. However, nations have become globalized and we should take part in this problem positively. Appealing importance of human life is one of the best ways, I think.  I was surprised that there is still labor slave and terrible work condition cause dead people. I think government should protect people who are working too match. Although it isn't easy to improve the working condition, government have to do something. How about make law about work, for example, make minimum wages rule or regulate work time. I think those law will improve working condition a little.  I felt that it was really terrible to know the severe actual situation and working conditions of the forced labor and the forced prostitution. And I was surprised how human rights are ignored so much today of the 21st century. In order to defeat such situation, it is important to remove faulty consciousness and corruption of the government, and we consumers choose the product consciously and what kind of non-humanitarian thing is performed in the world.  When I read this article, I was shocked that there are still situations that people are force to work with no payment all over the world. People have the right to live equally and no one can deny it. To cope with this problem, what we can do is to make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor when we are shopping. I also think that consumers should bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business as this article said.  I was surprised that there are still forced workers treated terrible conditions like slave. In Japan such a situation is unbelievable. But may be there is some responsibility for us. because We have wanted products with low price and forced producers to do so. Before considering about this problem, we should realize our responsibilities.  We the Japanese basically enjoy our peaceful life, so we tend to think there is no human trafficking or slavery any more. However, there still are such kind of things outside Japan. Everyone has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. We the Japanese should take an active part in spreading such thoughts all over the world.  I think it is nice idea to make human trafficking watch list. However, watch list is able to have only limited effect on the whole world. Then, I hit on two solutions to help labor victims improve their statuses. First solution is to establish the international watchmen and lawyers institution who specialize in labor problem. This institution in non Government Organization. The institution help the unethical business victims win labor disputes and labor trials Moreover, the institution encourage employees and labor slaves to set up their labor union. Therefore, it is easier for workers to demand employers and parent companies make better labor environments. Second solution is to organize small and medium sizes businesses which have more ethical and secure systems. This businesses will be supported by related big companies. Then, The companies try achieving economical superiority over the companies run by trafficking and unethical labor. For example, Improving quality and reducing cost by eliminating the waste of transportation help them attract more consumer. If they accomplish to have the better status in wholesale market than unethical companies, slave work has been abolished perfectly. However my suggestions seems hard to carry out. First of all, it is not clear who and which organization pay much money to begin the two propositions. Consequently, it is important to keep watch countries where trafficking businesses thrive, and to reconsider the more efficient and ethical way to help labor slaves liberate from unethical companies.  I had known that many people're forced to work in inferior condition in developing countries , but I knew how cruel the working condition is at first when I read this article. I think TIP report is playing a significant role in the movement of anti-trafficking , but it is not enough to eliminate slavery and trafficking issues perfectly because it is impossible for TIP to investigate the worst working condition in each country. I suppose that trafficking issues is one of the most important problems we have to think consciously because we tend to miss this problem behind a lot of serious problem such as an environmental problem and the North-South problem.  I have regarded the human trafficking as old habit. However it is not old habit any longer, it is ongoing problem we are now facing. I was shocked and also felt ashamed of not knowing the fact. We, especially the Japanese live in the affluent society. However, the social background of this is so serious. We always tend to forget that the food we easily get may be produced by modern-day slavery who work everyday at low costs. We should think of the two aspects and consider what we can do for them.  I was surprised that there were many people who worked as slaves in the terrible conditions. We, Japanese, do not know this fact and will have no chance to know because they are not interested in such problems. For Japanese, even if the working conditions are more and more worse, they have nothing to do with this fact. At first, we should have concern about it in order to solve. We must not turn our eyes away this problem.  People in developing countries are not aware of this situation. We have regarded human rights as one of the important things that we should respect. But we have always made sure of these rights between people and the government sometimes as conflict. But from now on, we have to protect the rights of other countries' people through border lines. However, especially Japanese have never introduced slavery. For example, in man'yoshu, the oldest the oldest existing collection of Japanese poetry, there are poetries of the emperor and those of homeless, too. So we have respect the human dignity of people who are in bat economical situations. Therefore other countries' people stand completely different backgrounds. So we, including me, may not understand how hard labor who are held by someone because of they are poor or sometimes not having citizenships. I think there is two solutions to make the situation of Thai's labor better. We should import Thai's goods more. This may seen as the way promoting bad situations more, but without enough monetary base. They cannot mend payments of all the jobs in Thai. And we should also introduce our industry to Thai. By doing so, we can create the job with much payment and good working environments. Japanese as the same Asian people will be the key.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. This news is unbelievable. I thought trafficking was a thing of the past. As I didn't know the fact, many people don't know it and consume them. We must not overlook it. We must know it and make it known to many people. Consumers also promote such problem. Consumers should know the fact and change their actions.  When I read this article, I was very shocked and surprised that there still are old-fashioned things such as human trafficking and slavery. I think We should help to improve the situation.  I think the ranking according to countries' willingness and efforts to combat trafficking and slavery is good for stop human trafficking, but it should contain the actual situation which slaves in. We should know their job in fishing boats is so rigorous. Also, in Japan, we should know our eating is supported by slaves and make effort to stop human trafficking.  This news was read and I was shocked very much. But I regarded me as shameful. It is because I cannot stop continuing receiving the benefit of globalization simultaneously We have the tendency to see only the good field of globalization. The foolishness is made to notice the slavery issue of Qatar. I think that it is a subject of us who live in advanced nations to help the workers who work under an unusual situation across a country. there were slaves in the back side where goods are enjoyable with budget prices . It is necessary to consider what we should do for stopping this negative chain.  When I read this article, I was shocked very much. We cannot check the situation of the work like the slave. However, I should be able to cause some action. I do not know what I should do now, but do not begin when I do not think. I may cause a big change if I begin it because it is small.  I was surprised that human trafficking is present still. I am the opposite to human rights violations. However, political issues are involved in this problem. I strongly believe these issues and must be solved worldwide. I hope that such problems are resolved quickly.  Slaves are still used . This fact shocked me and made me feel sad. We should abolish these slave systems.  Reading this article , I was surprised at the horrific situation and was indignant at it. In terms of the managers and the chief executive, I can understand that they have to cut their worker's wage, but from the opposite point of view, that is, in terms of humanitarian, we cannot tolerate the situation. It is no exaggeration to say that this is the ""murder"". To save them from that situation, we should understand the situation fundamentally and have to address it over a long period of time I think the circumstance is very cruel and bad thing. Forced labor damages people's dignity and human rights. The action should be censured more and people have to consider the forced labor problem. Why has substantial slavery lost even present time? We should treat the serious problem while taking account of the condition and human rights.  Reading Supermarkets tied to slave labor in shrimp industry and this article, I was very surprised that in the world, there are a lot of people treated as slavery and I do not that fact in detail. Before reading this article, I thought that now few people are treated so, but in fact , such a bad environment still remains. We must try to save them and know some of what we buy and use are at the cost of their lives. Moreover, governments should make place where these people can tell a lot of people that what happens in their working place. and The mass media have to report it more on a large scale.  I agree with the opinion that not only producers but also ourselves like consumers have responsibility.  I was so surprised and hurt my heart to see the article. Some of our daily foods are based on slave labor. What is wores, the environment of slave labor is so terrible. I think what we can do as consumer is to stop buying the commodities which use slave labor to make it.  The boycott will make the company which use slave labor reexamine their system and improve the condition of worker, as not slaver.  When I read the article, I was very shocked because I can't believe there are many forced workers for no pay, and under threat of extreme violence. In almost all nations in the world, the fundamental human rights are respected, and in many cases, this sentence is clearly written on their own constitutions. In other word, we take it for granted that we should respected human rights and human dignity. However, according to the article, human rights are ignored openly. In order to protect the creed of ""respect for fundamental human rights"", authorities, like UN, should take measures against the issue.  I agree with your opinion. What is needed is that we have two points of view-one is of executives and capitalists, and the other is of workers who are even now in that horrific situation! When I read this news, I was surprised that human traffic continued being left. Everyone in the world should has a right to live freely and equally regardless of the nationality. I think we should take movement like such thoughts all over the world.  In an increasingly globalized world, we take a high toll on poor people unthinkingly. We must face up to stark reality. We must take steps in order to solve. I'm going to buy nationally produced products. And, Japanese government should remonstrate in an emphatic manner.  I have never thought about human trafficking problems until I read this article. The point I sympathized most is that consumers should also bear some responsibility for combating the trafficking business. Without our attempts, this problems can't be solved forever. From now on, I also make sure the goods I buy are free from forced labor.  I was shocked and ashamed that I hadn't knew the fact that the eating habits of the Japanese is based on slave labor. I think that the Japanese Government should help Thailand and Qatar and any other nations which have human trafficking and slave labor problems to improve these problems. Japanese have responsibility for it because we are reaping the benefits from these nations.  When I read this article at first, I was shocked and surprised. Because in the world I have thought that human trafficking do not exist and this matter is the ancient problem . In addition to this, this problem is caused by the fact advanced countries are racking the developing countries. People in the developing countries are forced to work at lows wages. We usually use the product which is good for the cheap price. It owes to the people at low wages. Thus we in advanced countries should think about this matter seriously.  I think so, too. I was also shocked and surprised when I read this article. Slavery should be disappeared. This problem happened in the country far from Japan. However, we must not pretend not to see but think together and take some action.  I agree with this opinion strongly. It is because this human trafficking problem in developing countries is connected with Japan deeply. However most Japanese don't know about this problem. This is the most worst thing. I think ignoring is the most shameful thing. We should have interests for more things especially connecting our surroundings.  I disagree with this opinion. I think that we must consider about forced labor. Of course, the system called the slave is prohibited. However, people of the world understand that the slave is so bad system, such situation does not happen. We have to consider more.  It is unmistakable fact that slave labor in Thailand and Qatar is inhumane and bad and we buyer of the products which are made by slave laborers are responsible for this problem. However, I think it is little strange that the U. S solely interfere in the problem of Thailand and Qatar aggressively. In the case like this, non national organization should play a key role. If one strong country interfere, the problem is likely to be controlled to be profitable for that country and not to be solved for a long time.  When I knew the fact there are the people who work as slaves, I couldn't believe the fact. We have to abolish slavery. However, it is impossible to solve this problem by individual effort. So, I think we need International cooperation to solve this problem. I believe that the good idea to solve this problem will come out if the people all over the world consider carefully and discuss about this problem. I wish slavery will disappear from this world.  I was shocked when I read this article. I do not know that slaves are forced to work in Thailand and Qatar until I read this. In Japan, our rights to work with our intentions are protected. Other countries people are the same human beings as Japanese. So they also have human rights like that. Therefore I think these slavery in Thailand, Qatar and other countries must be prohibited and abolished. Moreover in order to eliminate it, we have to look for the way to do so and continue to make every effort.  I strongly agree with you. I also think we have responsibilities for it and should realize and consider. What we can do first is not to buy products made by slaves.  In the 21st century, all peoples should be given the fundamental human rights. We must respect the human rights. So shall we stop buying the products made by slaves? A boycott! We should show our opinion by action. And we will stress the owners.  When I read this article, I was so surprised and feel that I'm happy in that I was born in Japan. Japan is so peaceful, freedom, and rich country than other countries. If I were to born in a foreign country which is developing, I might be a slave. Now I know that I'm happy, I should do something to poor people.  I didn't think the world working situation is so terrible. This is not domestic problem but global problem. It's necessary for all the countries of the world to cooperate in slave labor conditions.  I think it is great advance that developed countries come to concern the condition of developing countries' people. The thing that developed countries should do next is to resolve the condition of them and protect their rights. I hope that these problem will resolve in the future.  When I read the article first I was very shocked, and I thought we, every Japanese people should know the fact. Because, for example, our clothes especially "" ""fast fashion"" made in these countries. Now it is natural for us to buy ordinary clothes at a very low price, but almost all of us don't know where and how they are made. I don't think we have to avoid buying them, but we should know the fact and move to improve their environment. I think it is our responsibility.  I strongly agree with your comments, because I also think in the world there is a mechanism that rich countries force poor countries in a lot of terms. I think appealing this mechanism is natural, but we must not overlook it. We, living in ""rich"" countries have some responsibility to improve the situation by thinking human rights and morality deeply.  I think it is so problematic for us to use the system of forced labor. We should do away with the system. In order to do so, we think better of the modern world system. In Japan, there is not the system of forced labor, but in the world there is still the system. we should dispense with the system.  I agree with your opinion. I think the modern condition should be improved.  When I read this article, I was shocked that forced labor is remaining at this peaceful age. We must abolish this shameless labor system, so we should buy thing free from slave labor.  I was very surprised at the fact there are still slave labor in many countries. So we must make sure the goods we buy are free from forced labor. But to tell the truth, we can't tell goods to buy from them not to buy. It cannot be helped that we want to buy cheaper, after all we maybe buy the former. So I'm sorry but the slave labor must remain.  I am impressed by this line: Slavery rips and tears at the fabric of the rule of the law. We constructed solid idea for human rights as far, but slavery destroy this idea. Slavery don't give benefit all the countries. Slavery should be banned.  I strongly agree with you. I also think that appealing importance of human life is one of the best way. We should think about human rights to live in the world.  I wish all slaves would be released. My heart aches for their suffering.  Wonderful consideration ! I'm impressed with your comment to globalization.  Above all, I was surprised that there are slave labors forced to work on agriculture or fishery for no pay in this world. Also, I was more surprised that there are human trafficking market in the current situation. I do not want to work for no pay and be have dealings on human trafficking market. I should be deeply grateful to my circumferent environmental and must to think about slave labor to save them from unfair working.  I don't agree with this opinion. Of course it is important for us to criticize such an action, but that's not enough to solve this problem perfectly. I suppose we have to make more effort to solve this problem, for example, not to buy the trafficking commodity and contribute some money to them. "
JOC JOC-14B-09N 7.19 "When I was high school student, I was taught what AED is like and how to use it. However, I think many people have never used it in this kind of real traffic accidents and maybe it is not clear if we can behave quickly and use it properly. In an emergency situation, I think most of us will be upset and cannot behave bravely, but after reading this article, we should do that to help people's lives! In this news, ""chikan"" made it difficult problem when a man was about to cut through the woman's clothes. It is very serious problem, however, in my opinion, we should not care about that because I think it's much more important to save the injured and we must hurry!!! Therefore, it's true that I can understand what the driver of the vehicle said but I agree with the man who saved the woman. This case would have happy end but anyway, I think the government should improve the training about using AED at schools.  I think AED should say that even people who may not have been received training can use. Almost all people will be unwilling at first, but in the emergency situation people around patient needs speedy action to rescue him or her , so we have no time confused. Therefore we need understand AED can be used by anyone, and we can't waste even a minute.  I just feel sorry for the man who saved the woman's life despite all the troubles. And this news makes me think that we should learn more about how to use AED. Ignorance can make a serious problem. In this case there were no victims, but the woman might have been killed by the driver's inappropriate ""sense of justice"" if he prevented the man from using AED earlier and more forcibly. Most of us are taught how to activate AED, yet do not know how to use it properly. So, from now on, more concrete training should be given to citizens so that we can deal with the difficult situation as in this story.  This news promotes negative behavior. It's really too bad. I want to praise his efforts. We should get knowledge of the correct use of AED. And, we must know to use an AED as soon as a sudden cardiac arrest happens. I hope everyone act without hesitation.  I have heard the news and been sympathized with the man who try to save the women. The fact that there is a person who don't know how to use AED and call the police officer is very surprising. I was taught the way of AED in schools and driving schools. Unhappily, such things may make other people be unwilling to use AED. AED is effective. We must not make atmosphere that you cannot use without hesitation. Today, people are too sensitive. We should become more generous.  when I read this article, I was shocked. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police. This is very poor thing. Definitely if I was driver, I would think like this too. But this mean I don't know correct use of AED. We must know how to use AED correctly and help each other.  I felt sad when I read this article. This is because there are some cases where kind intentions bring about unfortunate results. I think it is not good that the driver did not trust the man's kind behavior. Eventually this incident does not have bad result because the driver has understood that his idea had been just a misunderstanding and this case would make us not hesitate over whether we can use AED for women in emergency or not.  I think it is very foolish act. The driver should realize what the man did is correct by the accident situation and trust the man's kind behavior. these days, there are AED in many places. AED automatically explain how to it by themselves for someone who have not known how to use it. But as I learned how to use and what AED is in high school health education class, people should know the basics of AED using. We can not know when we encounter such a life saving situation.  I agree with you. I also think his action is really courageous and admirable. It is good for this country to increase a kind man like him, so we have to understand how to use AED and we are prepared for this situation.  I think that we can realize what the man do for the injured woman is correct by the situation of the accident. Anyway, I agree that your opinion that we must know how to use AED correctly. It is because we don't know when we encounter such a life saving situation.  I think the number of people who have right knowledge is too small. I think we must now the way for using AED in order to save human's life. We will be able to criticize the person who act rightly like him because of lack of knowledge.  I was very surprised after read this article. I think when we compare to rescue a person with fear to be called ""Hentai"" or ""Chikan, "" I will choose rescue. I can't understand why people who is an acquaintance with person who was rescued say such a terrible thing. They should rather say ""Thank you!"" I believe it is normal to choose rescuing person who is injured. So, I have no idea why they didn't choose it.  In our daily life, it is often occurs to jump to wrong conclusions. But we should not hesitate to take brave action to save a human life. As this article says, saving life is more vital than feeling shame at blaming as Hentai or chikan. Unfortunately the man was mistaken for pervert when he was trying saving a woman's life. we should take bold actions when it is needed.  Students of this generation receive the training of AED, therefore we all know that we have to remove any clothing when applying AED. It is shocking to me that people who don't know the appropriate use of the AED takes the action in the wrong way and even report it to the police. If the lady was in more serious condition, she would have been dead. One reason why the driver mistook his action is that he didn't know how to use the AED, and another is that a lot of pervert occur in Japan. Because perverts are not now unusual, people would think it's a pervert if a man was taking a woman's clothes off. It is a shame as a Japanese to even think someone would do such thing at a scene of car accident. I hope more people know about AED and people would trust others.  I agree with you. However, Ido not think that a lot of people can do such brave things. Nobody want to take responsibility if people who he or she aided dies. We have to do a drastic reform about lifesaving.  I have learned how to use AED at the driving school, but I don't have any confidence in using AED correctly. I think everyone should learn how to use AED because everyone could face the situation where they have to save someone's life. However, the number of people who can use AED correctly is very small , so local government should do something to solve this problem.  We students are taught how to use AED in our school. So we can roughly use that apparatus. But in our daily life, we are surrounded by the irrational atmosphere. This case is one of them. Thus this is so difficult a problem. But the man's brave action saved the precious woman's life. So this man's action should be ranked.  I agree with you! When I was a junior high school student, I have been thought about usage of AED a little. However, I have just been thought in a PE class a few times and I don't remember it well. Therefore, maybe I can't behave bravely and help a person who is in a serious condition if I was in an emergency situation. I think that the government and schools should improve the training about using AED, too.  I pitied this man to read this article. I was impressed by his bravery and judgment! Probably, if I was in a serious situation like this, I couldn't take action as him. I think there are few people who can take action like him in Japan. I think that the government and schools should improve the training of using AED positively. Then, people who can judge bravely and use AED exactly with confidence will increase more. I hope that such people increase and I want to such person, so I want to learn about the saving of life and using AED.  I want to learn how to use AED accurately too. If people who can use AED increase, more people will be helped. However, even if we know the way to use it, we will get into a panic. So I respect people who treat correctly like the man.  I feel sorry for the man in this story. He wanted to save woman's life and he put into action to save her life. I think that he is brave enough to be regarded with admiration. However, people who saw what was happening called the police ! All we have to do is to inform people of accurate knowledge about AED in order to save such a brave man.  I agree with you. Man who rescue the driver act correctly. Why man should be criticized? Moreover driver learned about hoe to use AED not only in high school but also in a driving school. I can't understand this driver's behavior.  Action of driver of the vehicle and the police officer is quite unbelievable. I have learned when and how to use the AED at the high school, so it's natural for us to estimate almost all high school students can deal with the AED. However, driver and police officer, both adult, didn't understand the situation and even criticized man's brave action. I think not only students but also adults have to learn what is the AED and why and when the AED is needed so we can use it to help others' lives without hesitation.  Action of driver and police officer is very terrible. Kind man's help means nothing to them. I know how to use AED. However citizen as me even know this, I can't unbelievable that police officer doesn't know how to use AED. AED is very important thing. This machine can be life saver and killer. Our understanding to this machine is valuable.  I feel sorry for the man who saved the woman with AED. People should correctly know various instruments that save human's lives including AED. What the driver of the vehicle do is very poor. And the police too. They should change their conscious.  I can not believe this news because this man just saved the women's life but he was questioned. He should be appropriate for saving life. The driver and the police should apologize to him and they should know more about the AED.  How to use AED is learned at school. But the person with using that actually is little. And the person who can manage AED perfectly would be little, too. If good will of the person who has that is judged by law, what should we make grounds? I feel sorry for the man in this story. It is because the man who try to save women's life questioned by police.  I think so, too. We should know how to use AED and act without hesitation.  I do not think it is a matter of lack of knowledge. Almost all Japanese school, they teach how to use AED. But they learn it without any reason. We need to take AED lecture more practically.  I think his comment is good and can agree with his comment to an extent. But, I also think his notion is a little bit idealistic. Now, it is the era of the sensitivity, and it is inevitable considering the tide of the time. "
JOC JOC-14B-17N 6.88 "I don't know many awkward handshakes did between many countries. I think what xi's face wasn't smile though Abe was smiling at first means xi feared Chinese people's reaction if he was doing congress with smile. He had no choice in order to save Chinese people's support for him. I think it is good to meet them . Abe wants to improve relations with Beijing , so his face was smile as he meet xi. Although xi's expression was not good, to be able to hold the congress means xi will think that making better relation with Japan. I think xi's face means two things. One is taking hostile action against Japan for save people's support for him. Another is an expression that he doesn't know what he should do between anti Japanese and thinking of improvement of relation to Japan .  The uncomfortable handshakes by world leaders cannot be helped though they are formally. However, frequent handshakes shouldn't be done because the act may cause bad feelings among the people who have dissatisfaction about policy. And it may become a serious situation. So they need consider whether the negotiation went smoothly when handshaking.  Awkward handshakes have a deep meaning and an important background. Through world history there were many conflicts between countries. In order that these problems were solved, each top leader discussed, but they never permitted each other I think. They paid attention to the whole world and they laughed shaking hands. I hope the day will come when I can see them shaking hands and laughing together from the bottom of their hearts.  The uncomfortable handshakes can't be helped. Conflicting interpretation of history can be solved easily. This time, Held Japan-China summit have plenty of meaning for two countries. Until that point China criticized Japan within the country, finally the summit substantialized. On China's part, he, they can't choose but tout for Chinese subject that Abe administration changed toward the bright side for consistency's sake of their assertion. That will be likely to make them weaken criticism toward Japanese government. It could be nearing reality to shake hands comfortably with smile.  Awkward handshakes is often done between leaders of not only nation but also corporation. These actions are necessary. Many people usually say flattery. Being honest is not always good. However, we want to avoid them as much as possible.  Handshake, whether it is awkward or not, may the useful way to establish friendly relationship. I once heard that in terms of psychology, man who cater to shake hand has a expectation to the person he is speaking to. In this case, that is president Abe and Xi's shaking hand, this theory doesn't hold good. But in someday, I hope the two countries truly help each others and handshake as a sign of trust.  Handshake is indispensable for establishing friendly relationship. Handshake show good relationship between two people or organization. It is good culture and carries out important tasks in the place that people make good relationship in. This culture will continue to the future.  I think so, too. With conflicts two groups or countries cannot go ahead and make better future. Shaking hands means that people of both sides want to mend the relation. After shaking hands, they can proceed to the future. But two leaders just pretend to be friendly, like Neville Chamberlain and Hitler, there is no future. In fact they cannot have stopped WW2. People should seek peace and friendship with other countries and groups so that leaders can shake hands without any secret intentions.  I would like to mention ""The uncomfortable handshake between Japan's Shinzo Abe and China's Xi Jinping"" in this article. I am very interested in the relationships between Japan and China. I take a Japan-China relations class. Teacher took up this problem. This meeting got a big write-up in the newspapers. Neighboring countries often disagree with each other. However, we have to search for the ways to make friends with China.  I agree with you. Handshake is great culture and can be a bridge of friendship between enemies. We have to do our best in order to deepen friendly relations. Handshake is often a courtesy and counterfeit. However, shake hand symbolizes our efforts to make friends with other countries and someone. It is very important action.  Handshake is a form to establish friendly relationship. If handshakes between countries are awkward, this action is very important each other. Now, the relation between Japan and China is bad, however, Japanese prime minister Abe and China's president Xi shook hands the other day. I think this action will be a key to improve the nation relationship in such two countries.  Awkward handshake between national counterparts seems to be the diplomatic fault, but I think this awkwardness has a great meaning. For example, Japan and China are the very influenced nations, so many nations that have deep relationship with Japan and China pay attention to the meeting between Shinzo Abe and Xi Jinping. Given the assumption, the two power have to take such nations into consideration. Moreover, Japan and China have a lot of diplomatic problem between them. So, in order to represent the nation's decision that we don't want to yield to counterpart, the awkward handshake is needed.  Before I read this article, I didn't know there are such a lot of awkward handshake in the world. In this article I only know about Japan and China's relationship isn't so good. The background of Japan and China's awkward relationship is that Japan colonized China in past. And other awkward relationships' background are related to things happened in past. It is sure that people in those country turn against. Also it is impractical that all countries are going to make peaceful relationship. However, I think we should try to make good relation.  I hope so too. Japan and China are leader of Asia, so if they help each other, not only Asia but also all over the world would develop.  why we are not able to be good relations. I could have not understand such awkward handshake. so I was surprised to read this article. Certainly there is awkward handshake between us. But we are not able to stop such handshake. All we can do is only to see it. Such culture like this will continue.  In Japan , there is very interesting word ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" It means ""eye talks a lot of thing just as we talk."" In this case, we can say ""@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@"" I think we can communicate many things by body language than by talking.  When we want to show friendship, we naturally try to handshake. It is because it is the easiest way. However, we sometimes do it absentmindedly. I think it is not good. I think we should let handshake have meaning.  I was shocked at this story because various countries have awkward relationships between other countries. I want everyone to handshake with smile from their heart.  I agree with your opinion. Thought, Japan has got along badly with China, there is a strong relationship between them. And, this awkward handshake reflects each countries diplomatic policy. I have not thought about formal handshake seriously, so I was surprised at this article. I learned that Every handshake has every deep meaning.  I have a doubt that it is thinking too seriously. Of course , their relationship influence various things. But uncomfortable handshakes is so formal. I think uncomfortable handshakes are necessary.  Thank you for your agreement. As for me, sometimes I also do such an awkward handshake in the case that I have to get along with someone I hate in my heart. In order not to get worse the relationship than now, we have to suppress our hatred. These awkward handshakes in the article shows what nations thought and what they want to express from their attitudes. I think this is the one of the fun of diplomacy. "
JOC JOC-14B-31N 6.83 "I think the Abe Administration does not understand the value of the constitution. The purpose of the constitution is to bind the government authority. So, all policy-makers must follow constitution. Though, for example, Abe Administration is going to infringe the freedom of expression with the secrets law. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority.  I think that I want Prime Minister Abe to review a constitution carefully. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election, and a one's thought street may surely act. However, he must not forget that there are the people of the opposition either. There are a lot of people of the opposition about the constitutional revision. It was a fact to have won in this election, but did not get support of the whole nation in it. I want him to examine it carefully for even slightly many nations to become useful.  I am concerned about possibilities of misunderstanding of Prime Minister Abe. His election this time ended in a landslide victory for him, so we tend to misunderstand it as if all Japanese people support him. However his party could not obtain a majority of votes. Therefore I would like him to deal with political problems carefully, especially Japan's pacifist constitution and relation to China.  I think PM should propose the new article 9 as soon as possible. Chinese government officials and the press of the Communist party said they will invade East China Sea and Pacific Ocean. Obama is reducing the army. So US cannot take part of maintaining the security East Asia. So Japan should do and oppose with imperialism of China. In fact they invaded and rule East Turkistan and Tibet even now. They support Pro-Chinese in Okinawa and want to make the island the part of Chinese. We cannot ignore Chinese invasion.  The Abe administration should advance the constitutional amendment while considering more carefully though there is a strong movement under way to carry out it. The constitutional amendment has only enforced once and it is a change from Meiji Constitution to the present constitution. By having the right of collective self-defense and preparing to use armed force in Japan, it has a great influence on other countries. If Japan don't think about having military force while deliberating on a relationship to countries which live in a state of tension.  I agree with your comment. If there is a strong movement under way to carry out it, some opposes his plan and great confusion will prevail throughout the country.  The opinion has a lack of balance. I think the conclusion of the Abe Administration is inevitable though Mr. Abe is a rightist because it is undeniable to have military force for Japan to get along with other countries.  I think that Prime Minister Abe should think about a little constitutional importance. To change the constitution may be connected in changing Japan in itself because it continued being the Japanese Supreme Standard of Laws after a war. Japan must surely consider about constitution Article 9 again while there is the menace of neighboring countries such as China or North Korea. However, the Abe Administration does not change a constitution easily and must push forward a story in consideration of the public opinion of the nation.  I think that Abe is a good politician and the Prime Minister because he has a strong faith and behaves in accordance with his faith. However, I think he must be calm and pay attention to opinions of countries around Japan. Now, the relationships of Japan and neighbor Asian countries have gone cold turned cold. It just arouses their hostility for Abe to persist in his opinion in this conditions. He should consider opinions of other countries and carry out politics wisely.  I think this is the most important problem in Japan nowadays. Prime minister Shinzo Abe was re-elected by public and hs said that this re-election means Japan have to rewrite the country's pacifist constitution. However, according to some newspaper's research, though the Liberal Democratic Party win a majority, people who support to rewrite the constitution is a lesser proportion. It is strange story, isn't it? This research means a lot of thing, for example, there are no reliable party, and also may mean interest groups power are being stronger. Can this say that this time's referendum shoe the will of the people? I don't think so. I want to keep studying these political problems.  I agree with you. Prime minister and there colleagues must consider this problem. This is very important, so they shouldn't be hurry to get conclusion.  As we know, Mr. Abe have long shown his biggest desire to change the current constitution, which is a symbol of post-war era, that is to say, the international situation that restricts Japan's bold and free action in terms of territorial, economical, social issues. And then most of citizens voted the LDP, so in a way this action can be viewed as ""a consensus"". However, we should not allow him just to proceed. In speech, we can say opinion against the policy. This way, we can make the administration consider carefully whether to enforce it.  I agree with you. Major issues in this election are economic policies. People is none too sure of constitutional change. Abe should forges better relations with neighboring countries and considers the idea of Article 9.  You have a very good viewpoint and I respect your attitude. In my opinion, the seemingly contradictory situation - where those who support the LDP do not necessarily stand for changing the constitution - comes from the reality that the majority of Japanese people are being ""voting machine"" in some way. I mean, there are many people who vote but do not have interests in politics. They vote without deep consideration, often haunted by disappointment at Japan's current political situation. I believe that, in today's democratic society, citizen's spontaneous actions like demo and speech are crucial. So, to begin with, WE should change our attitude and consciousness toward politics, eventually enabling democracy to function. That is what I have in mind.  I think that he understand the essence of constitution. Constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. So, Abe changes the constitution without hesitation only because won the election. Abe discusses carefully whether to change constitution.  This comment of his or her has very sharp consideration and poses questions to the current political situation that can be conjectured in the article. And I also try to have such critical and positive attitude, so I greatly sympathized with him or her.  This news has so important problem for Japanese, also for world countries. I think Mr. Abe is good prime minister, I trust him. However, I can't agree with revising the constitution completely. Firstly, I can't understand his aim clearly. I'd like him to go ahead discreetly.  In the first place, we did not expect the election. We want the government to take action positively. I was anxious about revising constitutions. In particular, the prime minister Abe try to change the interpretation of Article 9 which is a symbol of peace constitution. Finally, his desiring was to allow Japan to exercise the right to collective self-defense. I think that he should have explained us about its merit and demerit more detail. It is most important for the current government to listen a national opinion. Japanese constitution is established by tradition and history. Therefore, we have to be more careful when we consider the constitution in the future.  This news has so important problem for Japanese. We must learn the value of freedom and right. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority. We should consider the problem carefully.  I agree with you. Important problem in this election is economic policy. Few of people think constitutional change.  Article 9 of the current Japanese constitution rejects acts of war and weapons of war. Japan is one of the few countries whose constitution renounces war. I think it is natural to protect our own country from a threat from a neighboring country. Japan has been peaceful since the end of the Second world War under the constitution because we have been under the umbrella of the US . Meanwhile, a lot of people support Article 9. They love peace and claim that Japan should convey to the world how terrible war is and how precious peace is as the nation hit with a nuclear bomb. I am able to understand what they say. However, I believe that Japan should be more independent. That's why Japan is criticized for being subjugated by US .  I am able to understand what you said. However, I disagree with you. Currently, the far east is smoldering because North Korea tested missiles and nuclear weapons. I think that it is just because of the strict observance of the constitution that peace has been kept since the end of the Second World War. However, the present international situation is dangerous. This is a time of decision I think so too. I expect his ability to take action. I cannot understand his goal of revising the constitution. It is important to explain us more detail.  Changing constitution is not considered carelessly. As a matter of fact, Japan has been kept peace on the basis of this constitution. I oppose to the right of collective self-defense because this right means taking part in wars in the other countries positively. The prime minister Abe just wants to do great program remembered by later generations. There are few people who experienced World War II, so now is the very time when we reconsider the importance of peace and the effort of Japan so far.  I agree with you. The prime minister Abe play a good role about economy, but he has scant thinking of history. I think this constitution, which we have been followed, should be kept.  I strongly believe that we should not change the constitution. Wars do not produce something happy. On the other hand, they just bring misfortune. I have no experience of wars, but I was told how terrible they are by my grandfather. I am satisfied the original condition of Japan. We should avoid exposing to danger.  I doubt the Prime Minister truly understands the purpose of Japanese constitution. The original purpose of it is to restrict leaders' authorities. If he change the constitution without understanding it, I think it is very dangerous. In addition, I oppose changing the constitution. I am proud of our constitution which refers to ""peace"", and I hope this idea spreads and influences all over the world. It will be the model of the world, so I think we should search for the other ways to keep our global position.  I don't understand why is this election hold. Abe is very smart in this point. In this situation, it is clear that Abe will win this election. If Abe win this election, he will able to continue to do longer than now. He thinks that he got the support of the nation by having won for election. But I think it is not the support of the nation.  I agree with you. Abe surely have won the election, but he must not forget that constitution exists for protecting the right of minority.  I'm opposite to your opinion, too. He has a mind to make Japan go to the war. Japan has a wonderful constitution as a peaceful constitution. That's Japanese pride and I think the wisdom which arrived by the history with the long mankind. The person who doesn't look back to the past has no futures. Before our country amends the constitution and has military, reflection in the past should be reconsidered again.  I'm not supporting Prime Minister Abe. Only distrust is held in how to advance it his dictatorial politics. The same atmosphere as before the Second World War is because there is current state which has happened.  I think now is the time to rethink our constitution. We should prepare to make sure our national security. The situation of East Asia is at risk. Because Japanese economical power is strong, the only country which can deal with China and Korea. We cannot ignore their presence and imperialism.  I think Abe's policy is anachronistic. As other countries say, Abe should learn from history. Although we don't have military, and face a crisis from North Korea and so on, Japanese people remember WWII. That war leave scars to many people. Abe should reconsider this condition. All the Japanese people also should consider our own position.  I think so, too. Abe won the election, but he must not forget the purpose of democracy. We should go to the election to vote if criticize his policy.  I am also anxious about revising constitution. And we should consider more carefully and make a big deal of it. However, I think it is not because the constitution was established by tradition and history but because the constitution exists for the sake of prevention of national runaway.  I think we should discuss whether the constitution would be changed or remained. I think it should be changed because the environment has changed. The constitution is old fashioned. And, the new constitution by L. D. P. is better than present one. It is enough to change it. We should improve the constitution and the country! Wait a minute. Many constitutions around the world say the pacifism and also new constitution will show the same idea. We can never change anything if you say what we do not change means peace.  Because she thinks peace is only kept by words but I do not think so. the world is more complicated than pacifist know.  The Liberal Democratic Party of Japan enjoyed a landslide victory because they brought up the economic policy as the main issue. However, Prime Minister Abe's real intentions were to amend the Japanese constitution. He does not even understand the purpose of the Constitution, and just wants to rewrite it the way he wants it to be. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. If the Constitution is re-written into something convenient for the Government, the Government will go out of control. We must watch his moves carefully.  I agree because I also think Mr. Abe doesn't understand Japanese constitution. The Constitution is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government. He doesn't know that. Nevertheless he start to ready to change the constitution. This is serious problem.  The constitution should not be changed because of its tradition and history but because it is supposed to protect the people by limiting the powers of the Government.  I think we are short of opportunities of discussion. We should discuss more and more. Japanese government should explain this matter in detail and more times. we, including me should understand this matter in detail. Now I think Japanese people is the lack of understanding.  I agree with you. This matter is so complex. We must learn Japanese constitution and think whether we agree or not agree with Abe carefully.  This problem is very important for us and we Japanese should be interested in and discuss it. I think the citizens' opinion is not fully reflected to politics now. It is very bad thing and maybe can be called crisis of democracy.  I agree with you. This problem affect foreign countries as well as Japan and it is not good action seen from them.  This comment is inconsistent. I think Mr. Abe has not carry changing Japanese constitution through yet. It will be decided whether Mr. Abe is good minister from now.  This person is not aware of danger this law include. "
JOC JOC-15A-08N 6.21 "I think bill gates is so nice a person because he invests a lot of money in charity. And it is surprising that we have to keep two-thirds and four-fifths of existing fossil fuel reserves must remain in the ground if the world is to remain within a 2C rise in global temperatures.  Climate change maybe is the biggest problem we, the human beings, are facing right now in 21st century. People like Bill Gates who have impact on the world should step up and be the leader. Of course we also have to take responsibility and make the world safe for our future generations.  I think fusion reactor is one of the future energy resource. Fusion reactor is very deferent from nuclear energy. It use Hydrogen, not Uranium or Plutonium. It put little radioactive waste. It doesn't melt down. I mean, it's so safely. Current technology can't make it, but I hope we will use it someday.  Photovoltaic power generation, wind-generated electricity have big possibilities. However, these cannot supply energy continuously. The progress in the field of energy is required for economic overall expansion. However, there are three important problems that must be settled. It is cost, stability, and influence on environment. Such a point will have to be solved.  I think so, too. Bill Gates says, ""I choose the latter if I can realize either choosing ten future Presidents or securing the energy that is eco-friendly, and has low cost"". From this, I can know that he has good personality and understand how he regards an energy problem as important.  I think that it is wonderful news and Bill Gates is very good person. Resources are limited. For example, coal is left only for 150 years and petroleum is left only for 40 years. Therefore resource is very important. Renewable energy is wonderful invention, so we should make good use of it. If this news spread all over the world, everyone think about renewable energy, so the behavior of Bill is important for the world. I strongly believe that renewable energy should be utilized.  I think that renewable energy has some problems, too. Firstly, setting up the machine of renewable energy is very high cost. Therefore there is a possibility that electricity's cost becomes high. Secondly renewable energy is very instability. There are also a day when we have no sunlight and a day when the wind doesn't blow. These days, we cannot secure electricity. Finally, there is a possibility which occurs of influence on environment. Therefore I agree with you and I think your opinion is great.  As Bill Gates mentioned, the current climate change situation is irreversible, and I believe that there should be more investment on renewable energy. Renewable energy, compared to energy derived from fossil fuels are more accessible and has more potential. Therefore, Gates' decision may end successfully.  Bill Gates should be respectable except his business. Investing a lot of money in renewable energy business is surprising and worthy of promoting. I wish the rich did it like Bill Gates in Japan. Now Japan need new clean energy not nuclear.  You are wonderful to list the example of green energy. Certainly, there are a lot of problems on renewable energy. We must reconsider Japan's electric situations. Whether nuclear energy is good or bad seems to be a fruitless discussion.  I respect Bill Gates and his action because he invest in renewables even though it is high-risk. I think his action will be a good chance which we think about global environment.  Bill Gates is respectable person. He do action which other people cannot do. It is unusual to invest $2BN for renewable energy project. His action will make people think renewable energy again.  Bill Gates is the most rich all over the world. He created Windows and Microsoft corporation. However I don't think this only point make him grate. His other grate point is to contribute a lot of things to society like this article.  I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable.  I think it's important thing. It's meaningful for a famous person like him to announce he invest a large amount of money. Probably, we can't avoid a climate catastrophe and that current renewables are not yet close to being able to meet projected energy needs. So his action is very valuable.  I think so. I think it's role for influential people to announce global problem like environmental issue, but we must consider this problem, too.  I think it is interesting that Bill Gates invest in green energy technology and research to combat climate change, just for economic benefits. It means coming of the new era when good for environment is good for economic.  Some people may say that supported by capitals such as Bill Gates to solve the energy problem shouldn't be allowed to fear they will monopolize energy business. However, I think such people ""should"" invest this business because energy, environmental problem is very serious and we must solve it immediately. "
JOC JOC-15A-09N 8.05 "I don't know advancing the construction of a new US base by the governments of Japan and the United States is right or not. If it is not right, we have to prevent Japan from moving in the wrong direction. As Kenzaburo Oe believes and Yoichi Higuchi says, we should believe citizens protesting and support them.  I believe that the governments of Japan and the United States should not advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. First of all, there are many people who oppose to build new base at Henoko. Japanese government should listen to their voices. Additionally, nature and ecology of the sea at Henoko would be destroyed by building new base. All in all, we have to oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko. We should not only talk but also take actions to protect land and people of Okinawa.  I oppose to advance construction of a new US base at Henoko because Japanese government ignore the voices of people in Okinawa. We should take actions to prevent building new base.  I can't agree with the construction of a new US base in the Henoko district. Because it may lead to destruction of the environment. Beautiful sea which various kinds of sea creatures live in should be protected. Moreover, the mental burden on the locals will be too large. I disagree with the move to revise national security legislation and the constitution too. I want Japan to remain a peaceful country as it is Around Henoko of Okinawa where the mammalian dugongs of the sea in the crisis of the extinction inhabit is one of the sea areas where biodiversity is the richest in Japan. A human being does not have the right to break the variety into. If Japan and the United States which are a developed country take the lead to perform the environmental disruption while the world sings environmental protection, the other countries must be angry. I think that they should think about not only the political element but also the environmental element and should make a conclusion for the issue of transference.  I think so, too. Environment is not the thing which a human being may destroy. In addition, the human being grows by nature, and anyone know that we are healed by its beautiful scenery. I think that the transference supporter should reconsider such a natural idea.  I oppose to advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko, too. Now, the relationship between the Japanese government and Okinawa is not good because of US bases problem. It is important to discuss the political issues. In addition, I assume we need to think about the environmental issues to protect the beautiful environment in Okinawa.  I support Abe on this point. The construction of a new US base is necessary for Japan. Protesters are usually emotional and what they say is a little worthy of listening to. To cope with threat od China, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity. The right of self-defense is guaranteed as the natural right. So, there is no problem that Japan exercise the self-defense right.  To begin with, there was an agreement with America. The Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama spoiled it. If he had not become the Prime Minister, the construction of a new US base would have advanced.  X= people in Okinawa necessarily disagree O= people in Okinawa do not necessarily disagree This is the first time I've heard this. I oppose the construction of a new US base. We should protect nature and beautiful scene. I think it good that famous persons like Oe take concrete action. And Japanese government has to lend an ear to the voice of the people living in Okinawa.  I think so. If more US base is construct in Okinawa, it will impose a burden on Okinawa. And the friction between Japanese government and Okinawa will worsen. So, I think Japan and the United States should not advance the construction of a new US base at Henoko.  I often go to Okinawa. Seas in Okinawa are very beautiful. We can look fish which is swimming because water is very clean. Therefore I strongly believe that we should protect the nature in Okinawa. In addition I really looked Okinawa US base. Then I was very surprised because airplane was very fast and very noisy. I think that US bases are very dangerous and harm for people who live in Okinawa. All in all, I think that we should think about US bases and produce the solution.  I agree with you. Sea in Okinawa is very beautiful and there are many farms of sugarcane. I strongly believe that we should protect these nature. If we set up the US base in Okinawa, it connect to destroy the nature of Okinawa. In addition, US bases are very dangerous. Therefore Japanese people should insist that stop to set up the US bases in Okinawa.  Unfortunately, I have never been to Okinawa. However, I often see clear sea in Okinawa on TV and the Internet. Nature is great and respectable. If China attacked and occupied Okinawa, a lot of factories would be constructed. The factory would emit toxic sewage and smoke. Therefore transparent sea in Okinawa would be destroyed. To keep the clear sea, the construction of a new US base is necessary.  I disagree with Kenzaburo Oe for some reasons. It is true that some people say that the construction of a new US base will spoil clear and beautiful sea in Okinawa. However, China is threatening Japan with the navy today. So, Japan must more cooperate with America. And protesters such as Kenzaburo Oe do not show a concrete counterproposal. They are emotional and sensational.  I know it is not a good thing for Okinawans, and many Japanese people disagree with the new base construction in Henoko. However, although the Japanese people disagree with it, nobody help them. Any prefectures give their name in place of Henoko. Therefore, this issue does not advance for a long time. All governors in Japan should discuss about it, and if they cannot solve the problem, the Prime Minister Abe has to try to discuss with the US  Natural selection is inevitable. If the construction of a new US base were called off, it would be easy for China to attack Japan. If China attacked Japan, as a result, nuclear weapons would be used. Human beings would be extinct by nuclear weapons. Is it a natural selection? God knows it. However, we must keep the prosperity of human beings. Therefore, Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity for prosperity of human beings.  I think this movement which famous people take the lead in insisting on peace is very effective because people tend to be influenced by them. People in Nago may be encouraged to have hope by them. Recently, the government of Japan attempt to change the interpretation of the Constitution, especially, Article 9. However, many people are against this idea. I think we should protect Article 9 just as it is because it is a symbol of Japanese peace. It has passed 70 years since the Second World War was over. Let's take advantage of this opportunity and think about Japanese future developments.  I totally agree and am with Mr. Oe's position against the construction of US military basement in Henoko since it seems that the government has not learnt we have so criticized about the base in Okinawa. Even if Japan are forced to have them because of the lost in WWII, we have to minimize the number of the bases as it produces lots of harms like noise and crash.  Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to Saying that protesters are usually emotional is so relentless. We, as human, have to take priority on thinking about our lives first. And there isn't much threat of China for instance and even afterwards too I think, so we don't have to extend our self-defense power. If we do that, it will irritate other countries of course.  I agree with Oe's idea, what the Okinawan citizens will win. And I also wish for it. I think the problem of Futenma air station is unreasonable. All people should have the right of living peaceful. So it is very dangerous thing to change the constitution. Not only Okinawan people but also all Japanese people who think so too should try not to happen the situation.  I think, if China want to attack us by nuclear weapons, they do it although we don't have the Henoko base. That's because Japan have many US bases already. I can't understand why we need more bases with people's pain.  I oppose new American base. Why the government disregard nation's voice. I think that what's he does is Japan before the WW2's government. And Okinawa's things is to reflection the people who live there. What Mr. Oe who works publicly act this like is the important things . Because famous person have a great influence.  I agree with Oe Kenzaburo, even though I don't like his literature. Although, where will Futenma base move to? It is impossible to move outside the prefecture. I predict that the base will remain Futenma.  I agree with your opinion. We have to protect the beautiful nature of Okinawa.  I have never been to Okinawa, but I know that there are a lot of problem about World War two and American armies in Okinawa. Henoko's people disagree with the new base construction. I agree with people in Henoko. Japanese Prime Minister Abe must try to discuss about American army with American politicians.  Okinawa used to be a one country since it had own culture. I think Okinawa should be one public culture. But Okinawa's own economic is not enough to support its country. "
ACA ACA-A6U-006 9.82 "ON THE PASSAGE OF A FEW PEOPLE: SITUATIONIST NOSTALGIA PETER SMITH An endless adventure…an endless passion…an endless banquet. A Situationist Scrapbook, edited by Iwona Blazwick in consultation with Mark Francis, Peter Wollen and Malcolm Imrie, Verso/ ICA Publications, London, 1989. 96 pp. ISBN 0 — 8691 — 983 — 8. £10.95. (sandpaperback) On the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time. The Situationist International 1957 — 1972, edited by Elisabeth Sussman, The MIT Press/ICA, Boston, Massachusetts, 1989, 200 pp. ISBN 0860919838. £19.95. I These books are both related to the exhibition On The Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Period of Time presented at the Musée national d'art moderne-Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts during 1989 — 90. The exhibition was conceived and realised by Mark Francis and Peter Wollen with Paul Hervé Parsy. Francis and Wollen have also contributed articles (one each) both of which appear in both books as introductory statements on the Situationist International. Both books are anthologies of materials by a large number of contributors. Their titles invoke the Situationists' rhetorical use of long and rhapsodic titles. They also denote deliberate obfuscations deriving from Dada and Surrealism. On the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time (henceforth ‘the Boston text') is a film title used by Guy Debord in 1959. The Situationist Scrapbook includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI'). These are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's Psychogeographic Map of Venice (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s. The greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988. The book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain. The Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, along with historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning). ‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’ If this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world. Francis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism. The Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of On the Passage have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same. This legitimation in turn is related to the principle of détournement , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's LHOOQ ) with subversive intent. My view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem for the most part to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists. They are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI. Self-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes. The Boston text, for example, is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are! More prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text Mémoires of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd. One of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice. It appears a few lines away from the plagiarised title of the book. The proscription is, of course, a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, in the light of the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony. The Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group. There is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition. Some of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate. Francis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972. These stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition. In the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’. Periodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’. It is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period. To the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period? The notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong. The materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook no doubt express ideas about which strong convictions are held. What are these convictions, and why are they not articulated? Why were the exhibits left to speak for themselves? It seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market. Whatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project. The contradiction is perhaps a familiar one. As Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.' It is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition. Predictably they kept their distance. At the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity. It was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s. Thus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except in terms of agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of détourné illustrations in their publications. The article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies. Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase. Nevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history. He also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists. Apart from Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’. This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English. Levin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium. Debord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’. The main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema. For example, he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's Vent d'Est , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’ Not having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties. Defensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, and so on, typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’ Nevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing in public— Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France. Both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived. Further to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer. An example of this is the early Lettrist film Hurlement en faveur de Sade , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences. As far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text in relation to its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed. Whatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor. Hence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work. His remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation. Levin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema. His hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself. In the opening sequence of Hurlement , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated. The tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord. Situationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’. Levin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice. One of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction. Moreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act in culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order. Nevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute. It is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder. Debord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent. Debord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession. In Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences. One of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored. Debord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history. The blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art. Suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity. Debord, for example, proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.' There is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism. Moreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation. It sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement. Further clarification might also be required as to how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle. The critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism. For Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive. In Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions at once. More specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period. The SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’. This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it. In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified). He does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord. However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved. The reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn. It is, in short, uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse. Levin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation. What he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism. As with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for détournement (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc. The Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life. The fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries. The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books. If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life. The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre. The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences. The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers' Council after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system. The simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing. With the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon. The SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary. The revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, rather than by its standing as a political organisation. The remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image. Its re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names. The Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members. The gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text. They are not merely documentation. They are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book. The political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work. It is, for example, revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism. The introductions in both books are anodyne and brief. The historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period prior to the founding of the SI. Détournement and dérive (drifting) are thus reclaimed in terms of their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it. With the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are subject to critical reassessment. The short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions. Some of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel. Clearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident in that the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates. The temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal. The  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference so that popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text. There is of course an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those in possession of it. This presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before. Frank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’ He adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.' It therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI. ‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future. That sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI. The belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day. II What I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly due to the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics. What I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself. The Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves apart from the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, so that this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice. Their self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome. The effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications. Debord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium. Bernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper. There are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook. They appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors. Firstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, and so on. Whatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists? On what basis is this reference made? There is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation. Furthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a kind of make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection. There was no such connection. As late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested. The arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’. The case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists. Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted. Given the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord et al . are going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann. On the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’. The desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not in keeping with the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts. The second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the Sunday Times in 1967. Steiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem. Christopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic. His comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974. Gray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society. ‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body. The SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up. Their quest was for the perfect formula.' The history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives. The declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs. The movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world. Anti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957. The rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists. At the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism. More generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism. The more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (such as automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary. The critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century. The Situationists, contribution to this was negligible. The Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field. The conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism. The more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split. Others have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists. If the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future. Like the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian. Despite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps because of it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy. The Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society. Raymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’. Another Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work. ‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists. It is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti. But what does it mean? Obviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour. The refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs. Its political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message. The aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working. For other theorists such as William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively. Indeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation. Marx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’. Lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice. The plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction. Asger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production. Despite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (other than agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative. The aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle. In contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne. Their notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist. Its meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work. Now that Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did. Their appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics. These writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time. The Situationist lifestyle (in so far as it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain. Situationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated. For the most part, however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts. Indeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains. The uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic. The Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism. Moreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern. The decline of the meta-narrative in favour of aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists. The fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them. Nevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism. The concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists. The historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed. We have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances as if they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream."
ACA ACA-AS6-001 8.82 "Action and Inaction in the Cities Susanne MacGregor and Ben Pimlott The essays in this book do not amount to a programme: but they are intended to provide a springboard for one. The aim is to analyse a problem which economic growth alone has failed to cure — and to consider possible new forms of public action. The biggest single difficulty in drawing attention to urban poverty is that it is not new, but simply — in some of its most worrying manifestations — getting worse. Like the poor themselves, the inner city has long been with us. Ever since the Industrial Revolution created a mass urban society, the conditions of the poorest city dwellers have given rise to anxiety among the better off. The inner city has been variously regarded as a cause for moral outrage, a threat to public order, or as a stain on the nation's conscience. Meanwhile bad housing, bad sanitation, lack of education, and other perennial ills associated with overcrowding and poverty have been routinely denounced by political leaders and social reformers. A central objective of the post-war welfare state was, indeed, to alleviate the problems of the urban poor, over whom Beveridge's Five Giants (Want, Disease, Ignorance, Squalor, and Idleness) had for so long held sway. In the early 1940s and 1950s, the belief was widely held that a combination of government intervention — in the form of town planning, housing and health programmes, and the provision of social security — and permanent male full employment, together with an increase in real wages, would reduce suffering due to poverty to manageable proportions. The 1964 Labour Government was elected on a tide of impatience at the slackening pace of social reform, but also of optimism that little more than economic growth, fuelled by technological change, was needed to remove the main causes of urban deprivation (MacGregor, 1981). Disillusion swiftly followed. The work of Peter Townsend and others showed that, far from presiding over the elimination of poverty, the Wilson Government actually failed to prevent some of its features from worsening (Townsend and Bosanquet, 1972). Evidence began to mount that much of the social welfare paternalism of the post-war period had created almost as many problems as it solved. Neither the Butler Education Act of 1944, nor the introduction of comprehensive schools, prevented a high proportion of children from under-achieving. Post-war reconstruction and housing programmes seemed to do nothing to prevent, and seemed even to encourage, a rise in crime and mental illness. Meanwhile, in many parts of the country, a problem as old as cities themselves — tension between cultural groups, between earlier immigrants and newer ones, between black, brown, and white, and (increasingly) between large sections of urban youth and the police — came to be identified as the key inner-city issue. Rising unemployment turned a lingering and growing malaise into a crisis. As in the United States, so in Britain it was an outbreak of violence that dramatically brought the plight of the inner cities to public notice. In the early 1980s, at a time when manufacturing industry was collapsing and the outlook for the unskilled looked particularly bleak, frustration boiled over in a series of riots in London, Bristol, Birmingham, Liverpool, and elsewhere. All were spontaneous outbursts: none, contrary to some claims, were politically inspired or orchestrated (except in Northern Ireland where urban problems existed on a grander, more devastating scale, and where there was a unique heritage). Many had an ‘ethnic’ dimension, in the sense that many of the rioters were black. Unlike, however, the 1958 Notting Hill riots, few of those involved were immigrants — the vast majority were British born. And the disturbances could not strictly be called racial: the most prominent feature was that of violent clashes between young people and the police. The problems, however, were not confined to violent upheavals of this kind. Paul Harrison's Inside the Inner City: Life under the Cutting Edge focused on Hackney, a London borough ranked among the worst off on any scale of urban deprivation  (Harrison, 1983). Harrison describes (p. 369) the way in which the inner urban powder-keg leads to a vicious circle, with many victims, but few individual villains: The police force face the virtually impossible task of keeping the lid on the explosive mixture of ingredients that the dynamics of British society have assembled in the inner city. This mixture, heated by recession and high unemployment, inevitably generates a high level of crime. This necessitates, in turn, a far more numerous and ubiquitous police presence than in other kinds of area, far more frequent unpleasant contact with the public as potential suspects, and far greater opportunities for police misjudgment or abuse. The inevitable sufferers, of course, are the poor, of whom those who actually commit the offences that concern the police are a tiny minority and whom, indeed, it should be the purpose of the police to protect. Not only are the most disadvantaged on the receiving end of most crime, argues Harrison, they also have to put up with the heaviest police presence. They are more likely to be stopped and searched, and to be the victim of mistaken arrest or conviction. At the same time, the residents of the poorest areas have to suffer, in a way that is not true of those who live elsewhere, a growing fear of attack on themselves or their property. Improved police methods might help, writes Harrison, to contain the problem. But, without other changes, the result is likely to be a ‘society of barricaded self-defence, and a steady erosion of civil liberties’. And he concludes, ‘of all the warnings that the inner city has to offer for the direction British society is taking, this is perhaps the most sinister’. Harrison's vision of a nightmarish future for inner cities, locked in a cold or hot war between have-nots and the forces of public order, was echoed by Robert Chesshyre (1987, p. 95), who concluded that by the late 1980s: The basic social contract, whereby citizens enjoy certain rights — including health care, decent education and housing and a job — in return for which they observe the rule of law, was breaking down. As a consequence an underclass was evolving — football hooligans, muggers, inner city rioters — somewhat more frightening than their Dickensian forebears because they were mobile and all too visible. Recently, of course, there has been an added dimension — part media-and-politician inflated, part real: drugs. The spiral in drug abuse and trafficking, with direct consequences for the AIDS epidemic, has created a new kind of alarm. The early 1980s witnessed a radical change in patterns of heroin taking, alongside the global increase. Smoking heroin (‘chasing the dragon’) was one feature of the upsurge. Another was the increased availability of, and demand for, cocaine. Sensational media and police reports in 1989 seemed to suggest an increased use of ‘crack’ among young people in parts of south London, Liverpool, and Birmingham — with attendant fears that this particularly dangerous substance might become widespread, as it was reported to be in parts of the United States. for the moment, however, the pattern of drug abuse in Britain remains as varied as ever — with home-produced drugs such as amphetamines as serious a problem as those that hit the headlines. It is a symptom of public anxiety about urban squalor — and, less creditably, of class and racial prejudice — that ‘drugs’ and ‘inner cities’are automatically linked in the popular consciousness (MacGregor, 1989a). Nevertheless, drug-taking and more particularly the disruptive social consequences of addiction, are especially serious in areas of city poverty (Burr, 1989). In short, if life was always harder in the inner cities than elsewhere, and if conditions may temporarily have been alleviated by the impact of the welfare state and rising incomes, the last decade has been widely represented as a period of deterioration. Moreover, few would dispute that this apparent decline is a reality: the first words of the Prime Minister herself, after the result of the 1987 election was known, were an acknowledgement of the challenge posed to Government by the ‘inner cities’. What has been lacking however — as well as the political will to do something — has been any shared agreement on the cause. Can the problems of urban poverty be blamed on individual pathology? On feckless parents and grandparents? Or on the social or physical environment — the replacement of companionably unhygienic slums by soulless tower blocks with broken lifts (Coleman et al ., 1985)? Or would a simple injection of resources transform Kafkaesque honeycombs into happy living-spaces, with a consequent  decline in inner-city ills? ‘A duke can live comfortably in a castle, after all’, the architect Cedric Price is quoted as saying. ‘You and I would die of frostbite. Same building — just a matter of money and management’(Parkin, 1989). The view that only ‘outstanding management’ could meet the problem was held by the Audit Commission (1987). The picture painted by the Commission's report on inner London is as gruesome as any ever presented (and is itself revealing of common prejudices in its choice of indicators of deprivation): In some London boroughs, unemployment among young men exceeds 45%; in some places, among young blacks, it exceeds 60%. More than one child in three is born into a single parent family. Half the school leavers have no O levels or their CSE equivalents. Homelessness, housing conditions, crime are worsening year by year, as the cycle of urban deprivation becomes more established (p. 1) Drawing on North American experience, the Commission concluded that ‘poor management was an important contributory factor to New York's problems’, and sought to apply the same lessons here (p. 2). The Government's post-1987 initiatives have, to some extent, reflected a diagnosis based on the need for better management — though on the principle that central authorities can provide a firmer grip than local ones — but combined with an anti-collectivist belief in the restorative powers of capitalism. Leech and Amin (1988, p. 14) summarize this approach, not unfairly, in the following terms: the encouragement of private investment and the liberation of the market; the containment of the forces of social discontent; the control of the powers of the local authorities; and the encouragement of the movement of the wealthy into the inner city thus creating buffer areas of Tory support, accentuating inequalities and injustice and (hopefully though not necessarily) reducing the potential for conflict among the urban poor. The main thrust of the Government's policy is contained in the January 1988 White Paper on Regional Policy and the Enterprise Economy, in the new Employment Training programme, and especially in the March 1988 Action for Cities programme — all  resting on wider reforms to local government structure and finance, and to education and housing. The most striking feature of this package, apart from its aim actively to involve employers and entrepreneurs, is a sharp reduction in the role of local government. Despite the contemporary tone of much of Action for Cities , the programme's heritage can be traced to the early 1960s studies which provided the basis for the 1965 Milner–Holland Report on housing and the 1967 Plowden Report on education, as a result of which general improvement areas and education priority areas were established. The 1970s ‘Urban Programme’ had a social, rather than economic, emphasis and was administered by the Home Office. It was initiated partly in response to the furore caused by Enoch Powell's 1969 ‘rivers of blood’ speech, much as disturbances at the 1976 Notting Hill Carnival prompted further steps on the part of the Department of the Environment —‘A riot makes a much bigger impact on government thinking’, as Donnison (1987) has pointed out, ‘than any amount of earnest and accurate research’. The Urban Programme consisted of grants and initiatives under the 1969 Local Government Grants (Social Need) Act, which was intended as a flexible instrument to provide supplementary help to local authorities in the fields of housing, education, and health. Originally, the Programme supplemented existing central and local government schemes designed to meet special needs in urban areas. The scope was extended in an ‘enhanced’ Urban Programme, which included economic and environmental as well as social projects, and was specifically directed at the inner urban areas where the problems were most severe. Earlier, the change of emphasis from a ‘social’ to an ‘economic and environmental’focus had been reflected in a switch of responsibility for the Programme from the Home Office to the Department of the Environment. The ‘enhanced Programme resulted from the 1978 Inner Urban Areas Act, based on a White Paper, published the previous year, on Policy for the Inner Cities (DoE, 1977), the first comprehensive policy statement on the subject to acknowledge it as a definable and cohesive problem. The White Paper drew on studies conducted earlier in the decade in Liverpool, Birmingham, and London which pointed to a debilitating flight of capital and skilled labour from the critical areas of deprivation. A key aspect of the 1977 White Paper was the stress it placed on the wider effects of poverty: that it was not just those with acute needs who suffered. It argued that in talking about inner cities it was vital to think in terms not just of individuals, but of society; that the multiple deprivations of the worst hit areas affected all the residents; that the consequences included a pervasive sense of neglect and decay, a decline in community spirit, a low standard of neighbourhood facilities, and an increase in crime and vandalism; and that, without government intervention, the future was one of reduced job opportunities, deteriorating housing, and a decline in public services. The document, and the legislation that derived from it, pointed to a positively discriminatory approach: with both central and local government supplementing existing programmes in such a way as to strengthen local economies, as well as the physical and social environment. Such measures constituted the present Government's heritage, when it took office in 1979. None of them, of course, anticipated the scale of the problems which were caused by the slump and collapse of much of what remained of inner urban manufacturing industry in the early 1980s. Neither, at first, did the incoming administration foresee the impact of rising unemployment, which was to be especially serious among the urban young. True, the new Secretary of State for the Environment laid stress, from the outset, on the need for economic regeneration, and indicated his sympathy for the voluntary sector in the tackling of urban problems. The previous Government, however, had already pointed to the need to revitalize urban economies, and at first the shift was more rhetorical than real. Michael Heseltine (1987, p. 138) has since claimed that ‘we set a new objective: to make the inner cities places where people would want to live and work and where the private investor would be willing to put his money’. Partnership became his slogan — the partnership of public and private brains and money. A new Urban Development Grant was devised, to pump-prime with public funds schemes which would then attract private investment. Heseltine's vision was of ‘partnerships which recognise  that there are some things that only governments can pay for, but also that the ingenuity and flexibility of the private sector is indispensable’(p. 156). He claims that serious work on inner-city policy began in 1979: but it was, undoubtedly, the riots of 1981, coinciding with the biggest drop in employment and job vacancies since the war, which gave impetus to the new approach. Urban Development Corporations were introduced in 1981 in London Docklands and Merseyside, and the Urban Development Grant came in late the following year. Conservative instincts were, of course, to minimize — within the ‘partnership’— state involvement and expenditure, relative to that of private enterprise. Yet, the irony of the early 1980s — as a deteriorating, but perennial, urban problem rapidly became the most acute aspect of the crisis of mass unemployment — was that a Tory government, willy-nilly, found itself presiding over an increase in state intervention through a variety of agencies. The increased scale of operations also ushered in another fashion of the 1980s — new management structures. Thus in 1985 City Action Teams were introduced to each ‘Inner City Partnership’ area to co-ordinate the work of the three government departments involved. Task forces, meanwhile, were directed to tackle youth unemployment. By 1986/7 the Urban Programme was supporting 1,380 starter units and 400 business starts in enterprise workshops. It was providing 27,500 training places (often in conjunction with the Manpower Services Commission): some 2,500 buildings were being improved; estate action aimed to tackle run down housing; and a large number of new ‘partnerships’(which some might see as subsidies, or discredited regional grants, in a new guise) were in operation, in an effort to bring private investment to run-down urban areas. By 1988 it was claimed that £200 million of Urban Development Grant and Urban Regeneration Grant had successfully ‘levered’ more than £800 million of private investment into the inner cities (although how much of the latter sum might have been invested in any case is difficult to say). Meanwhile, there were other incentive schemes — Enterprise Zones, for example, and simplified Planning Zones, which aimed to lift tax and planning ‘barriers’ in order to facilitate investment. Indeed, while with one hand trying to hold down expenditure by  local authorities, the Government found itself by the late 1980s involved with the other hand in massive ear-marked spending on inner urban areas. The Department of the Environment alone by 1988 was spending half a billion pounds out of an Action for Cities total, involving most Home departments, estimated at £3 billion. Perhaps a Labour government would have spent even more: it would certainly have spent it in different ways. It is a curious comment on Thatcherism, however, that the administration most committed to a reduction in the role of the state, and in the need for an independent private sector, has spent more on specific urban regeneration and employment schemes and incentives to private investment in urban areas than any other in recent history. One of the most bizarre aspects of government policy has been the effective murder of the voluntary sector, and its appropriation, by subterfuge, into the Tory version of the corporate state. Conservatives have always lauded the ‘voluntarist’ principle in welfare, and encouraged it from platforms. Faced, however, with the catastrophic increase in unemployment and the need to occupy large numbers of workless people without directly employing them (which would have run counter to the economic doctrine which had led to the redundancy of many of them in the first place), the Government poured money into any ‘voluntary’ agency willing to put in a bid for government-funded cheap labour. One result was the triumphant expansion of some charitable organizations, which rejoiced both at their new-found importance and at the Government's munificence. Another was the transformation of many such bodies, already heavily subsidized from public funds, into de facto agencies of the state, which financed them and indirectly determined their policy. Nowhere was the impact of this clumsy sleight of hand more evident than in the inner cities, where voluntary organizations had been most active, and where the Government was most anxious for them to mop up unemployment. However, the later withdrawal of government support, with the scrapping of the Community Programme as unemployment receded, left many of these voluntary organizations high and dry. The National Council for Voluntary Organizations (NCVO) has suggested from a recent survey that  around 3,000 projects had been affected and had lost £285 million in funding (MacGregor, 1990). There was, of course, a crucial element in the Government's anxiety: the high concentration of ethnic minorities in the areas of concern. In 1981 nearly 40 per cent of ethnic minorities in the UK lived in ‘partnership’ or ‘programme’areas. There is a danger in reading back from this figure another stereotype, similar to the Pavlovian ‘drug addiction/inner city’ assumed link. Some urban areas have serious problems without a major ethnic dimension (Newcastle, Teesside); not all members of ethnic minorities are poor or deprived. Nevertheless, the high proportion of inner urban populations composed of people from ethnic minorities, and the high incidence among these groups of all the indices of poverty and social and environmental hardship — combined with the specific problem of inter-racial rivalry, harassment, and tension — make race and ethnicity an aspect that is central to any analysis of the inner cities and of any ameliorative approach. It was with the aim of contributing to such an improvement, as the representative body of employers and business investors, that the 1988 Confederation of British Industry (CBI) Task Force on business and urban regeneration came to three conclusions: first (in line with the Government's own beliefs), that business must take the lead in reversing urban decline; second, that charity — governmental or voluntary — cannot in itself deal with problems, and any regeneration must spring from private investment, commercially motivated; and third, that the potential exists for such investment, provided that early projects are seen to succeed (CBI, 1988). Echoing the Government, the CBI stressed the ‘partnership’ theme, involving developers and (for the CBI) local authorities. Leadership in such ventures, however, should come from businessmen, not local government. The essence of the CBI approach — as it admits, and as the Government approves — is enlightened self-interest: salvation will only come when investors want to invest, not when well-meaning local politicians and bureaucrats decide that they ought to do so. Notably absent from the CBI's understanding of the problems of inner cities was any notion that they should be met by national economic policy. The assumption, rather, was one of  special, even isolated, blackspots that can be dealt with by localized attention. As an organization of businessmen, the CBI — naturally perhaps — looked on the inner city primarily as a business opportunity. Thus a special report of the CBI London Region Urban Regeneration Task Force in October 1988 concluded that there was a need for partnerships in which government, local authorities, teachers, church leaders, and residents would all play a part, but with business taking the lead — helped by government subsidy or pump-priming. The bottom line to private investment remains, as always, the extent and nature of government funding. One paradoxical consequence of central government limits to rate support grant was a real-money leap in business rates in some areas, and a sizeable increase in the proportion of local budgets paid through rates by the business community. This heightened business interest in local spending and revenue raising, and fermented anxiety about the operation of the uniform business rate and the community charge: the CBI, previously concerned about fluctuating rates, is now concerned about the commercial consequences of fluctuating services, as local authorities try to manage their finances. To the CBI's worries about the future of the inner city is added a very real concern that business services may be placed high on the list for cuts by budget-chopping local authorities. While echoing the Government's ‘partnership’ theme in its rhetoric, and paying dutiful lip service to the principle of laissez-faire , the coded message of the CBI is an urgent demand for more government funding, not less. So far, the Government has been unreceptive. In addition to the Audit Commission and the CBI, Business in the Community (BIC) has taken up the theme of ‘partnership’. The problem, however, is turning phrases that are warmly applauded at rotary club or chamber of commerce lunches into serious investment. Why should genuine money-makers bother? ‘We all like to be liked’, as one Northern businessman recently put it. ‘But, in reality…what we are doing is serving our own best interests…. The more successful the town and country is the more chance we as individuals have of being successful.’ The trouble is, however, that the linking of individual with group  self-interest is not a sufficient incentive for smaller firms struggling to make a profit, nor indeed for large, profitable organizations. One of the causes of the inner-city crisis has, precisely, been the withering of the ‘Victorian value’ of civic philanthropy which once encouraged locally-based businesses to link commercial considerations with the welfare of the wider community. It is naïve to imagine that such an ethic can be revived by exhortation alone, or by the use of in uplifting but empty phraseology. It is possible, indeed, to turn the logic of the opponents of traditional regional policy and incentives, and of the proponents or a ‘partnership’ approach, on its head. ‘Partnership’ is an acknowledgement that business will not invest without encouragement, combined with a view that long-term investment needs to be self-sustaining. But if the aim is to encourage serious investment, there is also a need for serious spending on infrastructure and services, is well as for start-up finance or subsidy. There is a need, above all, for an environment in which a fledgling (or established) business will feel comfortable and wish to remain, because of local amenities and because of the availability of a healthy, happy, well-equipped workforce. It is certainly arguable (and many progressive employers would agree) that the wisest use of public money from a strictly economic point of view would be on schools, houses, and medical services, together with relevant training and measures to reduce discrimination; in short, that the agencies which most obviously have the capacity to produce strategic planning of a business-friendly kind are precisely those which this pro-business administration wishes to bypass — central government departments, and local government, properly funded. That, more or less, was the conclusion reached by the 1985 report of the Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission on Urban Priority Areas,Faith in the City (1985), a remarkable document roundly condemned by some Conservatives for its alleged implicit Marxism. Focusing on economic decline, physical decay, and social disintegration as distinctive features of contemporary urban poverty, the report stressed the Commission's view — quite different from that of the Government, the Audit Commission, or even the CBI — that ‘the inner city and the peripheral estates  are creatures of the whole society, not simply of their inhabitants’(p. 24). It dared to question the assumption that the creation of wealth, at whatever social cost, was necessarily the first priority of an economic system. Contemplating ‘the displaced fragments of inner city decline’— peripheral council estates — it suggested that wealth-creation ‘must always go hand in hand with just distribution,— offering, thereby, an alternative interpretation of ‘partnership’(p. 53). It commented, too, on the environmental and ecological consequences. For the Archbishop's commissioners, partnership needed to mean not just a link-up between business and the public or voluntary sectors, but a conscious attempt to meet the powerlessness felt by the ‘people in the street’(p. 186). The Archbishop's investigators did not search for, or embrace, a fashionable solution. On the contrary. Their main call was for a return to the 1977 White Paper, namely: ‘a specific commitment on the part of central and local government to the regeneration of the inner areas…both central and local government will be judged by their willingness to implement new priorities, to make funds available, to change policies and to adapt their organisations,(DoE, 1977, para. 25). Faith in the City concluded bluntly that the 1977 White Paper's ‘policy proposals have not been tried and found wanting. They have not been tried’(Archbishop of Canterbury's Commission, 1985, p. 193). So far from treating the problems of the inner city as local difficulties which a bit of capitalist enterprise could clear up, it regarded them as evidence of systemic failure. The retreat from the principles of the 1977 White Paper occurred in the context of the economic crisis of the 1970s, which culminated in the 1976 resort to the International Monetary fund. The scale of expenditure on all aspects of local government, and the greatly increased proportion of total public expenditure which it represented, meant that, when the crisis came, some were led to blame local authorities, and in the cuts that followed inner cities inevitably suffered most acutely. A serious blow, of course, was also dealt to the reputation of the Labour Party, which controlled many of the councils with the greatest needs and which made the heaviest demands on the public purse, and whose members were least apologetic about  doing so. When Anthony Crosland declared that the ‘party is over, he cannot have realized that the Government's cuts presaged a long period in which the Labour Party itself would be seriously threatened — partly because of its association with supposedly spendthrift urban policies. In the early and mid-1980s a handful of ‘municipal socialist’ Labour councils (triumphantly declared ‘loony’by Norman Tebbit and the right-wing press) were used as a symbol of the party's alleged financial irresponsibility. With Labour welfarism out of fashion, and neo-liberalism in vogue, the scene was set, not only for the downgrading of local authority power (including the outright abolition of the Greater London Council and the metropolitan authorities which, though actually limited in their spending power, were nevertheless the coordinators and vocal champions of many inner urban schemes), but also for the injection of national party dogma into the management of local affairs. ‘This Government is a radical government with a radical message…’, wrote Secretary of State Nicholas Ridley (1988, p. 32). ‘Conservatives have a strong localist tradition, but the danger of too much localism is that the Party's voice and through the Party the political interpretation of the Government's voice is not heard.’ This was one ‘problem’, at least, which the present administration has proved highly successful at solving. So dramatic, indeed, has been the impact of privatization and contracting out of services, and of other local government changes, that a reduction of over a third in the total number of local authority employees over the next five years has been predicted by one senior official (Davies, 1988). It remains to be seen whether the restructuring will save money, or merely shift essential expenditure between agencies, or simply reduce available services. What it will not do, of course, is tackle the inner-city problem — nor indeed is it designed to do so. If there ever was a Thatcherite economic miracle, it has, to an alarmingly divisive degree, passed the urban poor by. Jobless growth, changes in the composition of the workforce, increased ‘flexibility’ of labour's terms and conditions, have all contributed to an economic revival which has had minimal benefits where these are needed most. ‘The effect has been to  reinforce the concentration of unemployment in traditional inner city areas’, the Centre for Local Economic Strategies (CLES) reported in Local Work (1988), ‘and in the regions which were already suffering the worst unemployment before 1979.’ Yet the critical question for the 1990s and the twenty-first century remains unanswered: is there an approach — through central government intervention, decentralization, the encouragement of participation, or any other method — which avoids the insensitivities of bureaucratic welfarism, and yet produces results? PROGRAMME FOR THE 1990s Responding to this question — by asking new questions as much as by offering solutions — is the purpose of this book. It is, indeed, a great deal easier to point out the irrelevance of much of what is happening at the moment than to have confidence in any particular alternative. Still, some things may be said with reasonable assurance. Almost everyone agrees, for instance, that enterprise zones alone are of limited value, that tax incentives are relatively ineffective and deregulation is no solution. Despite government rhetoric, the impact of such measures on people rather than places — as several authors in this volume show — has been marginal. Contributors also agree on another point: that public expenditure and public services based on principles of universalism and citizenship for all are central to any real programme. The chapters in this book deliberately provide a balance between experts with direct political or administrative experience of the areas they describe (such as Nick Raynsford and David Mallen) and academic observers. Several contributors have both political/ administrative and academic credentials. The original intention was to provide a critical accompaniment to government promises of action on the inner cities made at the beginning of this Parliament. Out of them, however, has emerged the kernel of a view of the future. If there is a consistent bias in favour of public intervention and against inertia, there is also, we hope, little shirking of awkward issues — though the collection does not claim to be  comprehensive, and there are aspects of a huge topic that are barely touched. What the book does attempt to do is to provide a framework of problems and ideas, exploring major themes. Some chapters look at the manifestations of urban breakdown-John Benyon and John Solomos writing about racial conflict and disorder, for example— others, like Robert Reiner, at the evidence on rising crime rates and the complex ethical dilemmas which are often presented as simple. Several contributors are concerned with how urban dwellers actually live their lives: Peter Townsend, for example, shows the impact of social polarization upon health and well-being by indicating differential rates of mortality and morbidity, and the widening gap between the experiences of rich and poor. Others look at local government and central-local relations in practice. Susanne MacGregor points to the impact of a growing climate of social Conservatism, a climate that is encouraged by aspects of government policy. John Gibson highlights the regressive aspects of recent local government financial reform, and predicts dire consequences for the urban poor. The chances of the new system of local government finance surviving for long seem slim. Particular services are examined by two writers closely involved with implementation: Nick Raynsford looks it recent developments in policies on housing, and David Mallen considers how education might effectively be used as a key instrument of social improvement. Hilary Land examines women's systematic loss of rights and claims for social protection and its effect on the family and children during the 1980s. She demonstrates that policies of amelioration will do in more than touch the surface unless fundamental gender inequalities are addressed. A consistent underlying theme is that a reliance on market forces cannot be the answer: in every area, public action is urgently needed. Alternative approaches are reviewed by Franco Bianchini, who points to the potential role of an adequately funded arts programme in fostering civic pride and countering alienation, and Doreen Massey who emphasized the need for a combination of progressive national and local economic strategies. She turns the Government's self-help approach around by arguing that urban recovery will only be achieved by empowering the people who live in cities. Her final essay, indeed, echoes the theme of the whole book: the focus must be on democracy and on a sensitivity to local and individual needs and aspirations. In the early post-war period, the British welfare state was thought to be the envy of much of the industrialized world. Today, it is a cause for embarrassment, especially in the context of moves towards European integration. One reason is relative economic decline. Another is the failure of vision of successive governments, Labour and Conservative, since 1951. A third, since 1979, has been a conscious (and accelerating) ambition to limit public provision. To a large extent, however, fashionable doctrine has been the excuse for actual incompetence and neglect. There has been a consistent failure to direct the fruits of growth to the areas, industries, and groups that need it most. Outside London and the South-East, mass unemployment persists even among ‘prime-age males’, and much of the increase in employment has taken the form of low-paid, so-called ‘part-time’ work usually undertaken by women in addition to their child-rearing and ‘community care’activities. Contempt for the public sector has led to a deterioration of the infrastructure, and a visible collapse of key public services. Meanwhile, as Layard and Nickell (1989) have shown, Britain's recent record on education and training has been notably inadequate. The pragmatic short-term remedies suggested by W. J. Wilson (1987) in his study of inner cities and public policy in the United States could serve as one starting-point for discussion of policy in Britain. Wilson warns of the long-term effects of discriminatory policies. ‘Long periods of racial oppression’, he writes, ‘can result in a system of inequality that may persist for indefinite periods of time even after racial barriers are removed’(p. 146). Bad policies in the past may continue to cause problems, long after they have been replaced by good ones. Similar problems follow from centuries of unequal treatment of men and women. Conversely, positive policies should not be abandoned because they do not show immediate miraculous results. What the Right regards as  wasteful —‘throwing money at the problem’— in terms of, for example , income support to the unwaged, non-means-tested family and child benefits, may actually be a prudent investment in the future, with social and economic dividends. Wilson's conclusion — in favour of universal programmes — is one that needs to be reasserted for many areas of policy in Britain. Here, too, Richard Titmuss's exposure of the inadequacies of the ‘residual’ model of the welfare state bears re-examination: so does his healthy disrespect for econometric models as a foundation for social policy. It is not just that a ‘market’ approach to the administration of services dehumanizes people and makes doubtful assumptions about the way organizations actually work. It also ignores the complexity and variability of social relations and human needs, ‘chopping people up’ into consumers of this, clients of that, institutionalized service. Thus, Titmuss ridiculed the contortions of some economists in trying to base models on unreal statistical categories, such as that of the ubiquitous ‘average family’(Abel-Smith and Titmuss, 1987, p. 9). In spite of their claims, ‘targeted’ programmes frequently miss some of their most needy would-be clients, and stigmatize those they do succeed in reaching: selectivist policies deepen social divisions rather than heal them. Such programmes treat people as consumers in a supermarket, an approach which is the hallmark of Thatcherite social policy best epitomized in their poll tax legislation. Another, more fundamental lack is the absence of a view of the recipients of services as social participants. An obsession with cutting costs and with theories of self-help has downgraded public services and re-evoked images of the poor law. There is no simple way to turn local administration — which increasingly means delegated central administration — into what John Stewart and Gerry Stoker (1988) call ‘community government’. Participation is an easier word to use than to implement, as was discovered by the would-be implementers of the 1969 Skeffington Report, and by many idealistic councillors in the 1980s. But to say that it is hard does not make it less desirable, neither does it mean that governments should abandon the attempt. What is clear is that civic or community pride — essential  if urban decline is not to turn into urban collapse — and the view of local government as an honourable profession, cannot survive unless the public service which local authorities provide rests on principles of local democracy. Simply handing over powers to local government (or stopping the removal of them) is not enough. But it is the sine qua non of progress towards a more sensitive management of urban affairs. Decentralization and local democracy should be the slogans of all who are concerned about the inner city. CONCLUSION The essays in this book do not present a monolithic view, and they reflect widely differing perspectives. However, they share common perceptions, as we have already indicated. Though they are neither statist nor paternalist, the authors see a larger role for democratic central and local government in the reduction of urban poverty. They do not — as this administration, despite its early assurances, appears to do — regard urban life as marginal to the issue of economic progress. On the contrary, they place the crisis in the inner cities at the centre of any national programme — of critical importance to this country's future social, economic, and constitutional well-being. They see urban decay not as a peripheral manifestation nor as a growing pain, but as a chronic condition of social polarization that is becoming firmly entrenched in British society. The authors are unconvinced that a reliance on business, left to its own devices or even pump-primed, is sufficient, without full-scale and direct attention to the needs of all residents, those in both the paid and the unpaid workforce, and their dependants. In the ancient world, during the Middle Ages and Renaissance, even in the twentieth century, the word ‘city’ was frequently associated with wealth, success, culture, and opportunity. The word ‘civilization’ itself — and the word ‘citizen’— derives from it. It is a bitter indictment of our own time that the phrase ‘inner city’ should today universally conjure up images of disorder, poverty, fear, vandalism, and alienation. If capitalism can be credited with historic levels of prosperity for many, the inner city  is the cockroach at its heart. Homelessness, drug addiction, beggars in the streets give the lie to the assumption that the standardized values and comforts of the suburbs are universally available. This book does not pretend to offer an answer. Its authors seek, rather, by challenging old approaches and re-analysing the problem, both to assert its importance and to suggest new ways of tackling it."
ACA ACA-AS6-002 9.94 "Race, Injustice, and Disorder John Benyon and John Solomos INTRODUCTION Civil disorder and unrest were recurring phenomena in many British inner-city areas during the 1980s. In 1980, 1981, and 1985 major riots in Bristol, London, Liverpool, and Birmingham commanded the headlines and became a key theme in policy debates about the future of the inner cities. It is worth stressing that in each year since 1980 there have been examples of serious street disorder (Benyon, 1984; Benyon and Solomos, 1987). These outbreaks of disorder have presented a major challenge to the Thatcher Government's image as the guardian of public order. More importantly, however, they have given added urgency to the long-running debate about the future of Britain's inner cities. The sight of violent confrontations on the streets of major cities helped to stimulate yet further the acrimonious political debate about how to regenerate depressed inner-city localities (Robson, 1988). This chapter explores the political and policy debates surrounding the major outbreaks of urban unrest during 1980–1 and 1985, and the ever-present threat of more violent disorder. After providing a brief overview of the chronology of urban unrest during the 1980s, the chapter concentrates on two main themes. First, the political debates about the origins and causes of the unrest are assessed, and second, the impact of the unrest on the policy agenda is examined. This entails a review of the impact of the Scarman Report, and other important policy documents, on the agenda of both the Government and other political institutions. Finally, the chapter concludes by providing some reflections about the prospects during the decade ahead. THE CONTEXT OF URBAN UNREST: 1981 AND 1985 The first notable instance of urban unrest during the 1980s took place in the St Paul's district of Bristol on 2 April 1980. The immediate reaction to this event was one of shock and surprise, with public and media attention focusing particularly on the interplay between racial and social deprivation in the St Paul's area (Joshua and Wallace, 1983). A year later further serious violence occurred during the weekend of 10–12 April 1981 in the Brixton area of south London; this resulted in many injuries and widespread damage, and it attracted enormous media attention. Further disturbances took place in many parts of the country in July 1981. On Friday, 3 July a pitched battle occurred in Southall between hundreds of skinheads and local Asian people, and the police quickly became embroiled. On the same night in the Liverpool 8 district of Merseyside, an apparently minor incident sparked off rioting which lasted until Monday, 6 July. The disorder in Liverpool 8 was particularly violent. For the first time ever in Britain, CS gas was fired at rioters by the police. Looting and arson were widespread, and the damage was estimated at some £10 million. On the night of 7–8 July 1981, disorder occurred in Moss Side, Manchester. During the following week disturbances were reported in places such as Handsworth in Birmingham, Sheffield, Nottingham, Hull, Slough, Leeds, Bradford, Leicester, Derby, High Wycombe, and Cirencester. Disorder again erupted in Brixton on 15 July 1981. At 2.00 a.m. eleven houses in Railton Road were raided by 176 police-officers, with a further 391 held in reserve. The police had warrants to look for evidence of unlawful drinking and to search five houses for petrol bombs, although no evidence of either was found. During the operation the houses sustained very considerable damage — windows, sinks, toilets, floorboards, furniture, televisions, and personal possessions were smashed. The resultant outcry led to an internal inquiry which exonerated those involved and stated that the police officers had been issued with sledgehammers and crowbars ‘to effect speedy entry’. Compensation of £8,500 for structural damage, and further sums for damage to personal property, were paid by the Metropolitan Police. This  raid, and the resultant violence on the streets of Brixton, convinced many people that the way policing is carried out is a vital factor in the context of urban unrest. An inquiry into the Railton Road raid by the Police Complaints Board discovered ‘serious lapses from professional standards’ and an ‘institutional disregard for the niceties of the law’(Benyon and Solomos, 1987). Disorder was again evident in 1982 and in subsequent years, although on a reduced scale (Benyon and Solomos, 1987). The attention of the news media was firmly focused on the Falklands, and so few accounts of disturbances in British cities were reported. It is clear, though, that urban unrest continued to occur in parts of London and Liverpool, and similar disorder seems to have taken place in 1983. The following year, the Metropolitan Police Commissioner reported that during 1984 there were many mini-riots which had the potential to escalate to Brixton 1981 proportions, and he added: ‘London is nowadays a very volatile city.’ A MORI opinion poll in February 1985 reported that 64 per cent of those surveyed expected further riots to occur in British cities, and seven months later their fears were justified. In September and October 1985 serious urban unrest again became the focus of popular attention. The first major eruption occurred on Monday, 9 September 1985 in the Lozells Road area of Handsworth, Birmingham. The riot resulted in the deaths of two Asian men, Kassamali and Amirali Moledina, who suffered asphyxiation in their burning post office. Another 122 people, mainly police, were reported injured and the value of damaged property was put at £7.5 million. Further rioting occurred the next day when Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, visited the area. Other disturbances, widely regarded as ‘copycat’, were reported elsewhere in the West Midlands, for example in Moseley, Wolverhampton, and Coventry, and in the St Paul's district of Bristol. The Handsworth/Soho/Lozells area, with a population of 56,300, is regarded by Birmingham City Council as the most deprived district in the city. Unemployment is a major affliction, and at the time of the riots 36 per cent of the workforce in Handsworth was out of work, while the figure for people under 24 years was 50 per cent. It is an area in which it was claimed that  reasonably good relations existed between young blacks and the police, as a result of the practice of community policing introduced in the late 1970s. However, at the end of 1981 a new superintendent instituted changes which included moving a number of the area's community police-officers to other duties and clamping down on the activities by local youths which had previously been tolerated. These changes resulted in an increase in tension between youths and the police. In July 1985 two serious disturbances occurred in Handsworth, but both were played down and went unreported in the media. The context within which the eruption on 9 September occurred was thus one of deteriorating relations between young people, especially blacks, and the police, as well as one of widespread unemployment and social disadvantage. The tinder merely required a spark, which was provided when a black youth became involved in an altercation with an officer over a parking ticket. It was alleged that during the incident, at which more police arrived, a black woman was assaulted. Three hours later some forty-five buildings in Lozells Road were ablaze. Brixton was the scene of the next outbreak of violent disorder, during the weekend 28–9 September 1985. 724 major crimes were reported, 43 members of the public and 10 police-officers were injured, and 230 arrests were made. As in Handsworth, the event which led to the rioting involved police-officers and a black person. At 7.00 a.m. on 28 September armed police entered Mrs Cherry Groce's house in Normandy Road, Brixton, looking for her son. Two shots were fired by an officer, and a bullet damaged Mrs Groce's spine causing permanent paralysis. At 6.00 p.m. the local police station was attacked with petrol bombs, and during the next eight hours large numbers of people, both black and white, took part in burning and looting which caused damage estimated at £3 million. During the riot a freelance photographer sustained injuries from which he died three weeks later. Two days after Mrs Groce was shot, rioting occurred in Toxteth (Liverpool 8). In this instance, the disturbances were precipitated when four black men were refused bail at Liverpool Magistrates' Court. During the summer there had been reports of rising tension in the area, and on 30 August a crowd demonstrated outside Toxteth Police Station and then attacked police  cars and the station itself. A number of assaults on police-officers were also reported. As in Brixton and Handsworth, police relations with youths, and especially with young black people, were a significant factor in the explosive mixture, and in Toxteth, too, the disorder was precipitated by an incident involving police officers and black people. The most serious of the disorders occurred at the Broadwater Farm Estate, in Tottenham, London. The rioting began about 7.00 p. m. on Sunday, 6 October 1985, and during a night of extraordinary violence Police Constable Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death, 20 members of the public and 223 police-officers were injured, and 47 cars and some buildings were burned. Guns were fired at the police, causing injuries to several officers and reporters, and the forces were issued with CS gas and plastic bullets, although these were not used. As in Handsworth, Brixton, and Toxteth, the context within which the disturbances occurred in Tottenham was one of deteriorating relations between the police and young people, especially blacks, and the trigger event involved police-officers and black people (Gifford, 1986). The chief superintendent for the area was a firm believer in community policing, and he put as his first priority the prevention of public disorder. However, it is clear that many of his police constables and sergeants did not agree with this approach. During the summer of 1985 there was evidence of increasing tension, and a prominent member of the Hornsey Police Federation was quoted as saying that rank and file officers ‘desperately wanted to go in hard and sort out the criminals’. Some serious incidents occurred during this period on the Broadwater Farm Estate, such as an attack on police by youths which resulted in one officer sustaining a bad head wound, and there was also a series of attacks on an Asian-owned supermarket. Senior police-officers appeared to play these incidents down, but black youths complained that on the estate they were increasingly harassed by the police. The incident which precipitated the riot began when police-officers stopped a car driven by Floyd Jarrett, a 23-year-old black man well known in the area. One of the officers decided to arrest Jarrett for suspected theft of the car, but after an altercation Jarrett  was in fact charged with assaulting a police-officer. On 13 December 1985 Jarrett was acquitted of this charge, and was awarded £350 costs against the police. While he was detained at the police station a number of police-officers used a key taken from the arrested man to enter his mother's home. During the police search of the house Mrs Cynthia Jarrett collapsed. The family alleged that her death was caused by a police-officer who pushed her over; the police denied that this had occurred. On 4 December 1985 the inquest returned a verdict of accidental death. Mrs Jarrett was certified dead at 6.35 p.m. on Saturday, 5 October, and news of the tragedy spread quickly around the estate during the evening. The next day, after sporadic incidents, violent disorder erupted at about 7.00 p. m. Disorder occurred again in 1986. During the spring there were renewed reports of increasing tension in some areas. In Notting Hill, for example, there were allegations of assaults by the police, and the planting of drugs, while in Nottingham a number of forced entries into black people's homes and a series of street searches caused widespread anger. On the Broadwater Farm Estate virtually every black male under 30 was interrogated — over 350 people were arrested although most were released without charge. In July 1986 the Metropolitan Police mounted a huge raid in Brixton, involving nearly 2,000 officers, aimed at selected premises in which cannabis offences were allegedly being committed. In early September 1986 serious disorder occurred on the streets of the North Prospect Estate in the Devonport constituency of Plymouth. A large crowd of white youths set up burning barricades and smashed windows, doors, and fences on the estate. A few days later the Avon and Somerset Police organized a large raid in the St Paul's district of Bristol. Almost exactly one year after the Handsworth riots, 600 police moved into the area to search several premises in connection with drugs and drinking offences. The reaction was serious rioting and attacks on the police involving petrol bombs, bricks, and stones. In 1987 disorder occurred in Wolverhampton after a black youth died of asphyxiation while being arrested on 20 February. Later in the year, violent clashes occurred on the streets of  MAKING SENSE OF THE 1981 RIOTS Reactions to the riots have concentrated on a number of key variables that are said to characterize the localities in which the riots have occurred. Lord Scarman's report on the 1981 disorders highlighted the importance of unemployment, urban deprivation, racial disadvantage, relations between young blacks and the police, the decline of civic consent, and political exclusion as the key issues. Other reactions have concentrated on the issue of the interplay between inner-city decay and racial disadvantage in contemporary Britain. Yet others have argued that the unrest can be seen as a symptom of the breakdown of law and order in British society (Gaffney, 1987; Hall, 1987; Keith, 1987). The main issues that were prominent in debates during 1980–1 were ‘race’ and ‘law and order’. This was by no means an accident, since throughout the 1970s a powerful body of media, political, and academic opinion had been constructed around the theme of how Britain was drifting into a ‘violent society’, and how the basis of consent was being shifted by the pressures of immigration and the growth of multi-racial inner city areas. A glimpse of the impact of the 1980–1 riots at this level can be achieved through two important debates in Parliament. The first took place in the midst of the July 1981 riots, and had as its theme: ‘Civil Disturbances’. The tone of the debate was set by Home Secretary William Whitelaw's introductory statement in which he spoke of (a) the need to ‘remove the scourge of criminal violence from our streets’, and (b) the urgency of developing ‘policies designed to promote the mutual tolerance and understanding upon which the whole future of a free democratic society depends’(Hansard , vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1405). The ‘scourge of criminal violence’ was, Whitelaw argued, a danger to the whole framework of consent and legality on which the  political institutions of British society were based. In reply Roy Hattersley supported the call for the immediate suppression of street violence, but warned that the roots of such riots could not be dealt with until all people felt they had a stake in British society (ibid.: cols. 1407–9) The second debate took place on 26 November 1981, on the publication of the Scarman Report, and had as its theme: ‘Law and Order’. The importance of the riots in pushing the law and order issue, and specifically policing, on to the main political agenda was emphasized by the Liberal leader, David Steel, who argued that ‘urgent action’ to prevent a drift into lawlessness was necessary from both a moral and a political perspective (Hansard , vol. 13, 26 November 1981: cols. 1009–11). A subsequent debate on the same issue in March 1982 was also full of references to the experience of 1981, the impact of street violence, crime, decaying urban conditions, the breakdown of consent between the police and many local communities, and the spectre of ‘more violence to come’ if changes in both policing tactics and social policy were not swiftly introduced (Hansard , vol. 20, 25 March 1982: cols. 1107–81). The need to support the police was accepted by both the Labour and the Conservative speakers in the parliamentary debate on the riots, and was established as a benchmark for the official response to the riots long before the Scarman Report was published in November 1981. Any substantive disagreement centred around the issue of what role social deprivation and unemployment had in bringing young people to protest violently on the streets. Intermingled with the discourses about race and law and order were constant references to unemployment, particularly among the young, and various forms of social disadvantage and poverty (Solomos, 1988, pp. 186–911). Throughout 1980 and 1981 debates about the riots in the media, in Parliament, and in various official reports hinged around the interrelationship between racial, law-and-order, and social factors. The importance of this debate can be explained, partly, by the political capital which the Opposition could make from linking the social and economic malaise of the country at large with violent street disturbances. Conversely, throughout this period Government Ministers strenuously denied  that unemployment and social deprivation were significant causes of urban unrest. Although the Scarman Report is often taken to be the central text which argues for a link between ‘social conditions’ and ‘disorder’, the terms of the debate were by no means set by Scarman. During both April and July 1981 vigorous exchanges took place in the press and in Parliament about the role that deteriorating social conditions and unemployment may have played in bringing about the riots. During the 16 July parliamentary debate on ‘Civil Disturbances’, Roy Hattersley's formulation of this linkage provided a useful summary of the ‘social conditions’ argument. After some preliminary remarks about the Labour party's support for the police, he went on to outline his opposition to the view of the riots as essentially anti-police outbursts: I repeat that I do not believe that the principal cause of last week's riots was the conduct of the police. It was the conditions of deprivation and despair in the decaying areas of our old cities — areas in which the Brixton and Toxteth riots took place, and areas from which the skinhead invaders of Southall come. (Hansard , vol. 8, 16 July 1981: col. 1408) Much of the subsequent controversy about this analysis centred on the question of youth unemployment. Hattersley had suggested that the riots were a ‘direct product’ of high levels of youth unemployment, and a furious debate ensued in both Parliament and the media about this assertion. The final symbolic cue used to make sense of the 1980–1 protests is more difficult to categorize, but its basic meaning can be captured by the term ‘political marginality’. While a number of discussions of the roots of urban unrest in the United States have noted the salience of political marginality in determining participation in violent protests (Skolnick, 1969; Fogelson, 1971; Edelman, 1971; Knopf, 1975), this issue has received relatively little attention in Britain. Nevertheless, during the 1980–1 events and their aftermath the political context was discussed from a number of perspectives. The Scarman Report, for example, located part of the explanation for the riots in the feelings of alienation and powerlessness  which were experienced by young blacks living in depressed inner-city areas. A successful policy for tackling the roots of urban disorder was seen as one which sought to involve all the community in dealing with the problems of each area so that they could come to feel that they have a stake in its future (Scarman, 1981, para. 6.42). Where such arguments did not fit in with the overarching themes of race, violence and disorder, and social deprivation they were either sidelined or pushed into the sub-clauses of official reports. The Scarman Report, for example, contained the following policy proposal: ‘I recommend that local communities must be fully and effectively involved in planning, in the provision of local services, and in the management and financing of specific projects,(Scarman, 1981, para. 8.44). Such a move towards greater political integration was seen by Lord Scarman as essential if the gap between inner-city residents and the forces of law and order was to be bridged. But the concern with overcoming political marginality remained on the sidelines of the main public debate because it questioned the perception of the rioters as driven by irrational, uncivilized, and criminal instincts. This did not, however, stop the question of political marginality and the need to reform existing policies from being raised at all, as can be seen subsequently by the attempts after 1981 to introduce both locally and nationally measures which were meant to address some of the grievances of the rioters and to ensure that further disturbances did not occur. Aspects of these measures are considered further on in the chapter. PERSPECTIVES ON THE 1985 RIOTS Despite widespread predictions of further unrest in the aftermath of 1981, the scale and the location of the 1985 riots seem to have surprised even some of the most astute commentators. Handsworth, for example, was presented even shortly before September 1985 as a ‘success story’ in terms of police — community relations. The outbreak of violence in this area was therefore widely presented as an aberration. Similarly the spread of violence in London to areas such as the Broadwater Farm Estate in Tottenham  was seen as a break from previous experience, which had centred on areas such as Brixton. There are many continuities between 1980–1 and 1985 in relation to the common-sense images used in the press and television to cover the events. But responses in 1985 were different, at least in terms of degree, and probably in relation to the extent to which the riots were seen as a ‘race’ phenomenon by a wider body of opinion. The ambiguities and sub-clauses to be found in much of the press coverage during 1980–1 had at least acted as a countervailing tendency against the more extreme forms of discourse which blamed the riots completely on black people. During the 1985 riots and their immediate aftermath, the imagery of ‘race’ was used by sections of the press without the sense of ambiguity which could still be found in 1980–1. The ‘silence over race’ was breached in 1980–1, but in 1985 debate about racial issues was taken a step further. Peregrine Worsthorne, for example, used the ferocity of the confrontations in Handsworth, Brixton, and Tottenham to argue that there was a major question mark over the possibility of assimilating the ‘coloured population’ into mainstream ‘British values’(Sunday Telegraph, 29 September 1985). To be sure there was still a strong response opposing Enoch Powell's call for repatriation, from all shades of political opinion, but the racialization of public debate about the 1985 riots went much further than 1980–1. In this context it was the externality of British Afro-Caribbeans and Asians which was highlighted rather the racist institutions and processes which worked against blacks at all levels of society. The usage of ‘race’ during the September-October 1985 period took on new meanings, which had little if anything to do with the impact of racism as such, since the emphasis was on the cultural characteristics of the minority communities themselves. After Handsworth part of the press response was to blame the riot on rivalry between West Indians and Asians, and even after the arguments were criticized by local residents; and community leaders, they were used to ‘explain’'what happened. In addition, the question whether the cultures and values of the black communities, their family structures, and their political attitudes ‘bred violence’ was constantly raised (van Dijk, 1988). The actual facts' of who was arrested during the riots, whether black or white, were hardly debated since it was assumed that they were mostly black and mostly unemployed and involved with crime (Keith, 1987). The imagery of the ‘black bomber, used in Handsworth was extended to the notion that there were groups of alienated and criminalized young blacks who saw the riots as a chance to engage in an ‘orgy of looting’. The Dear Report on Handsworth captures this image and links it to the social condition of young blacks: The majority of rioters who took part in these unhappy events were young, black and Afro-Caribbean origin. Let there be no doubt, these young criminals are not in any way representative of the vast majority of the Afro-Caribbean community whose life has contributed to the life and culture of the West Midlands over many years and whose hopes and aspirations are at one with those of every other law-abiding citizen. We share a common sorrow. It is the duty of us all to ensure that an entire cultural group is not tainted by the actions of a criminal minority. (Dear, 1985, p. 69) This ‘black’ criminal minority was constructed not only into the leading force behind the riots, but sometimes as the only force. Indeed, throughout September and October 1985, and during the following months, the imagery of race continued to dominate debate about both the causes and the policy outcomes of the riots. As pointed out earlier, the ‘social causes’ argument was another major plank of public debate about the 1980–1 riots, particularly in relation to the highly politicized issue of unemployment. During 1985 this issue was raised once again, though by then the extent of mass unemployment and urban de-industrialization and decay was more stark than it had been in 198l. Images of ‘urban decay’, ‘tinderbox cities’, and ‘ghetto streets’ linked up with the images of ‘race inequality’and ‘black ghettos’to produce an analysis more complex but also more contradictory. An interesting mixture of the various images was provided by a story in the Daily Telegraph under the headline: ‘Broadwater Farm: Like the Divis Flats with Reggae’(8 October 1985). The Mirror described the estate as ‘Living Hell’, and quoted one resident as saying that ‘You've no idea how awful daily life is’(8 October 1985). Such images were reworkings of arguments  already used about Toxteth in 1981 and Brixton in 1981, but they were used more widely than in 1980–1. Even the Daily Mail , which deployed the clearest use of ‘race’ and ‘outside agitator’arguments, ran a major story on Broadwater Farm under the headline: ‘Burnt-out hulks litter this concrete jungle…despair hangs heavy’(8 October 1985). A number of stories using such imagery were run by both the quality and the popular press during this period, but similar arguments are to be found in parliamentary debates (Hansard , vol. 84, 21 October 1985, cols. 30-.46, 388), and even in official reports produced by the police on the riots in Birmingham and London. The ‘cities of inner despair’ were conceived as the breeding ground for disorderly protest, and however hard the Government tried to break the causal link between the two, it was forced to take on board the need to restore order not only through the police but through promises of help for the inner cities. Much as in 1980–1, the ‘social causes’ argument cannot be seen separately from the broader debate about the future of the British economy and society. The Government's record on unemployment was a heavily politicized issue, and just as in 1981 it vehemently denied any responsibility for the riots through its pursuit of free-market policies. But the Government did find a way of accepting a link between the riots and social problems without bringing its main policies into the debate: namely by linking the growth of violent disorder to crime and drugs. The emphasis on ‘crime’ and the ‘criminal acts’of the rioters in the official responses to the 1985 riots took a general and a specific form. The general form relied on the argument that the riots were not a form of protest against the insufferable social conditions of inner-city areas or the actions of the police, but a ‘criminal act’ or a ‘cry for loot’. This was an argument put most succinctly by Geoffrey Dear, Chief Constable of the West Midlands (Dear, 1985) and by Douglas Hurd, the Home Secretary, in relation to Handsworth. But it recurred as a theme in official and press responses to the other riots. The specific form was built upon the notion that the outbreak of violence in Handsworth and Brixton, in particular, was brought about by ‘drug barons’ who saw the police attempting to curb their activities and control ‘their  territory’. Numerous examples of this line of argument can be found in Dear's report on Handsworth, and in press coverage during the riots. Taking the specific argument about the role of drugs and ‘drug barons’ in stimulating the riots, this seems to have served two purposes. First, it distanced the riots from the social, economic, political, and other grievances which had been linked to them by locating the cause outside the ‘social problems’ of inner-city dwellers and in the ‘simple greed’of the drug barons to accumulate ‘loot’. Second, just as Dear's image of a few hundred ‘young black criminals’ was used to explain what happened in Handsworth, the problem of drugs was used to explain what happened at a national level. The issue of drugs provided an everyday image, already a national issue through saturation media coverage and public debate, around which the police, the Home Office, and other institutions could depoliticize the riots. Responding to the Handsworth events Douglas Hurd was moved to argue forcibly that such events were senseless and reflected more on those who participated in them than on the society in which they took place: ‘The sound which law abiding people in Handsworth heard on Monday night, the echoes of which I picked up on Tuesday, was not a cry for help but a cry for loot’(Financial Times , 13 September 1985). The Chief Constable for the West Midlands, Geoffrey Dear, took this argument further by pointing out that the day before the riots a successful carnival had taken place, with the support of local community leaders. He drew the conclusion from this that the riot ‘came like a bolt out of the blue’(Guardian , 21 November 1985). Such language focused attention on the individuals or groups who were ‘breaking the law’, ‘committing criminal acts’, and threatening the interests of the law-abiding ‘majority’. SYMBOLIC POLITICS AND POLICY INITIATIVES The 1980–1 and 1985 riots resulted in a wide variety of responsive measures, emanating from both central and local government, as well as other agencies. The very multiplicity of ideological constructions of the riots is an indication of the complexity of the  responses which resulted in policies and programmes of action. There are, however, three analytically distinct and important political and policy responses which need to be examined:(a) the Scarman Report;(b) policing and law and order (c) economic and social policies. The Scarman Report In the aftermath of the April 1981 riots in Brixton the Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, used his powers under the 1964 Police Act to appoint Lord Scarman to inquire into the events, produce a report, and make recommendations. This brief was subsequently widened to cover the occurrence of other disturbances during July 1981. Lord Scarman's inquiry was not on the same scale as the famous Kerner Report in 1968 on the US riots, but since the publication of his Report in November 1981 his views and prescriptions have played an important role in fashioning political debate about the riots. It is therefore important to look into the basic analysis which the Scarman Report puts forward in order to understand how the political agenda has developed, in response to the riots, since 1980. The starting-point of Lord Scarman's explanation of the riots is important. His analysis began by distinguishing between the background factors which had created the potential for urban disorder in areas such as Brixton and the precipitating action or event which sparked off the riots. Scarman identified two views that were commonly held as to the causation of the disorders. The first explained them in terms of oppressive policing, and in particular the harassment of young blacks. The second explained them as a protest against society by deprived people who saw violent attacks upon the forces of law and order as a way of calling attention to their grievances. For Scarman both views were a simplification of a complex reality, or at least‘not the whole truth’. He linked the ‘social’ and ‘policing’aspects of the complex reality of areas like Brixton in an analytic model which emphasized the following issues: 1. the problems which are faced in policing and maintaining order in deprived, inner-city, multi-racial localities; 2. the social, economic, and related problems which are faced by all residents of such areas; 3. the social and economic disadvantages which are suffered particularly by black residents, especially young blacks. (Scarman, 1981, paras. 2. 1–2.38) He saw the existence of all these features in certain deprived areas as ‘creating a predisposition towards violent protest’, which could be sparked off by incidents such as confrontations between local residents and the police or by rumours about the actions of the police or other authority figures. From this account Lord Scarman drew the conclusion that once the ‘predisposition towards violent protest’ had taken hold it was difficult to reverse. Talking about the position of young blacks, he noted that because they felt neither ‘socially nor economically secure’ many of them had drifted into situations where more or less regular confrontations with the police were the norm of their daily experience. Noting that despite the evidence of academic and government reports, which had pointed to widespread discrimination against young blacks, very little had been done to remedy the position, Scarman concluded that:(a) many young blacks believed that violence was an effective means of protest against their conditions; and (b) far from the riots being a meaningless event, they were ‘essentially an outburst of anger and resentment by young black people against the police’(Scarman, 1981, paras. 3. 110 and 2.38). What is important to note here is that aside from Lord Scarman's condemnation of the ‘criminal acts’ committed during the riots, the Report was a strong argument in favour of a historical and social explanation of the riots. Given the close link which the Scarman Report established between questions of policing and the ‘wider social context’, the programme of action which it outlined contained proposals not only about the reform of the police and the introduction of new methods of policing and riot control, but about employment policy, social policy, and policies on racial discrimination. In a telling phrase Lord Scarman argued: ‘The social conditions in Brixton do not provide an excuse for disorder. But the disorders  cannot be fully understood unless they are seen in the context of complex political, social and economic factors which together create a predisposition towards violent protest’(para. 8.7). Although some of these issues went beyond the main remit of his Inquiry, he drew the conclusion from this basic finding that only a national government-led initiative to deal with problems of policing, unemployment, poor housing, and racial disadvantage could get to the roots of the unrest. Parliamentary and media responses to the Report varied greatly, although it was widely seen as making an important contribution to the debate about how to respond to the riots and prevent the outbreak of violence in the future. But what became clear after the immediate debate on the Report in late 1981 and early 1982, was that the Government was not going to implement all the recommendations. Some aspects of its proposals for reforming the police and rethinking police tactics were implemented during 1982 and 1983, but evidence of the ‘urgent action’ which it called for in other areas remained difficult to find. This returns us to the earlier point about the other major forces which contributed to the development of political responses to the riots: namely the media, Parliament, the political parties, and popular ‘common-sense’ debate. The Scarman Report formed a part — and a vital one — of this process of political debate, but its role cannot be understood in isolation. This can be seen if we look more closely at the issues of policing and economic and social problems. Policing and law and order Indeed, in the aftermath of the Scarman Report's publication, police opinion was divided on the question of whether its proposals for reforming the police and the adoption of new methods of policing could be implemented, or whether such changes could insure against further violence and unrest. The policy responses after the 1985 riots show some of the same characteristics as those during 1980–1, but as argued earlier, the emphasis on the ‘criminality’ of the riot participants favoured explanations that linked disorder to the pathological characteristics  of inner-city residents which pushed them towards lawlessness and crime. This in turn produced a sharper contrast than in 1980–1 between (a) responses which emphasized the need to strengthen and buttress the role of the police, and (b) responses which called for greater emphasis on the rejuvenation of the social and economic fabric of the inner cities. Economic and social policies In terms of economic and social policies the impact of the 1980–1 riots was equally ambiguous and contradictory. Part of this ambiguity, as outlined above, resulted from the Government's strenuous efforts to deny any link between its policies and the outbreak of violence and disorder. This denial was particularly important, since at the time the Thatcher administration was going through a bad period in terms of popular opinion on issues such as unemployment, social services, and housing. While Lord Scarman was careful not to enter the political dispute between the Government and the Labour party on issues such as unemployment and housing, his call for more direct action to deal with these problems, along with racial disadvantage, posed a challenge to the political legitimacy of the policies which the Government had followed from 1979 onwards. It also posed a delicate problem for the Home Secretary himself, since Lord Scarman had been appointed by him to carry out his Inquiry. Having spent the whole summer denying any link between its policies and the riots, the Government had to tread warily in responding to the economic and social policy proposals of the Scarman Report when it was published in November 1981. The parliamentary debate on the Report showed the Home Secretary adopting a two-pronged strategy in his response. First, he accepted many of the recommendations of the Report, particularly in relation to the role of the police. Additionally, he accepted the need to tackle racial disadvantage and other social issues. Second, he emphasized the Government's view that, whatever broader measures were taken to deal with racial and social inequalities, the immediate priority was to restore and maintain order on the streets. When the Home Secretary talked of  the need for the Government to give a lead in tackling racial disadvantage he therefore saw this as in issue for the longer term. On the other hand, he was much more specific about the reform of the police and the development of new tactics and equipment for the management of urban disorder (Hansard , vol. 14, 10 December 1981: cols. 1001–8). In 1985, however, the Government specifically rejected calls for another inquiry like Lord Scarman's, arguing that since the riots were a ‘criminal enterprise’ it was useless to search for social explanations or to have yet another report advising it about what to do. Implicitly, the Government was saying that it knew what the problems were, and how they could be tackled. While some senior policemen, like Metropolitan Police Commissioner Sir Kenneth Newman, wanted to stress the link between the police and other areas of ‘social policy’(Metropolitan Police, 1986), the official government response attempted to decontextualize the riots and see them as the actions of a small minority who were either criminalized or influenced by extreme political ideas. The dominant approach of the Government attempted to emphasize two main arguments. 1. that the riots were ‘a lust for blood’, an ‘orgy of thieving’, ‘a cry for loot and not a cry for help’; 2. that the riots did not reflect a failure to carry out the ‘urgent programme of action’ recommended by Lord Scarman in 1981, but were the outcome of a spiralling wave of crime and disorder in inner-city areas. The logic of this approach, articulated by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd most clearly, was that the riots were both ‘unjustifiable’ and a ‘criminal activity’. In a widely reported speech to police chiefs at the time of the disorders Hurd made this point clear: Handsworth needs more jobs and better housing. But riots only destroy. They create nothing except a climate in which necessary development is even more difficult. Poor housing and other social ills provide no kind of reason for riot, arson and killing. One interviewer asked me whether the riot was not a cry for help by the rioters. The sound which law-abiding people heard at Handsworth was not a cry for help but a cry for loot. That is why the first priority, once public order is secure, must be a  thorough and relentless investigation into the crimes which were committed. (Daily Telegraph , 14 September 1985) Such arguments resonated through the media and in the various parliamentary debates during September and October 1985. They became part of the symbolic political language through which the riots were understood by policy makers and by popular opinion. Since the 1985 unrest, and particularly after the 1987 General Election, the Government has announced a number of initiatives on the inner city, and it has presented these as part of an effort to rejuvenate depressed areas on a sound basis. The evidence that has emerged since then, however, points to a major discrepancy between the Government's promises of action and the allocation of resources to implement them (Robson, 1988). It is perhaps too early to reach a conclusion on this point, but a repeat of the period of inaction between 1982 and 1985 seems to be evident, within the current political context. A number of local authorities have attempted to take more positive action to deal with the issues raised by the 1985 riots, but their experience has shown that such local initiatives are often severely limited by the actions of national government, the police, and broader economic and political pressures. In the years since 1981 the one consistent response to urban unrest has been the provision of more resources, more training, and more equipment to the police. Instead of tackling the causes of urban unrest, the Government has built up force to deal with the manifestation of those root conditions. Increasingly the most strident political voices are raised in the name of free enterprise and law and order, not for equity and social justice. For the New Right and other influential sectors of political opinion the attempt to achieve racial equality through legal and political means is at best naïve political folly, and at worst a restriction on the workings of the market. The present political climate gives little cause for optimism that a radical change in governmental priorities in this field is likely (Solomos, 1989). The Government's plan of Action for Cities (DoE, 1987), issued  after Mrs Thatcher's post-election promise, says very little directly about racial inequality. It remains to be seen whether it will suffer the fate of numerous other initiatives on the inner cities and fade into obscurity. But one thing seems clear: during the past decade the Government has been more intent on reducing the powers of local authorities than on providing for fundamental changes in the social conditions of the inner cities. CONCLUSION: LITTLE ROOM FOR OPTIMISM Despite the Government's recently proclaimed intention of regenerating the inner cities, there is little room for optimism. Unless radical action is taken, British cities seem poised to become yet more turbulent, brutalized, and trouble-torn. The excluded black and white citizens in the urban areas seem set to continue to suffer deprivation and disadvantage. The remedy of using tough policing is merely tackling the symptoms of the disorder, and is liable to exacerbate the underlying malaise. This approach should come as no surprise, however. History shows that the usual response to violent protest and riots was repression. History also shows that this course was normally ineffective and that disorder only diminished when movement was made in the direction of the reforms which were demanded. The auguries for such reforms are not good, and further urban unrest remains in prospect."
ACA ACA-AS6-003 8.82 "Crime and Policing ROBERT REINER FULL CIRCLE? On 13 May 1833 the National Political Union, a body organized to seek the extension of the franchise to the working class, held a meeting in Coldbath Fields, in Clerkenwell, London. This was to become a celebrated and controversial rite of passage for the new Metropolitan Police, then not quite four years old. Fighting broke out between participants and the police, during which a constable, PC Culley, was fatally stabbed. An inquest jury, rapidly assemble in a nearby inn, returned a verdict of ‘justifiable homicide’. This was quashed on appeal to the Court of King's Bench, but it symbolized the deep and widespread popular suspicion which attended the birth of Peel's ‘New Police’. For the conventional ‘cop-sided’ histories of British police development, Coldbath Fields marks the crucial turning-point in their battle to win consent for their very existence. From the middle of the eighteenth century onwards a growing chorus of voices had championed the creation of a professional police. But they were successfully resisted by a rejectionist front which encompassed a variety of social interests and philosophies, ranging from rural Tory gentry to urban working-class radicals. Upper-class objectors worried about traditional civil liberties, central government encroachment on the delicate network of power relations in local parishes, and the expense of a public police. Working-class hostility was roused by the fear of the police being used to control industrial and political organization, and to curb their recreational activities under the guise of maintaining public order in the streets. This alliance of opposition frustrated all attempts to establish a professional police until Peel's 1829 Metropolitan Police Act. In the conventional view Coldbath Fields was a shock to respectable consciences, and rallied the support of all but the dangerous classes to the Peelers. In fact, however, resistance to the new police continued to be expressed in the street violence and riots as ‘the plague of blue locusts’ spread throughout the country between 1829 and 1856, and in particular as it came to the working class communities of the North (Storch, 1975, p. 94). Indeed, working-class assent to policing has arguably always been hesitant and brittle (Cohen, 1979; Brogden, 1982). When PC Keith Blakelock was stabbed to death on 6 October 1985 during the rioting in the Broadwater Farm Estate he was the first Metropolitan policeman to be killed in a riot since PC Culley in 1833. The parallel with Coldbath Fields dramatically symbolizes the way that policing, crime, and public order have turned full circle back to echo early Victorian conditions. The urban disorders of the 1980s are the most explicit index of the deep hostility now felt by many inner-city residents towards the police, and of the problems of policing the inner city. Nor are the parallels confined to the inner city. Another dramatic instance of historical déjà vu came during the miners' strike, when it was reported that an attack had been made on the police station in Malby, South Yorkshire, scene of an anti-police riot a century earlier when the ‘new police’ first arrived there. More recently a moral panic about ‘lager louts’ despoiling rural Arcadias has emerged. What has been rudely shattered is the cosy depiction of British history as the progressive ‘conquest of violence’(Critchley, 1970) which is celebrated in the conventional accounts of the British police (Reith, 1938, 1943, 1956; Critchley, 1967; Ascoli, 1979; Stead, 1985). But if the long-term trajectory of ‘law and order’ in Britain is not the unilinear march of civility which may once have seemed plausible, what is it? And how are we to understand and deal with the contemporary return of the repressed, in terms of spiralling levels of recorded crime and riotous disorder? In this chapter I shall try to locate our present concerns in a pattern of historical development, and seek to excavate from this a prognosis for the viability of current strategies and initiatives. A CRISIS OF ‘LAW AND ORDER’: MORAL PANIC OR REASONABLE CONCERN? In the conventional view, Britain, once a legend throughout the world for its stolid, peaceable, and harmonious character, has experienced in the last decade and a half an alien and shocking advent of unprecedented incivility and disorder. At the visible apex of this trend come the urban disorders of Brixton and Bristol, Toxteth and Tottenham. Underneath lies the more regular procession of smaller-scale crowd disturbances, political, industrial, and recreational. Even less visible except to immediate participants and police is the routine ‘slow rioting’ of Saturday night street brawling, which (according to the perceptions of all the chiefs constables I have interviewed in a research project over the last year) is assuming more menacing and violent proportions throughout the country. Beneath it all is a growing wave of individual crimes, adding up to a crisis of law and order. This conventional view is summed up by the dominant reactions to the 1981 Brixton disorders. Lord Scarman referred to violence and disorder ‘the like of which had not previously been seen in this century in Britain’, while one Conservative MP summed up this orthodox reaction in a parliamentary debate (on 13 April 1981) when he spoke of the riots as ‘something new and sinister in our long national history’. The initial response of the Left and liberals to this reaction was to dub the conventional wisdom ‘moral panic’. What was new was the growth of a strong state control apparatus, legitimated by the fears generated by manipulation of public anxiety. It was pointed out that contrary to the rose-tinted spectacles view, Britain has a long history of riot and disorder. The conventional perspective is guilty of ‘historical amnesia’, which has forgotten the turbulent and bloody conflicts of the past (see, for example, Benyon, 1985). The most thorough-going and influential example of this genre of debunking moral panic is Hooligan by Geoff Pearson (1983). This is a deservedly much-admired, fascinating, and lovingly collected parade of paranoia through the ages. Moving backwards, through four centuries of history, Pearson shows a  perennial refrain lamenting a supposedly shocking increase in crime, violence, and public disorder. Each period seems to construct its own mythical golden age ‘twenty years ago’. But Pearson assiduously shows how the grandads of that supposed era of tranquillity were themselves bemoaning the sad decline of standards of virtue and discipline since their youth. And so on, in a potentially infinite regress of grandadology, wailing and gnashing teeth at the decline of family life, parental irresponsibility, declining national character, and the need for a firm reassertion of authority. ‘Street violence and disorder are solidly entrenched features of the social landscape’, argues Pearson, at any rate in capitalist societies which necessarily generate a ‘residuum’, an under-class of the underprivileged and unemployed, unintegrated and potentially threatening to the established and respectable. If this reserve army is always with us, so is social reaction to it: an ‘immovable preoccupation’ with ‘the awesome spectre of crime and violence perpetually spiralling upwards’. This perspective offers a useful corrective to the historical perception of recent levels of crime and disorder as utterly foreign and novel in British experience. But the critique runs the danger of becoming a facile agnosticism about patterns or trends in crime and disorder. Piecing together a catalogue of recurring laments neither answers nor dismisses the still pertinent question: are things really getting worse, getting better, or remaining the same? It is as if an economic historian, collating woeful Financial Times editorials every few years, were to conclude that there really were no business-cycles, let alone longer-term Kondratieff waves of growth and decline. Furthermore, the litanies of ‘respectable fears’ and ‘moral panics’are only one of the discourses about ‘law and order’found in popular, political, or academic discussion over the last century. At the turn of the century, the very time when Pearson documents the coinage of the term ‘hooligan’ to portray a supposedly new breed of youthful folk-devil, there is found in other sources a mood of contemporary congratulation about the long-term conquest of the problem of order. The Criminal Registrar's Report for 1901 documents a trend for declining levels of crime and violence over more than two decades. The introduction  comments: ‘We have witnessed a great change in manners: the substitution of words without blows for blows with or without words; an approximation in the manners of different classes; a decline in the spirit of lawlessness.’ Nor was this position unique. The latest volume of the magisterial History of English Criminal Law (Radzinowicz and Hood, 1986, vol. 5) shows that criminologists at the turn of the century were vexed with explaining the puzzling phenomenon of English success in conquering routine crime and violence. Not that all was well in the sphere of order and crime. On the one hand, there was a variety of political and industrial threats to the order of the established classes. The Fenian menace legitimated the establishment of a specifically political police, which would have been utterly unacceptable in the climate of early nineteenth-century Britain (Porter, 1987). The industrial conflicts of the first quarter of this century stimulated a new level of centralization and sophistication in the state's coercive response to the labour movement (Morgan, 1987). But what differentiates the earlier part of this century from either the present or the early nineteenth century is that these problems did not all coalesce into one disturbing image of a threatening, dangerous, and disorderly criminal class. Various types of criminal — the political, the habitual and the recidivist, the feeble-minded, the inebriate, the juvenile — were all differentiated as separate specimens in the taxonomies of the new science of criminology (Garland, 1985). And with the cognitive optimism of criminology was combined a penological optimism, that the new forms of scientifically grounded interventions would provide a solution to the problems of crime. This penal optimism reigned throughout the first half of this century (Bailey, 1987). Right down from the last quarter of the nineteenth century to the 1960s one can indeed construct a counter-grandadology to Pearson's ‘history of respectable fears’. It is possible to catalogue a chorus of social self-congratulation, as respectable commentators recount the positive achievement of tranquillity since the days of their youth, as the very epitome of social progress. This mood is captured, for example, in Leonard Woolf's autobiography Sowing (1960): I am struck by the immense change from social barbarism to social civilisation which has taken place in London (indeed in Great Britain) during my lifetime. No one but an old Londoner who has been born and bred and has lived for 50 to 60 years in London can have any idea of the extent of the change. It is amazing to walk down Drury Lane or the small streets about 7 Dials today and recall their condition only 50 years ago. Even as late as 1900 it would not have been safe to walk in any of these streets after dark. This is not intended to supplant Pearson's perennial panic view with a resuscitated Whig theory of progress. The point is only that there are long-term trends and patterns in crime, violence, and disorder. There may be a perennial fascination with the crimes which do exist, but more sober analytic or reflective assessments have not always been pessimistic or anguished. It may evoke nostalgia now, or appear quaintly naïve, but there have been periods when crime and disorder seemed soluble, if not yet totally vanished, problems. IS CRIME INCREASING? The statistics on crime, for all the familiar pitfalls in their interpretation, should not be dismissed. They can be judiciously appraised, with an open eye for trends which may affect the relation between recorded and unrecorded crime, in combination with broader consideration of historical and theoretical issues which may affect their validity. The major studies of the long-term trends in crime statistics (Gurr, 1976, 1981; Gatrell and Hadden, 1972; Gatrell, 1980) concur in depicting a secular decline in the latter decades of the nineteenth century. This coincided, however, with an increasing prevalence of the conditions and institutions which should lead us to expect the reporting and recording of offences to grow in proportion to the actual occurrence of victimization. As a noted historian of crime recently argued, the decrease in levels of recorded crime ‘coincides with increased court activity, with the spread and professionalisation of the new police, and with an apparent increase in public cooperation with both courts and the police. If the radical criminologists' assumptions are correct, then the figures for the second half of the  19th century might probably show the opposite from that which they do’(Emsley, 1988, p. 42). The secular trend towards declining levels of crime levelled off in the first decade of this century. The recorded rate of crime then remains on a rough plateau until the end of the 1930s. During the late 1930s and early 1940s there is a fairly sharp rise, but then again a rough plateau (albeit with sharp year-by-year fluctuations) in the late 1940s until the mid-1950s, when there begins a sustained and sharp increase, getting ever steeper in the late 1970s and 1980s. From 1975 onwards the rising crime-rate is justifiably referred to as in a stage of ‘hyper-crisis’(Kinsey et al ., 1986 p. 12). While in the quarter-century from 1950 to 1975 recorded notifiable offences per 100,000 population increased by just over 3,000, from 1,094 to 4,283, it took just the decade from 1976 to 1986 for crimes per 100,000 population to increase another 3,000, from 4,346 to 7,331 (Criminal Statistics , 1986, Table 2.2). In the late nineteenth century the trend to lower levels of recorded crime coincided with developments which, other things being equal, would lead us to expect rising levels of recording. This buttresses confidence that the recorded trend is in the correct direction. But can we be sure that the last three decades of sustained growth in crime are not a recording phenomenon (Bottomley and Pease, 1986)? The plain answer is that we cannot be certain about it. At the same time as recorded levels of crime have increased, so have many other factors which might increase the propensity of the public to report, and the police to record, offences. Police numbers and resources, for example, have increased considerably. The number of police-officers in England and Wales grew from nearly 76,000 in 1961 to nearly 110,00 in 1976, and nearly 122,000 in 1986. police strength his not, however, kept pace with the increase in recorded crime. In 1961 there were 11 crimes recorded per police-officer, but by 1986 this had grown to 32. Even taking account of the increase in other resources available to augment police-officers, from civilian support staff to more sophisticated technology of all kinds, there is clearly a much greater recorded crime work-load per police-officer. The only way that we could definitely ascertain the extent of  the increase in recorded crime which is due to changes in reporting and/or recording practices would be if there were available victimization data over a long period. Such data is available for the United States since 1973, when the Federal Government initiated an annual series of National Crime Surveys. Overall these indicate that while the rate of victimization recorded in the annual surveys did increase in the 1970s and 1980s, this was at a substantially lower rate (1 per cent on average) than the officially recorded crime-rate (3.5–5 per cent average annual increase; cf. Box, 1987, pp. 18–20). Moreover, the global index of either victimization or recorded offences can be misleading, in that it conceals quite large variations in the trends for specific offences. None the less, what the United States data imply is that the upward trend in recorded crime is in the same direction as actual victimization, although at a slower rate. The recorded figures exaggerate the increase in victimization which is occurring, mainly because of a greater public propensity to report certain crimes. The experience in the United States cannot necessarily be extrapolated to the United Kingdom. In Britain there have been three national crime surveys, in 1982, 1984, and 1988. Overall. between these years, the increase in victimization measured by the survey (30 per cent) roughly matches the increase of police recorded offences (41 per cent ). But this cannot be taken as carte blanche for assuming that long-term recorded crime trends correspond to victimization. Not only is a comparison between only three years potentially misleading; there are very considerable divergences between trends in victimization and recorded crime for specific offences, which are concealed by the coincidence in the overall direction (Hough and Mayhew, 1985, Dowds et al ., 1989). It is often pointed out that the long-running set of victimization data in Britain, the General Household Survey's regular measurement of the extent of burglary victimization since 1972, indicates that most of the increase in recorded burglary is a reporting phenomenon. Combining the General Household Survey (GHS) and the British Crime Survey (BCS) victimization data reveals that while police-recorded burglaries doubled between 1972 and  1983, the level of victimization went up only by 20 per cent(Hough and Mayhew, 1985, pp. 16–17). Thus the considerable increase in recorded burglary during the 1970s was largely a recording phenomenon. But this may not apply to other offences. Furthermore, the BCS points out (ibid.) that the gap between the trend in recorded burglaries and victimization is much lower in recent years: there has been an appreciable increase in burglary victimization between 1981 and 1983 of 9 per cent, while recorded burglaries increased by 24 per cent . If this gap continues to narrow then the recorded trend of burglaries may be more confidently interpreted as showing the direction of crime. In conclusion, it seems that we cannot accept without question the dramatic increase in recorded crime as corresponding to a real increase in victimization of the same proportions. But it would be wishful thinking to explain away all, or even most, of the increase as an artefact of recording changes. We can plausibly infer that crime has been increasing in the last two to three decades, presenting a problem for explanation and policy. CRIME AND INNER CITIES While crime overall has been increasing, it must be emphasized that both the reality and the fear of victimization are considerably greater in some areas than others. The British Crime Survey found, for example, that (as classified by the ACORN ‘Classification of Residential Neighbourhoods’ system) there were three types of area which were especially prone to both crime and fear of crime: ‘High-status non-family areas’(I), ‘Multi-racial areas’(H), and ‘Poorest council estates’(G). Whereas the national average frequency of being a ‘mugging’ victim (robbery/theft from the person) was 1.4 per cent, in these areas it was: I: 3.9 per cent ; H: 4.3 per cent ; G: 3.3 per cent . In the last two areas, the proportions of people who were ‘very worried about mugging’ were 32 per cent and 36 per cent, compared to an average of 20 per cent , and (11 per cent in rural areas — these data evidently precede the advent of lager loutishness!). Whereas on average 2.4 per cent of households were victimized by burglary, in the high-risk areas it was 6.3 per cent(Hough and Mayhew, 1985, Table M). These  findings are replicated by the recent local crime surveys, notably those in Merseyside and Islington, which have constituted the empirical core of the ‘New Left realism’ in criminology (Kinsey, 1985; Jones et al ., 1986). The Merseyside Crime Survey found, for example, that 44 per cent of interviewees had been victims of crime in the last twelve months, and a quarter had been victimized twice or more. Multiple victimization (two or more experiences) was twice as high in inner-city areas as in affluent suburbs. Fear of crime varied accordingly. Crime was seen as a big problem by 66 per cent in inner-city Liverpool, compared with 13 per cent in wealthier suburbs (Kinsey et al ., 1986, p. 4). David Downes (1983) aptly summed up the irony of ‘law and order’ being seen as a Conservative concern, when he called it ‘theft of an issue’. POLICING, ORDER AND LEGITIMACY Rising crime is not an inevitable nor universal problem. It was noted above that for an extended period of our history crime was actually falling. The overall trajectory since the early nineteenth century seems to be a rough U-shape: falling down to the early 1900s, a plateau until the mid-1950s, and a steepening rise since then. It is plausible that disorder follows a similar pattern. It has been shown, for example, that levels of violence during industrial disputes fell in the first three-quarters of this century, but that this trend has been reversed more recently (Geary, 1985). If crime and disorder follow a U-shape pattern of long-term change, the legitimacy of the police — the extent to which they are broadly accepted as valid in mission and methods — has followed an inverse path: an upside-down U. Starting from the widespread opposition encountered at the birth of the new police, opposition gradually came to be located primarily within the less ‘respectable’ sections of the working class, as well as in the wider working class during periods of labour conflict. Even here, as the fact of policing came to be established, opposition was not to the police per se , but to specific operations or tactics. By the late 1940s and 1950s, the advent of post-war political consensus and social integration was the precondition for the police achieving a pinnacle of widespread popular acceptance. This was symbolized in the  Dixon of Dock Green phenomenon: the only time that a cosy, non-action-man, ordinary uniform bobby has attained heroic stature in a country's folk-lore. But it was confirmed by harder evidence, above all by the national survey conducted for the 1960 Royal Commission on the Police. This found not only a generally high level of support for the police, but that this spread throughout the class structure (indeed was marginally higher in the working class). The very fact that a series of comparatively minor incidents had triggered the establishment of the Royal Commission as the only comprehensive review of the organization of policing in a century, is testimony to the widespread consensus about policing. Since the 1950s policing has become a highly controversial, politicized issue. More recent poll evidence (e.g. for the British Crime Survey, or the British Social Attitudes Survey by Jowell et al ., 1988) continues to show high overall acceptance of the police. But this must be qualified in two crucial ways. First, there is a widespread perception recorded in the surveys of specific types of police malpractice coming to be perceived as problematic, e.g. corruption and racial discrimination. Second, there is a considerable and growing rejection of the overall legitimacy of the police among some sections of the population: youth, the economically marginal, and ethnic minorities especially Afro-Caribbeans. For example, the Policy Studies Institute found that while 29 per cent of Londoners overall thought the police treat particular groups unfairly, this rose to 68 per cent amongst young West Indians (Smith, 1983, pp. 243–6). How can these recent trends (rising crime and disorder, and falling police legitimacy) be explained? CRIME, DEPRIVATION, AND MORALITY Criminologists have scarcely addressed, let alone answered, the broad questions of explaining overall trends in crime. Positivist research has generated much data about specific relationships between individual or social characteristics and the likelihood of conviction. Radical approaches have been characterized more by theoretical or programmatic work than by grounded accounts or changing crime patterns. Even the recent ‘New Left realism’ does  not address the broader questions of causation, though its leading exponent Jock Young (1986) has rightly emphasized the need to return aetiological questions to the foreground. But so far their explanation of rising crime has largely focused on alleged deficiencies in police strategy, in particular on counter-productive militaristic tactics which exacerbate ‘public alienation’ and therefore impede successful crime control (Kinsey et al ., 1986, pp. 40–2). Admittedly the vicious cycle of police militarization and public alienation is seen to be kicked into play by the economic crumbling of the inner city, but thereafter the weight of the explanation is placed on inadequate (or over-heavy) policing. As will be indicated below, I do not feel that much (if any) of the explanation can lie at the door of the police station. More plausible is the analysis developed in Dahrendorf's Hamlyn Lectures on ‘law and order’(Dahrendorf, 1985, 1987). In this the main structural precondition of growing crime is seen as the growth of an underclass. The social prerequisite of the long trend in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries towards lower crime and disorder, and greater police acceptance, was the historical process of working-class incorporation. Uneven and limited though this might have been, the gulf between Disraeli's two nations in the early and mid-nineteenth century became blurred and attenuated by the twentieth. The sharp end of routine policing always falls on the economically marginal, those who live out their lives in public places which routine police patrols regulate, and those who are not integrated into the mainstream institutions of economic and political life. Incorporation of the working class reduced the adult part of this residuum to a politically insignificant, atomistic, albeit cyclically fluctuating stratum. The main grist to the mill of policing was working-class youth, but the perennial conflict between youth and the police is one with ever-changing persona and is not the basis of political conflict. This changed with the re-emergence of long-term structural unemployment, leading to the de-incorporation of increasing sections of the working class, ‘who are being defined out of the edifice of citizenship’(Dahrendorf, 1985, p. 98). The underclass in Dahrendorf's account is not simply the product of unemployment. It is the consequence of the apparent structural inevitability of its position: ‘The majority class does not need the unemployed to maintain and even increase its standard of living… The main point about this category — for lack of a better word we shall call it ‘under class'’— is that its destiny is perceived as hopeless' (Dahrendorf, 1985, pp. 101–7). Now there are problems with the simple postulation of a link between unemployment, crime, and disorder, as Mrs Thatcher is only too ready to point out. There is an enormous literature of research on the relationship, which the late Steven Box (1987) has usefully summarized and reviewed in his very important last book,Recession, Crime and Punishment . Box summarizes some fifty research projects on the relationship between unemployment and crime. Most are aggregate studies, looking at the correlation over time or across space between levels of crime and unemployment. He sums it up: The relationship between overall unemployment and crime is inconsistent…on balance the weight of existing research supports there being a weak but none the less significant causal relationship. However, properly targeted research on young males, particularly those from disadvantaged ethnic groups, which considers both the meaning and duration of unemployment…has yet to be done’. (pp. 96–7) Much of this debate has been vitiated by the assumption that if unemployment is causally related to crime, this must be an invariable law: true at all times and places. But it is more plausible to suppose that the meaning of unemployment will vary according to a number of factors, e.g. its duration, social assessments of blame, previous experience of steady employment, perception of future prospects, comparison with other groups, etc. It would be too much, therefore, to expect that there would be a universal and invariant relation. Some support for the link between offending and perceptions of the justice of unemployment is suggested by the research evidence on the connections of income inequality and crime. All the fifteen studies of this reviewed by Box suggest a strong association (over time or cross-sectionally) between economic inequality and crime in general(though this is not true  of five studies on homicide specifically)(Box, 1987, pp. 86–98). This plausibly supports the view that it is relative deprivation which is causally related to crime, and that in conditions where unemployment is perceived as unjust and hopeless by comparison with the lot of other groups, this will act as a precipitant of crime. Two recent studies, one American (Thornberry and Christenson, 1984) and one British (Farrington et al ., 1986), have both used a novel methodology to establish that at least in the present climate unemployment is linked to crime. They have looked at the commission of offences reported over time by a sample of youths in longitudinal surveys. What is shown is that crime-rates (especially for property offences) were higher during periods of unemployment than of employment. This suggests that holding constant other variables, the same youths commit more crimes while unemployed. That there should be a link between (a) unemployment and (b) relative poverty, and crime is hardly surprising. Both exacerbate the incentives to commit offences and erode the social controls which would otherwise encourage conformity (relative fearfulness of sanctions, perception of the justice of the system, involvement in conventional activities and relationships, etc.). So it is clearly right to argue as Dahrendorf does that the emergence of an underclass excluded apparently permanently from dominant economic life is a potent condition of rising crime. This is all grist to the mill of orthodox social democratic analyses of crime. But it cannot be the whole story. First, there is the problem of rising crime during the so-called period of affluence. It is this indeed which prompted the first ‘new realisms’ in criminology.: the right-wing realism of James Q. Wilson and his associates in the United States (Wilson, 1975); and the ‘administrative realism’attributed by Jock Young to our own Home Office Research Unit (Young, 1986). If the rate of crime increases when the adverse social conditions which have been linked to it are becoming ameliorated, the answer must lie elsewhere: either in the failure of the criminal justice system to deliver sanctions with sufficient certainty or positiveness (the ‘New Right’ analysis), or in changes in the availability of criminal opportunities in the environment (administrative criminology). Dahrendorf accepts both these as possible contributions, but encompasses them within a much broader idea: the growth of anomia , the failure of a social structure to instil adequate commitment to its conventional moral codes, as crystallized into the criminal law. This is more profoundly a matter of the deeper cultural instilling of conformist values than of the effective threat of post hoc sanctions by the criminal justice system. The idea of the failure of the agencies of socialization to instil discipline and moral values because of the effects of post-war ‘funk’ and permissiveness is a favourite stalking-horse of the right-wing populist criminology championed by Norman Tebbit and others (and in a more sophisticated version in Douglas Hurd's Tamworth and other speeches). The Government has eagerly seized on the ‘evidence’ provided by the new affluent and rural as well as urban ‘lager lout’folk-devils to deny any link between inner-city deprivation and crime. Instead, the finger is pointed at a common moral malaise due to over-liberalization and erosion of discipline (Patten, 1988). Because of this pedigree, the opinions of the Left and of liberals have shied away from examination of the issue of morality in relation to crime. This is a great loss, because at root there is an integral relation between the ideas of crime and morality. Older Marxist criminologies (notably Bonger's) saw the link between economic conditions and crime precisely as lying in the culture of egoism which was stimulated by economic advance under capitalism (Bonger, 1916). This is more evident than ever in recent years with the amorally materialistic culture which has been encouraged by the present Government's economic and social policies. (Labour is beginning to pick up this theme:Guardian , 2 January 1989, p. 3.) But uncomfortable questions must also be raised about the less traditional and disciplinarian approaches to education, to family, and to other social institutions which Left and liberal opinion have championed. What values do we want to underpin social relations and criminal law? How can these be instilled? These problems are ones well recognized and analysed, though not answered, by, for example, Durkheim's discussion of anomie (Fenton et al ., 1983) and Dahrendorf's of anomia. As both emphasize, moral education cannot proceed effectively in an economically unjust society. This much is social  democratic orthodoxy. But can less authoritarian forms of moral discipline be effective and if so, how are they to be achieved? POLICING Traditional Left analyses have a uniformly negative image of the police as a repressive apparatus of the state. ‘New Left realism’ specifically challenges this. The nub of its argument is that policing is a necessary function which ideally should control the criminal victimization disproportionately afflicting the most vulnerable members of our society. But it can only be performed well if there is a profound democratization of the structure of accountability. At present the police do not perform their task satisfactorily. Their initial response to the growth of crime, which stemmed from rising unemployment and inequality, was heavy-handed and militaristic. This was counter-productive in alienating those sectors of the community whose co-operation was essential to criminal investigation. Only by restoring the confidence of these sectors can crime control by the police be successful, and the prerequisite of this is democratic accountability to local communities. There is an unquestioned presumption here, which pervades current thinking about the police from all perspectives: that the effectiveness and quality of policing have declined. The evidence presented for this by the ‘New Realists’ and others is the seemingly inexorable rise of crime and the decline of ‘clear-up’rates (Lea et al ., 1987). Between 1979 and 1986 the clear-up rate fell from 41 per cent to 32 per cent. But the clear-up rate is a notoriously inadequate measure of police effectiveness, open to manipulation by many factors other than policing skills (Reiner, 1988a). To take the most obvious arithmetical point, if the number of crimes per police officer increases, then, other things being equal, the detection rate must fall, even if efficiency remains constant. In a recent study Lea and Young recognize this point, and say that the best indicator of police performance in crime investigation is the number of crimes cleared per officer (Lea et al ., 1987). What they do not say is that on this ‘best’ measure, police performance has in  fact improved marginally, not declined (from 7.9 in 1972 to 9.6 in 1986.) Clearly in the last twenty years there has been growing controversy about fundamental aspects of policing, unprecedented in this century. (Reiner, 1985, charts and tries to explain this.) But, to put it provocatively, the growth of conflict over policing, and evidence of increasing public hostility and questioning, does not itself establish that standards of policing have declined. (When looking at crime trends criminologists are usually hesitant about inferring objective worsening of problems on the basis of moral panics.) There are many reasons to expect a priori that standards of policing should have improved. There has, for example, been a progressive improvement in the educational standards of recruits, and in the quantity and quality of police training. Perhaps it is not so much that police behaviour has deteriorated as that public expectations have risen. What, it will be said, about the ‘obvious’ evidence of brutality and corruption? While there are, of course, many recent causes célèbres of police abuse (Reiner, 1985, ch. 2. 2), memoirs of earlier times (e.g. Mark, 1978; Daley, 1986) suggest that there was an enormous extent of subterranean wrong-doing in the cosy days of the traditional bobby on the beat. For obvious reasons the dangers of such malpractice are endemic in policing, and it may be ‘respectable fears’ about it which fluctuate more than the extent of abuse. In so far as tactics have evidently changed (for instance in public order policing: McCabe et al ., 1988; Northam, 1988), it is at least as plausible to see these as a reactive response to rising crime and disorder, as the spontaneous cause of them. The ‘New Realists’ see policing as the key to crime control, and accountability as the key to good policing. Paradoxically, this comes at a time when both the Conservative Government and the police themselves are much more cautious about the potential contribution of policing. Police numbers and resources are no longer seen as a vade-mecum by the police or the Government (as Hurd, for example, made clear in his speech to the Police Foundation Conference in Oxford on 11 April 1988)— hardly surprising after nine ‘wasted’ years. There is in fact a remarkable cross-party congruence on the idea that the effectiveness of  criminal justice and policing depends on the ‘involvement of the community’, though the Government denies that this requires full local democratic control, as opposed to consultation. I am myself sceptical about whether the local democratic control espoused by the ‘New Realists’ would have the dramatic confidence-building effect claimed. In any case, the extent of central influence over policing has grown remorselessly and may not be reversible (Reiner, 1988b, 1989). This implies that the accountability of central government in relation to policing is the more important problem to address. CONCLUSION ‘New realism’, like the old ‘law and order’ Conservatism, rejects the traditional social democratic analysis that there is no panacea for crime through criminal justice policy, whether of the Left or the Right. But the essential precondition for order is economic justice and welfare, without which moral socialization cannot take root as other than fragile coercion. None the less, in a just and thriving economy, an effective criminal justice system has important functions to perform. It must show that serious offences against the criminal law will be effectively dealt with. But it is not clear that the declining overall effectiveness of the police and of criminal justice is because of internal failings so much as because of the overwhelming growth of work-load due to growing social and economic inequality coupled with moral deregulation."
ACA ACA-AS6-004 8.95 "The Inner-City Battlefield: Politics, Ideology, and Social Relations Susanne MacGregor INTRODUCTION From the moment in 1979 when Mrs Thatcher swept to power on a wave of uncollected garbage following the ‘winter of discontent’, her radical assault on social democracy and the welfare state was to be a continuing theme of the politics of the 1980s. In her famed speech on election night 1987, as she rallied her party troops on the steps of Party Headquarters not to rest on their laurels but to continue the fight (they were to be allowed one night of ‘marvellous partying’ but must start back the next day with renewed vigour), she announced that ‘we've got a big job to do in some of those inner cities…and politically, we've got to get back in there — we want to win those too’. The connection between her public policies and the political arithmetic was precise and clear. In this chapter, I shall argue that the concept ‘inner city’ is a fundamentally ideological category. Although it is often presented as a scientific term, relating to features of urban development, its use is better understood as part of an ideological set which has been borrowed from the United States. The use of the very term is therefore questionable. As used in politics and social policy in contemporary Britain, the concept ‘inner city’ is part of a move to a more conservative and punitive set of social practices and attitudes. THE ‘INNER CITY’ The ‘inner city’ is a representation which serves as a focus for politics and policy. It is a public issue which represents a  constellation of social worries, to do with urban poverty, squalor, ill-health, deprivation, decay, crime, social disintegration, and social polarization. The core issue is that of urban poverty . Poverty has been a continuing problem in post-war Britain. Its size and shape have varied and the names used to describe it have varied. What we have seen in the 1980s is a process by which poverty has been redefined as to do with the ‘inner city’. This involves an association of poverty with crime and violence, and with decay and backwardness. The redefinition of poverty as urban poverty and as a problem of the inner city reflects also a change in perceptions of appropriate policy responses. Specifically, the concentration on the spatial dimension, the grounded location of poverty in certain areas, arose when attempts were being made to restrict the scope of public policy and the extent of public expenditure, to limit its focus to targeted areas. However, reality intrudes on such constructions, as indicated by the gradual widening of the category ‘inner city’ to refer also to ‘outer estates’and then to whole cities, like Bradford; in some cases it is even used as a code for whole regions of deprivation in conjunction with that other metaphor, the North-South divide. The battle of ideas is about the very categories to be used in policy debate. Those who prefer limited, selective superficial policies exert pressure to restrict the scope of the categories. Those arguing for more fundamental change, tackling the causes rather than merely the symptoms of social distress, utilize categories embracing wider sections of society, extending from the still limited concept of the ‘bottom third’ to wider notions of the ‘public’and ‘citizens’. This chapter has a double focus. It aims to show that closely related to the objective of resurrecting conservative social policies is a political method which involves an attempt to change Britain's political landscape. Mrs Thatcher's expressed aim was to rid the country of socialism forever, and part of this involved destroying the Labour party's local government base. In the 1980s, Labour local authorities had emerged as defenders of the poor and of public services. The third term reforms to local government, the ‘inner-city’ policies, were much less about doing good for the  poor and arresting decline and decay than about undermining Labour's power bases. The flagship reform, the poll tax, and the related flotilla of changes affecting privatization and contracting-out, education, housing and social services, as well as specific ‘inner-city initiatives’, were designed to change the political structure and quite precisely to replace local democracy by the ‘market’. The explicitly anti-democratic nature of the radical Right project was put succinctly in an Institute of Economic Affairs pamphlet: it is clear that the machinery of representative parliamentary democracy has so far proved unsuitable as the mechanism for translating personal preferences into day-to-day practice. Profoundly disturbing questions must be raised about the imperfections or obstacles in the representative political process that frustrate the wishes of the sovereign populace it is ostensibly designed to represent. (Harris and Seldon, 1987, p. 64) Rather than propose ways in which representative democracy could be strengthened and improved, these authors concluded: ‘the weight of the evidence is that a vote is much less effective than purchasing power…the market is potentially more democratic than the state’(p. 65). DIVIDED BRITAIN: THE ASSAULT ON THE WELFARE STATE Britain has become an increasingly divided kingdom under Mrs Thatcher: the years 1979–87 witnessed major changes in Britain's electoral geography, reflecting growing socio-economic polarization — the divide between the relatively prosperous and the relatively deprived areas widened (Walker and Walker, 1987). Johnston and his colleagues (1988, pp. 325–7) have argued that this polarisation of the country and its potential political consequences was recognised by the Conservative Government almost certainly well before the results of the 1987 general election were known…the development of policies to tackle the economic run-down and social deprivation of inner city areas was identified as a major thrust for the new government and many new initiatives were conceived in the first weeks of the new Parliament. To a large extent, these continued and crystallised earlier attempts to tackle similar problems… The nature of those policies with their emphases on private sector developments, home ownership and small businesses, suggests that in part at least the Government is seeking to produce electoral change by introducing traditional Conservative supporters to areas where the party has been very weak — as, for example, in many of the residential developments in London's Docklands. Mrs Thatcher's identification of the ‘inner cities’ as the focus of her third term's agenda was not therefore a new conversion to the need to do something about urban poverty, squalor, and alienation. Rather it was one more step in the step by step approach to the reform of both local government and the politics and values of British society, which has been followed through consistently and vigorously throughout the 1980s. For the third term, the key policy areas, which would tackle the ‘really big job’ of the ‘inner cities’, were named as the policies for local government, education, and housing. Much of the right-wing discussion of policies for inner cities has been framed as though the attack was solely on two forms of ‘extremists’: one, the ‘Loony Left’ and the other, disorderly, criminal elements fomenting riots and social disorder. But the Thatcherite counter-revolution is much more all-encompassing: it is an assault on social democracy and all that that term entails, just as much if not more so than on simply ‘taking out’ pockets of resistance in specific local areas. Key state agencies in the social democratic arrangements identified for attack were local authorities. TACKLING THE TOWN HALLS The programme of reforms to local government, to reduce the power and status of local authorities, is part of a planned programme which, it is intended, will stretch into the 1990s. Because some reforms are hidden from public view over the horizon does not mean that they have not been thought out and designed. As we move along the road, they will come into sight. Mrs Thatcher herself supported this reading: ‘I'm here because I believe in things — because I'm always thinking forward’(speaking on Panorama , 25 January 1988). The Bradford model represents Thatcherism in action in the ‘inner city’. (Bradford as a whole was frequently described as an ‘inner city’ in news broadcasts in 1988, demonstrating clearly that the term signified ‘poverty and decline’rather than a specific area in a city.) Shortly after the Tories won control of the council in September 1988, almost £6 million of cuts in local authority expenditure were announced. The Leader of the Council, Eric Pickles, speaking at the Tory Conference in 1988, had promised that these reforms would place the customer first and that Labour would be swept from control of the cities and Town Halls. In this constellation, the Right identifies housing as of particular significance. The long period of domination by municipal socialism is said to have produced a dependence on the local authority, especially through provision of council housing. Low rents are seen as a form of bribery of the electorate. And this special culture is thought to be found in a particularly acute and virulent form in Scotland and in some parts of the North of England. Michael Heseltine was the main spokesman of the Conservative approach to the inner cities until his ministerial career was  abruptly interrupted by the Westland affair in 1986. He has remarked on the apparent fact that the ‘Loony Left’ were ‘increasingly to be found in the more deprived and distressed parts of our country’(Heseltine, 1987, p. 131). The Government had, he said, four choices. They could let conditions worsen; or they could move power back to national government; or they could re-organise the electoral boundaries so that the irresponsible Left loses its tight inner urban constituencies; or they could push power out beyond local government and into the hands of the people whom it is elected to serve. (p. 132). In practice, all four of these options have been pursued by the Thatcher administrations. But it was the fourth option which the Tories emphasized in their rhetoric. Local authorities would be encouraged to see themselves primarily as ‘service-providers’. Once this was conceded, the next step would be to move to their becoming semi-independent public bodies (much the same might happen to hospitals and other public services), with the ‘freedom to manage’ without regard to political pressure from local electors or ‘vested interests’(trade unions and professionals) and the freedom to cut labour costs (the main item in service budgets) by paying people only what it was necessary to pay them in that local market. National pay settlements and negotiating arrangements  hinder that process which would be improved, they argue, by ‘flexibility’ in wage-rates and local pay bargaining. The economics of the enterprise culture and the shape of service provision are thus integrally related, two sides of the same coin. And such changes mark a decisive shift away from local democracy. INSTITUTIONAL REFORM AND SOCIAL ENGINEERING Two developments — opposition to central government policies by Labour local councils, and urban riots — forced the Government to develop policies for the ‘inner cities’(Heseltine, 1987). That riots and local socialism were both found in the most acutely stressed parts of the country is no accident. Each was a form of opposition to the direction and effects of government policy and protest at economic changes. Hence the Tory Government's need to try to destroy such opposition. This could be done by  beating down, as in the assertion of dominance over local authorities. Or it could be done through fragmentation. Fragmentation takes place where blocks of low-income poor housing and their associated populations are broken up and dispersed, either through deliberate slum clearance and dispersal of population, as in the late nineteenth century (Stedman Jones, 1971); or by the decentralizing effects of the policies of earlier post-war years, overspill outer estates and new towns; or through the later processes of ‘gentrification’(Glass, 1964)— a term first used by Ruth Glass but popularized in the late 1970s — i.e. the emergence of new wealthy areas as in Islington or Docklands and the displacement of the poorer local population, likely to be further encouraged by the impact of the poll tax. Both the assertion of central authority and the fragmentation of local social structures and economics are integral to the overall desire to use power to restructure social arrangements in such a way that certain interests are favoured over others, to reward supporters,and to maintain these arrangements by using social institutions to entrench an alternative set of ideas, those of the ‘enterprise culture’. The Thatcherite counter-revolution should be seen, then, as consisting of a number of interrelated policies designed to restructure taxation, restructure public expenditure, reshape the welfare services, and curb the power of professionals, trade unions, and local authorities. These are closely interrelated and the Government's plans for the ‘inner cities’ cannot be understood unless seen as part of this overall enterprise. Thatcherism's social engineering — just as much social engineering as that of the Fabians or the very different local socialists they oppose — aims to ‘temper expectations’. The post-war boom's revolution of rising expectations is said to have fostered an insatiable appetite for more, without concern for the question of ‘who pays?’ Thatcherism is the revolt of the haves against the demands of the have nots. Mrs Thatcher, speaking on Panorama (25 January 1988), said that her constituency is that of those who are working ‘for an increased standard of living for their own families’(not, we should note, for others). She receives more complaints, she said, from those who are in work but feel they  would be as well off on supplementary benefit; her aim is to increase the gap between those who are working and the non-working. An interesting aspect of any ‘counter-revolution’ is that it takes the terms of the ‘revolution’and turns them to its own purposes. As Arno Mayer (1971, p. 45) commented, ‘as if by reflex, the counter-revolution borrows its central ideas, objectives, styles and methods from the revolution’. Thus ideas and principles are taken over, redefined, and reapplied in order to structure and manage discontent and political rebellion. Key words such as self-help, accountability, responsibility, hard work, thrift — many central to the tradition of the English working classes and trade unions — have been appropriated and presented as specifically Conservative and in some way under threat from socialism and collective action. So the Thatcherite counter-revolution has redefined the idea of justice. John Redwood, Head of the Prime Minister's Policy Unit in 1983–5, now a Conservative MP, sees two different kinds of justice: protection for the poor; and that all who enjoy services should pay (speaking on Weekend World , 11 October 1987). The poll tax, he said, is central to change and to improving the inner cities. Enterprise has been driven away by high business rates and high domestic rates. Enterprising people, in Thatcherism's view, are those who create new jobs. These are the highly successful, who must be encouraged to stay and to do well for they are the motor that pulls the rest up; they create prosperity and employ other people. Part of the drive to improve inner cities is deliberately to reward success, increase the gap between the working and the non-working, retain business and talented and successful people in these areas, and charge those who use services the economic cost of these services, so that if they don't like the price they will be encouraged to move out to areas where ‘the price is right’. This is called ‘consumer choice’ and it also opens up the possibility of charging for more services. The effect on the demography of the inner cities could be dramatic, as migration into and out of inner cities is in any case already high. Since housing is also crucial to mobility, the break-up of local authority control of low-income estates is also part of the package of reforms. Reports that the numbers registering on the electoral rolls are falling (Weekend World , 11 October 1987; the Independent , 23 February 1988, p. 6) indicate that the political arithmetic will also play its part. If some of those who resist and resent the imposition, opt out of the electoral system (and the calculation is that these will be those who are thought, either now or in the future, likely to benefit from the present array of public services), while others are more inclined to vote at local elections for a party which offers to cut and reorganize services, the electoral outcome would be dramatic. Michael Howard, then a Minister at the Department of the Environment, reported an opinion poll as having found that one-quarter of people who had not previously voted in local elections intended to vote in future as a result of the community charge (interview on This Week, Next Week , 21 February 1988). Quite how they will choose to vote is less certain, however, as the poll tax becomes labelled ‘a Tory tax’ and as environmental issues and collapsing public services assume a higher priority. Another concept which has been taken over and reinterpreted is that of ‘decentralization’. One argument against the Government's third term agenda for local government and the public services has been that, by undermining local authorities, they are increasingly centralizing decision-taking. On the contrary, argue the Thatcherites, we are ‘putting power further away’, for example to parents through the education reforms. With the opting-out opportunity, schools will have greater responsibility and liberty than under local authorities. In addition, capital is said to have been spread among the people. FROM ENTITLEMENT TO OBLIGATION The new enlightenment's assault on social democracy has focused particularly on the concept of ‘dependency’. Dependence on bureaucracies (local authorities, the NHS, the social security system) is said to present people with a lack of control over their own lives, to damage the spirit of independence. The sole supporters or the ‘social democratic’ welfare state are, so the argument goes, the publicly employed educated classes, whose careers are linked to the state. Removing the supports of these state agencies — the welfare net, subsidized public services — would face people with a ‘reality test’: that if you don't sweep floors eight hours a day, you won't have any money to live on. Young people are thought to have imbibed this dependency culture to an extent not found in their parents and grandparents — a product of the high rates of social expenditure of the 1960s and 70s. To effect a new social discipline, a new relationship is being established between the state and its subjects: society, that is the government, plays the role of the strict disciplinarian father; the people ate their children who have to be taught to mend their ways. John Moore, then Social Services Secretary, set this out explicitly in a key speech in autumn 1987, when he argued the need to move from social protection towards attacking dependency. In doing this, he said, ‘we are following the oldest pattern of behaviour known to man: the way parents raise their children. The aim of all parents is to teach their child to become an independent, self-reliant adult, able to participate in life and gain satisfaction. This should be society's aim for all its citizens too.’ A clearer statement of the top-down direction of the people by government would be hard to find. It demonstrates the emphasis on moral regulation and discipline which distinguishes the conservative from the liberal phases of Thatcherism. The American writer Charles Murray, one of Mr Moore's mentors, has justified moves away from the language of entitlement to the language of obligation by reference to something he calls ‘popular wisdom’. This he defines as characterized by ‘hostility towards welfare (it makes people lazy), toward lenient judges (they encourage crime), and toward socially conscious schools… The popular wisdom disapproves of favoritism for blacks and of too many written-in rights for minorities of all sorts’(Murray, 1984, p. 146). John Moore continued his ‘assault on dependency’ in 1989 by arguing that real poverty has already been abolished in modern Britain. Very few are really poor any more. To make this case, he defined poverty in ‘the old absolute sense of hunger and want’ or as ‘starving children and squalid slums’. By defining poverty as starvation and destitution, he was able to claim that not many people in Britain are poor and that those who argue the case for improvements to welfare provision, ‘the poverty lobby and the media’, are really intent on furthering their socialist aims through calling Western material capitalism a failure. Where others might see a more complex situation with a conceptual continuum between starvation, hunger, destitution, poverty (want), and inequality, Moore abolishes poverty by dividing it up between the two extremes of the continuum, also at the same time neatly side-stepping discussion of the visible increase in begging, destitution, and homelessness in major British cities. The sub-text, or hidden message, of Moore's attack on the poverty lobby is an attack on the poor themselves, part of the move to a harsher, conservative approach to social policy. The poor are in reality simply experiencing the effects of inequality and can indeed be blamed for their condition. ‘It is hard to believe that poverty stalks the land when even the poorest fifth of families with children spend nearly a tenth of their income on alcohol and tobacco’, was Mr Moore's dismissive conclusion. Such new social engineering is based on a specific form of behaviourist psychology — rewards and punishments directed at individuals teach them that actions have consequences, that failures or mistakes are punished and not rewarded, so that behaviour changes. This stress on merely individual responsibility ignores the reality of the interrelatedness of human life. No consideration is given to the fact that actually society is everything — that one person's effort may bring reward to someone else; that one person's mistake can bring disaster to another. The aim of the Thatcherite reforms to the public services is said to be to give consumers the power to go elsewhere if they are not satisfied. This policy is limited, however, in two crucial ways: first, that such ‘choice’ in effect reduces to the ability to pay, and ability to pay has been profoundly affected by other policies which have increased the differences among groups with regard to income and wealth; and secondly, that many public services must be provided in the local area if they are to be of real value and if other costs, not only financial, are not to be incurred, for instance, in travelling or moving residence in order to receive them. For example, proposals such as those to base service provision on charges or vouchers are impractical and tend only to  increase the differences between the services available in different areas and to shift the costs from the more visible budgets of the services to the less visible ones of the individual, relatively powerless consumer: either their pockets or their time and energy will be hit. As we have seen, the language of this welfare revolution is American, much of it popularized by writers like Charles Murray (1984). The aim to move away from the language of entitlement to the language of obligation is very different from the language of freedom and liberty which dominated the earlier phases of Thatcherism. As the terms accountability and democracy were redefined in the poll tax debates, so the concepts of ‘justice’ and ‘active citizenship’have been redefined in the debates about public services. The Thatcherite assault on the welfare state involves two key aspects: lowering expectations and imposing work discipline. The object of the ‘training schemes’ being promoted as part of the inner-city package is to drive down wages, for without reducing wages there will be in job creation. The creation of the enterprise culture in deprived areas of the North and the ‘inner cities’ is fundamentally about the creation of jobs at lower wages than were previously viewed as acceptable and reducing entitlement to benefit and levels of benefit in order to increase the incentive to take on these jobs. The end of entitlement is perhaps best demonstrated by the introduction of the Social Fund in the social security reforms of 1988. The Social Fund replaced the previous system of additional and urgent needs allowances and grants, which had been an area of supplementary benefit responsive to demand and welfare rights pressure. The solution to the complexities of the system and the growing complexity of case law adjudication was to abolish the notion of additional allowances completely, replacing them with loans from a limited budget and no right to independent appeal. This signified a ‘campaign against the benefit culture’. Benefits would go only to those in ‘genuine need’ so as not to ‘featherbed’the rest. A distinction would be made between the deserving and the undeserving poor. The main aim of these reforms was not to meet need precisely and in a neat, targeted  form. Rather it was precisely to change attitudes, to stress individual responsibility — you're on your own, don't expect any help from us — and to reduce the state's obligations. THE BATTLE OF IDEAS ‘The welfare state is at once Britain's proudest achievement and the biggest man-made disaster’, Sir John Hoskyns has written. (He is another former Head of the Prime Minister's policy Unit and a key figure in the Institute of Directors.) In a series of articles in The Times to celebrate Mrs Thatcher's ten years as leader (11, 12, and 13 February 1985) he wrote that she had inherited ‘forty years of muddled policy’. The first stage of the attack on the ‘muddled policy’ involved reducing the power of the trade unions, especially the public sector unions, who were thought to dominate the welfare state itself. Having cowed the trade unions, we can see that the next step was to take on the local authorities and the poor. Next in line for the 1990s are child benefit, pensions, and the NHS. By the year 2000, little will remain of the 1940s social legislation, assumed by Beveridge. Beveridge's Report was based on three guiding principles: the second of these was that: the organization of social insurance should be treated as one part of a comprehensive policy of social progress . Social insurance fully developed may provide income security: it is an attack upon Want. But Want is one only of five giants on the road of reconstruction and in some ways the easiest to attack. The others are Disease, Ignorance, Squalor and Idleness'. (Beveridge, 1942, para. 8, my emphasis) Thus Beveridge had assumed that the elimination of poverty was integrally linked to policies for health, education, housing and town planning, and full employment. Under Thatcherism, full employment commitments, family allowances, the NHS, town planning, council housing, education, social security, all will have been radically reformed. The battle of politics and ideas which focuses on the inner city represents a conflict between sets of interests and values which have a long history, dating at least from the 1830s and the New Poor Law of 1834. These are conflicts between democratic and  anti-democratic, socialist and anti-socialist, egalitarian and anti-egalitarian ideas. The ideas of the radical Right are not new. They go back a long way. They are old ideas stated in new form, in new language. In all the post-war years, both currents have been present. What changed was the party political situation: the seizure of power by the radical Right in the Conservative party and thence in government. For example, Ian Macleod and Enoch Powell (1952) had argued: Given that redistribution is a characteristic of the social services, the general presumption must be that they will be rendered only on evidence of need, i.e. of financial inability to provide each particular service out of one's own or one's family's resources. Otherwise the process is a wasteful and purposeless collection and issue of resources, which leaves people in the enjoyment of the same facilities as before. And Geoffrey Howe (1961) argued that ‘over the whole field of social policy, the firm aim should be a reduction in the role of the state’. These ideas were given a great push forward by the increasing impact of American thinking on British social policy from the late 1960s onward. The collapse of thinking about social policy in Britain, a result largely of the failure of the Labour party to develop new policies and not to defend adequately basic principles and institutions, created a vacuum into which right-wing ideas flooded. It was easier for the Thatcherites to attack the welfare state successfully because its principles and institutions had not been adequately defended, as Dorothy Wedderburn and others were warning as early as 1964 (Wedderburn, 1965). The slippage of support for universalism, equality, and public services was illustrated in comments made by Roy Jenkins. Writing in 1959 and with reference to Peter Townsend's calculation that a fifth of the population had not shared in the general improvement in living standards since the war, Roy Jenkins argued: Any believer in social justice, or indeed any believer in a civilised society, must surely give a high priority to providing such an improvement. Some, including Mr Townsend himself, would give it an absolute priority. They would deny the right of those whose standard of living is already at or above the average to any further improvement until the  submerged fifth had been given more or less equivalent benefits. I would not accept this extreme position . Neither the economic policy of a nation nor the political programme of a party is likely to achieve a successful dynamism if it is based solely upon the assistance of lame ducks. (Jenkins, 1959, pp. 56–7, my emphasis) Thus even in 1959 advocacy of equality was cast as extremism. the need for incentives was accepted if economic growth was to be attained. And any chance of winning an election on proposals for social justice was ‘realistically’ denied. It is important to stress that while there is within right-wing attacks on the welfare state a concentration on shifting culture and attitudes, with the increasing emphasis on ‘business’ and ‘enterprise’, on managing tight budgets and devolving responsibility for effecting cuts to lower levels, the intentions are determinedly economic. Ideology provides the justification and politics the means for shifts in economic outcomes — redistribution of income and wealth away from some sectors and groups towards others. This shift requires crucially a lowering of labour-costs and restructuring of the labour market. Social discipline is wanted not just for itself but for these ends. Much of what happened with the ascendency of the radical Right in British politics was predicted in at least one prescient article (Leonard, 1979). What is interesting, however, is that it has taken over ten years to bring about the changes Leonard anticipated. This is important and tells us two things. First, that the radical Right's assault has been carefully managed; the step by step approach was brilliantly conceived and managed by diligent and unerring control from the centre; secondly, that the speed of its success has varied in different areas of public provision, which tells us much about the role of resistances, resistances built on organized opposition within the public services. In the areas most closely concerned with the inner city, opposition from local authorities has been crucial. RECENT POLICIES ON THE INNER CITIES Conservative policy on the inner cities has diverged in some ways from the earlier policies of the 1970s, especially in shifting  away from social and environmental programmes towards an emphasis on economic and enterprise-generating ones. In other ways, however, there is a continuity in these policies, especially in so far as inner-city and urban initiatives specifically target defined spatial areas and direct resources deliberately towards them through special schemes. The assumptions lying behind such targeted programmes are that the ‘problem’ is a bounded one, concerned with ‘pockets of poverty or deprivation’, restricted areas of decay, which can be remedied through relatively limited expenditure and precise targeting of funds and activities to ‘special’, different, difficult problems, limited problems which remain to be rooted out, while the rest of the system is assumed to be functioning well and on course for prosperity and harmony. That is, inner cities are perceived as ‘deviant communities’, areas which need to be turned around and brought back into the mainstream, a mainstream that requires little or no restructuring or reform. This shift in policy from universalism towards selectivism and area targeting was criticized as early is 1976 by Peter Townsend, who was quick to note its implications: The perception that the ills of society are relatively more prevalent in some areas than others has innocent and fairly obvious origins… But then material and environmental deficiencies become heavily associated in the public mind with other socially perceived problems. For social reasons, both the degree of concentration of certain acknowledged problems and the extent to which they can be explained by internal processes of self-generation rather externally imposed processes may be grossly exaggerated. (Townsend, 1976, p. 168) He foresaw the dangerous drift in urban policy, which began under a Labour government, towards beliefs in contamination, self-generation of problems, individualistic explanations for poverty, pathologizing of areas and their populations. These perceptions were encouraged by policies which assumed that problems of urban deprivation had their origins in the characteristics of local populations and that these could be resolved simply by better co-ordination of the social services and encouragement of citizen involvement and community self-help. THE ‘URBAN UNDERCLASS’ A key feature of this situation is the extent to which public policy itself acts to create an ‘underclass’ of excluded poor, who are compressed into densely populated, poorly served physical spaces, crowded estates, and ‘inner cities’. This also implies, as recognized by the community development activists of the 1970s and their inheritors the ‘local socialists’, that poverty is a political condition as much if not more than a social or economic one. The powerlessness of the poor, their inability to influence the distribution of life-chances and rewards, helps to explain their poverty (Miliband, 1974; MacGregor, 1981). Some political activists concluded from this that what was needed was to ‘empower the poor’, encourage their civic and political participation as a way to redress the balance, give them the strength to organize in such a way as to make effective claims on society, to receive those citizen's rights to which they were said to be entitled. Much welfare rights activity and anti-poverty campaigns of local authorities, as well as anti-racist, anti-sexist equal opportunities policies, were based on this analysis. Once again, the counter-revolution has taken over the key concepts of this approach and turned them on their head. The ‘enabling state’ and the concept of empowering people have been interpreted as encouraging more individual consumer choice and limited, voluntary self-help welfare activity and ‘community care’(Thatcher, 1985; Ridley, 1988). The perceptions of the ‘inner city’ and of the ‘underclass’which inform government circles today are drawn from the United States, whose cities offer a terrifying picture of our future if we continue to move down the road to a residual, extremely selectivist welfare system. These perceptions emphasize the pathology of the victims themselves and the pathological influences found in certain areas. Fear about a drugs epidemic fuelled this alarm (MacGregor, 1989). ‘We have seen the future and it is frightening’, said Robin Corbett MP returning from a visit to New York's Lower East Side with the Home Affairs Select Committee in 1985. The picture was sketched by John Banham (1988, p. 23), Director-General of the CBI, describing Lawndale on the south side of Chicago. This, he said, represents a future to be avoided at almost any cost. There, a combination of poor housing and education, high crime rates, much of it drug-related, large-scale immigration and associated racial tensions, an exodus of jobs and the more well-off to the suburbs, high youth unemployment and welfare dependency and the break-up of traditional family structures have served to create what some commentators in the United States have described as an ‘urban underclass’. John Banham's understanding of the term ‘underclass’ derives from his days as a Director-General at the Audit Commission. It reiterates an orthodoxy whose source can be traced to one specific article (Lemann, 1986). This perception found expression also in an important Audit Commission Occasional Paper (Audit Commission, 1987) from which Banham's statement quotes and which is itself a direct repetition of Lemann's views. The paper set out in diagrammatic form a view of the factors causing an urban underclass (see Figure 4. 1). At the centre of the conception is high youth unemployment which, it is assumed, in the case of males leads to crime and trouble with the police; in the case of females it leads to single-parent families. Single-parent families, that is mothers , are blamed for continuing this process, producing a culture of dependency and poverty in that their children are said to grow up with poor interpersonal skills, low educational achievement, and lack of marketable skills. Recent US research and policy have focused on ‘dependent mothers’. Welfare is seen as a drug of addiction but studies of long-term welfare recipients have found that only one in five daughters of dependent mothers themselves become dependent. Furthermore, half of all mothers on welfare come off it within two years (Daly, 1989). However, superficial reading of research findings, combined with prejudice, has led to a growing stress on workfare in the United States where mothers, whose children may be as young as six months in some States, could be forced to accept training or low-paid work even where the child care support services are inadequate. The harshly punitive impact of the new   social conservatism on these women and their children contrasts with right-wing rhetoric expressing concern for the family. These views are being borrowed by right-wingers in Britain (Redwood, 1989). The social historian John Macnicol (1988) has criticized the ‘pursuit of the underclass’ which characterized the 1970s and 1980s. He pinpoints the beginnings of the contemporary resurgence of this theme as Sir Keith Joseph's speech to the pre-School Playgroups Association on 29 June 1972, when he was Secretary of State for Social Services. Macnicol shows that the roots of these views lie deeper and can be found in the social debates of the past one hundred years. Investigations of a hereditary or hard-core social problem group have always been crucial in conservative social reformist strategies. Joseph had mused: ‘perhaps there is at work here a process, apparent in many situations but imperfectly understood, by which problems reproduced themselves from generation to generation’(Joseph, 1972). The focus on the pattern of births among the very poor, a feature of the American concept of the underclass, one which prioritizes ‘single-parent female headed households’ as major issues (blaming the mothers), appeared explicitly in Joseph's 1974 Birmingham speech when he maintained that, because an excess of births was apparently occurring in mothers of social class V, ‘the balance of our population, our human stock, is threatened’. Birth control might help to prevent the excess production of ‘problem children, the future unmarried mothers, delinquents, denizens of our Borstals, subnormal educational establishments, prisons, hostels for drifters’. Extensive research failed to support the cycle of deprivation thesis but the stereotype lived on, and grew to more prominence with the dominance of the right wing in the Conservative party and thence in British society and politics: Keith Joseph was of course an early leading figure in this faction within the party. The apparent existence of an economically unproductive residuum of social outcasts has been traced as a feature of social investigation and social policy by, among others, Stedman Jones (1971) and John Macnicol (1988). The words used — the labels — have varied over time: residuum; social problem group; hard-core; problem families; the culture of poverty; alienation; hereditary poverty; the inadequate poor; the urban underclass. The search for personal inadequacy and behavioural defects has been the key focus of such research and policy. Macnicol argues that ‘in its periodic reconstruction, the underclass concept has tended to consist of five elements’: 1. an artificial ‘administrative definition relating to contacts with particular institutions of the state and welfare agencies, social workers, the police etc.’; 2. the separate question of inter-generational transmission, through either heredity or socialization; 3. identification of particular behavioural traits as antisocial, ignoring others; 4. stress on resource allocation issues, emphasizing high demand for services by defined categories of users; and 5. ‘it tends to be supported by those who wish to constrain the redistributive potential of state welfare and thus it has always been part of a broader conservative view of the aetiology of social problems and their correct solutions’(Macnicol, 1988, p. 316). The centrality of the ‘family’ in these conservative perceptions, and the double-edged nature of the disciplines advocated to deal with the problem, were illustrated in an editorial in the Wall Street Journal (Europe) of 17 January 1989. Entitled Today's America , this explained the split between the successful, socially mobile blacks and the rest thus: the key to the difference…lies in the family — a truth Daniel Patrick Moynihan was pilloried for stating a few years before Martin Luther King's assassination. In the past week, it happens, we have heard intelligent and well-meaning whites talking in apocalyptic terms about the problem of the black underclass — that it can only be solved by draconian measures of enshrining abortion or taking children away from mothers. Rather than this, argued the Wall Street Journal : the solution to the underclass lies in stricter enforcement of the criminal laws, in giving tenants a stake and a say in public housing, in educational innovation opposed by teachers' unions, in changing welfare laws so that a baby is not a ticket for an apartment separate from mom's. Much of the problem of the underclass, we continue to believe, arises from perverse incentives rooted in misguided paternalism. This explanation of urban poverty in terms of‘perverse incentives’ is being picked up by the right wing in Britain and used as the basis for proposals for new policies and regulations regarding unemployment benefit, income support, and housing entitlement as they apply to lone mothers. In the same week in which the Wall Street Journal editorial appeared, it was announced in Britain that an extensive study of lone parents' reliance on social security would be carried out after comments from Ministers that the state is having to foot the bill for the so-called dependency culture (Guardian , 18 January 1989, p. 3). Mr John Moore, then Social Security Secretary, had spoken of a young woman in his constituency who obtained special benefit and a council flat by becoming pregnant. He had said that the Government needed to be ‘wary of providing incentives to obtain a particular benefit which can erode a sense of personal responsibility and adversely affect behaviour’. Similarly, discussions are developing on how to limit the housing provided for single mothers and their children to very low standard institutional care, ‘to discourage the others,. BLAMING AND EXPELLING THE VICTIM While disputing the definition of an underclass composed of recalcitrant or wayward pathological individuals, it should be noted that current developments in public policy, especially the poll tax registration and payment procedures, are encouraging the formation of an ‘underclass’ in the sense of a section of society which does not participate even formally in society, let alone participate fully as citizens. Townsend's most important definition of poverty which emphasizes that lack of money leads to in  inability to join in fully in social life, producing in exclusion of individuals and social groups from ordinary life, focuses crucially on the role of lack of participation and powerlessness in the social construction of the ‘poor’. Some features of public policy may add to this informal exclusion and outcast status by encouraging people to opt out completely even from formal status as a citizen, thus losing all civic rights. The poll tax is crucial here (MacGregor, 1988). The pressures to evade the tax — a new imposition bearing particularly hard on poor people in deprived, high spending areas — will encourage some people to disappear from all public record and perhaps to keep on the move to avoid detection. Recent changes in social security regulations add to this. Shelter estimated that 25,000 to 40,000 young people slept out in the open in Central London in 1987. Others say the numbers increased in 1988. The census of 1991 may be affected by these processes and since the census returns will form the basis of some resource-allocation calculations, severe underestimation of the needs of some areas may be the result. In the United States cities already have to argue for a notional amount to compensate for such under-recording: the same will probably have to happen in Britain. THE DEBATE IN THE UNITED STATES: SOCIAL DEMOCRACY'S ALTERNATIVE In his book The Truly Disadvantaged , William Julius Wilson avoided the simplistic banalities of writers like Murray and Lemann (Wilson, 1987). He confronted the evidence on inner cities and, being a black social democratic scholar, dared to observe the clustering in ‘ghetto’ neighbourhoods of ‘socially isolated’blacks and Hispanics. This is due, he argued, to decreasing employment opportunities with the shift from goods-producing to service-producing activities and the loss of 7 million unskilled jobs, and the undesirable concentration effects of this. But this situation was not, he claimed, the result of personal inadequacy; it resulted from wider impersonal economic and demographic forces. The loss of employment opportunities led to a loss of ‘marriageable men’ in inner-city areas. A key factor in the process, Wilson argued, was the collapse of institutions in these neighbourhoods, a direct result of poverty and social isolation, which produces a continuing social disorganization. Wilson's work has been lauded by the centre-left in the United States and is an important reminder that not all Americans are Reaganites. But this brave attempt to ‘face facts’ contains problems. The concept of social disorganization, for example, which has a long history in sociology, assumes its contrast to be with a ‘community’, a harmoniously well-organized and integrated society. What we see, however, are different forms of organization,alternative institutional arrangements. We may prefer arrangements based on institutions like the church and the shop but gangs and parties are also forms of social institution, not perhaps quite so easy to break down and displace as ‘disorganization, would imply. We may agree with much of Wilson's emphasis on the need for public policy that promotes universal programmes and increases employment and training opportunities open on the same basis to all people . However, his analysis has been criticized as ‘abominably sexist not to mention atavistic’(Reed, 1988). The tangle of behaviours Wilson discusses consists of crime rates, teenage pregnancy, female heads of families, welfare dependency, and out of wedlock births. Clearly four of these are overlapping categories and focus on women specifically. To condemn this analysis as sexist is not however exact. Young men and underclass men in general are also portrayed in disparaging terms in the book, even though the explanation for their behaviour (criminality, violence, drugs, hanging round pool halls, lick of responsibility for offspring) is placed at the door of external forces. Rather, the analysis is pro-nuclear family and implicitly pro-patriarchy and favours a clear set of moral rules and values, which perhaps are ones of which many respectable working-class people, both black and white, Afro-American, European-American, and others, might approve. But by focusing on a particular selection of empirical evidence, the book seems to shift  the blame from the poor and the underclass to women and to their lack of available, acceptable marriage partners. The implicit solution is a resurgence of the ‘normal’ nuclear family. Whatever the support or not for these values, the book fails to recognize the wider changes that have gone on in the family and in gender relations, changes which may be quite separate in origin from the question of poverty, although they add to the poverty of women and children. Remedies for the poverty of single mothers and their families in an economy where the two-income family sets the norm in both the production and consumption systems would need to be more far reaching than those proposed by Wilson. It is quite clear that the lone parent is greatly disadvantaged in terms of available resources, money especially, but also time and energy, compared to the two-parent or three-generation family, and she and her children suffer because of this. But other factors cross-cut and a given lone-parent family may still be better off than if they were in a two-parent household characterized by vindictiveness, meanness, or violence (Pahl, 1985). Importantly, the politics behind the ‘impersonal, economic and demographic forces at work in British and American cities need to be brought out. The transformation of postwar industrial cities was driven not by some abstract historical force but by a combination of private investment decision and state action. This impetus was centred around an urban renewal policy that — along with explicitly segregationist policies in federal public housing — cut off minority communities, displaced large sections of these communities and concentrated them between expressways, office complexes, stadiums and civic centers. There lies the source of Wilson's ‘social isolation’. (Reed, 1988, p. 169) Wilson in the end fails to escape from ‘the nexus of moralistic ideology and patriarchal vision dressed up as social science,(ibid.), much as the writers reviewed by Macnicol failed to do. However, his conception of the ‘underclass’, its causation and policy remedies, differs markedly from those of the far Right whose views have been so easily absorbed into British government and establishment thinking. CONCLUSION the single point that emerges from a close reading of the literature on the underclass and the inner city is that there is no valid need to identify the poor by their putative behaviour at all. Many of the indicators chosen are suspect, as Macnicol has shown for earlier periods, in that they simply count contact with state agencies, and it is a commonplace observation that the poor are more likely to be in contact with social workers because they are poor (Becker, 1988); young drug-takers in inner cities are more visible than wealthy socialites but drug-taking and drinking stretch across social groups (O'Bryan, 1989; Plant, 1989); desertion of women by husbands and the choice to remain unmarried are not restricted to the poor; and so on and so on. All these ‘signs’ of ‘inadequacy’are nothing of the kind but are indicators of poverty and powerlessness. Only measures of material social conditions, unemployment, income, housing conditions, density of population, can usefully serve to characterize the deprivation encountered by those forced to live in these circumstances. The ‘underclass’ is what the working poor become when they are not employed. Once jobs arise and if they are paid for their labour, they become the workers again; sometimes they are just as poor but their class position has changed. However, long-term unemployment and disconnection from the social relations of work and employment are bound to produce different patterns of social life, norms, and values and possibly despair and hopelessness. It may lead to a gap between the values of those most closely tied to the institutions of the labour movement and the unwaged. But this problem too is not confined to the gap between the ‘workers’ and the unemployed. It affects the gap between unionized and non-unionized sectors, between men-dominated and women-dominated work-situations and areas of social life. These varieties are complex and changeable: at times of rapid social restructuring such changes are also more rapid. What is clear is that public policies that come from outside and are imposed on inner-city populations are often based on prejudice and ignorance. What is needed is a change in the processes of decision-making so that policies are informed from below by the people involved, who  are the only ones who really know what life there is like and what people really want and are able to do. In the dominant conceptions of inner-city public policy, breaking the cycle focuses on the issues of ‘welfare dependency’ and ‘youth unemployment’: it does not include far-reaching and fundamental reorganization of social and economic life and the redistribution of income, wealth, and life-chances. Hugh Stretton (1978) has provided four metaphors to characterize the city: the city as machine; as community; as a market place; and as a battle-ground. In this chapter I have concentrated on the image of the inner city as a battle-ground — a battleground on which opposing forces, ideas, and values can be identified. The argument has been that the geography of poverty and the geography of voting are interconnected and thus party politics and public policies are interconnected too. Attitudes to social problems and public policy and electoral strategies are closely intertwined, most effectively by the Thatcherites in their overall strategy of social engineering. Their opponents have not been able to make the connections as effectively, either through working out a coherent ideology or through practice and organization. Only municipal socialism offered any coherent alternative, but this was limited by its restriction to the local level; the balance of power went against it and it has now been thrown back. Dominant perceptions of poverty in divided Britain as characterized by urban poverty, decay, and concentration in areas defined as ‘inner cities’ and inhabited by an ‘underclass’call forth increasingly punitive and extremely tight-fisted selectivist policy responses. An alternative view sees the shape of poverty as reflecting the shape and condition of the wider society and requires more wide-ranging policy responses, especially those founded on universalist principles. In a critical article written several years ago, Townsend concluded by reminding his readers what Tawney had written in 1913. Plus ça change : in the 1990s these words (apart from their dated gender references) remain as relevant and as enlightening as in the 1970s and at the beginning of the century: the problem of poverty is  the condition of the normal man [and woman]in normal circumstances, neither better nor worse off than his [or her]neighbours, not of those whose failings qualify them to be the text for the moralist, and who are no more common in the manual working-classes than in other sections of the society. It is in short the question of the economic status and opportunities of those who make up seven-eighths of the community, not of any submerged residuum… The problem of poverty with which the student is concerned is primarily an industrial one,— and only secondly in its manifestations,—[found]in the mill, in the mine or at the docks,— not in casual wards or on the embankment. (Townsend, 1976, p. 171)"
ACA ACA-CLP-001 9.4 "HUMAN RESOURCES AND SYSTEM DESIGN Concepts The human contribution The human role as a system controller The business of designing machines, processes and systems can be pursued more or less independently of the properties of people. Nevertheless people are always involved, the designer himself is a human being and his product will shape the behaviour of many workers and other users. More fundamentally, the design activity will be meaningless unless it is directed towards serving some human need. In spite of all this, the design process itself is often thought about and executed without any formal considerations about people. Inevitably the engineer, architect or other designer devotes most of his attention and expertise to devising mechanisms, buildings and so on which support some human activity more effectively than those currently available. The new machine or system must not be very different from the old one for a variety of reasons. The old one did its job, not perfectly but well enough to justify its existence. The new one is usually designed on the basis of copying the old one but removing as many as possible of the faults. There are other reasons such as commonality of components and, of course, shortage of imagination which lead to most design and development being a progressive iterative process. This happens to suit the human operators because most of their skills will transfer along the line of development of the machines and systems. From the engineering point of view the hardware technology is central and the operators tag along supporting the activity of machines which are basically doing the work. In nineteenth century transport for example, the coach and horses was not a serious competitor for the steam-engined train, nor was the man with a spade as productive as the operator with a steam shovel. This was the earliest technology in which power was derived from sources other than animal muscles and the output was so obviously superior that men did not mind putting up with the inconvenience of machines which were uncomfortable or awkward to use. They even took pride in developing new skills which enabled them to use difficult machines which inexperienced people could not  use. This attitude was reinforced by the second wave of technology which provided instrumentation, ways of sensing and recording data which gave more accurate and reliable data than that which can be detected directly by the human senses. At this stage the typical machine operator manipulated machine controls on the basis of data presented on instruments. The machine controls caused power to be applied and consequences to occur which resulted in changed readings on the instruments. The man was in the control loop (Hick and Bates, 1950). More recently, in the third wave of technology the man has been removed from the responsibility for continuous control (this is best done by computers working to a moderately flexible range of programs) but he remains as the monitor of the system performance and a selector of the appropriate program determined by the changing short-term objectives. He may keep the responsibility for setting-up and shutting-down the system or this also may be partially delegated to computers. This is the ‘Supervisory Control’ role (Sheridan and Johannsen, 1976). Information flow in these three phases of development of system control is shown in fig. 1.1 Supervisory control is by no means universal, in fact it remains restricted to high technology systems such as aircraft, computer controlled machine tools, chemical plants and power stations. (Edwards and Lees, 1974). There are still many systems where the man is in the control loop, for example in vehicle driving and in most manufacturing production processes. There are many tasks where the operator is assisted only by hand-tools and simple powered machines, for example in craft-work and surgery. There are also plenty of tasks, although these are now perhaps more common in leisure than in paid work, where the man supplies the muscle power, for example the manual labourer and the active sportsman. In general, the working man may function at any level from the senior partner in high technology operations to the provider of muscle power in physically demanding jobs. In all cases the ergonomic requirement is that the task as designed should make use of his abilities and be adaptive to his limitations. The human contribution in high technology systems All working systems, including those incorporating advanced technology of processes and process control, depend on skilled operators. There are social, economic and technical reasons for this. Socially the public will not easily accept automatic systems. When seeking reassurance that a system is safe they study the people who are responsible for it. They have no means of assessing the reliability of automatic control systems but they can make some assessment of a skilled individual and without  knowing very much about his working procedures they will trust his actions if he seems calm, competent and mature. The most direct example is the nervous airline passenger who is comforted by the belief that the middle-aged pilot he saw sitting on the flight deck is flying the aeroplane. Less directly but equally importantly, people living in the vicinity of a large plant would not take kindly to the idea that it was not under the control of human beings who are on the spot and are assumed to know exactly what is happening. Economically it remains true that it is inordinately expensive to construct a system which must continue to be reliable without direct human intervention, for example under the sea or in space. Equally it is expensive to ensure that equipment will continue to function under rough handling conditions, for example the necessary ‘ruggedising’ of military equipment. A system can be designed much more economically if it can be assumed that skilled personnel are available to control and take care of it. Technically the state of the art seems to be that systems are most efficient, reliable and safe when control is largely automatic but the human operator remains in a monitoring and supervisory role. That is, continuous dynamic dealing with minor perturbations is automatic and so also is the application of basic rules about safety; for example , the system or some part of it might be programmed to go through a step-change function such as a shut-down if certain parameters exceed prescribed limits. The role of the human operator in these circumstances is largely specified by operating instructions which are mandatory. Given this and this — he must do that. Characteristically his intervention in this way is a response to some other human requirement; for example, a maintenance man may wish to have a particular sub-system shut down for his attention or a user of the system product may wish to receive a different input to meet his purposes. Many of these interactions could be made automatic were it not for the basic need for a human presence for the social/ economic reasons mentioned above and because the human operator has to act as the ultimate back-stop when things go badly wrong. Things go badly wrong when there has been some extreme untoward event such as a fire, an earthquake or a bomb, alternatively an unanticipated combination of faults may occur within the plant itself. In either case the human intervention must be a very high level one based on complex diagnosis and innovative design-type thinking about how best to cope so as to avoid a catastrophe. A catastrophe can happen when the system energy is no longer channelled as intended by the designers or because there is a release of toxic substances or both. The demands on the operator stem from two kinds of task which are not compatible because they require very different levels of skill. On the one hand he must cope with routines where the demand is for precise obedience to  established instructions and on the other hand he might suddenly be faced with a need to respond in a creative manner totally outside any instructions. Superficially the solution would seem to be to have two kinds of operators, those who carry out the routines and others who are on call should unforeseen emergencies arise. There are two snags about this approach. Firstly there may not be time or it may not be physically possible to suddenly introduce a high level operator, for example we cannot put a different pilot on the flight deck when an aircraft gets into trouble. Secondly, the high level operator will not maintain his skill and familiarity with the system unless he operates regularly within it. His ability to intervene effectively must be a function of his ‘hands on’ experience supported of course by his conceptual knowledge of how the system functions. This last proposition is based on experience of systems where the intervention requires complex manipulative activity, for example a surgeon dealing with an emergency during an operation or an aircraft pilot taking over manually. It is not so obviously true where the intervention takes the form essentially of a decision to initiate a single direct action such as closing a particular valve or starting up a stand-by pump. In these circumstances it is not clear whether or not the effectiveness of the intervention is quite so dependent on operating experience. Taking for example the nuclear power plant control room, the question is whether the desk operators should be expected to cope with all emergencies which appear within the total information presentation or whether, for complex and dangerous situations, a more senior person such as the shift-charge engineer should be called upon to make the decisions. This policy issue must be cleared before the basic personnel decisions about selection and training of staff at the various levels can be made and before the information presentations can be designed. The human contribution in low technology systems The extreme case of man as a source of muscle power is dealt with in the previous book in this series —The Body at Work . Such working situations are now relatively rare in developed countries and the man is more usually employed in tasks where there is a considerable control element requiring extensive information processing. Such tasks range from the use of simple hand tools to tracking using complex powered machinery. Human beings are needed for those tasks for a variety of reasons from their highly dexterous manipulative potential through to their ability to accept informal instructions. These reasons are given in detail in the discussion of man-machine function allocation (p. 35). The demands on the human operator are difficult to quantify or even to describe because the process is essentially an interactive one. The skilled operator is working in harmony with his tools and machines. The concept of ‘demand’ is often not appropriate because it implies confrontation, the process is more aptly considered as one of cooperation and persuasion. The human operator is pursuing an objective, usually to make something or to go somewhere, and he achieves this with the assistance of the hardware at his disposal. This hardware, if it is well-designed, aids him in his progress toward his objective. There may be demands in the sense that there are always obstacles to be overcome but these stem from the nature and the variability of the situation he is in; that is, the materials he has to deal with or the environment he has to move through. The skilled operator will aim for efficient performance. Efficiency incorporates not only quantity and quality of achievement but also preservation of his own safety and health and that of others who might be involved as working partners, passengers or the general public in the neighbourhood. Of course, if his tasks are badly designed they may well make unnecessary demands. These begin with bodily aspects of the operating posture required and the forces which must be exerted to operate controls. for a work-space which is used full-time very slight departures from the optimum may lead to problems in the long term, for example in strained ligaments, tendons and muscles. Posture is constrained not only by the physical dimensions of the work-space but also by the need to be in a position to see certain events and to feel others through control operations or machine movement. Other demands will arise if the information presented is inadequate in content, e.g. poor lighting may make it difficult to detect some relevant cues, or in structure, e.g. because of poor coding and presentation of information on dials, charts or screens. Correspondingly there may be output demands created by control operations which result in things happening too quickly or unexpectedly. The level of demand is to do not only with the tasks as they are done but also with the duration for which they must continue to be done. This applies particularly to routines and repetitive work where the main operator limitation is not capacity or skill but stamina. In principle, repetitive work is best left to automatic machines but the flexibility of human performance is often needed because slight changes are required either to modify the product or to cope with different materials. Batch production work is often of this kind and in general it is by no means as unchanging or boring as it might appear to the casual visitor to the factory. In all the clothing trades for example there are continuous changes in sizes, materials, colours, styles and so on which provide the appropriate variety for  the customers and incidentally for the producer. Work design must take account of the needs of the consumer as well as those of the worker. Ergonomics and other aspects of technology The technical specialist who represents the people point of view implicit in the approach just described is the ergonomist. In the previous book in this series the relationship of ergonomics to other aspects or kinds of technology was discussed in detail. The unique feature of ergonomics is its emphasis on the characteristics of human operators and their relevance to the design of work. The role of the ergonomist is essentially an advisory one. In the case of high technology design he must provide a service for the engineers and scientists who carry the technical design responsibility. This service may simply be as a source of information or the ergonomist can have more power in that the design decisions involving people have to be approved by him. This is usually restricted to obvious cases of man-machine interaction such as the design of displays, controls and work-spaces. In the case of low technology design again he has an advisory role but with a general emphasis on awareness of the kinds and ranges of people who are being catered for. for systems which are already operating the ergonomist is likely to cooperate with occupational health and safety specialists and to play a part in the consideration of accidents and occupational diseases which might arise from unnecessarily stressful work situations (p. 294). It will be appreciated that for most kinds of work and most working organisations it is not feasible to employ specialist ergonomists. In such cases those who have responsibilities for work design need to have some awareness of the principles of ergonomics. The philosophy of work Ergonomics is sometimes confused by questions such as, who is the ergonomist servicing — the employer or the worker? or, to whom is he ultimately responsible — the state, the employer, the producer or the consumer? fortunately it is possible to dispose of these issues without taking up any particular political position. Ergonomics seems to flourish equally well in capitalist and socialist/communist systems, ergonomics activity can be sponsored with equal validity by employers organisations and by workers organisations. This is because, as already mentioned, ergonomics is about efficient use of people. There can be no good reason to object to this when it is recognised that efficiency incorporates personal factors such as safety, health and quality of  working life as well as system factors such as productivity and quality of work. There is rarely any conflict in that good ergonomics is in line with the objectives of the worker, the employer and the consumer or customer. There are sometimes larger issues of whether what the system does is acceptable or not, for example in weapon systems, and the ergonomist as a citizen will have his own opinion on these matters but the ergonomist as an ergonomist is confined to questions of efficiency. There is an underlying necessary ethic which is best summarised as the social contract. An individual is a member of a community from which he obtains considerable benefits, in return he develops special skills which he applies for the benefit of the community. The application of special skills in this way is called work. The ergonomist has to believe that work is a good thing and that to conduct it efficiently is always better than to conduct it inefficiently. The design of systems. The system concept A system is a set of interacting parts which has meaning as a whole because it is possible to define a purpose — a reason why the parts are seen to be related to the whole and a justification for the concept of the whole (Singleton, 1974). Thus, systems theory is essentially teleological — explanations are in terms of consequences rather than causes. The parts may themselves be complex and may be conceived as having their own subsidiary purposes in confluence with the system purpose, these are sub-systems. The system in turn is part of a larger complex — the parent system. Thus, systems are hierarchical and at each level the unit is considered as a functional rather than a physical entity. The systems approach is often a convenient way of looking at human behaviour either internally — this is man as a set of sub-systems or in terms of the man interacting with mechanisms — man-machine systems, or man interacting with organisations — socio-technical systems. The enormous flexibility of the systems approach has its penalties in potential confusion due to the highly variable relationship between functional and physical entities. Sometimes this relationship is fairly close; for example, in the nervous system, the endocrine system, the digestive system and so on , and sometimes it remains almost entirely unknown, for example , the perceptual system and the decision-making system. These last two are obviously each related to the nervous system and to the brain but not necessarily to a particular part of the brain and taken together they overlap in such obscure ways that they are best regarded as sub-systems in different domains, one can talk in terms of one or the other but not both simultaneously. Systems theory is a useful way of identifying complex entities, particularly  those which have a functional unity and of talking about relationships but it remains at some level of abstraction from reality. for example, to solve any design problem there has at some stage to be a switch from systems thinking to thinking in terms of physical entities because these are the things that can be created, precisely located and manipulated in the real world. Nevertheless, there are enormous dividends in being able to discuss functions independently of physical mechanisms and to explain relationships without being restricted to established and readily observable physical connections or separations. For example, thinking of a power station as a way of translating energy from fuel into electric power enables the designer to consider various options. Should the fuel be of a fossil type such as coal or oil or should it be the radioactive elements in a nuclear reaction? When the heat has appeared how best should it be taken away — by pressurised water, by steam, by liquid sodium or by carbon dioxide? This heat has to be turned into mechanical energy, currently always by a steam turbine and the mechanical energy in a rotating shaft is then translated by a generator into electricity. The losses in this transfer of energy from one form to another can be calculated and the flow through the various sub-systems can be traced. The initial consideration of the power station as an energy processing system aids design discussions about the relative advantages and limitations of various mechanisms and their performance in practice. As the system operates it has to be controlled. The control of the flow of energy is partly through automatic servomechanisms and partly through human operations. The design problem of which does what is also best thought about initially in system terms. Distinct from the flow of energy the designer is, at this stage, thinking about the flow of information. Energy and information are processed by systems and sub-systems. In these terms, the human operator is a particular sub-system. Mechanical devices and human operators are not comparable physically beyond the mundane level of size but they are comparable as different sub-systems whose performance can be described and assessed in terms of the common metrics of energy and information. Hence the importance of systems concepts to ergonomics. If the human operator is to control functions within other sub-systems he must receive information about the system state through a man-machine interface. This interface takes its physical form in the control room. The control room is part of the communications channel between the human operators and the mechanisms and its design, as a man-machine interface, is one of the key ergonomics problems in power stations. Office organisations also can be considered as systems. There will be certain physical mechanisms such as telephones, typewriters and computers but the flow of energy is trivial and the interest centres entirely on the flow of  information. Consider, for example, a travel office. There is a vast amount of information available either in printed form or through computer networks. The objectives are to help members of the public to find their way through this information store and to transmit their orders for particular journeys or holidays to the providers of those services. The manager or designer of the office has to consider the various sub-systems he requires; one for dealing with enquiries, one for handling money, one for receiving new information, one for confirming orders and so on. The interface between the public and the information store is a counter manned by people. The counter assistants are parts of the interface. Information is exchanged verbally and through written documentation. In this kind of office the variety of requests for service is probably such that it would be necessary to provide a set of categories of the main kinds of activities or functions. It would then be possible to devise the appropriate system for presenting the required information. It is a very different situation from a power station control room but nevertheless the same principles of starting by the analysis of the required information apply. The power station, the travel office and all other man-made systems have in common the employment of people so that sub-systems are required which are associated with personnel functions. It is necessary to attract and select staff, to train them, to provide them with various services and with potentiality for advancement as their skills increase with experience. The design of tasks is the common ground between personnel activities such as training and engineering activities such as workplace design. Consideration of people in system terms provides the possibility of generalisations which apply across great varieties of physical and intellectual activities. The resulting knowledge is the content of ergonomics. Fig. 1.2 shows the outline of the systems design process in a way which emphasises the parallel roles of the engineer and the ergonomist concerned respectively with the design of the hardware and the personnel sub-systems and their common design problems of allocation of function and interface design. The design of high technology systems The insertion of an adequate Human factors approach into a comprehensive design process is not easy, partly for the reason mentioned already that it has not habitually been regarded as necessary and partly because it cuts across all other decision-making. The Human Factors specialist can rightly be accused of wanting to have a finger in every pie because, as he sees it, behavioural considerations do affect every design decision. If ergonomics was confined to, say, the determination of the physical dimensions of the work-space then it would be more readily accepted by traditional designers, but the  broad claim that ergonomics has a contribution to make to every design and operational aspect which involves the behaviour of people is a proposition which it is much more difficult for an engineer or other designer to digest (fig. 1.3). The questions begin with the formulation of the design objectives. What are   the human requirements which the new product or process is intended to meet and how far are they not met by those already available? This would normally be regarded as a matter for economists and market-research specialists but behind the formidable array of evidence which they will generate are more fundamental questions of consumer preference, customer requirements and so on which are matters of human needs and prejudices. Competent market research should cover these aspects but the ergonomist can remind the policy-makers that such evidence is needed and that it should be acquired by studies of people which are properly conducted. If the evidence is favourable then the next step will be to set up a design team containing members covering the relevant range of expertise. How much design effort is needed in the different areas will not be clear at this stage but unless the system is very simple there are bound to be problems of overlap and of how far to arrange sub-teams by discipline, by function or by problem (Singleton, 1987). The usual compromise is that there should be problem-orientated sub-teams but with additional support available from discipline-orientated specialists. If these latter are part of the design team then already we have a matrix organisation but they may well be provided on a service basis from some other part of the parent organisation. Difficulties will emerge later unless considerable thought is given at this stage to the appropriate range of skills required and the consequent problems of interdisciplinary communication. The art of good sub-system design is to identify problem areas where work can proceed relatively independently of other areas so that the need for intercommunication is minimised. There will always be the need for some intercommunication and the appropriate interfaces should be provided. Nevertheless, if committees, working parties and task forces begin to proliferate within the design team, this is a sure indication that the basic allocation into sub-systems was not optimal. Communication should be mainly through the central command and control centre which may be no larger than the project leader and his small personal staff as may be a group of heads of sub-systems or both. These issues are discussed from another viewpoint in Chapter 3 (p. 140). The analysis of required skills ought in principle to have an ergonomics input but in practice it is usually done on the basis of experience of similar system designs in the past. There can be a useful discussion between the project leader and an ergonomist where the former is invited to clarify how he sees these intercommunication problems being dealt with including such criteria as what is reported to him, what to the meeting of sub-heads and what occurs directly between sub-teams. Organisational rules of this kind can be very helpful in steering between the excessive information flow, e.g. memoranda copied to many people, and excessive unilateralism, e.g. refusing further discussion after the issue of formal documents. Having allocated the human and other resources needed for the overall design task it is then appropriate to develop a more detailed model of the system functions in terms of materials, energy and information flow. Most designers have an intuitive but unformalised picture in these terms but it is of great utility to produce these pictures in flow diagram form so that any differences of view are revealed and can be reconciled by discussions during the process of agreeing the diagrams. When there are a number of individuals or groups from different disciplines and pursuing different objectives within some overall specification it is  obviously crucial that all their activities should be in line with the common goal. To this end, it is necessary that there should be intercommunication not only about particular design decisions but also about underlying philosophies so that the ultimate system is conceptually as well as operationally coherent. Sometimes this is achieved by a dominant project leader who imposes his own philosophy and then makes many of the decisions leaving only detailing for team members. In recent times it is more usual to have some element of discussion, partly because of the increasingly democratic style of organisations and partly because the variety of relevant technology requires a correspondingly wide range of expertise. In any case there is a need for widespread intercommunication which may be mainly informal but requires some formality to ensure that clashes of attitude do not delay or distort decisions and to make sure also that finalised decisions are unambiguously recorded. If this intercommunication is not properly arranged there will be the familiar symptoms of frustrating reiteration, decisions being misunderstood or being constantly revised, political manoeuvring and even concealment of progress within one or more of the teams. As the overall design progresses the information storage system becomes increasingly important. If insufficient attention has been devoted to the design of this and also the related access procedures the symptoms are a plethora of documentation which no individual entirely understands, the temptation to do it again rather than waste time finding out how something has already been done and too much reliance on the human memory. The behavioural symptoms of inadequate organisation of design teams are summarised in Table 1.1. As the system is made more definitive by the selection of particular physical mechanisms there should be parallel activity in the consideration of how these things are to be used and maintained by the human operator. Note that the philosophy here is that all the hardware is ultimately an extension of and a support for human functions. This is the concept of all systems as human beings with various kinds of engineering aids (Singleton, 1967a). functions are delegated from the human operator rather than allocated to him. This extreme ergonomics stance serves as an antidote to the equally extreme engineering approach in which systems are regarded basically as hardware which for reasons of economic or technological limitations have to depend occasionally on some human performance. Even if there is no dependence on human performance in the on-line operational mode it is bound to exist in the maintenance mode. In either case, there will eventually be a need for the consideration of the kinds of human operators required and how they are to be selected and trained. Traditionally these personnel functions were regarded as quite separate from   design functions and indeed they were often left until the hardware design and commissioning was virtually complete. The essence of the systems approach is that personnel decisions should proceed in parallel with engineering decisions, partly to economise on development time and partly to provide scope for trade-offs. One factor which has given renewed emphasis to this need for cooperation is the increased use of simulation (p. 128). Simulators were originally considered to be training devices but their use is now extending into other fields such as personnel assessment and as aids to the design of the information interfaces. It used to be considered that simulator specifications could only be proposed when the on-line system design had been completed but there are considerable advantages in developing the simulator before the on-line system so that it becomes a dynamic mock-up of the real situation. Detailed evaluations can be carried out on this mock-up before the real system is constructed. All systems are constructed from bought-in components which may themselves be complex enough to warrant a human factors evaluation. for example, a motor/pump system may well have its own controls, there will be standard maintenance procedures and there will be an operation/maintenance manual. All of these can be assessed from the point of view of clarity of presentation and ease of use. The system being constructed will require its own operating instructions, maintenance procedures and perhaps safety regulations. The design and preparation of this documentation has a Human factors component. It is a matter of storage, access to and presentation of information. Even at the design stage it is useful also to recognise that all this material will require procedures for updating in the light of experience Finally it must be accepted that technological and operational expertise is never complete. The operators of plant are bound to discover by experience aspects of the design which could be improved. There should be a mechanism for feeding this information back to the designers so that the succeeding system designs will avoid these problems. In particular, human performance within systems is impossible to predict with any precision and details of this performance as it occurs in practice or on simulators is the only basis for prediction on matters such as safety and system reliability either for the current system or for future systems. Potential human factors inputs to the large scale design process are summarised in fig. 1.4. In all behavioural matters and indeed in many technical matters also it is important to avoid the impression that when operations in practice contain undesirable features not predicted by designers then the designers have made mistakes. This may be true in a formal sense but allocation of blame is not usually a productive exercise particularly from a learning view-point. It is valuable to inculcate the attitude that everyone learns, that is, design and operating staff all improve on the basis of experience with feed-back. The exposure and remedy of facets of systems performance which are not entirely as predicted is in everyone's interest. One example of this is matters to do with safety: it is always useful to collect ‘critical incident’ data as well as accident data as one part of the feed-back about system performances. The setting up of routines for this communication is another aspect of ergonomics. In summary, although the basic contribution of the ergonomist is to the design of information interfaces these interfaces extend far beyond the man-machine interface found in the control room. They include the documentation of the design itself, communication within the design team, between designers and suppliers and between designers and operators (fig. 1.5). The operations staff include those who set it up, those who control it during operations, those who maintain it, and eventually those who have to dismantle it. To give one example of the size of the documentation problem it is not unusual for a large process plant to have two or three hundred volumes of instructions. These include the operating instructions, the maintenance instructions, the suppliers' instruction manuals, the safety regulations and instructions for particular emergencies. The design of smaller systems The design of a machine or device which is assigned as an aid for one person will not usually encounter the problems associated with elaborate design teams just described, but nevertheless some human factors sensitivity will help to provide a better product. This can be important not only from the point of view of efficiency in design and use but also in improving the sales appeal. It is increasingly common for advertisements to emphasise features such as‘man-machine harmony’ or ‘user friendliness’. The implication is that ergonomics has been properly applied. There is a need for formal ergonomics in any design where the designer himself is not an experienced user. Some hand tools are beautifully designed to match the user, e.g. the two-handed scythe. In these cases it is clear that the design developed by constant trial in practice. There are others, however, where even after centuries of use this matching is not obviously satisfactory, for example violin playing would seem to be posturally a disaster, but there may be some subtle aids to very precise control of the sound generated in having the source of sound very close to the ear and perhaps some vibration transmission by the direct contact of this instrument and the jawbone. Ergonomics is concerned with the transmission of information. for modest design enterprises information exchange is needed between the designer and the potential user, between the designer and the producer and between the designer/producer and the customer/actual user (Fig. 1.6). The designer needs to know about the tasks which his new device is intended to aid and also about the kind of person who will use it. Clearly, designing for fit young men in the armed forces has different constraints from designing for middle-aged female workers in manufacturing. Some of the required   information may be susceptible to precise description in numerical terms such as body size and strength, but most of it will be of the ‘awareness’ kind when the designer recognises broadly that particular kinds of people have particular advantages and limitations. Similarly the range of tasks for which the device is required may not be known in the kind of detail which is available from comprehensive task descriptions but the designer will consider the extremes of what it is likely to be used for and the environment in which it will be used, for example designing a machine-tool for use in a factory has different requirements from designing a powered garden tool where the user could be wearing heavy gloves, will not be wearing safety-boots and will not receive any formal training. Communication between the designer and the producer used to be done almost entirely by traditional engineering drawings but there is now a tendency to use sketches, schematic drawings, photographs and models including computer-based models, for example complicated shapes in three dimensions are difficult to represent as rectangular projections and are not easily interpreted. Communication with the customer/user takes the form of operating instructions which are contained in an instruction book. The design of this book, booklet or even leaflet is a much neglected art and is frequently very badly executed — hence the common attitude reflected in the aphorism ‘when all else fails try reading the instructions’. The most common failings are to rely too much on words rather than extensively labelled diagrams, to use technical terms and concepts which the user may not understand, to focus on what it is at the expense of what it does and to fail to separate the needs of the operator from the details which are needed to set up the device, to locate faults, to provide remedies and to provide routine maintenance. An extended booklet should have a very good index or other access system to the information. The designer is not the person to evaluate the clarity and usability of instructions, a sample of actual users will provide a much better assessment. further details are given on p. 76. The design of macro-systems The larger systems which make up communities and nations are currently in a state of flux because of the impact of technology. The provision of such a variety of telecommunication and travel facilities makes it impossible for any community however large or small to develop in isolation. The consequence is an increasingly standardised way of life or at least aspirations towards a particular way of life across the world. The differences which remain are enforced mainly by differences in average income and in style of government. Technology continues to change jobs with consequent changes in ways  of life and it also changes life-expectation which has profound effects on all communities. However, just as hardware systems are dominated by engineering thinking, macro-systems are dominated by economic thinking. There is excessive reliance on the adaptability of people who are required to adjust to whatever is dictated by economic and technological policies. Politicians in all countries would accept the proposition that the system should be designed to serve the people but whatever the political philosophy behind the system, the people always seem to be more its servants than its masters. Economic issues are real enough and it is often pointed out that politics is about priorities. The priorities are assessed on the basis of evidence and unfortunately evidence about people is not so readily quantified as evidence about financial and physical resources. The result is that systems at every level from the state to the small company are evaluated and policies are developed which are not sufficiently orientated to the needs and aspirations of the people within the system. This is a very large issue mostly beyond the scope of this book except to note that ergonomics is an exemplar of a style of thinking which is based on characteristics of people. Ergonomics can be defined as systems design with the attributes of people as the frame of reference. Although the human operator is for many purposes within ergonomics appropriately considered as a mere information processing device, any design issue must be considered in the context that these human operators are individuals and citizens within communities. What they believe, what they want, what they like, what they dislike and whether they work efficiently or not are determined by the societal context as well as by the physical environment. It is therefore appropriate to bear in mind the position and trends in human resources in the community of which the workers are members. For such macro-systems, the principle that the designer produces what he thinks the users need is being replaced by the principle that the users themselves decide what they want and the professionals assist them in designing as specified by the users. This approach generates another duty for designers and ergonomists, to present to the users an array of possible options which will aid their discussions and choices. Knowledge Demographic data Currently there are about 4.5 billion people in the world, 1 billion in the developed world and 3.5 billion in the developing world (Table 1.2). This puts a correct perspective on the contents of this book which are mainly concerned with technologically-based societies although there is a section in   Chapter 3 on ergonomics in developing countries. Most of the evidence and experience reported here has been derived from the 16% of the world population living in Europe and North America. The two worlds differ markedly in the distribution of populations, developed countries have about 65% of the population in the economically active age range from 15–64 years, about 25% under 15 and the remaining 10% in retirement. This last group is still increasing quite rapidly. The retired group is much smaller in developing countries where about 55% are in the economically active age range and more than 40% are under 15. Life expectation at  birth is about 45 years in developing countries and more than 70 years in developed countries. The longer life expectation of females is more marked in the developed countries (Table 1.3). The age distribution of the working population for two countries, one developed and one developing, which happen to have the same sized labour force is shown in fig. 1.7. West Germany has a greater proportion of people economically active but they start work later and retire earlier than do workers in Pakistan. There are about 4 million research and development scientists and engineers in the world, 3.5 million in developed countries and 0.5 million in developing countries, almost all this latter 0.5 million are in Asia, the numbers in Latin America and Africa are very small (UNESCO statistical year book). The differences in various amenities are shown in Table 1.4. The energy consumption is about 100 units (kg of coal equivalent per person) in a developing country and about 10000 units in Europe and the U.S.A. This is affected by the fact that developing countries mostly have tropical or sub-tropical climates while developed countries are in the temperate zone, but there is a similar difference of about 100: 1 in income per head between the rich countries and the poor countries (The Economist — the world in figures ). Within any country the Human Resource situation can be approached by this basic division into the ‘economically active’ and others who, for one reason or another, are supported by the workers. Those supported include young children, students, retired persons, seriously disabled persons, people living on independent means and, somewhat unfairly, women doing domestic work. The numbers and proportions of those economically active in a sample of developed countries are shown in Table 1.5. It will be seen that in each country this economically active group is about half the total population. for males the proportion is usually about 55% and for females about 45%. A very large economy such as the U.S.A. has more than 100 million workers, the large European countries have about 25 million workers. Japan is about half-way between with about 60 million workers. The smaller European countries have less than 5 million workers. Workers in this sense are a country's Human Resource which is deployed for the benefit of the community generally. The primary need of any person or population is water and food and in primitive societies the supply of these commodities will absorb the effort of almost all the workforce. As food supplies improve it is possible to move some of the Human Resource into construction and manufacturing. In the U.K. the concentration on manufacturing in the nineteenth century was balanced by the importing of food. France, by contrast, had a smaller manufacturing base but remained self-sufficient in food so that the dramatic fall of proportion of   workers in primary industries did not occur until after World War II (fig. 1.8). In the U.S.A. even at the time of President Lincoln about 1860 there was serious debate as to whether the economy should remain agricultural or whether there should be a positive attempt to develop manufacturing. In India the total population is currently about 665 million of which 244 million (37%) are economically active. 153 million are engaged in agriculture and fishing, that is 63% of the working population (I.L.O. data). In the U.K. less than 3% of the working population are now employed in agriculture, in most advanced countries this figure is now well below 10%, as illustrated in fig. 1.9. This also shows that the predominant way of earning a living in a developed country  now is in the service industries. fig. 1. 10 shows the current distribution of U.K. Human Resources. The former basic industries — mining, agriculture, construction and manufacturing — now employ about a third of the total workforce. In manufacturing between 1980 and 1985 output measured per person-hour or per person employed increased by about 25% but the total   output remained roughly constant, that is the manufacturing labour force is still falling rapidly (Economic Trends 1985). Some consequences of these trends are discussed in more detail in Singleton and Crawley (1980). From the end of World War II to the early 1970s there was virtually full employment in developed countries, but in the last ten years the position has changed considerably as shown in fig. 1.11. Apart from Ireland it would seem that the smaller European countries have contained the situation better than have the larger ones, but this is an artefact since other small countries such as Belgium, Netherlands and Denmark follow the same trend as the larger countries. It should be noted that the trend of an increase in unemployment from about 5% to about 10% over ten years is sufficiently general to indicate that it is not a function of the style of government. These data for countries do not reveal considerable underlying differences within countries. In England for example, unemployment in the North is twice that in the South-East, and in most European countries there are lesser employment opportunities in rural   areas as opposed to urban areas resulting in depopulation of the countryside and an increase in the size of cities. This trend is even more marked in developing countries. Human resource utilisation This brief excursion into the complex field of labour statistics is intended to illustrate the following points which are relevant to the theory and practice of ergonomics. 1. Since the beginnings of technology, now about 200 years ago in the case of the U.K., the labour market has been in a continuous state of flux. 2. The overall shift has not been so much from agriculture to manufacturing but rather a steady rise in the service industries, and a fall in primary industries. 3. The manufacturing labour force in developed countries is now in   accelerating decline as productivity and the investment per worker increases, this is resulting in a further increase in service industries and an increase in unemployment. 4. There are considerable differences between the problems of so-called developed and developing countries. This dichotomy is useful but is an oversimplification; degree of development as measured for example by income per head or technology utilisation is best described by a continuous scale. A particular country is at one point on that scale at one time by one measure. 5. Accelerating technological development has pushed the government of every country off-balance in the past decade. This is illustrated in developed countries by the increase in unemployment which is fundamentally a failure to properly utilise the total Human Resource. In developing countries there are many contrasts in that high technology (airlines, nuclear power, information systems; etc.) exists in small pockets alongside the still unresolved traditional problems of inadequate nutrition and health. 6. Ergonomics also is pushed off-balance because the variety of human work increases in parallel with technology. The traditional problems of heat stress and physical work-load remain, particularly in the developing countries, while new problems appear as more complex systems are designed requiring new operator roles and more serious consequences of inadequate performance. 7. Nevertheless technology now provides the possibility of allocating high energy and repetitive work to machines so that the typical man at work is in a supervising rather than an operating mode. 8. When machines provide the energy and set the pace the objective of the operator (and consequently of ergonomics) shifts from rates and amounts to quality, reliability and safety. 9. The general concept of work is also shifting from man-machine interaction to man-man interaction with machines as aids. 10. Many of the policy issues are mistakenly addressed in that there is too much emphasis on finding uses for what technology can provide rather than driving technology by the needs of people. The behavioural specialists are responsible for providing data and attitudes for the policy-makers which should redress the balance. 11. The economic concept of work is too narrow for ergonomics. There are many ergonomics problems in the non-economically active half of the population. If ergonomics is regarded as the science of work then work must be defined as purposeful activity rather than merely as activity for economic gain. 12. This brief statistical survey reveals the scale and diversity of problems  associated with the mind at work. This is daunting but it is also challenging and stimulating. Principles, methods and procedures Education, work and leisure Virtually all human societies have developed the principle that the pattern of personal activity should change with age. In the early years there is extensive leisure devoted to play in which the basic manipulative and social skills are developed. There is also more formalised learning through an educational system which concentrates mainly on information processing: reading, writing and arithmetic and more elaborate symbolic and organisational skills. When the individual has matured he usually accepts responsibilities for child-rearing and for work. In his declining years the proportion of leisure increases again, sometimes suddenly when he ‘retires’ but preferably gradually as his energies diminish. Thus we can normally expect a mature mind in a person at work and although developmental processes of growth and senescence are of some interest, studies of the person working usually assume that we are dealing with a mind which is equipped with the basic skills derived from play and education but one which has not been subject to any serious diminution of capacity. This is not to suggest that the age variable can be ignored. It is accepted that ageing is a continuous process from birth to death and there are considerable differences between the average worker in the 25–45 age group and the apparent equivalent in the 46–65 age group. The age distribution of a particular workforce can materially affect the problems of work design and training. Correspondingly it must be recognised that an individual has entered work with a particular educational standard. During his working years he has considerable leisure which is bound to have some interactions with work. for approximate computational purposes it is normally assumed in the western world that a full working year is no more than 200 man-days. The remaining 165 days disappear in week-ends, holidays and absence for training, sickness and so on. There is also a widespread convention that the working day should be 7–8 hours, that is about a third of the total day. Thus the full-time worker is in fact working for less than 200% of the total time. The distinction between work and leisure and between work and education is an arbitrary one from the point of view of stress on the person. for example, many city office workers regard the main stress of the day as the difficulties in getting from home to work and back again with work as a relatively relaxed period between. Even more strikingly, some working mothers regard a period  at work, particularly if it is part-time, as a welcome respite from the great variety of stresses arising in looking after a home and children. Some of the most exacting university degrees, such as those in the biological and physical sciences demand a level of work load from the conscientious student which is greater than that expected in most occupations. One would expect self-selected leisure activities to be different from and complementary to those at work. for example, the manual labourer is unlikely to take up an energetic hobby such as cycling and he is likely to spend his holidays relaxing at the seaside rather than walking in the mountains. The young office worker in a safe sedentary job may well take up rock-climbing as a dangerous, physically exacting antidote for the dull occupational part of his life. Although it would be convenient scientifically and sometimes personally to regard work as a separable part of a human life this separation is never entirely valid and can be misleading. The mind at work is part of the person at work and that same person has many other activities in the past and the future and in parallel which have their interactions with the work. In system jargon, the working world is one sub-system within a complete set of sub-systems which make up the total environment or life space of the individual. To study one sub-system in detail without regard to interactions with the others is usually inadequate, but on the other hand, to try to examine simultaneously the whole complex of sub-systems is to invite disorientation. The remedy is a compromise in which activity in one sub-system such as that which incorporates work is studied but in the context of sensitivity to external influences. Systems theory can be applied in many ways to behaviour at work. The two main theories emphasise respectively interactions with other people;socio-technical systems and interactions with machines;man-machine systems . Socio-technical systems In the period of technological innovation following the second world war a group of human relations specialists, working from the Tavistock Institute in London, noted that the social behaviour of workers and their organisational structure in groups and teams was influenced by the technical systems associated with that work. The first studies were in coal mines where there were different degrees of mechanisation associated with the same type of working group and it was also possible to distinguish different social organisations working in similar technical environments (Trist and Murray, 1948). Some groups were organised so that each worker carried out an independent part-task with little reference to  the total task, whereas in other cases each worker had a commitment to the total task and carried out various sub-tasks in this context. This latter, labelled a ‘composite’ group as distinct from a conventional group, had greater productive achievement and lower absenteeism. More generally, the effectiveness of the production system depends on the way the social system is adjusted to the technical requirements (Emery and Trist, 1960). Technological decisions necessarily dominate the design of the system in the sense of how the collective task of transforming inputs into outputs is achieved. Nevertheless, the social system which integrates the activities of the workers and provides the flexibility for relating separate tasks to the needs of the production system as a whole must be considered. Hence the concept of the socio-technical system where technical and social requirements are harmonised into one effective organisation. The organisation, like a living organism, maintains a dynamic equilibrium with the environment. Thus it is an open system rather than a closed one and its behaviour cannot be understood by simply looking at the relationship between inputs and outputs. The adaptability of the enterprise may lie in providing appropriate outputs to match the changes of the market from relatively stable physical inputs or may lie in providing a fixed output with changing sources of inputs. In either case there is no fixed relationship between physical inputs and outputs, the system responds to the environment. It follows that one of the main tasks of management is to control the interaction with the environment. The implication also is that, if management has got the technology right within the system design, it should then attend to the environment and should allow, within the internal activities, scope for self-organising into autonomous groups. If, on the contrary, there is a rigid internal separation between the roles of setting standards and meeting standards then conflict has been built into the system (Klein, 1979). This approach can legitimately be regarded as the parent of organisation theory (p. 143), and of the ‘quality of working life’(QWOL), sometimes also called the ‘job design’ movement (Davis and Cherns 1975, Davis and Taylor 1972). It provides considerable insight into the eventual difficulties of the early twentieth century mass production methods as exemplified by the moving belt type assembly line. On the other hand it does not provide remedies for production problems which can be applied as standard recipes or procedures. Again, because of the elusive if all-pervading nature of the theme, it is difficult to formalise into legislation on humanising work as several European countries have discovered by experience. It has emerged in many countries that, as the standard of living rises, it is more and more difficult to run an autocratic production system using the  indigenous labour force. The first management remedy is to import a more docile labour force from another country or from a less developed part of the same country. This is only a temporary solution and there have been many attempts to organise more humane working systems. The danger here is that, although things may be pleasant for the workers, the incentive to work very hard is not so direct and it may not be possible to maintain a competitive position in comparison with the same industry in a developing country. Hence a further development of research on work motivation (p. 144). Taking a more global view, one opinion is that the manufacturing industries should indeed move to developing countries whilst the advanced industries orientate their labour forces toward information and other service industries. There is a trend in this direction (Singleton and Crawley, 1980), but, of course, it is not the complete answer. There are other complications. Robots, for example, are best suited for the highly repetitive manufacturing tasks which are the ones least suited to human efforts so that robotisation can cure some of the ills of mass production. Looking at the environment, as market demands become more sophisticated so there is a need for operator flexibility in production system outputs, which has its counterpart in greater variety of work within the production system (Lupton and Tanner, 1980). Socio-technical system theory has been highly fruitful in generating other academic lines of development: organisation theory, quality of working life concepts and work motivation, in stimulating many innovations in production organisation and in provoking governments to consider legislation in matters such as humanisation of work (Germany) and co-determination at work (Sweden). Paradoxically it has not developed a formalised set of principles or immutable knowledge which could, for example, be structured into an academic text-book about socio-technical systems. The problem seems to be that it is fundamentally about attitudes to work and such attitudes are subject to an inextricable and non-monotonic range of influences not only from work itself, with all the pressures of technological change, but also from prevailing economic, social and cultural changes in the community generally. Man-machine systems Work is very rarely performed by a man without the aid of some machinery and correspondingly machines rarely function for very long without human intervention. Man and machine can be regarded as sub-systems each making a distinctive contribution towards the achievement of the purposes of the working system. The system itself can be described as a set of functions necessary for the overall purpose. The emphasis on defining the system in terms of its purposes or objectives and analysing it in terms of its functions are the characteristics of the systems approach. It follows that at some stage in the design process it should be useful to consider how the various functions are most effectively allocated — to man or to machine. Fig. 1.2 shows the essentials of the system design process but since feed-back paths are omitted this figure does not indicate either the repetition and iteration which goes on in operational design or the different possible priorities and variability in the order of decision-making. The engineering emphasis will be on the search for mechanisms which can most effectively perform the required functions with the human operator in a support role undertaking functions which are not readily mechanised. The ergonomics emphasis will be on the human operator as the navigator moving towards the system objectives supported by various mechanisms. One neutral viewpoint is to consider formally the relative advantages and limitations of men and machines. These can be listed (Table 1.6) on what is called a ‘Fitts List’ after Paul Fitts who originally proposed this approach (Fitts, 1951). At the time it was hoped that eventually it would be possible to refine the quantitative distinctions between the performance of men and machines so that allocation of function decisions would be unambiguous (Wuffeck and Zeitlin, 1962), but this has not happened. The reason seems to be that men and machines are fundamentally complementary rather than comparable, this point was originally made by Jordan (1963). If a required function can be specified precisely then a mechanism can be designed to perform it. The reasons for incorporating men in systems are to do with properties such as flexibility and adaptability which by their nature are not specifiable in numerical terms. Incidentally this clarifies why the man-machine system is such a potent combination. Each provides attributes which are not easily available from the other. A man without the support of machinery is physically weak and informationally slow. A machine without human guidance is inflexible and highly limited in recognition and learning facilities. Nevertheless it is not common practice to consider the man-machine allocation of function as an isolated design decision. More usually the allocation emerges from a pattern of related decisions including what can be reliably and economically achieved by hardware and software, what the allocated tasks look like as integrated jobs for the human operators, the skills and traditions of the available work-force, the importance of safety and reliability and so on(Table 1.7). As potential functional weaknesses emerge during the design appraisal further consideration is given to what functions might be allocated to the man or machine to provide greater mutual support. The result of selective competent design along these lines should be a system with optimal man-machine allocation given the technological state of the art and a comprehensive sensitivity to the feasibility of the human tasks. A detailed discussion of the historical development of the allocation of function concept is given in Singleton (1974). This approach contravenes currently fashionable Human Factors methodology that there should be a formal attempt to carry out man-machine allocation. Operational experience of real systems design reinforces doubts about the allocation of function concept as a basis for a unitary systematic procedure. The paradigm illustrated in fig. 1.12 has the virtue of simplicity. Like many block diagrams this conceals the practical problems. from such a simple diagram it is easy to assume that all the thinking is done in terms of functions. This cannot be sustained because the only way to validate task analysis is to switch from functional concepts to behavioural concepts and the only way to validate hardware concepts is to switch to thinking in terms of specific mechanisms. Thus, allocation of function requires a continuous juggling of functional, mechanistic and behavioural approaches. In addition to the separate criteria related to men and mechanisms there are others to do with information acquisition, storage and presentation focussing on the interface design which has its own design criteria. Note that a real problem usually involves men rather than one man and thus there are extensive man-man communication issues where few of the functions could conceivably be allocated to non-human mechanisms. In a military command and control situation these will typically be sub-system operators, supervisors and customers using the output (p. 243). Even when design attention can be focussed on the interaction within a single man-machine sub-system it emerges that the man may have very different roles in setting-up, operation and maintenance of his particular machine and each role may require separate man-machine allocation considerations. A designer is often restricted by various mandatory requirements based for example on imagined safeguards against accidents. There are also unspecifiable but none the less potent political restrictions, some from within the organisation, some from outside it. For example the use of nuclear power in either the military or the civil sense is regarded as qualitatively different from non-nuclear power in its safety, control and management requirements. Design is never an isolated logical process. There is a legacy of experience from earlier designs which inevitably guide and inhibit a new design. The shifts  of allocation of function from this point of view are illustrated in Fig. 1.13. Swain and Wohl (1961) argue that the man-machine concept is oversimplified, it should be man-machine procedures allocation and also that prime equipment should be separated from check-out equipment (Fig. 1. 14) In equipment involving advanced technology the allocation of the control function is between the on-line operator and the designer. The latter builds decisions into the hardware and software based on his knowledge of the limitations of the mechanisms. High technology can also be used to provide the operator with flexibility in the allocation of functions, he can make his own  decision about when to control manually and when to leave it to the mechanisms. This is called supervisory control (Fig. 1. 15) It emerges from the above discussion that man-machine allocation of function is at best an oversimplification and it may lead to the neglect of some key features of human performance. Only the human operator can cope with the concept of purposes and goals and more particularly with their modification in the light of changing circumstances. Knowledge of circumstances is communicated partly by information exchange across man-machine interfaces   but also by verbal exchanges between people. These verbal exchanges can be factual but can also be diffuse in the sharing of attitudes, beliefs, urgencies, doubts and so on. These features are just as important to efficient performance as are data about plant functions but they cannot be incorporated in a man-machine allocation process. Implicit in the attempt to complete a systematic man-machine function allocation is the principle that some trade-off is possible. More attention to the hardware and information presentation will yield improved operator support whereas more attention to operator training will minimise the difficulties of interpreting information presentations and thereby making full use of machines (Singleton, 1967b). These alternative procedures are summarised by the expressions ‘fitting the man to the job’ or ‘fitting the job to the man’. The systems approach indicates that the two should be balanced on technical, economic and behavioural criteria (Table 1.8.). To proceed systematically, both require that there should be the greatest possible understanding of what the man is required to do. The design of the man-machine interface must develop from an understanding of how the man is expected to interact with the machine and correspondingly the design of selection, allocation and training schemes depends on knowing what is required of the operator. The study of demands on the operator requires task analysis. In this context the term ‘machine’ is used as shorthand for the total hardware and software system or, in other terminology, the plant. For information systems the allocation of function and interface design issues merge into the procedure for considering the required points of human intervention in the total information network. From this point of view the allocation of function and interface design are one core design activity based on the man-machine concept. Task analysis Terminology In the context of systems design, task analysis has become the generic term applicable to the field study of human performance. This is somewhat confusing because the centre of interest may be jobs or skills rather than tasks, and strictly the procedure is often more accurately described as one of synthesis rather than analysis. For example, a designer may build up a sequence of actions which an operator must follow in order to cause his product to function properly — he has synthesised the task from a knowledge of how the machine or other product was designed to function. Nevertheless, such activity comes under the heading of task analysis (Fig. 1.16). Tasks represent the human contribution to system performance but for   purposes of personnel selection, training and allocation, it is necessary for tasks to be separated or combined into jobs. For systems which have evolved on the basis of operational experience rather than those which have been created by a formal design process, job analysis rather than task analysis may be the starting point of human factors studies. The ergonomist will begin his investigation by the consideration of what the personnel actually do in their jobs which have emerged and been refined by practice and personal preference rather than design. A task is usually considered to be an integrated sub-activity with a particular  purpose as distinct from a job which is a particular kind of work carried out by an individual in a system context. Jobs are collections of tasks or parts of tasks. Occupation is the wider term which covers a range of jobs and the career of an individual in a community context. For example, management is an occupation, a production manager is a job, and work scheduling is a task. These distinctions are demonstrated in Fig. 1. 17. Another source of ambiguity is that task analysis is often used as a generic term covering any study and description relating to people at work. Sometimes this is no more than a description of what has to be done but sometimes it incorporates how the operator does it or should do it. Strictly, this latter should be called a skill description rather than a task description. In principle a task description is not necessarily an activity of   a person, the task might possibly be completed automatically. There is no such ambiguity about a skills analysis which is always person-orientated and not just system-orientated. This confusion of terms obscures even further the difficult technical problems of moving from a task description to a skill description. The task description should emerge logically from the system design and more particularly from the allocation of functions. There is no such deductive way of getting at the skill description. This can only be done by studying operators. There are two problems in analysing tasks: one is to acquire the evidence on which to base the task description, the other is to record what has been found out in a way such that other people, notably the interface designers and the personnel specialists, can use it effectively to assist in their work. It aids clarity   to reserve the term analysis to mean the acquisition of evidence and description to mean the presentation of the evidence. The test of a task description is: does it indicate a necessary function within the system performance? The test of a skill description is: does it indicate how an individual goes about a task, does it allow for individual differences such as those between a highly skilled operator and a mediocre one? For routine low-level tasks there may be no great distinction between a task description and skill description but for high-level tasks there will be a considerable difference. Skills analysis is an attempt to get at what is going on in the operator's mind. For a repetitive task there may be comparatively little going on in the mind which emerges at the level of consciousness. For example, the assembly of a set of components will be carried out by an experienced operator without thinking about it. He may be surprised when the analyst reveals the complexities of his hand movements and finger manipulations. The only way he can recall what he does is by doing it, literally ‘going through the motions’. On the other hand, for a task such as fault diagnosis he will be thinking about it in various structured ways which he can reveal by talking about it and exploring verbally why he looks at particular indications or takes particular actions. Human tasks and the purposes of task analysis are too varied for there to be one standard procedure for either analysis or description. Analysing a task where the main requirement is speed of response is different from analysing a task in which problem solving is required. A task analysis in the context of ‘fitting the man to the job’ can be very different from one designed to assist in ‘fitting the job to the man’. As mentioned above the two extremes of human tasks are the procedure and the diagnosis. Procedural task analysis is usually initiated on the basis of technology and logic by the designer. A task has been allocated to the human operator and what he must do is a function of the needs of the hardware. Such tasks may be in operation or maintenance. In either case the designer writes down the sequence of actions which must be taken coupled with informational indications of what should be happening. For example, in starting up a machine or system (Table 1.9). Effectively the operating instructions are the task description. It is, of course, desirable to check that nothing has been forgotten and to this end it is usual to ask an operator to go through the designed procedure while observing what he does and also observing that the system performs as expected. This may be done on the machine if it is available, or on a simulator or on some kind of mock-up of what the system will be like. This is known as the talk through or walk through method of task analysis. The difference is only in the kind of task and size of hardware. For example, in the case of starting up a machine at a control panel the operator will be given the instructions and   asked to provide a verbal commentary as he actuates the various controls and checks the various indications, this is a ‘talk through’. On the other hand, a maintenance check of a series of related machines may involve moving to and fro between them while activating this and that, this is a ‘walk through’. The operating instructions/task description can be modified if the analysis reveals any problems from the operator's point of view; anything which the designer may have omitted or any difficulties the operator has in moving around, manipulating controls or checking information presentations. Ultimately, the machine layout or interface design may be modified to make the operating instructions easier to follow. For complex processes the procedures can include stages of diagnosis (see below) because the operator has to monitor and interpret what is happening in the plant. In particular he is aware of various conditional constraints which form a multidimensional envelope, and whatever happens he must keep the plant state within this envelope. Thus he must have extensive knowledge of the parameters and their relationship, e.g. pressure/temperature curves, together with the safety limits of each parameter. Sometimes the safety limits are fixed, sometimes they are conditional on the state of other variables or plant, sometimes they are merely probabilistic. This is an extremely difficult task, and   the operator requires various aids such as alarm systems and automatic cut-out devices which are also effectively monitoring the parameters approaching limits (see alarm systems p. 225). Diagnostic task analysis is even more complex and may indeed be virtually impossible to complete. It depends on the complexity of the task faced by the operator. The range of diagnostic task difficulties for a control centre is shown in Table 1.10. The operator is assumed to be reacting to a situation in a  control room, containing a great variety of dials, charts, and computer driven displays together with the controls needed to take action in any part of the system. The simplest thing that can go wrong is the failure of one mechanism such as a pump, valve or thermostat. This will be indicated in the control room by changes in pressures and temperatures which the skilled operator will trace readily to the particular failure. Usually there will be some redundancy in the system so that other mechanisms can take over. If the hiatus is serious he may have to shut down all or part of the system or it may trip automatically and the operator's task is to observe/control the shut-down to a quiescent state. The worst possible condition that can be envisaged is one in which there is an expert in the plant aiming to do the maximum possible damage and aware of the indications of his actions which are transmitted to the operator — this is not quite science-fiction, it could happen as a form of sabotage,. A much less demanding condition is one in which the saboteur is attempting to damage a plant about which he has little or no technical knowledge. However, the difficult condition which requires the most consideration because it is not that unlikely is one in which the operator is faced with a situation where various things have gone wrong naturally or by inadvertent human interference in the plant or instrumentation. His diagnostic task is somehow to differentiate between the information he is receiving which is false and that which is valid and follow this by the selection of a remedial strategy. There are further complications in that, because of the plant failures, not all the standard range of remedial actions will be available. Some automatic reactions may be taking place which might help or hinder, and he must also stay within the mandatory operating instructions. Unfortunately, because such situations are created by combinations of events the number of possibilities is very large and it would be prohibitively tedious to enumerate all of them. A complete task description is impossible and the appropriate preparation for the operator is not in direct training but rather in education/understanding of the system and the way it operates. He must attempt his diagnosis by returning to the relevant scientific and technological principles. How he does this in general terms is illustrated in Fig. 1. 18. The task analysis will take the form of a consideration of the most likely or most dangerous failure and combinations of failures and the ways in which these will appear as indications in the control room. This should occur not only at the design stage but also as experience develops in operating the plant and data on actual failures and failure rates become available. Such task analysis can only be carried out to some cost-effective limit beyond which the skilled operator must be trusted to get things right by applying his broad expertise. This is not as much of a gamble as it may appear at first sight, there are general principles of how to cope with the system, some  of which can be built into automatic safeguards and some of which can be conveyed to the operator as knowledge and instructions. In serious cases the aim is to shut down the system safely. In less serious cases the operator may for a while maintain certain parameters at appropriate levels without diverting his attention to detailed diagnosis, this is called function control . In dealing with lower technology or less formal system design, there is a range of relatively standard ways of finding out about operator performance   by studying it directly. Task analysis, in common with every other perceptual process, is a matter of setting up mechanisms for categorisation and filtering. The analyst is faced with an activity which is continuous, homogeneous and full of detail, some of which is significant and relevant and some of which is of no consequence. For example, the worker may pause at one point and scratch his nose, this may indicate that a critical decision is being made or it may indicate simply that his nose was itching. The art of task analysis always is to select what does matter, reject what does not matter and separate into categories or stages something which seems at first sight to have no internal boundaries. As already mentioned what is significant for a task description leading to an interface design may be different from what is significant for personnel allocation and training but the available procedures are the same. The acquisition of evidence and the presentation of evidence are linked, of course, in that it may be necessary to decide what should be presented before it is acquired although more usually it is a matter of presenting what can be acquired. The range of human tasks has already been indicated by the description of the extremes of procedural and diagnostic task analysis. The simplest kind of human task, and the most straightforward to observe and analyse, is that in which the operator goes through a standard sequence of actions. These are still common in industrial assembly and inspection tasks. The most complex and most difficult to analyse are tasks requiring original thinking often with many apparently random alternations between deduction and induction, this occurs in fault diagnosis tasks. There are at least two dimensions of complexity: the kind of task and whether the analysis focuses on material, information or people. These are illustrated in Table 1. 11. Each cell in this table represents an enormous variety of human work but this is hardly surprising since the total of eighteen cells covers all human work. There is a variety of task analysis methods available and the selection of an appropriate set varies with the kind of work (as represented by these cells) and also with the purposes of the analysis. Table 1.12 gives examples of kinds of task and the probably appropriate method of task analysis for each cell in Table 1.11. It should be emphasised that this is only a tentative illustration. The method used for a particular analysis depends on a great variety of factors including the analyst's expertise, the time available, the situations accessible for study, the related information already available, the purpose of the analysis and so on. Task analysis by observation Process charts . Accurate observation of what a person is doing is not easy. The observer needs some discipline which ensures that he really does   focus on the detail and separates the action into a coherent sequence. The required discipline is provided by the attempt to complete a chart such as a flow process chart using the A.S.M.E. symbols. These were originally standardised by the American Society of Mechanical Engineers. The symbols and an illustration of a flow process chart are shown in Fig. 1.19. It is assumed that whatever an operator is doing can be classified into one of five categories: operation, inspection, transport, delay and storage. Delay occurs when the operator is doing nothing — usually waiting for a machine to complete a sub-task — it differs from storage where there has been a particular decision to put something aside. For example, storage for a hand implies some static work — the operator is holding something or exerting a force of some kind although there is no resulting movement. Process charts may concentrate on material, operator actions or the events in the process. These are known respectively as material-type, man-type or process-type charts. More details of these charts and how to complete them are given in ILO (1979). The same symbols are used for a two-handed process chart in which a detailed description of what each hand is doing separately is provided (Fig.  1.20). The meaning of the symbols changes somewhat because the separation of events is much more detailed. The same symbols can also be made to follow the concurrent behaviour of members of a team (Chapanis, 1959). Note that, apart from the inspection category, the emphasis is entirely on what the operator does. Little attention is paid to the input side as distinct from the output side, the sensory information and feed-back which the operator is using to control what he is doing is neglected. This is appropriate enough for highly repetitive routine tasks because, as mentioned earlier, the operator is probably proceeding with little conscious attention and the limitation on performance is in the speed of the action rather than in the informational control. To broaden the emphasis on a two-handed process chart it is possible to add   another column labelled ‘attention’ or ‘sensory activity’and to try to describe human activity in these areas at particular points in the sequence. This goes beyond direct observations and requires some inference or speculation on the part of the observer. Finer analysis of hand movements is possible using classifications such as Therbligs (Shaw, 1952), or Methods-Time-Measurement symbols (Maynard et al ., 1956). Analysis at this level of detail is not usually attempted by direct observation but rather by film or video analysis. Sequence charts . These are similar to flow process charts except that no standard symbols are used, the chart is simply a list of the actions the operator takes but there may well be additional columns referring to the events which occur and the consequent information which appears. A sequence chart is more appropriate for a routine interaction with a machine rather than a physical manipulation of objects. An example is given in Table 1. 1 3. Sequence charts are particularly useful for the study and description of starting up and shutting down procedures. They form the basis for procedural training. Link design charts . This is a detailed sequence chart orientated more towards operator choice of actions and correspondingly relevant to the study of interface design rather than training (Singleton, 1964). It is assumed that for every action the operator has a purpose, the choice of the particular action at the particular time or point in the sequence is triggered by some other event, usually the successful completion of an action is indicated by a particular information presentation which also is noted on the chart. The chart is particularly useful for detecting when information about action completion is not available and when an action is required which is not triggered by information from the situation. That is, the operator has to depend on his memory (which is unreliable). An example is given in Table 1. 14. Flow charts . These are more graphical presentations as distinct from verbal listings. They are used to indicate the spatial location and separation of events which are integral parts of the same process. An illustration of a flow chart is given in Fig. 1.21. It is possible to obtain a kind of flow chart automatically as it were by using successive photographs of operator positions on the same photographic plate. More usually, this is done by attaching lights to the wrists or to other parts of the body, if the light is flashing at a known frequency the relative time of particular positions as well as the sequence can be measured. This is called a chronocyclograph . Flow charts are a useful record of a process but are not  particularly suited as a basis for analysis which might lead to improved job design or training. On the other hand, they can clearly indicate differences in ways of doing something. Block diagrams . These are particularly useful to describe situations where events occur in parallel or in patterns rather than in a single series. The block diagram is highly versatile as a spatial representation of any process at any level, that is the same process can be represented by one block or by very many blocks which provide more detail. The art of useful block diagram production is to select the appropriate level of detail. Most people find such diagrams much easier to understand than paragraphs of explanatory prose but the flexibility itself can lead to the difficulties illustrated in Fig. 1.22. It is important that blocks are at about the same level of complexity within one diagram. Blocks may represent physical entities, topics, concepts, decisions, actions or processes. If these are mixed in the same diagram the distinctions between categories should be indicated by using differently shaped blocks. Many of the figures in this chapter illustrate this convention. Homogeneity is also desirable in the meaning of lines and arrows. A line may indicate a causal link but simple cause-effect relationships are destroyed if there are feed-back lines. Usually the line represents the flow of something but that something might be material, energy, information or time but again these should not be mixed on the same diagram unless differently coded lines are used. It is usually possible to invert a diagram so that blocks and lines are interchanged. One of the more subtle failures is to confuse a block diagram with its inverse. An inverted block diagram can be a path-node diagram. The advantage of these is that the length of the path can be used to indicate time taken. This is the basis of ‘critical-path analysis’ where such a network can be analysed. The shortest path through a network is the minimum time in which the whole process represented could be completed. The longest sequence of required activities is the time it will take if no adjustments are made. An optimum path can be selected and other activities adjusted to phase in with those on this ‘critical path’. There are formal techniques of network analysis which occasionally prove useful; for example, in identifying equivalent diagrams or ways of simplifying diagrams (Battersby, 1970). Algorithm charts . These are a particular form of block diagram where the emphasis is on binary choices. Again there can be concentration on events or on operator decisions. In the latter case these are usually an oversimplification because there is an underlying assumption that decisions are being made in a simple logical sequence. In practice, the operator jumps forwards and backwards within the pattern indicated on the chart rechecking some decisions and anticipating others. Nevertheless, by relating required information to decision points any lack of information can be revealed. It invariably turns out that an operator makes a series of decisions partly on the basis of what is currently displayed (on-line information ) and partly on the basis of other material obtained from his knowledge of the system performance, his briefing and his operating instructions (off-line information ). Adequate on-line and off-line information is essential for apposite decision-making. Fig. 1.23 shows such a chart. F.A.S. T. diagram . Function Analysis System Technique was developed by Bytheway (1977) within value engineering. It imposes useful discipline on the production of a functional diagram in two ways. Within each block the function should be described by a verb and a noun. The functions are arranged in a sequence such that an arrow to the right on any line indicates HOW? and an arrow to the left indicates WHY? If these criteria cannot be met then either the functions are in the wrong order or some are missing. The diagram should be produced by writing each function on a card, the cards are then arranged to meet the criteria. Unfortunately the resulting diagram is not so easy to interpret as are some of the other forms of chart. In particular there is no obvious starting or ending point and the lines do not indicate a sequence. Fig. 1.24 shows an example. General functional diagrams . As a Task Description, a block diagram is intended to illustrate the dynamic behaviour of the system with emphasis on human interactions within the system. For some purposes it is appropriate to use blocks and lines to indicate the flow of energy or material and to indicate all the ways in which the human operator can affect this flow. This is not a performance diagram but a potential performance diagram (Fig. 1.25). For other purposes it is appropriate to concentrate on a specific sequential task and illustrate the order of events involving human actions (e.g. Figs. 1. 19 and 1.20). If a particular dimension (usually left to right or up to down) indicates a time scale as well as sequence this is called a time-line diagram . The blocks may even be omitted to further emphasise the relative timing of events. (Fig. 1.26). Alternatively if the process is highly complex the emphasis may be on the pattern of events as indicated by a network of blocks with a specialist symbol indicating the many points within the system for which information for the operator might appear and another symbol for points where he can interfere in the system dynamics (Fig. 1.27). Task analysis by discussion Observation of operator performance within many high technology systems reveals nothing more than a person sitting at a desk scanning various kinds of displays at intervals and just occasionally picking up a telephone, making a note in a log-book or manipulating a control. In such situations, the task analysis requires extensive discussion rather than observation. Such discussions will centre on the operators themselves but may also involve others such as the management, the training officers, the safety specialists and the  system designers. There will often be complications in that there can be two or more operators working simultaneously with overlapping tasks. The supervisor may also monitor the same information or may have his own separate displays or both. In such a team operation there will normally be a clear standard mandatory difference of responsibility but in practice what they actually do can overlap and overlap differently for different teams. Inevitably, discussion with different individuals about a particular task will yield very   different versions of what is being done or should be done. If there is a written version of what ought to be being done this is a useful basic document. However the supervisor will point out that things have changed since that was produced and he will have his own view of the essentials of the task. The operators themselves will again have a different version. The differences will be   mainly in emphasis on what is important central activity and what is peripheral. Even between operators carrying out what is ostensibly the same task there will be discrepancies, particularly if the discussion extends from what is required to the way these requirements are met. Similarly the specialists, the training officers, task designers and safety officers will have their own version structured in terms of the particular difficulties they have had in their specific contributions to the task performance. Finally, task descriptions differ with the personal biases of analysts and the reasons why they are conducting the analysis. However, in spite of all these sources of ambiguity the comprehensive task description is the essential starting point for most human factors work. An approach structured by a particular procedure is of considerable assistance in reducing ambiguity and ensuring that the result is comprehensive. The approach might consist of any one or any combination of the following techniques. Responsibility charts . A useful starting point for the study of any system is a responsibility chart. This can indicate not only the hierarchy but also the different levels of modelling the system. Normally, the operators closest to the plant will have the most detailed information and this gets condensed or reduced as one moves up the hierarchy. For example in a power station the desk operator will monitor the detail of the plant performance, the supervisor will have more summarised information and greater contact with the national grid, while the station manager's on-line information about the plant is presented on one or at the most two dials in his office which indicate station output. A responsibility chart can indicate not only decisions and duties but also the information needed to discharge these duties (Table 1. 1 5). Although it is usual to model responsibilities in terms of a hierarchical tree there are bound to be overlaps between what appear to be different levels of the hierarchy. These shared or duplicated responsibilities are unavoidable and often in fact are desirable because the process is one of mutual monitoring which usually improves reliability. Occasionally overlap may have the opposite effect due to the ‘falling between two stools’ phenomenon, two operators at the same level or at different levels may each assume that the other has taken a particular action which they both know is required. The remedy is adequate information feed-back and continuous checking but the need for this may not    be obvious from the chart because the areas of overlap are difficult to illustrate. It makes for much neater charting to assume that there are no overlaps but this defeats one of the main purposes of the chart. Hence the most comprehensive and useful charts often have many irregular comments, asterisks, footnotes, directing arrows and so on, which at first sight detract from the clarity of the presentation. Hierarchical Analysis . Tasks, in common with responsibilities, are susceptible to subdivision at different levels. A useful way of describing a complex task is to separate it into sub-tasks and further separate these sub-tasks into even smaller units. This provides a very clear picture of the total activity although the order of doing things may not be obvious. Such an hierarchical table (Fig. 1.28) can be supplemented by lists or sequences of operations which define a plan or a subroutine within a total task. Correspondingly, a tree or network of operations can define a pattern of decision-making. This technique, originally developed by Annett et al (1971), has been used extensively as a basis for training and retraining requirements (Duncan, 1975, Shepherd and Duncan, 1980), and also for the study of job satisfaction (Crawley and Spurgeon, 1979). For a particular system there may be many different but equally valid ways of separating tasks into sub-tasks depending on the relative emphasis on  training, interface design and other system design aspects. Sometimes a ‘bottom-up’ approach may be better than a ‘top-down’one. Protocol analysis . An operator carrying out a task can be asked to talk about what he is doing as he does it. Clearly this is useful for tasks which involve extensive scanning of information sources and deliberations about what action to take. The visible action may apparently be trivial — adjusting one or two of very many available controls — or may even be non-existent. This sort of task is very common in process control situations where the operator often makes a preliminary three-way decision corresponding to the worldwide system of red, amber and green traffic lights. That is, he does nothing, he does nothing at the moment but prepares for action, or he takes action. Because so much of the activity is in searching for information and processing it leading to a decision, the observed output is obviously a poor indicator of total activity and his verbal commentary is a much better guide to his task performance. Such a commentary can be recorded or notes can be taken directly by the analyst. The snag about recording is that an enormous amount of material is produced which is very tedious to analyse. The presentation of the result may use any of the charting methods described in this chapter, or may take the form of a descriptive narrative. M.C.I.Job-process analysis . Man-Computer Interaction has further complicated the relationship between human operators and other parts of a system but the computer can help to analyse these interactions. Tainsh (1985) has developed a technique in which a computer-based simulation of a generic information handling task is used to assist in analysing the behaviour of an operator or a team of operators. There are two V.D.U.s, one displaying alphanumeric data, the other graphical data. A group of operators (note, these are people with extensive experience of the same or similar tasks, not the unskilled  performer normally used in human performance experiments) run through a task using this equipment. Their behaviour and achievements are observed and discussed amongst themselves and with the analyst (Fig. 1.29). Conclusion Task analysis has not and cannot be reduced to a set of standardised procedures which the aspiring analyst could acquire in a formal training course. The techniques just described are no more than guidelines in what remains the creative art of studying and describing what an experienced worker is doing or will be required to do. The danger in being too rigid is that justice will not be done to the flexibility and complexity of human performance. The danger of being too flexible is that the ergonomists will have an inadequate basis from which to design interfaces, training courses and other operator aids. If a comprehensive task description can be completed then it is legitimate to enquire why the task cannot be allocated to a technical device rather than a human being. Yet without a reasonably comprehensive task description the total system performance may be unreliable or unpredictable. There is a necessary compromise which can only be arrived at in the context of a particular system. As mentioned earlier there are always the twin problems of how to get the information and how to present it. It is sometimes easier to proceed on the basis of: ‘If I were doing the job this is how I would do it’, but this can be delusory even for analysts who have past experience as operators. For analysts who are designers creating a new task there may be no alternative, but any task description arrived at by this method should be checked against the behaviour of real operators as they gain experience. A particular difficulty about task synthesis is that there is no easy way of confirming completeness. A task description which is part of a design process should be fully — documented in terms of the origins of information, the assumptions made and the methods used. The standard method of producing task descriptions is to write all the separate sub-tasks at various levels on cards and then assemble the cards in a network. There is a temptation to make these final diagrams very large, but often it is more useful to separate into small units with cross-referencing. The optimum size seems to be A3, this is easily copied and circulated but is large enough to contain considerable detail. The procedure can be computerised, there are programmes available for the easy production, manipulation and storage of block diagrams with useful cross-referencing facilities. There is an inherent difficulty in that often the main dividend from a task  analysis is from the act of obtaining it. Those not involved find it difficult to gain very much from a presentation of a task description. Like reference books, they have to be used rather than read. Task analysis can be very expensive in skilled manpower, but in looking at cost/value it is important to include in value the increase in mutual understanding which occurs when a multi-disciplinary team conducts the analysis. If such a team is used the required man-hours can be optimised by using the Delphi method rather than a long series of group meetings. Political, economic and social issues which arise in conducting Task Analyses are discussed in the context of Job Analysis (p. 148). Application Man-power planning The ‘Human Resource’ concept of man-power as the central profit-generating asset of any organisation has made some progress over the past twenty years. There was particular interest around 1970 when companies were prosperous, stable and innovative (IPM, 1972, Patten, 1971). The objective is to revise and almost reverse the traditional accountancy concept of man-power as a resource consuming factor requiring regular payments, overheads in the form of heated, lighted, equipped workspaces and so on. From the narrow accountancy viewpoint, people are a cost and it is desirable to keep this cost as low as possible. In these terms it is very difficult to justify, for example, sending a member of staff on a training course. The training requires expenditure and so also does the replacement for the person away. Where is the return? The return is actually in the improved human resource but this is not readily measurable in terms which accountants use. There have been two attempts to reduce human resources to this form of measurement (Giles and Robinson, 1972). One is to acquire a human asset multiplier for each level of staff. The multiplier for manual staff might be unity but it increases with staff level and becomes three or more for management. The other is to add together all the personnel costs for each kind of worker from the original job advertisement through to the retirement or redundancy payments. The first does attempt to obtain a value, the second remains essentially a cost and not a value. It would be unduly optimistic to assume that management skills have risen to a level such that costs undertaken can be assumed to be equivalent to value. A less direct measure which is applicable only to the most senior management is to observe the fall or rise of the share price when a particular executive leaves or joins a company. This can be very high, for a large company a change in market value of millions of pounds is not unusual. The most serious consequence of the accountancy view of man-power is that high level policy decision-making does not give this factor sufficient weight. For example, the main board of a company will have complete details of cost and values of physical resources such as buildings and equipment but relatively scanty data about the man-power which is their most important asset. Indeed it will be described almost entirely as a liability because the costs will be known. Similarly, broad factors such as the state of morale will again only be described by negative features such as absenteeism, stoppages, strikes, low quality output and so on. It is obvious that company output and projects must reflect the man-power and its performance level, but, if this is acknowledged at all, it is only in brief verbal terms within, for example , the chairman's annual report. The obsession, of current management, with measurement and the reduction of every variable to numbers for ease of computer manipulation has worsened the situation. Unfortunately there is no easy remedy. Human resources are too complex a variable to be easily susceptible to measurement beyond the level of counting heads and trades. Key variables such as the quality of staff at any level and the current morale are only expressible in general verbal descriptive terms. It is generally accepted (p. 145) that ‘hygiene’ type variables such as pay and working conditions can, if they are inappropriately specified, depress morale and motivation but they will not in themselves result in very high levels of these parameters. Morale and motivation are influenced more by conditions of work in the sense of work variety opportunities and attitudes of management. These factors are worthy of emphasis because in practice they are still dealt with very badly in many organisations and yet it takes little trouble or expertise to make an enormous difference. for example, very few senior managements take the trouble to keep workers fully informed about policies and likely changes. The result is excessive reliance on rumour and continuous speculation which is not only time-consuming but is also highly deleterious in morale terms. The two human factors which can be unambiguously measured are age and sex. The age distribution of a work force is always an interesting and important source of information. For most purposes a rectangular distribution is the most desirable because it provides the appropriate mix of youthful enthusiasm and ageing experience. It also makes for regular changes as staff retire and are replaced. Many distributions show a peak in a particular age group mainly associated with taking on a large number of young people when the organisation was started or reorganised, this is not desirable because it leads to excessive competition for promotion at particular stages. These comments are obviously most relevant for work forces where there is little tendency to move  out, this is characteristic of a surprisingly large number of organisations in European countries and in Japan but much less so in the U.S.A. Stable work forces have their advantages in terms of familiarity with the enterprise and its peculiar needs but they do result in problems if the market for the products is erratic or otherwise unpredictable. This is particularly so in high technology e.g. design and construction of ships, aircraft, power stations and chemical plant, where the product unit is large and expensive and the variety of required expertise is extensive. Some peaks of demand can be dealt with by using consultants, but they tend to be expensive and do not always fit well with ill-defined but important factors such as the favoured style of the organisation. In well ordered systems it may be possible to calculate the length of in-house experience required to achieve the required level of expertise in particular topics and compare this with the lead time for particular product requirements. Given time available to train new staff it is not necessary to keep more than a nucleus in that particular expertise. On the other hand, if there is usually insufficient notice of need it may be necessary to keep staff who have periods with little to do between projects. It is also desirable to have the possibility of shifting staff between design and operational duties. This not only provides flexibility in the use of man-power, it also improves communication. These real difficulties of man-power utilisation are such as to force many organisations to become larger and larger if they are to remain economic. Size provides a cushion to the vicissitudes of markets but it creates other problems. For example, difficulties of communications and in particular , how to inculcate the feeling within each individual that he and his performance are important to the organisation. This is considered in more detail in Chapter 3. Human resources should be fundamental to subjects such as ergonomics which are essentially people-centred but the concept remains procedurally undeveloped at any level from a continent through countries, regions and companies down to particular working systems. This is one reason why policy makers never seem to take account fully of the people affected by their decisions. The design of procedures The increased importance of standardised informational support for both machines and operators has led to the concept of procedures as a separate design issue within a system (Fig. 1.30). Much of this information can be incorporated in computer programs but there is also a need for extensive printed paper for the use of the operator. This takes three main forms: checklists, routines and knowledge-texts. The terminology in this field is not standardised. Software might be  restricted, as in this book, to computer programs but it is sometimes used as the generic term to include all sources of information. Procedures is sometimes used for what are here called routines and sometimes to indicate all the operator's information support except software. The situation is further confused when some but not all the operator information support is itself computer-based. Sometimes the term firm-ware is used. However whatever the terminology used there is a requirement for design effort. The quality of procedures would be much improved if designers followed some simple guide-lines (Table 1.16). Many documents are written on the implicit assumption that the reader is much like the writer in terms of expertise    and style of thinking. Similarly it is assumed that the conditions under which the reading will take place are the same as those of writing which are usually a clean well-lit office. They may have to be read in the open air, in rain and darkness or within a plant under oily, cramped, poorly lit conditions. The user probably has limited expertise and he may be working under various stress conditions. The material on which the information is printed, the typeface used, the sequence, the structure and the format generally should reflect the conditions of use,(Easterby and Zwaga, 1984). All these things can be achieved if it is acknowledged that all procedures should a validated by users under the normal conditions of use. Checklists Checklists are used in the pre-start mode, for routine maintenance and for fault-finding. They normally take the form of a series of questions or statements which the operator uses to guide and structure his inspection of the hardware and other system components. The sequence is dictated by the optimal order in which actions should be taken, for example in starting up an aircraft. There are many situations when the order is of no great consequence, for example a safety audit of a new machine, and in this latter case some logical structure is needed. As mentioned  above, the logic of the design may not be the optimal basis if the way the operator thinks and acts is different. Baker (1984) suggests that four kinds of shortcoming emerge when checklists are validated in the real situation. The operator may deviate from the listed procedure because it may require excessive moving about or because he is interrupted by the requirements of other tasks. Systematic use of a checklist often reveals faults in work design such as inadequate access, visibility and labelling. The checklist itself may be inconsistent, incomplete, imprecise or ambiguous. Finally the checklist may have reprographic limitations such as inadequate vertical or horizontal structure, poor typefaces and insufficient linking of requirements, descriptions, remarks and tick-off points. The International Ergonomics Association developed a general ergonomics checklist which is reproduced in Edholm (1967). There is a deceptive simplicity about such lists which requires extensive effort to ensure a comprehensive but coherent content. The context is, of course, the context of ergonomics as conceived by the designers of the list. Routines A routine is the most common form of instructional material. The reader is required to follow a series of steps which might, for example, introduce a change in the performance of a complex system. Normally routines are single chains of instructions although it is possible to have some conditional branching. Each step should be simple and complete in itself — preferably with some indication that successful completion has been achieved, for example the appearance or the change of colour of a signal light, or the noise of a motor starting or a change of pressure which indicates that there has been a change in the flow of some material. As mentioned earlier a routine can often be regarded as a written task description. By definition and design intention routines are inflexible. The user is intended to behave exactly according to their instruction. No great skill or intellectual effort is required, which is one way of saying that the human operator is being under-used, but the purpose of a routine is usually to avoid common human error such as omitting a step or reversing steps. In general the value of formal routines is precisely that the operator, left to himself, will not normally function in such a systematic sequential manner. Knowledge texts Knowledge is contained in documents which may vary from single sheet presentations to large manuals. As instructional material it is indirect  in that the reader is not necessarily told what to do, as in a routine. Rather he is informed about the situation and the purpose of informing him is to provide a knowledge base from which he can work out his own actions. Nevertheless, the relevant action remains important and the knowledge provided should be carefully and stringently selected. It is too easy to follow the academic tradition and provide knowledge for its own sake. The ‘need to know’ criterion is crucial because unless it is applied, the operator can be overburdened with unnecessary material. Correspondingly the material should be structured in terms of how it is most likely to be used. In this context the operator requires a guide for action and not a scientific text-book. It is invariably better to provide material diagrammatically, systematically or at least in well-structured short paragraphs rather than in flowing prose. Consider for example how readily information about the relative position of streets is available from a map of a town centre rather than a verbal description of all the streets. Such a map will enable the reader to work out for himself how to get from one location to another within the town. Note the enormous flexibility compared with a routine which would tell him only how to get from one particular point to another. A second important difference is that if he misses his place in a routine he will be totally lost, whereas if he happens to go in the wrong direction while using a map he is still able to make whatever correction is necessary. However the map does require more intellectual effort than does the routine not only in making decisions about how to proceed but also in filtering out the required information from the massive irrelevance (for a particular task) which is equally available. Thus, one would expect the use of the maps to be slower than the use of routines with the human performance being more versatile but less predictable. With two-dimensional representations such as maps it remains important to avoid too much homogeneity and provide substructure in the form of main roads and key buildings or other features such as rivers. See, for example, Fig. 5.3 Manuals which may contain maps, schematic diagrams and other materials warrant separate consideration. The design of manuals A manual is usually in the form of a book or booklet which is sent with the hardware from the maker to the customer. It is part of the communication package from the designer to the user. Thus it is a particular form of job aid which provides the operator with information on a system and its performance. The standard of manual design has traditionally been very low for several   reasons. For this purpose, the designer is too familiar with the product and he rarely takes the trouble to find out what the user really needs to know. Often the manual has to be provided hurriedly at the end of a project when the budget is running out, and it is regarded as a tiresome chore still required after the essential design work has been completed. The problem is particularly acute for computers. Manuals for cars, machine tools and so on are poor but at least it is possible to observe the mechanisms and their functions. Most computer operators do not know or wish to know about the mechanisms, and in any case these are not accessible to vision and manipulation. The computer operator is entirely dependent on the manual, at least in the early stages of gaining familiarity with the system and its functions. He is usually very badly served although the principles of manual design are well known. For most systems the manual is best divided into parts as indicated in Table 1.17. The first part should be a general introduction which orientates the readers towards the system, its purpose, its functional structure and mode of operation and its performance limits. This should be followed by a separate section on how to set the system up in the first place and how to check that it is working properly. If it is fairly small it may be necessary to describe how to unpack it, fix it into position, connect it to power supplies and start it up. If it is large, the emphasis will be on the start up procedure. The section describing the operation of the system should cover not only how the system operates but also how the user can operate it. Extensive use of line drawings, schematic  diagrams, algorithmic lists is desirable, and where prose is used this also should be structured into short sentences with meaningful separation into paragraphs. The maintenance section should indicate what, if anything, the operator is expected to do and the symptoms which indicate that more specialist maintenance skills are required. Tables subdivided into Faults/Reasons/Remedies can be extremely helpful. Parts lists including description reference numbers and sometimes drawings are necessary if the user is expected to deal with his own replacements. A standard fault is to assume that the reader is familiar with the jargon which the designer habitually uses. A glossary of terms and acronyms used can be very helpful not only to the reader but also to the writer who is forced to consider carefully how he is using various technical terms. Finally, all manuals should end with an index which supplements the table of contents at the beginning."
ACA ACA-B1G-002 9.33 "Potential Applications Overview Ian Masser Given the extent to which geographic information management is applications driven, it is important to consider in some depth the characteristics of some potential application fields. In the process it will be necessary to examine not only the extent to which geographic issues feature on the policy issues agenda in these fields but also the institutional context which governs decision-making and the extent to which data are available for research and policy analysis purposes. Questions on data availability are likely to be particularly important where users are heavily dependent on secondary sources. In situations of this kind provisions governing access and format may exert powerful constraints on the use that can be made of these data. The first four chapters in this part examine issues relating to geographic information handling in terms of four potential applications fields. The authors were asked to review the current state of the art in their fields with particular reference to the likely requirements of the future policy issues agenda in terms of the demands that they make on geographic information management. Authors were also asked to evaluate critically the state of geographic information provision in terms of the needs of users and to consider the impact of user requirements on the development of geographic information handling methodology. In this way the chapters in this part present a number of perspectives which essentially complement and amplify the discussion in the previous part. In this case, however, methodological issues are tackled from a largely user standpoint, whereas in the previous part they were viewed as substantive problems in their own right. In effect the product of the discussion in both parts is a matrix where the methodological issues are listed along one axis and particular applications fields on the other. Figure 8.1 summarizes the main features of this matrix. There are important differences between the chapters in this part both in the nature of the demands that they make on geographic information and also in the relative importance that is attached to geographic criteria as against other issues by planners and decision-makers in these fields. The first three chapters dealing with environmental monitoring, natural and technological hazards and settlements and infrastructure applications make use of a very wide range of geographic information. A major feature of these applications is the extent to which they involve overlays of a variety of information drawn from different sources on a topographic map base. for this reason they make particularly heavy demands on current GIS technology both because of the size of the data sets and the diversity of the data structures that are involved. Brown's chapter on geodemographics discusses an application field where primary data collected for operational purposes are typically evaluated in relation to secondary data derived from sources such as the Census of Population. The range of data sets involved and the demands that are made on GIS technology in applications of this kind are often more limited than those of previous applications fields. However, this is offset by the demands that are made on spatial analysis and modelling methodology. Rhind's chapter on environmental monitoring and prediction discusses the role of geographic information management in promoting sustainable development on a global scale in the context of the issues identified in the Brundtland report. It points to the impact that the findings of global environmental research are likely to have on most sectors of the UK economy. This contribution also indicates the wide variety of groups that are involved in monitoring environmental change and draws attention to the role that the European Community is increasingly playing in co-ordinating these efforts. One of the examples of work in progress discusses research that has been  carried out for the European Commission as part of the CORINE Project. This highlights the challenges for research in a field categorized by a lack of data for some countries, varying definitions and standards in use, and unreasonably high user expectations. The chapter as a whole draws attention to a number of key methodological issues that are involved in environmental monitoring and prediction. These include the highly specialized nature of much of the technical analysis, the limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many of the findings of this kind of research and the consequent need for the development of knowledge-based inference machines for extracting useful information from secondary and often proxy data. In Chapter 10 Gatrell and Vincent consider a wide range of natural and technological hazards including industrial hazards, risk assessment, hazardous waste disposal, emergency planning, natural hazards and environmental epidemiology. The substantive content of much of this research straddles the social, environmental and mathematical sciences. To model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas generated by a chemical explosion and its impact on the surrounding area, for example, an understanding of atmospheric dispersion models, epidemiology and population distribution would be required. In applications of this kind the authors argue that geographic information management in general and GIS in particular have an important role to play and they give a number of examples from research in progress to illustrate the current state of the art in this field. The discussion of operational problems and prospects further amplifies many of the issues raised in preceding chapters, particularly with respect to the problems caused by the dependency on secondary data sources and the need for much more detailed geographic information to overcome some of the problems associated with linking data sets. Like most of the other contributors to this section, Gatrell and Vincent see decision support systems as a major area for future development in the geographic information management field. Given that‘most GIS are rather dumb systems, requiring intelligent, very computer literate users’, managing natural and technological hazards means that this knowledge base must be built into the system so that it can be utilized quickly by untrained users after a disaster has taken place or in an emergency. The settlement and infrastructure field is also characterized by a wide range of users with a great diversity of interests. These include not only central and local government but also major utility companies and transport suppliers. According to Shepherd these users share a common need for up-to-date information on the amount, capacity and condition of urban land, transport networks, utilities, hospitals, schools and other major communal facilities. In addition to these data requirements, such users are also interested in developing their capabilities for modelling the changing relationships between the supply and demand for infrastructure in the context of both public and private sector decision-making. Shepherd, more than any other contributor to this section, draws attention to the extent to which current efforts in the geographic information  management field are constrained by the highly fragmented nature of both data suppliers and users both in sectoral and spatial terms, the great diversity of data sets in varying formats and the difficulties presented by institutional factors such as copyright provision, data ownership and the control of access to data. Digital data occupy a central position in this applications field and a number of examples are given to illustrate the extent to which their development has been hampered or facilitated in various countries by the policies of the organizations with responsibility for digital data provision. In Chapter 12 Brown reviews the development of geodemographics from its origins in the computer-based social area analysis of US census tract data from 1950 onwards. He describes the features of the four main systems that are currently in use in the UK and illustrates their application with reference to examples drawn from retail analysis and store location, market research, credit rating and target marketing. Brown demonstrates the extent to which the growth of research activities in this field has led to the emergence of improved cluster analytic methods for the multidimensional classification of people according to the type of area in which they live. In the last part of this contribution, Brown identifies a number of priorities for future research. Like Gatrell and Vincent and Shepherd before him, he is concerned with the lack of detailed geographical information particularly in this case with reference to the years between censuses. Spatial linkages also feature prominently in Brown's discussion which amplifies many of the points made in the earlier contribution from Openshaw in Chapter 3. The analysis points to the need for the development of a fuzzy geodemographics methodology which takes account of the effects of different types of spatial errors. Other major research priorities for the future in this applications field are the development of response-modelling techniques to explore the factors affecting consumer choice. This is particularly important in a field where many of the demands made by users are highly specialized in nature. In summary, then, as fig. 8.1 shows, many of the issues raised by this review of geographic information handling in the four potential application fields are essentially complementary to those discussed in the part on methodological developments. Spatial analysis features particularly prominent on the research agenda relating to natural and technological hazards and geodemographics. Questions relating to data integration emerge as being particularly critical in terms of environmental monitoring and settlement and infrastructure applications. Spatial linkages and questions relating to spatial representation feature prominently in the settlements and infrastructure and geodemographics fields. The evaluation of error propagation is a matter of considerable significance in the environmental monitoring and settlements and infrastructure fields. Finally, in all applications fields, the findings of the reviews above suggest that there is a need for improvements in user interfaces of all kinds. This is particularly evident in the demand for the development of knowledge-based decision support systems and modelling capabilities. Such demands highlight the extent to which geographic information management must be regarded as a means to an end rather than an end in itself when  viewed from the standpoints of the needs of planners and decision-makers. The final chapter in this section rounds off the discussion of applications-related research with an examination of organizational issues that need to be taken account of in handling geographic information. Campbell presents a conceptual framework for the analysis of the organizational issues involved in the development and implementation of GIS. This contribution cuts across many of the questions relating to particular applications that were raised in preceding chapters and draws attention to the dangers of neglecting institutional and personal considerations in practice. All too often, as the experience of many mature applications indicates, technical and data-related matters dominate the system development phase and technically elegant solutions are devised which fail to take enough account of user needs and capabilities. Campbell discusses the role of geographic information in organizations and the process of GIS diffusion drawing upon research from a variety of social science disciplines. The findings of the analysis are summarized in two sets of research questions for all applications fields. In this way she sets out a research agenda for applications-related research which serves a similar function to the spatial analysis research agenda set out by Openshaw at the beginning of Part Two. Environmental monitoring and prediction David Rhind Introduction Monitoring of the state of and the changes in the environment is now universally recognized as being of profound importance to mankind (Tickell 1986, 1989). This awareness is most obviously manifested by the frequent appearance of press reports on ozone depletion, on the greenhouse effect and possible global warming, on nitrate pollution, on deforestation in the Tropics, on decreasing biological diversity and on many other environmentally related topics. Usually these reports concentrate on prophecies of a forthcoming Armageddon but many also describe a dire contemporary situation. Thus the algal bloom off the Italian Adriatic shore in 1989 is reckoned to have caused the holiday trade and local fisherman losses running into tens if not hundreds of millions of pounds. More globally, the Brundtland Report (WCED 1987) noted that, in the 900 days during which the World Commission was at work, 1. The African drought put the lives of 35 million people at risk and may have killed 1 million of them; 2. The Bhopal accident killed 2000 and injured 200 000 more; 3. The Chernobyl disaster caused environmental damage across Europe; 4. A chemical fire in Switzerland caused toxic materials to be transported by the Rhine at least as far as the Netherlands; 5. At least 60 million people died of diarrhoeal diseases caused by malnutrition and dirty water. As a consequence of these and other disasters, of rapid and world-wide broadcasting of them and of the concerned action of many individuals, the environment is now ‘moving fast up the political agenda’(Patten 1989). The then Prime Minister also emphasized the political awakening to the environment  in statements such as: ‘it is possible that with all these enormous changes (population, agricultural, use of fossil fuels) concentrated into such a short period of time, we have unwittingly begun a massive experiment with the system of this planet itself’(Thatcher 1988). The political concern is not altruistic. Mrs Thatcher, a recent convert to environmental conservation, clearly held the opinion that environmental problems are not only soluble but that solving them can be shown to be cost-effective: In the past when we identified forms of pollution, we have shown our capacity to act effectively. The great London smogs are now only a nightmare of the past. We have cut airborne lead by 50 per cent. We are spending £4 billion on cleansing the Mersey Basin alone, and the Thames now has the cleanest metropolitan estuary in the world. Even though this kind of action may cost a lot, I believe it to be money well and necessarily spent because the health of our economy and the health of our environment are totally dependent upon each other…. The Government espouses the concept of sustainable economic development. Stable prosperity can be achieved throughout the world provided the environment is nurtured and safeguarded (Thatcher 1988). The primary official manifestation of this UK commitment to the environment has been the government's White Paper (HMSO 1990). While criticized by many on the grounds that it had few ‘teeth’ and represented a compromise between the DoE and all other departments (notably those of Agriculture and of Transport), it was none the less a major achievement. Its main sections dealt with the government's approach to the environment (nationally, at the European level and globally), the nature and effects of the greenhouse effect, environmental problems in both rural and urban areas (especially in relation to land-use matters), pollution control and enhancing awareness of environmental matters. Central to this approach is said to be an emphasis upon guidance from the best available scientific evidence. There is also a clear recognition of the need for monitoring and modelling of the state of the natural and man-influenced environment. Though there has been a change of Prime Minister and of the Secretary of State for the Environment since the publication of the White Paper, the environmental cause seems as strong as ever. Thus,The Times of 17 December 1990 reported that a group of 40 of the most senior Civil Servants had met the previous weekend to discuss ‘ways in which the government machine could respond better to national and international problems such as the threat of global climate change’. Pearce et al.(1989) have argued that the effects of government, commercial and other actions on the environment can and should be assessed on a cost/benefit basis and this seems likely to be the basis on which at least the UK government will proceed. Given such a lead, it is scarcely surprising that British scientists have sought to demonstrate the practical and financial consequences of environmental events and processes; Table 9.1, for example illustrates their perception of the importance of global environmental research to the UK domestic economy. If it now seems self-evident that monitoring of the global environment is necessary, indeed is even vital, the prediction of what is likely to happen is almost as important: the 170 000 people in the Maldives are understandably worried about the prospect of global sea-level change since no part of the islands is more than 2 m above present sea-level! Yet, as we shall see below, the prediction of the activities of natural and man-influenced environmental systems requires an understanding of the interaction of processes that, in many cases, we simply do not yet have. Even monitoring of the present is very imperfect, as witness the order of magnitude variations in estimates now current for deforestation rates. This chapter, then, attempts to review some of the problems in environmental monitoring and prediction, describes some of the relevant scientific and organizational activities and looks ahead to what is likely to happen next. The nature of environmental processes Notwithstanding Mrs Thatcher's confidence that we can ‘fix’ environmental problems, the difficulties associated with a task even as apparently simple as monitoring a state variable are considerable. Some of the reasons for this — the difficulty of deciding on appropriate proxy variables and on economical yet non-biasing temporal and spatial sampling frameworks, taking account of the relative importance of aperiodic and rare events as compared to near-continuous processes, processing the vast volumes of data usually involved and organizing the multidisciplinary and (often) multinational researchers involved — are discussed briefly later. Even at this stage, however, it is important to stress that we have a very incomplete understanding of many  processes in the natural environment. The next section therefore attempts to summarize what we do know; it is derived chiefly from the Earth System Sciences Committee (ESSC)(1988). Temporal and spatial scales of operation Even ignoring the effects of man, earth system processes operate at a variety of spatial and temporal scales (see Fig. 9.1; see also Rosswall et al.1988). Thus microclimate effects can have major short-term implications for local populations (such as those brought about by the photochemical smogs of Los Angeles), are often applicable only over areas of a few hectares or less and may operate on a diurnal cycle. In contrast, soil creation (cf. soil degradation) may require hundreds or thousands of years. In between are variations in phenomena such as El Nino . The sampling theorem indicates that we must sample these phenomena at a frequency of no less than half their wavelength if we are to avoid bias in measurement. In this chapter, the primary concern is with changes occurring over time spans from minutes to centuries and from spatial wavelengths from about 1 m to about 100 km. It is, however, impossible to separate out processes acting at different scales and over different periods: a single volcanic eruption lasting hours or days sometimes leads to dust and gas being ejected into the atmosphere over a period of months and this in turn may lead to global climatic fluctuations over years or decades. Conversely, a large-scale and long-period phenomenon   such as the movement of tectonic plates can lead to local stress accumulation and to its release by an earthquake in a few seconds and with highly local effects. This therefore has the following consequences: 1. We should know something about the periodicity of the variables we are monitoring if we are not to risk either unnecessarily detailed data collection or aliasing of trends; 2. Since we know that the periodicity of some variables is longer than the monitoring already carried out by human beings, we must make use of surrogate or proxy variables to extend our range of knowledge (such as via tree rings, palynology, oxygen isotope ratios from ice cores and geomorphological evidence of environmental change); 3. Since we are not yet able to predict all the interactions which may be important in a study of environmental problems, collecting potentially useful data as well as those believed central to the problem under study is often wise; 4. We must accept that most data collection exercises will inevitably be a compromise on the grounds of cost and hence less than perfect data sets will be produced; 5. Irrespective of the use of surrogates, monitoring environmental processes only makes sense over time-scales which are extended by human standards (hence the IGBP (see below) is designed to run for two or three decades); 6. Changes in political priorities may simply result in the need for informed guesswork if suitable data are not available. Much attention will be given throughout this chapter to monitoring the environment on a global basis. This is not merely because of its topical nature. The main reason is that — though some problems are local and are best studied that way — many others (even involving a limited geographical extent) are best understood within a global framework. Thus no meteorologist would attempt to forecast the weather 2 or 3 days ahead without using a mathematical model based on observations from all around the world. Moreover, recent work has shown that much of the heat energy in the seas of the North Atlantic (every square kilometre of which gives off as much energy as a nuclear power station and hence influences our weather) is absorbed from sunlight in the tropical Pacific and is carried by ocean currents through the Drake Passage and up into the Atlantic. Thus, to understand some local and many regional, national and continental and all global environmental events, we need to have a global perspective and hold global databases (Rhind and Mounsey 1989; Mounsey and Tomlinson 1988). In no way, however, does this invalidate the need for microscale studies — for instance, while global data sets may indicate the extent of algal blooms and may suggest causes of them, only detailed study of the algae themselves can provide understanding of why the bloom is occurring. The processes themselves A major complication, however, is that the environment can rarely be treated as in a laboratory experiment. Given this, determining the nature of the interactions between the variables becomes a matter of major difficulty. Figure 9.2 is taken from ESSC (1988) and is an attempt to show the interactions between environmental processes, as well as the indicators and implications of change in the state of the environment. In essence, the figure can be summarized as showing processes within the physical climate system and within the biogeochemical one, these systems being interwoven by the global role of water and increasingly affected by human activities. The main components of the first system are well known: the atmosphere is its engine and atmospheric circulation is driven by differences in solar heating between the equatorial and polar regions. We are, however, becoming ever more aware of the massive influence of oceans on our climate; research into ocean/atmosphere interactions is now a priority. In ocean dynamics studies, important topics are heat storage, circulation and the role of sea ice. Atmospheric circulation (and, in turn, precipitation and temperature) is also greatly affected by the balance of thermal energy at the land surface, itself affected by the vegetation and terrain characteristics. The biogeochemical system embraces the totality of the movements of the key elements essential to life — carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and others — through what has been described as the total earth system. The oceans and their biota play a central role in the carbon and nutrient cycles; global ocean circulation is also critical to the global carbon budget. Trace gases in the atmosphere are key components of the cycles of such elements as carbon, nitrogen, oxygen, sulphur and the halogens; as is now well known, their concentrations are much influenced by biogenic and anthropogenic activities and the concentrations of such gases as carbon dioxide, ozone, methane, nitrous oxide and the chlorofluoromethanes (CFMs) strongly affect radiative transfer and provide a link with the physical climate system. A particular cause for concern is that the concentrations of the two main CFMs is increasing by about 5 per cent per annum while the equivalent figures for methane, nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide are 1, 0.4 and 0.3 per cent. Finally, the chemistry of the stratosphere is dominated by the photochemical production and catalytic destruction of ozone. There are several important ways in which biogeochemical processes can influence climate and hence habitability (except where the latter is maintained at enormous cost). If, for instance, the concentrations of certain trace gases (see above) continue to increase, it has been predicted that the earth's surface temperature will increase by an amount comparable to that since the last major phase of the most recent glaciation (about 18 000 years BP)— though there is some dispute about the magnitude of the likely change. The converse case — the effect of physical climate changes on biogeochemical processes — is also of obvious importance: changes in annual averages and cycles of temperature and precipitation, together with the probabilities of    extreme events such as prolonged droughts or frosts, are major determinants of terrestrial ecosystem type, at least in areas largely unaffected by human activity. Human-induced changes to the environment have increased rapidly as a consequence of growing population numbers and of numerous developments in technology. fossil fuel combustion, for instance, has led to increased concentrations of sulphate in precipitation (’ acid rain') and many rivers, lakes and estuaries have been greatly affected by phosphates from agricultural, urban or industrial sources. It should be stressed, however, that — while the outlines of human activities are clear — there are still many uncertainties: for instance, we know that the atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide has risen about 9 per cent since 1959. But calculations of the total carbon released by fossil fuel combustion imply that, if all such carbon remained in the atmosphere, the concentration would have increased by twice as much. The absolute difference between the two figures seems to be due to two different factors: absorption by the oceans and other reductions in carbon stocks in living biota, the latter being strongly affected by human activities since the Industrial Revolution. Does God play dice? Much environmental prediction is predicated upon a logical positivist or Newtonian deterministic basis. The environmental systems are effectively regarded as machines whose workings can all be discovered, described in differential equation form and whose future activities can thus be predicted in detail if their initial states are known. An argument by many atmospheric physicists, for example, is that shortcomings in the accuracy of weather prediction over periods of more than a few days largely results from the unsophisticated nature of existing models, the lack of suitable data and inadequate computer power (see Fig. 9.3, derived from Tyler 1989). In   contrast, the advocates of chaos theory (e.g. Stewart 1989) argue that some natural systems are so sensitive to tiny stimuli that even ‘the faint beat of a butterfly's wing could be the ultimate trigger for a hurricane’. In essence, they argue that tiny differences in the initial conditions of many systems can lead to widely different outcomes since the systems exhibit stochastic behaviour within a deterministic framework. If so, there is little chance of making accurate long-term forecasts of these systems. This has been recognized by, among others, ESSC (1988). The authors of that report accepted that there is a theoretical limit of 2–3 weeks in explicit prediction of day-to-day fluctuations in weather because of the influence of small-scale turbulence within the large-scale dynamics; such limits imply that medium and long-term prediction must inevitably be stochastic. To complicate matters still further, however, it seems at least possible that the components of the earth system may best be predicted deterministically at some spatial and temporal scales but stochastically at others and that the basis of prediction will differ for different components. As an example, atmospheric temperature shows marked day-to-day variability, a strong seasonal cycle with some year-to-year variations, a weak minimum variability for 10–20 year averages and then increased variation again at longer time-scales (ESSC 1988). It need hardly be pointed out that coping with such multiple databases on which modelling is to be carried out is not a trivial exercise. Finally, it is perhaps worth concluding this section by emphasizing that there is still much controversy among the scientific community about the magnitude of many of the effects being discussed. In general, the research work of the international groups of scientists, including those involved in the Inter-Governmental Committee and in the UK's Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change, has progressively reduced the magnitude of the predicted effects of, for example , global warming. In giving the 1990 Robens Coal Science Lecture at the Royal Institution, Sir John Mason (a former Director of the Meteorological Office) urged caution in interpreting the results of the massive atmospheric and oceanic modelling exercises; as the equilibrium models are refined to take account of the thermal lag in oceans, etc., lower values of predicted changes are likely. Thus, while almost all scientists are — at the time of writing — convinced from the evidence that change in climate is under way and that regional effects may be much greater than the global average, the magnitude of the latter is now thought likely to be about half of what was predicted only 5 years ago. Who is involved and what is going on? If we consider the environment in the broadest sense, much monitoring of it has been in progress for many years and by an enormous diversity of organizations in the UK; these include the DoE, the Forestry Commission, the Nature Conservancy, the Health and Safety Executive, local authorities, the component members of the Natural Environment Research Council (such as the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology and the British Antarctic Survey), individuals or research groups in academia, the CEGB, the Friends of the Earth, and UK Centre for Economic and Environmental Development (CEED)(1989). The diversity of monitoring organizations seems just as great in other countries; numerous multinational organizations, both quasi-governmental (e.g. the UN Environment Programme (UNEP)) and non-governmental (e.g. the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED)) are also active in the field. Moreover, commercial monitoring of the environment is now also routine, notably to predict crop yields in the main grain-growing areas and hence facilitate the buying of futures. The international scientific involvement Scientists have both promoted and responded to the increasing interest in the environment. Thus, at the global scale, the International Council of Scientific Unions (ICSU) has endorsed the setting up of the International Geosphere Biosphere Project (IGBP) to ‘describe and understand the interactive physical, chemical and biological processes that regulate the total Earth system, the unique environment it provides for life, the changes that are occurring in that system and the manner by which these changes are influenced by human actions’(Report of ad hoc Planning Group for IGBP 1986, quoted in IGBP 1988). Priority in the IGBP is intended to be given to those areas which deal with key interactions and significant changes on the time-scales of decades to centuries, that most affect the biosphere, that are most susceptible to human perturbations and those that will most likely lead to a practical, predictive capability for global change. This is to be put into operation by concentrating on four themes: 1. Documenting and predicting global change; 2. Observing and improving our understanding of dominant forcing functions; 3. Improving our understanding of interactive phenomena in the total Earth system; 4. Assessing those effects of global change which will be large scale and cause major modifications to both renewable and non-renewable resources. By 1990, IGBP had progressed as far as defining a set of seven core projects (IGBP 1990) addressing these four themes. In addition, plans for regional research centres and for the data and information systems for IGBP (known as IGBP-DIS) had been announced. The latter are particularly relevant to this chapter. Based in Paris and working under Professor I. Rasool, it is intended to concentrate on managerial and policy aspects of the task in the first 2 years (1990–92) but then to expand considerably thereafter. Tasks  agreed for the IGBP-DIS include making available a ‘directory of data directories’ modelled on NASA's Master Directory, providing data sets for education and training and undertaking a land cover pilot study. Until 1990, remarkably little interaction had taken place between the ‘hard science’ and the social science communities on global monitoring and prediction. It is noteworthy, however, that the Royal Society made a plea for just this type of multidisciplinary work in its submission on greenhouse gases to the House of Lords' Select Committee on Science and Technology (Royal Society 1989: 40). Fortunately, in addition to the actions of the world ‘hard science’ community, a parallel effort is now being initiated by social scientists (Fuchs 1989; Jacobson and Price 1990). Currently this is organized and sponsored by the International Social Science Council (ISSC), the UN University and the International Federation of Institutes of Advanced Studies. Its objectives are to: 1. Improve scientific understanding and increase awareness of the complex dynamics governing human interaction with the total Earth system; 2. Study, explore and anticipate social change affecting the global environment; 3. Identify broad social strategies to prevent or mitigate undesirable impacts of global change or to adapt to changes which are unavoidable; 4. Analyse policy options for dealing with global environmental change and promoting the goal of sustainable development. Jacobson and Price (1990) provide a useful summary of the ways in which human factors contribute to, and are affected by, likely global changes; in particular, they stress the importance of the data-handling issues and the role of GIS in coping with some of the problems of data integration and manipulation. The ISSC proposed its own work programme in the Human Dimensions of Global Change in late 1990. While these organizations intrinsically have a world-wide membership and are concerned with research into global environmental change, others share the same interest but from a more restricted geographical base. A leading example of this is the European Science Foundation which has sponsored research programmes in both the physical and social science aspects of environmental change (ESF 1990). Governmental and political involvement The spread of environmental awareness is readily demonstrated: in 1972, 26 countries had environmental and natural resource management agencies whereas, a decade later the number was 144 (WEC 1985). In most countries, the governmental and political concern with the environment has come somewhat later than that of scientists or concerned lay people: the early development of the Green Party in the Federal Republic of Germany  is something of an exception. Such a commitment to the environment is, none the less, both welcome and necessary if resources are to be made available to tackle existing, let alone forthcoming, environmental problems. The ‘conversion’ of the UK government has been briefly described earlier; it is manifested in their July 1989 commitment to spend £10m. on climate change research in 1989/90 and the confident request to them from the Advisory Board for the Research Councils (ABRC) for an extra £11m. in 1990 and £13m. in the two succeeding years for additional environmental research. Perhaps the most significant development of all, however, is the increasing role of the European Commission. Their role in bringing environmental impact assessment (EIA) on to the statute book is well known, but the Commission has now made a proposal (CEC 1989) for the ‘establishment of the European Environment Agency and the European Environment Monitoring and Information Network’. The Commission argues that there is at present no monitoring of environmental quality and trends on a European scale, nor any guarantee that the results of environmental monitoring will be comparable on a Community-wide basis (a realization brought about through the CORINE programme described later). The objectives of the new agency would be to assist the Community and the Member States to achieve the goals set out in the Treaty of Rome and in successive environmental action programmes; it must also, however, be seen in the context of the European Council's adoption on 2 December 1988 of the Rhodes Declaration on the Environment and the environment chapter in the Single European Act which comes into effect in 1992. The detailed specific roles of ‘the System’(comprising both agency and network) are envisaged as: 1. To provide the Community, the Member States and participating third countries with the objective (sic) information requested for the formulation and implementation of sound and effective environmental policies; 2. In particular, to provide technical, scientific and economic information requested by the Commission in its tasks of identification, preparation and assessment of the implementation and results of environmental action and legislation; 3. To stimulate the development and the application within the agency of techniques of environmental modelling and forecasting in order that adequate preventative action can be taken at the appropriate time; 4. To help ensure the harmonization and comparability of environmental data in the Community as well as the integration of European environmental data into international environmental monitoring programmes, such as those established within the framework of the United Nations and its system of agencies. Considerable stress is laid by the Commission on collaboration with national data-gathering agencies and with states adjacent to the Community's borders. It is envisaged that the totality of activities will extend the existing State of the European Environment report (CEC 1988) through addressing the issues of the quality and sensitivity of the environment and also the pressures upon it. Priorities for the new agency include study of atmospheric emissions and quality, water resources and quality (including the marine environment), soil erosion and pollution and important land resources, and biotopes and nature conservation. At the time of writing, the proposal has been approved and discussions are in progress on the location of the agency's headquarters. It seems certain to have major and growing effects upon environmental monitoring and prediction in Europe and on the policies of component governments. Yet this is by no means the only plan which the Community has in relation to the environment: Directorate-General XII (that for Science, Research and Development) has published details of an extensive R&D programme (CEC 1990a) and the Commission as a whole (CEC 1990b) has made public its plans to develop regular official statistics of the environment. The private sector Certain aspects of environmental monitoring have long been carried out by the private sector, notably that of crop states on a world-wide basis. Derived from satellite imagery at comparatively low resolution, predicted yields for different crops in different nation states become of commercial value. However, significant resources are also being made available by the private sector where there is no immediate commercial gain: thus IBM UK Ltd has donated £3.5m. of computing equipment to UNEP and IBM in general is actively supporting other R&D which can be expected to facilitate ‘sustainable development’: IBM Europe, for instance, has invested $16m. in its Bergen scientific centre to make it the focal point for the company's environmental modelling and a centre for information on the environment and sustainable development. On a more modest basis, IBM UK have agreed to fund a pilot global population database being built in Birkbeck College to permit assessment of the impact of environmental change on the world s population. Many other companies, of course, are supporting environmental work but IBM seems almost to be unique in its corporate commitment to use of high technology for facilitating ‘sustainable development’. Some examples of environmental monitoring projects The local scale At the local scale, it is usually impossible to neglect the effects of multiple processes operating. An example of environmental modelling and prediction  where the interactions between different processes and dynamic feedback is taken into account is given by Haber and Schaller (1988). Their work formed part of one UNESCO Man and Biosphere (MAB) project, carried out in the Berchtesgaden National Park in Bavaria. Following Holling (1978) and Grossman (1983), they conceptualized the man/environment relationship at a series of hierarchical levels: 1. The lowest, or process, level, is directly and (usually) obviously connected to perceived reality. Thus processes and interrelationships are mostly obvious, simple and linear; data are usually readily available and may be voluminous. This level is readily handled in commercial GIS;, 2. The intermediate, or dynamic, level is concerned with less frequent and often irregular events, e.g. a temporary lack of water because of fire, frost or excessive demand from an increasing populace. Characteristically, the data used may be more difficult to obtain and are usually more spatially aggregated; modelling software which permits feedback loops is essential; 3. The top, or strategic, level is the most difficult to explore; the external influences are often unpredictable by formal means. Relevant data are therefore difficult to identify and scenario building is one of the few approaches available. The Haber and Schaller approach is to ‘soft-couple’ these different levels and their accompanying approaches using an ecological balance model. Results of running this with different scenarios include ‘time slice’ maps of possible outcomes and of the exchange of material and energy within the study area. While ultimately qualitative, it seems to offer a method for coping with different types of process and incorporating stochastic and truly random events. The national and continental scale: the CORINE project The CORINE programme represents the product of much activity by the European Commission's Directorate-General (XI) for the Environment. It originates from an Italian request to the Council of Ministers in 1973 to identify environmentally ‘balanced’ and ‘unbalanced’areas in the Community; the first attempts to do this were unsuccessful and, though by 1981 it was clear that a new approach based on an environmental information system was the most promising one, funding for this was not secured until 1985. A 4-year experimental programme to ‘collect, co-ordinate and ensure the consistency of information on the state of the environment and natural resources in the European Communities’ was set up and labelled CORINE. The objectives of CORINE were to be achieved through bringing together existing data holdings in the member states, developing methods for holding, analysing and presenting the data, and encouraging the exchange of data. A  number of priority areas were identified, including biotopes of importance for nature conservation, acid deposition and its effects on soils and biotopes and the protection of the environment of the Mediterranean region (Briggs and Martin 1988). Many achievements can be claimed by the CORINE project team. As a result of some 40 sub-projects involving all the Member States (and often several groups within each one), databases of topography, soils, water resources and quality, biotopes, atmospheric emissions, climate, soil erosion and administrative boundaries have been built up for the whole Community and can be interrelated; other data sets (such as land cover, derived from satellite imagery) have already been compiled for some of the Member States. Various aspects of the CORINE project have been described in papers by Rhind et al.(1986), Wiggins et al.(1987), Briggs and Martin (1988), Briggs and Mounsey (1989) and CEC (1990c). For the present purposes, however, the key findings are: 1. Many necessary data sets were unavailable for reasons of administrative inadequacies, confidentiality constraints, cost or non-collection in certain countries; 2. The unavoidable reliance upon existing data sets led to many problems due to non-harmonization even of commonly used variables, e.g. eight different definitions of potential evapo-transpiration were in use in the Member States and ‘maximum temperature’ at each weather station was defined in at least four different ways; 3. The compilation of a spatially coherent database from mapped information compiled by different organizations at different scales and on different topographic bases (see Rhind and Clark 1988) is often difficult; 4. User expectations are often unreasonably high; use of administrative computing systems encourages bureaucrats to believe that environmental data can just as readily be analysed and used to support decisions. The ‘fuzzy’ nature of much geographically distributed data, the inherent errors in it, the effects of the processing algorithms used and the assumption of known interactions between variables ensures that completely routine use by unskilled users is unlikely to be possible in the foreseeable future; 5. More detailed data are required for particular tasks as the role of CORINE grows. The European Commission's proposal for an environment agency (see above) will subsume the CORINE team and databases. The global scale: NASA and GEMS/GRID Without question, the largest ‘player’ in the global environment arena is NASA. The organization has initiated many of the schemes which now are  under discussion — the IGBP, for instance, has been strongly influenced by NASA proposals. A summary of current activities and future plans is given in NASA (1988b). By way of example, current programmes are collecting global data on stratospheric ozone, on sea-surface and sea-ice variables and on the earth's radiation budget. Approved future programmes include the Upper Atmosphere Research Satellite, the NASA Scatterometer and the joint NASA/CNES Ocean Topography Experiment. In addition, however, funding has recently been approved for a much more ambitious scheme — the Earth Observing System (EOS). This is conceived not as a set of hardware but as a comprehensive information system focused on the needs identified by the ESSC (see above) and anticipating somewhat those of IGBP. It will collate data from the two proposed space station polar platforms, one European Space Agency platform, a Japanese one and also from the manned space station. On this basis, a data flow of no less than 1 terabyte (i.e. 10&sup12; bytes) /day is anticipated by the mid-1990s. A major user of NASA data and skills has been the UN Environment Programme. formed in the wake of the 1972 Stockholm conference, UNEP soon spawned the Global Environment Monitoring System (GEMS) as well as an international register of potentially toxic chemicals and a global network of sources to locate and provide technical, scientific and management information on the environment. The need for a mechanism to handle the global environmental data was defined in the early 1980s and the Global Resources Information Database (GRID) resulted. Mooneyhan (1988) has described the progress of the pilot stage of GRID which culminated in approval for a full operational phase; GRID is now involved in integrating, storing and exploiting a variety of global environmental databases, mostly acquired from NASA. In addition to the work being carried out in the UNEP HQ at Nairobi and in the GEMS/GRID site in Geneva, a series of GRID regional nodes are now being set up world-wide, each equipped with the same hardware and software and local subsets of the data. The first of these is in Bangkok and another is to be opened in Latin America. Moreover, national nodes are also being set up; the recent IBM gift to GRID (see above) has ensured that powerful microcomputers have been installed in many African countries, together with national and continental data sets. Training of unskilled staff to operate this equipment and to exploit the scientific data is now a major role for GRID staff. Technical aspects and problems It follows from much of the above that there are major challenges in use of environmental data. These are best considered by itemizing characteristics of contemporary environmental monitoring and prediction: 1. The use of secondary data, rather than primary data collected by the data analyst; 2. The need, at least with data on the terrestrial environment, for an inference process to extract useful information from the secondary (and often proxy) data; 3. The data volumes collected are often voluminous even by the standards of contemporary computing facilities; 4. The analyses carried out are often arcane in detail to all but a small group of ‘high priests’; 5. We have only a limited capacity for checking the accuracy of many environmental monitoring results, let alone of predictions. Some of these characteristics are now addressed in slightly more detail; it will be obvious that such problems merit a paper in themselves. Remote sensing as a data collection process As the need for more extensive, high-resolution yet consistent and up-to-date data becomes more pressing, increased use of remote sensing seems inevitable. No other data collection methodology obviates the short distance variation in data sets induced by variations in data collection and aggregation methodology typically encountered between adjacent nation states. The problem is now recognized, especially in Europe, and strenuous efforts are being made to harmonise the data sets (e.g. through the use of standard classifications, such as that for land use produced by the Conference of European Statisticians in 1989). At present, however, ground-collected environmental data are far less than ideal. Recognizing this, NASA (1988a) concluded that forthcoming global science projects would need land surface altitude data at three resolutions: 1 km resolution in XY and 10–100 m resolution in Z on a global basis, 100 m XY resolution and 1–10 m resolution in Z for regional databases and 10 m XY resolution and 0.1–1 m in Z for local studies. They argued that existing maps and digitized files from them are unable to meet these needs at global or regional scale and only remote sensing could help in the short term: the availability of stereometric data from the French SPOT satellite has already led to proposals for automated creation of global digital elevation models with a spatial (XY) resolution of about 30 m (Muller 1989). For many terrestrial purposes, however, a substantial inference process must take place to convert the radiometric measurements into useful information (in contrast, more direct measurements of sea state, etc. are possible). The value of this information is inherently dependent upon the quality of the inference process and that in turn depends upon the complexity of the scene, the spatial, temporal and spectral resolution of the sensors and the particular algorithms used. Thus far, for instance, accuracies of land cover (let alone what is often needed, i.e. land use) determined from Landsat and SPOT imagery for the UK have rarely been higher than 70 per cent unless trivial classifications (e.g. built/unbuilt land) have been used. One  solution to this is to ‘densify’ the ground control and another is to use contextually based classifiers rather than the traditional, spectrally based ones. But the ground conditions in some parts of Europe make good results extremely difficult to obtain: some areas of Portugal, for instance, have field sizes of only a few metres and exhibit multi-level and multi-seasonal cropping. A further difficulty is the cost of the data in relation to its anticipated benefits. Relatively few cost/benefit studies have yet been carried out except in such areas as crop prediction and ocean navigation (where they are generally shown to be highly advantageous in saving someone else's money). It may be that a study commissioned from contractors by the British National Space Centre will provide useful evidence on the cash value of remote sensing; it is particularly timely in view of the appointment of Professor Pearce (see above) as the adviser to the UK Secretary of State for the Environment. Other work on assessment of costs and benefits of such data have been carried out for the French government by Professor Didier (1990). Finally, since data are often costly to acquire, it follows that summaries of them e.g. The State of the European Environment report (CEC 1988) and the Environmental Data Report of the UN EP (GEMS MARC 1989) are of considerable value. Equally, the ‘signposting’ role now being adopted by UNEP's GRID project — which is expected to offer on-line access to a catalogue of environmental data sets and details of the responsible agencies in 1991 — is to be welcomed. The data problem and partial solutions The lack of harmonization of definitions and methods of collection of environmental data have already been outlined above. In the European Community of 12 nation states, for instance, no less than eight procedures for calculating potential evapo-transpiration have been in use! The need for harmonization is obvious and, in this respect, must follow from the successful pioneering achievements of EUROSTAT in harmonizing the definitions in trade, demographic and other ‘social science’ statistics (see CEC 1990b). An additional and severe problem is that the volumes of data which are already collected are huge by the standards of only a decade ago. By 1995/96, they will be very much greater, notably from the EOS programme. NASA has announced plans to collect up to 1 terabyte (10&sup12; bytes) /day. Since remote sensing data sets (especially those pertaining to terrestrial areas of the globe) typically need much pre-processing to calibrate, transform and then perform an inference process and hence convert measurements of the radiation reflected or emitted by small areas of ground into useful (e.g. land cover) data, the processing power required is going to be formidable. Other, non-remote-sensing data sets are smaller in volume but  more complex in structure and in their characteristics. To hold all of the 1/50 000 scale topographic map coverage alone for the European Community would probably require about 3 terabytes of storage. Parenthetically, the form in which the data may be held can affect dramatically the scale of the problem faced. It would be technically possible, for instance, to hold in less than 1 terabyte detailed information for every individual in the world, akin to that collected about everyone in the UK through the Census of Population. In practice, legislation generally forbids such data being held thus and distributed in anything other than area aggregate form; the cross-tabulations commonly employed (e.g. to give tables of population numbers broken down by age and sex) often result in a great multiplication of the data volumes. This all presents major problems of data storage, handling (especially for global data sets), display and dissemination. Fortunately, technical developments have ensured that the increase in computing power per unit cost has been growing at about an order of magnitude every 6 years over the last three decades. Indeed, this may grossly under-represent the present situation: the rapid spread of UNIX-based systems seems to facilitate competition and, at the time of writing, performance of workstations per unit cost seems to be increasing at about 50 per cent per annum. Moreover, the advent of low-cost, high-density-storage devices like CD-ROMs may well make substantial data sets available even to those with modest computing power: a CD-ROM, for instance, can hold about 600 megabytes (i.e. 10&sup6; bytes), can be reproduced currently for about £1 and read on a device costing about £400. Yet, despite such revolutionary changes in technology, novel solutions will still be required to make effective use of the new data sets. One such solution is Goodchild and Yang's (1989) scheme for a hierarchical spatial data structure to handle data for the spherical earth. A particular problem is that little or no quantitative regard has been paid until recently to the effects of quality variation in environmental data. The literature of the last few years is thronged with papers proposing that these must be taken into account — but with few realistic proposals on how this is to be achieved. Goodchild (1988) has made perhaps the best summary of the problem and possible solutions to date. Finally, relatively little emphasis has been given to the management of data as a corporate resource, available to a wide community: many environmental data are collected on a project-by-project basis and ‘lost’ once the urgency of the initial research is over. However, the 1990 report of the Data and Facilities Working Group of the UK Inter-Agency Committee on Global Environmental Change argued strongly that planning for the dissemination and maintenance of such data was a vital role. It also noted that ownership of and access to environmental data was a policy matter of the greatest importance; this may be more difficult in ‘within country’ data than with global data since the latter are often already the subject of international exchange agreements at zero cost. Global environmental research and the social sciences Thus far, the emphasis has been very much on the natural science aspects of environmental monitoring and prediction. That is unremarkable since the anticipation of such problems and assessments of some of their causes and magnitudes can only be made by environmental scientists. Yet the consequences of any significant changes are a matter of the utmost concern to planners and to politicians at all levels, the quantification of the costs and benefits of alternative policy strategies is very much a matter for economists, and the adaptation of societies to massive change is a particular interest to sociologists and others. For geographers — who span the conventional (and now archaic) dichotomy between the natural and the environmental sciences — all of these aspects need to be woven together to anticipate the likely spatial patterns of the effects of massive change, the redistributions in trade, health and wealth which they will bring about and the ‘knock on’ effects these consequences themselves will have on society and the environment. For social scientists, then, environmental monitoring and prediction are a matter of considerable significance, especially as ‘globalization’ of markets and economies proceeds. The Economic and Social Research Council (ESRC) commissioned two reports on global environmental change to guide or at least inform the allocation of research funding. These reports (Pearce 1990; Turner 1990) may be taken as informed views from at least the economists in the UK social science community on the social science aspects of global environmental change. Pearce (1990), for instance, presented an economist's views of the high-priority topics for research as follows: 1. The theory and practice of international agreements, viewed in a game theory context; 2. The theory of optimal behaviour under scientific uncertainty;, 3. Cost-benefit frameworks, especially for dealing with man-induced climatic effects; 4. Definition of the impacts of climate change on eastern Europe and the developing countries; 5. Appropriate policies on non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gases; 6. Assessment of the ecological values of tropical forest; 7. Economic instruments for reducing greenhouse gases; 8. The international politics of climate change; 9. National and global energy options given the greenhouse effect; 10. Trade and global change. Turner (1990) argued that the priorities are as follows: 1. The socio-economic consequences of sea-level rise; 2. Techniques for the valuation of environmental resources and effects; 3. An assessment of management tools, institutional adaptation and policy integration in regard to global environmental change; 4. Studies of agriculture in relation to climate change; 5. Understanding of how environmental issues and technical change interact; 6. The interrelationship between environmental ethics and economics. There is, then, no shortage of social science research which is claimed to be necessary if we are to cope with environmental change. Some of it is being carried out: in March 1991 ESRC announced a £6m programme of research on Global Environmental Change. However, perhaps most critical of all in the early stages is social science practice rather than research. In the USA at least, there needs to be an improvement in scientists' understandings of how to influence the allocation of funding for remedial measures or for further research (see Kitsos and Ashe 1989). All too often, it seems that the coupling of an as yet imperfect scientific understanding to policy-making is tenuous (see Table 9.2). Fortunately, considerable high-quality work has already begun on the legal, political and institutional aspects of global environmental change (see, for instance, Nitze 1990). What next? The contents of this chapter have scarcely touched upon such important environmental research as the World Ocean Climate Experiment or the World Climate Research Programme. Nor has there been any discussion of the growing requirement in the UK (as elsewhere) to carry out an environmental impact assessment for all major developments. The consequences for some nations or subgroups in a population of being without access to environmental data or the tools for analysing them while others have such access are potentially profound — as the European Commission has recognized in issuing  a directive on public access to environmental data (CEC 1990d)— yet space limitations have also precluded their discussion. Despite these shortcomings dictated by the space available, what has been said should be sufficient to illustrate the enormous and diverse scope of environmental monitoring and prediction. Such is its diversity that measuring the total expenditure on it seems quite impossible and the number of ‘actors’ already involved is vast. What is clear, however, is that monitoring is rarely a simple exercise, that the time-scales of the sponsors of monitoring and environmental research are rarely long term though most science is inevitably of this nature and that the increasingly multinational nature of such work necessitates a degree of management not always present in local or nationally based schemes. In these circumstances, it is scarcely surprising that there is evidence of international and interdisciplinary dispute, as Terney (1989) has chronicled in regard to IGBP. Moreover, as Newby (1990) has pointed out, the complexities of environmental research have created a new kind of relationship between research and policy: ‘in the past,…the relationship was predicated on the belief that science provided decision-makers with objective ‘hard’ facts on which to base their soft, value-ridden policies…. But now we find scientists delivering only ‘soft’, uncertain ‘facts’ to decision-makers facing ‘hard’decisions.’ Yet, even if all of this causes great uncertainty among scientists, it is still a reasonable prediction that a decade ahead will see both environmental monitoring and prediction treated as an everyday need and activity in major organizations. We shall also see the existence of binding requirements upon national governments — certainly in the European Community — to collect at least basic environmental indicators in a harmonized form (CEC 1990b). More than that, it seems highly likely that the social science aspects of environmental problems will underpin the actions of governments and international agencies. Perhaps the single most important conclusion to be drawn from this review is that the monitoring, modelling and management of the global environment are tasks which uniquely require the integration of skills and techniques from many disciplines. Building such research teams is essential. Underlying it all, however, is one obvious fact: that the gathering and analysis of geographically distributed environmental data form the necessary starting-point for ensuring the success of our future on earth.

Managing natural and technological hazards Anthony C. Gatrell and Peter Vincent Introduction Few areas of the application of GIS technology can be as socially significant, or environmentally relevant, as the management of emergencies and disasters due to natural and technological hazards. Whether attempting to construct a database of resources for use in planning responses to nuclear emergencies, developing optimal routes for scheduling the safe transport of hazardous substances, or monitoring the health implications of a disaster, GIS can assist in identifying possibilities and formulating solutions. The 1990s have been declared the International Decade for Natural Disaster Reduction . Let us hope that G1S can, in some small way, help mitigate the suffering and hardship felt by all those afflicted by the effects of hazards which, as we have learnt with bitter recent experience in the UK, can occur in an untimely fashion in the most improbable of places. Research on hazards is multidisciplinary and straddles the social, environmental and mathematical sciences. If, for instance, we wish to model the dispersal of a plume of toxic gas resulting from a chemical explosion, assess its possible impact on human health and evaluate likely evacuation scenarios of the population at risk we would require, for example , a knowledge of atmospheric dispersion models, epidemiology and population distribution. Some researchers suggest that hazards (and emergencies that might result) can be regarded as either natural or technological. We shall elaborate on this simple division below but suggest here that the wealth of literature on the former (see, for instance, Burton et al.1978 and Perry 1981) has yet to be matched by a similar volume of work on the latter. There are signs that this imbalance is being rectified (Zeigler et al.1983). Hazard research, like few other GIS application areas, is not only stretching the present technology to its limits but is a quite remarkable focus of international effort into several important research-related areas such as expert systems and simulation studies. In this sense the scene is clearly one of hazard problems looking for improved GIS rather than for GIS looking for good problems, as is all too often the case. Hazard research What are hazards? Formally, a hazard can be defined as: ‘a physical situation with a potential for human injury, damage to property, damage to the environment, or some combination of these’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 30). A hazard is a threat which, given a set of circumstances, may become translated into a realized event. What we choose to call this event depends upon factors such as its magnitude: we speak for instance of accidents, emergencies, disasters and catastrophes, each of which carries connotations concerning the scale of the event and each of which will have a set of human and/or environmental consequences. On 30 March 1956 one of the most powerful volcanic disturbances this century, the Bezymianny eruption, occurred. Few people noticed the event as it took place in an uninhabited part of Kamchatcka and caused no known casualties. In contrast, the extrusion of a small volume of lava from a secondary cone on the slopes of Tristan da Cunha became the focus of global interest when, during October 1961, the island's lobster processing plant was smothered and the 300 people of the island's only settlement were evacuated to the UK. These two contrasting events emphasize the central fact that even natural hazards are not defined solely by the characteristics of the event but by the interaction of those events with the human occupation of the threatened area. As noted above, the simple division of hazards is between those which are natural and those which are technological or human-induced. Each of these may be further subdivided and the typology shown in Fig. 10.1 draws upon the classic work of Burton and Kates (1964) in separating geophysical from biological hazards and Zeigler et al.(1983) in distinguishing public (or what we might call societal) hazards from private (individual) ones. The further subdivision of natural hazards is self-explanatory as is that of individual technological hazards. Zeigler divides the public hazards into those which result from the production of raw materials and manufactured goods, those which originate in transport and transmission and those which threaten the public in their role as consumers. The United Nations Disaster Relief Organization (UNDRO) has produced a classification of disasters, derived on the basis of case data (Table 10.1). UNDRO recognizes three basic types of disaster: accidents, natural events, and other disasters. The differentiation of accidents from other types is useful in the context of emergency planning and is not so clearly conveyed by other     hazard typologies. However, the temptation in all classification exercises is to produce partitional schemes and this should really be resisted here. It is more useful (Johnson 1983) to adopt a non-partitional scheme (fig. 10.1) that recognizes, for instance, food poisoning as both a personal and consumer hazard, or lead pollution (e.g. from car exhausts) as both a meteorological event and technological hazard (both public and private). An air crash (as at Lockerbie) affects an entire community directly, as well as being an occupational hazard and risk to the individual traveller. Hillslope failure (as   at Aberfan in South Wales in 1966) is a geomorphic hazard but may arise because of raw material extraction. Dutch elm disease is a floral hazard but is exacerbated by the transport of infected logs. Hohensemer et al.(1983) make the important point that hazards are multidimensional in nature and suggest 12 dimensions along which any hazard may be scored (see Table 10.2). These factors will, of course, be important in deciding on the role that GIS can play in hazard monitoring and emergency planning. For instance, some events will persist briefly, have immediate consequences, minor transgenerational effects and have little or no potential for non-human mortality (an air crash is an example). Others, such as a chemical explosion involving the release of a toxic gas, may persist for a week or more, have delayed consequences, may affect a future generation if the toxic chemical is mutagenic and may have a significant impact on plant and animal populations. There may be more scope for a GIS approach in the latter than in the former situations. The Hohensemer scheme is not, however, beyond criticism. for example, can hazards really be thought of as having any intentionality? Industrial hazards and risk assessment Once hazards have been identified there may follow efforts to assess the hazard risk. By ‘risk’ we understand ‘the likelihood of a specified undesired event occurring within a specified period or in specified circumstances’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 30). It may, of course, be easier to quantify risk for natural hazards because of historical records and statistical estimation of recurrence intervals. Technological hazards are more unpredictable and may be extremely rare, so that it becomes difficult to use probability concepts to quantify risk, especially those which rely on notions of relative frequency. The identification of chemical hazards requires that the locations of sites be known, together with the dangerous substances stored or processed  there. In the UK (see Petts 1988 for a splendid overview) the Health and Safety Executive must be notified of sites where hazardous substances in excess of threshold limits are handled. Such substances and thresholds include, for instance, 25 tonnes of flammable liquid petroleum gas and the explosive sodium chlorate, and 10 tonnes of toxic chlorine gas. Some 1600 installations are notifiable, along with thousands of kilometres of pipelines (mostly high-pressure natural gas transmission lines). Following a number of major accidents involving industrial activities (including those at Flixborough, Humberside in 1974; Beek, the Netherlands in 1975; and Seveso and Manfredonia in Italy in 1976), the EC issued a Directive on Major Accident Hazards. The Directive, which is commonly referred to as the ‘Seveso’ Directive, was issued in June 1982 and in the UK its requirements were embodied in the Control of Major Accident Hazard (CIMAH) Regulations (1984). Among other things, these regulations require operators of hazardous installations to draw up on-site and off-site emergency plans and to give information to members of the public who live or work near such installations (Houston 1987). There are presently about 300 CIMAH sites. However, many potentially hazardous chemical installations are not covered by such regulations. Clearly, a plant which stores 1 tonne less than is required for notification slips through the net, while large numbers of handling sites (warehouses, for instance) are not covered. The regulations have obvious implications for G1S work, as illustrated below. In Halton Borough, Cheshire, for instance, there are 13 notifiable installations, with over 20 000 people living within the defined ‘consultation zones’(Petts 1988). It is also relevant to point out here the work of the Health and Safety Executive in developing techniques for quantitative risk assessment (Health and Safety Executive 1989). Such techniques include the use of a ‘risk assessment tool’(RISKAT), inputs to which include data on wind direction and speed; the output of which is a map of calculated risk contours. In societal risk assessment ‘it is also necessary to input data on the distribution of population around the installation. This can be a difficult and time-consuming process, and inevitably some simplifying assumptions are needed’(Health and Safety Executive 1989: 17). Again, the G1S implications are clear and are discussed below. Hazardous waste disposal The disposal of both nuclear and non-nuclear wastes has proved to be of major public concern in recent years. The rather clumsy handling by NIREX of the search for sites to store low- and intermediate-level wastes, together with very recent worries about the import of toxic wastes such as polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), are but two examples of such concern in the UK. However, while the former has been given considerable attention by geographers (summarized by Openshaw et al.1989) there has been relatively little such work in the UK on the disposal of non-nuclear wastes. This  contrasts with the situation in the USA (Greenberg and Anderson 1984), where the clean-up of abandoned sites is a priority. Certainly, in terms of the volume of waste generated in the UK non-nuclear hazardous industrial wastes should be high on the environmental agenda; while less than 1 million tonnes of all nuclear wastes were generated in 1985–86, 10 times that amount were generated of hazardous wastes (Openshaw et al.1989: 13). Attention should be drawn to the three Annual Reports of the Hazardous Waste Inspectorate (now merged with other branches of the DoE to form Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution). These contain some valuable material on disposal practices, and volumes of waste generated and disposed of by each waste regulation authority (WRA)— counties in England, districts in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Each WRA is required to produce a waste disposal plan and these are starting to appear. They too contain useful material on, for instance, the locations of sites, though individual site licences must be consulted for details of what each is permitted to take in the way of hazardous wastes. What is not known is information on the locations of former sites, at which quite toxic materials may have been dumped, though recent work by Egger (1989) in Austria has mapped a vast number of such sites. It is these, rather than existing, licensed sites which should be a focus of research activity, particularly when examining possible links to ill health. We simply do not have enough evidence yet to back up the claim that ‘people are almost certainly ill, dead, or dying because of these sloppy waste disposal activities’(Openshaw et al.1989: 12). Research is in progress, however, to assess possible health effects of poor incineration (Diggle et al.1990). Particular attention should be focused on hospital incinerators, since these have been subject to Crown immunity for many years and most are technically ill-equipped to burn at sufficiently high temperatures for adequate disposal of wastes (Gatrell and Lovett 1991). We need to produce an inventory of all such sites, together with a publicly available, comprehensive database on all sites accepting hazardous industrial wastes. Emergency planning It is convenient to retain the nuclear/non-nuclear distinction when discussing the background to emergency planning. Nuclear emergency planning in the UK has been reviewed by Matthews and Pepper (1981). Nuclear power stations must prepare a plan and submit this to the Nuclear Installations Inspectorate and Health and Safety Executive for approval. Evacuation plans are required to cover an area within a distance of 2.4 km; these detail the roles to be played by the emergency services. The very narrow emergency planning zones contrast with those in the USA (Collins 1981), where planning is required up to 16 km from the site to cover exposure to radiation plumes. Local authorities in the UK that have declared themselves ‘nuclear-free’ have been highly critical of British planning, calling for an extension of emergency zones to at least 24 km. Zeigler et al.(1983) should be consulted for material  relating to evacuation behaviour in the wake of the incident at Three Mile Island. In the UK little work of any description seems to have been done on human behaviour in the aftermath of releases of hazardous substances, nor is much available on public attitudes to emergency planning. Indeed, no major studies of evacuation due to hazards have been undertaken in recent times and this is a widely recognized deficiency which no research funding body seems willing to rectify. In the USA on the other hand, a good deal of useful research in these areas has been undertaken. This research is brought together in very useful reports produced by the Oak Ridge National Laboratory, Tennessee (Sorenson et al.1987; Vogt and Sorenson 1987) and the Disaster Research Centre, University of Delaware. Perry (1985) has written an interesting book on emergency planning and evacuation, covering both natural and technological hazards. For him, comprehensive emergency planning and management involve: prevention, protection, response and restoration. By prevention we understand the elimination or reduction in risk, perhaps by adequate zoning or safe routeing of shipments, for instance. Included in protection are methods for detecting likely hazard events and in warning those likely to be affected. Response includes search and rescue (including the need to cope with secondary threats such as contamination of water supplies after an explosion, or fire following an earthquake). As Perry and others have noted, relatively few resources are devoted to the first two aspects, the bulk going to response and restoration (rebuilding). It should be clear from this brief description that these issues are inherently geographical. In one of the few studies of evacuation behaviour after a non-nuclear hazard event Liverman and Wilson (1981) give weight to this argument. In 1979 a train carrying chlorine, liquid petroleum, toluene and propane was derailed in Mississauga, Ontario, causing a series of explosions. This led to the evacuation of 250 000 people which, although staggered over several days, led to great pressure on transport arteries. An important finding was that many relied on their own transport and went to stay with friends and relatives some distance away, rather than relying on the 19 official evacuation reception centres. Despite this, the evacuation was successful, partly because the accident occurred at a weekend and the immediately affected area was sparsely populated. In addition, the police were well prepared, stimulated largely by implementing a plan designed more to cope with an emergency at the nearby Toronto International Airport than for the event in question. It is not without interest to note that in the USA there is a Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), established in 1978, charged with dealing with all types of emergency planning and management. In the UK there is no equivalent, though the spate of disasters in the past 4 years (involving over 1000 lives lost) has led to several calls for such a national body to be established. Natural hazards In this short space it is not possible to go into any depth on the nature of particular natural hazards but only to highlight those aspects relevant to GIS. Needless to say, the study of natural hazards is important, a statement brought into sharp focus by the fact that natural hazards account for up to 4 per cent of total deaths in the world each year (Mitchell, 1974). In 1970, for example, more than 200 000 people died in the cyclone and flooding of Bangladesh and in 1979 the hurricanes David and Frederick caused more than $3bn damage in the USA. Shah (1983) made a comprehensive investigation of natural disaster reports for the period 1974–80 and concluded that both disaster frequency and magnitude (measured in terms of lives lost) are increasing. High death tolls are still a characteristic of less developed, low-income countries. Surprisingly, fog is the third most important hazard in Europe after floods and volcanoes. Research on natural hazards has a long tradition in geography going back more than half a century. Much of the impetus for such research arose in the USA from observations on river basin management and the need to reduce flood damage. The vast majority of natural hazards studies have ignored the physical nature of the events per se and have concentrated on behavioural issues such as the perception and estimation of hazards. This emphasis is partly due to the background of the researchers involved (many are human geographers and sociologists) and partly because it is only really since the Second World War that major hazards have been monitored systematically, culminating, of course, in the last decade or so in the use of satellite technology. Brief reference to two examples of natural hazards may illustrate the potential relevance of a GIS approach, applications of which are considered below. Jones et al.(1989) have examined the distribution of some 8500 landslides in the UK. Their maps show clearly an increased propensity for landsliding in the north and west of the UK. More to the point, however, is the fact that this distribution can be modelled in terms of slopes, rainfall, rock types and so on. In other words the actual hazard distribution can be understood and areas at risk identified. The potential benefits to insurance companies, engineers and planners are clear. Second, a well-known winter hazard in the UK, with marked spatial localization, is fog. Predictive models of its distribution have clear implications for road and air safety. Perry (1981) describes a fog potential index that is a function of local topography, environmental features affecting fog formation and distance from standing water bodies. Reliance is currently placed on a network of monitoring stations, often sparsely located and frequently outside fog-prone areas; GIS could implement a predictive model based on digitized map features and indeed the model could also be used in site allocation studies for airports and the like. The majority of natural hazard research has focused on single hazards but of course any area may be prone to more than one hazard type. This idea led Hewitt and Burton (1971) to develop the concept of ‘all-hazards-at-a-place’. To achieve this they concentrated on the whole spectrum of damaging events in an area and explored their aggregate impact. The implications for GIS in the development of ‘hazardousness’ indices are obvious and if time-series data are available there is the potential to produce a variety of probability maps. The collection of historical data on natural hazards is important since it is clear that their spatial pattern varies through time. Many areas that appear to be hazard-free on current maps may merely by passing through a temporary period of quiescence. This is perhaps best illustrated with reference to earthquakes. For example, in 1692, the whole of southern England was affected by an earthquake whose epicentre was located in what is now Belgium; a good deal of minor structural damage was inflicted (Morse 1983). Presumably the builders of the Channel Tunnel are aware of this? Environmental epidemiology This is, of course, a vast subject area, embracing the impact of the natural and technological environments on human health. It covers, for instance , the associations between water and air pollution and ill health, links between geological and pedological environments and ill health, as well as associations between specific technological hazards (e.g. high-voltage power lines) and possible health effects. We can only consider a small fraction of this work here; little consideration is given to occupational environments, for instance. In the UK such research is widespread though there are specialist environmental epidemiology research institutes at Southampton and Cardiff (funded by the Medical Research Council), and others at the University of Surrey (Robens Institute) and at the London School for Hygiene and Tropical Medicine. The latter houses the Small Area Health Statistics Research Unit (SAHSRU), which has a specific remit to conduct research into morbidity and mortality at local scales (Elliot 1988). The SAHSRU liaises closely with OPCS. The kinds of databases used by these groups are discussed below. Greenberg (1983) and a collection of papers in Greenberg (1987) review some of the literature on environmental epidemiology. It seems worth stating at the outset that there are two ways geographical research in this general area can proceed. One is to collect morbidity and mortality data (usually the latter is more widely available, though the former more useful) and to examine spatial distributions for clustering. This has itself generated a substantial literature (see the papers in Elliot 1988 for an overview) and is nowhere better exemplified than in Openshaw's geographical analysis machine (see Ch. 2). We then search retrospectively for evidence of possible environmental associations. An alternative approach is to begin by hypothesizing an environmental determinant of ill health and to collect data to test an explicit hypothesis. If an association is suggested then we would want to collect data in other areas to assess the hypothesis further. Of course, these  two approaches are not clear-cut in practice; in many cases the hypotheses of interest will have themselves been generated by inductive mapping. One example of an hypothesis which has been given serious attention in recent years is the possible link between electromagnetic fields generated by high-voltage power lines or supply cables and ill health. Some work (Perry et al.1981) suggested associations with mental illness and suicide, while others (e.g. Wertheimer and Leeper 1982) have examined links to various cancers, including leukaemias. A good bibliography is provided in Perry and Pearl (1988). The Central Electricity Generating Board (now privatized and split into two companies) is funding a large-scale, 2-year project to assess links to childhood cancer, while another recently announced study aims to look at links to sudden infant death. One obvious problem, with implications for any GIS input, is that the effects are highly localized, with little measurable field effect more than a few dozen metres away from the route centre-lines. Accuracy of digital data collection (either of the power lines or residential locations) is paramount. There seems to be a growing interest in examining associations between ill health and the geological environment. GIS work in this field (e.g. Matthews 1989) is reviewed later, but we note here the work of the applied geochemistry group at Imperial College (responsible for a series of atlases on regional geochemistry) and the existence of a Society for Environmental Geochemistry and Health. One area of recent debate concerns radon gas and its links to lung cancer. This is taken very seriously in the USA, where the Environmental Protection Agency estimates that 10 000–20 000 deaths from lung cancer each year are due to radon gas exposure. Estimates from Scandinavia suggest that 10–30 per cent of such deaths are caused by exposure to radon (Richardson 1988: 270–81). The gas is trapped in well-insulated houses and is produced by the decay of uranium in rocks and soil; thus it has been measured at high concentrations in parts of Cornwall and Devon. There are great difficulties in assessing health effects, however, since exposure varies greatly from house to house within small neighbourhoods. Carefully designed case-control studies are therefore required to measure the separate effect of radon exposure after controlling for smoking behaviour and other risk factors. Other health concerns which might merit attention by those involved in the Regional Research Laboratory (RRL) initiative include air and water pollution. The debate about lead pollution from vehicle exhaust emissions is well known; less publicity has been given to PAHs (polychlorinated aromatic hydrocarbons), a ubiquitous product of combustion processes and known to be carcinogenic (Lioy and Daisey 1987). Research at the North West Regional Research Laboratory (NWRRL) aims to create buffers around busy roads and junctions and to use data from the Cancer Registry to examine possible links between proximity to such sources of pollution and prevalence of lung cancer. Those with an interest in health and air pollution should note the availability of a very detailed database from the Warren Springs Laboratory, containing details of smoke and sulphur dioxide emissions at a large number of sites in the UK. The possible link between nitrates in water and stomach cancer is  the subject of much debate (Beresford 1985), as is the association between aluminium content and Alzheimer's disease. The problems of assessing such links are, of course, huge, but there is scope for a contribution. The role of GIS in hazard management scenarios — examples As we have already implied, GIS has a role to play in all aspects of hazard research, from hazard monitoring, risk assessment and emergency planning to coping with an event and evaluating its consequences. The examples described below illustrate all these, though as yet there do not appear to be many instances of disasters in the management of which GIS has played a significant part. Technological hazards, emergency planning and GIS A considerable amount of research has been undertaken to apply GIS methods to evacuation scenarios around hazardous sites. Much of this research has concentrated on network analysis of the road system. Reference was made above to so-called CIMAH sites, major hazardous installations for which on-site and off-site emergency plans must be prepared. Early research at the NWRRL focused on developing a GIS for use by the police and county emergency planning officers in Cumbria that would aid in the management of a possible explosion at a chemical factory in Whitehaven, west Cumbria (Vincent et al.1988; Dunn 1989). The police required a portable system that could be implemented on an IBM-compatible microcomputer. This was written at the NWRRL using FORTRAN 77 and the Graphical Kernel System. The GIS is menu-based and is exceptionally user-friendly (Pl. 10.1). It opens with an outline map and the superimposition of the rather rigid zones used by the emergency planners. Full zoom facilities are available at any stage. In any emergency it is of course vital to have high-quality data on the distribution of population and resources. The system incorporates digitized data on the distribution of all domestic and non-domestic properties in the town together with digitized road centre-line data. Both sets of data were provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd, who are undertaking this digitizing task for the entire country. Other spatially referenced data incorporated into the system include those on the distribution of schools, medical and transport services which can be displayed and supplementary information about them obtained. The GIS permits population estimates to be made for any arbitrary rectangular region on the map. Most significantly, it incorporates a shortest path algorithm which uses the road network to find optimal routes between user-defined start and end nodes. Although predating the RRL initiative by several years — and, indeed the emergence of GIS as a major research area — we should remind ourselves  of Openshaw's work on appraising nuclear reactor sites. Using what would now be called GIS skills, Openshaw (1980) examined over 13 000 1 km grid squares in the UK which intersect the coastline and related these to data from the 1971 Census (which were made available for such grid squares). He demonstrated that there is an abundance of ‘remote’ sites, in contrast to the official view that such sites were increasingly hard to find. He suggested that in early spatial searches for sites ‘only a small number were ever identified in the first place because rigorous searches could not be performed by manual means with poor quality data’(Openshaw 1980: 289). Heywood and Cornelius (1989) have shown how GIS can be used for monitoring possible radiation releases and thus the relevance of GIS in nuclear emergency planning and monitoring. They propose a national radiological spatial information system and, in a pilot project in Cumbria, have integrated several layers of data within ARC/INFO to show what this might involve (Fig. 10.2). Such data include those from the Population and Agricultural Censuses as well as point data from rain gauge sites and radiation monitoring stations. As an example, the system is used to determine restriction zones for the movement of sheep after the explosion at Chernobyl in 1986. This is done by finding areas of high rainfall and parishes with high sheep populations. The map overlay of point and area information shows generally good agreement with the restriction zones imposed by the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, with the exception of a small area to the south-east of Cumbria, bordering on Lancashire. The British government carried out a review of its arrangements for handling nuclear accidents overseas following the Chernobyl accident. The DoE, through Her Majesty's Inspectorate of Pollution (HMIP), was given the task of co-ordinating a national response plan, installing the radiation monitoring network and acting as lead government department in an emergency (HMSO 1988). The monitoring network has become known as the radioactive incident monitoring network (RIMNET) and has, as its prime responsibility, the detection of abnormal increases in radiation levels within the UK of the kind that might arise from an overseas nuclear accident. The full implementation of the RIMNET system will take some time. By the end of 1988 gamma radiation dose monitors had been installed at 46 meteorological stations as part of phase 1 of the development programme. Radiation readings are taken every hour at each station and are transmitted to a central computer which analyses the data. The current criterion for alert is two readings of more than three times normal background, either successively at the same site or simultaneously at two adjacent sites. The dissemination of information in the event of an incident is dealt with at three levels: the first is the normal system of press notices; the second is the use of teletext and viewdata (Ceefax and Prestel) to get direct to members of the public at their homes or places of work; the third is the use of Telecom Gold electronic mail to get more technical details to various official bodies, such as water authorities (Jackson 1989). Phase 2 of the RIMNET scheme will be completed by the end of 1991 when between 80 and 90 monitoring sites will have been established. Given very wide regional and local variations in deposition, questions must be raised about the effectiveness of such a small network; local authorities will need to supplement it with their own networks. There are important analytical problems to be addressed concerning the siting of such monitoring equipment and these are elaborated on later. Abroad, Kaspar (1981) has discussed a computer-based exercise, with GIS overtones, involving the simulated evacuation of the population living in the vicinity of the Neckarwestheim nuclear power plant in Baden Württemberg. In the scenario he outlines, an area affected by radioactive releases is determined, the population within that area is allocated to reception areas (with capacity constraints), evacuation routes are identified and traffic restrictions implemented. Little detail is provided, however, and it is thus difficult to evaluate his work fully. Dangermond (1985) describes the use of the ARC/INFO NETWORK module for use in emergency planning situations. He describes how a road network is digitized and subsequently analysed using allocation, districting and routeing algorithms. Allocation determines which arcs in the network will be allocated to a particular node or centre; districting makes it possible to outline rapidly sets of polygons in order to define specific areas of interest (districts) and to summarize their characteristics; routeing provides a minimum path algorithm through the network, the arcs of which can be assigned weights according to road conditions, road capacity and so on. Dangermond gives several examples in his paper including the use of NETWORK for the allocation of emergency vehicles, optimum routeing of fire engines from garages to the accident scene and the movement of spills through sewers and river networks. When combined with the other facilities in ARC/INFO, quite complex disaster management scenarios can be handled. For example, earthquake fault zones can be combined with data on housing density and structural details to predict earthquake damage levels and these data then related to the network model. Vincent (1989) illustrates the use of ARC/INFO and its NETWORK module for finding safe routes for chlorine transhipment on the road and rail systems of north-west England (Pl. 10.2). In this case, population density data for a 1 km buffer on either side of network arcs were overlaid on the network itself so as to act as weights for the minimum path algorithm. Chosen routes were those which minimized population rather than distance. Hazardous waste disposal There can be little doubt that a GIS approach has wide applicability in all sorts of location problems where the goal is to minimize (rather than, as conventionally, maximize) accessibility to a population. A particularly good application is to the search for potential sites for the disposal of nuclear and non-nuclear (but none the less hazardous) wastes. We discuss here some relevant work on the siting of facilities for the disposal of nuclear wastes before examining those for non-nuclear wastes. The major contribution to informed debate about the search for sites for the disposal of nuclear wastes has come from a group of geographers (Openshaw et al.1989) and a GIS approach to this problem can pay high dividends. The work of Carver (see Openshaw et al.1989: Ch. 7) is an interesting example. One advantage is the ability to model a range of alternatives by allowing particular criteria to enter or be omitted from the polygon overlay operation. Conceptually, what is offered is little more than an automated ‘sieve mapping’ that land-use planners have used for many years, but the whole procedure is speeded up by many orders of magnitude using GIS software. The authors examine both near-surface sites and deep repositories (which use more restricted population criteria and allow offshore locations to enter). Data layers include geological maps, conservation areas, transport routes, petrochemical facilities and demographic data. As different layers are added sequentially we see how the proportion of available land shrinks (Pl. 10.3); for instance, when geological criteria are set in the search for a deep repository, 25 per cent of land area remains and the addition of the population density layer reduces this to 24 per cent . However, adding a proximity to transport constraint lowers this to 12 per cent; and so on . We cannot pretend GIS is a solution to the political problems of negotiation and justification but at the very least the openness of the procedures goes some way towards satisfying a worried public. GIS research into site selection for non-nuclear hazardous waste has been almost exclusively conducted in North America and has yet to be matched in the UK. Jensen and Christiansen (1986), working in the south-eastern USA, use a raster approach (with a pixel resolution of 20 m&sup2;) and Boolean overlay to ‘weed out’ particular sites, such as those which are poorly drained, environmentally sensitive or inaccessible (see also Stewart 1987). Environmental monitoring of sites for the disposal of toxic waste is of particular concern in the USA. The Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) legislation of 1980 (‘Superfund’) requires the cleaning up of the worst landfill sites, of which some 800 had been identified by the Environmental Protection Agency by 1986 (Foresman 1986). A major worry has been the threat posed by groundwater pollution and some research has been conducted on using GIS to monitor this (Merchant et al.1987; Barringer et al.1987; von Braun 1988). This is an important topic since 95 per cent of rural households in the USA consume only groundwater, while half the US population consumes at least some groundwater (Merchant et al.1987). Clearly, the research demands access to exceptionally good environmental data, usually in three dimensions. As Foresman (1986) suggests, we might expect remote sensing technology to play a major role. Merchant et al.(1987) for example, use the image processing system ERDAS to construct an index of vulnerability to groundwater pollution; this uses variables such as depth to water table, soil type, slope and so on (see Estes et al.1987 for a similar approach). Barringer et al.(1987) overlay data on soil type and geology with that of groundwater quality (hardness and corrosivity measures) and build a linear model which shows that the background environmental variables are good predictors of the water quality indices. Again, a raster-based approach is used. A further example is work by von Braun (1988) who uses pMAP to look at exposure of organic and metallic compounds in groundwater in the vicinity of Tucson airport, Arizona. Using plume models that predict the movement of contaminants she is able to intersect the results with data on current well locations and to assess which water supply areas are worst contaminated. Overlaying the results with residential location data provides ‘maps delineating location-specific exposures for each residence in each time-period’(von Braun 1988; 1160). In principle, it is then possible to compare such ‘doses’ with epidemiological data, once again indicating a link from a hazard event to assessment of health outcomes. Attention should be drawn to Foresman's comment that the US Geological Survey (USGS)(at the EROS Data Centre) have successfully linked ARC/INFO to a model of groundwater flow (Foresman 1986: 260). This kind of link between GIS and other modelling programs is to be warmly welcomed and parallels work at the NWRRL in linking GIS and air pollution plume models. Natural hazards and disaster management Several studies in recent papers have shown the effectiveness of GIS in mitigating the effects of major natural hazards. Berke and Ruch (1985), for example, describe a GIS for assessing the impacts of hurricanes on the Texas Gulf coast. Hurricane damage through high winds and tidal surges causes an immense amount of destruction and poses a major threat to many coastal communities in the USA. It has been estimated, for example, that during the mid 1970s some 50 million US citizens were subject to hurricane winds of over 160 km/h and 6 million were subject to hurricane surge (Brinkman 1975). The system described by Berke and Ruch (1985) is raster-based and has an interesting modelling component called SLOSH (Sea, Lake and Overland Surges from Hurricanes). SLOSH is able to estimate still water surge by grid cell for various hurricane intensities, angles of approach to the shoreline, forward movement speeds and landfall locations. Additional algorithms are used to model total building damage costs for each grid cell based on water-depth and speed-depth rating curves. Hobeika and Jamei (1985) describe the MASSeVACuation (MASSVAC) simulation software designed to analyse and evaluate traffic evacuation plans given a natural disaster in an urban area. The system comprises three interrelated modules: community and disaster type characteristics module; population distribution module; network evacuation module. The type of natural disaster determines the time period within which the road network has to be evacuated. The control and management strategies are directly correlated to each specific disaster scenario. MASSVAC is quite flexible and various user-defined road network options are available such as: traffic signal timings on the road network; one-way traffic; reserved lanes for special vehicles such as those of the emergency services. Hobeika and Jamei have tested MASSVAC on various evacuation scenarios for Virginia Beach City in order to determine evacuation times for flood and hurricane conditions. In general, they suggest that the model provided reasonable and reliable evacuation times. Southworth et al.(1989) have enhanced the MASSVAC model with the addition of a colour graphics module which they call MVOPL. This module has been developed using IBM's Graphics Kernel System and provides a number of display screens. The most interesting are those which portray population flows as scaled ribbons on the network diagram, and evacuation shelter capacities as bar diagrams. The diagrams are updated periodically during the course of the simulation. In dry parts of the world, such as Australia, forest and bush fires are an important natural hazard and some attention has been given to the ways in which GIS might help examine their potential impacts. Kessell (1988) describes a PC-based GIS called PREPLAN (PRistine Environment Planning LANguage) which is a natural area management, land-use planning and fire modelling system developed for the Australian National Parks and Wildlife Service, PREPLAN comprises four modules: a simple raster-based GIS; a grid cell resource database; a wide range of vegetation, fuel, fire behaviour, erosion and land-use models; tabular, statistical and colour graphics output system. With this system real-time fire growth can be modelled, taking into account changes in terrain, fuel and temporal changes in the weather. Kessell points out that uncontrollable fires are recurrent phenomena in many parts of Australia, causing damage in the hundreds of millions of dollars and significant loss of life. Systems such as PREPLAN can provide the user with sound models of the behaviour patterns of fire and are therefore of enormous value in land-use planning. One of the most widespread natural hazards is flooding, and the potential for loss of property, risk to life and general social disruption is large. One interesting example of a GIS approach to flood damage estimation is the ANUFLOOD package which was developed in the early 1980s following detailed flood damage studies for flood-prone coastal towns in northern New South Wales, Australia (Smith and Greenaway, 1988). The ANUFLOOD system requires locational and building type data on individual properties, stage-damage curves relating the average damage that would result from overfloor flooding to differing depths for each property type, and lastly, flood frequency in terms of flood height expressed as a probability. Output from the system is both tabular and graphical. Of particular interest is the construction of maps showing the expected annual amounts of damage for gridded flood-prone areas. ANUFLOOD also contains modules which permit the investigation of various flood damage mitigation options, such as property height raising, levee construction and flood proofing. Environmental epidemiology The possibilities sketched above relate to emergency planning, the search for hazardous sites, and risk assessment. To what extent can GIS help if an event occurs? What, for instance, of the health consequences? There is a rich tradition of epidemiological work in geography and with the increasing availability of spatially referenced medical data the scope for GIS applications is wide (Gatrell 1987). For instance, Diggle et al.(1990) assess the hypothesis that cancer of the larynx is associated with proximity to a now-closed incinerator and develop a statistical model from the theory of spatial point processes to test this. This would have been impossible without the link provided from postcoded data (increasingly available from sources such as cancer registries) to Ordnance Survey (OS) grid references. Such a link is provided by the Central Postcode Directory, which matches all 1.5 million unit postcodes in the UK to grid references. When the cases of laryngeal cancer are compared with a null distribution (provided by the distribution of much more common lung cancer) the hypothesis is given strong support. Although the proposed method is novel, it is but one of an increasingly large number of methods designed to detect and model ‘clusters’ of disease (see, for example, Cuzick and Edwards 1990). The work of Diggle et al.(1990) examined only a single point source, though it generalizes to multiple sources and to linear hazards as well. As a second example of health work linked to hazard studies we may cite the research being conducted by Cross (1989) on childhood leukaemia. There are numerous hypotheses concerning the aetiology of this disease (from ionizing radiation to viral transmission) and Cross's approach is to collect digital data designed to test some of these hypotheses and to use ARC/INFO to display and analyse results. For instance, one hypothesis concerns the role of electromagnetic radiation, a source of which is overhead high-voltage transmission lines as noted earlier. If these are digitized and buffer zones constructed around them (Fig. 10.3) we can quite easily test hypotheses about prevalence in such buffer zones as compared with prevalence outside. However, we should bear in mind the earlier point about the resolution of the data, since such electromagnetic effects have a very weak effect beyond perhaps 50 m (Wertheimer and Leeper 1982). There has been a suspicion for many years that high rates of stomach cancer in parts of Wales may be linked to soil chemistry, specifically such factors as zinc/copper ratios, and to lead content in water supplies. Matthews (1989) has used data from the Regional Cancer Registry (morbidity rather than mortality data) and data on trace elements to examine this link. Since the latter are available for a 5 km raster the registration data are assigned to these grid squares using the OS grid reference. As with any such study there are the usual problems of ecological analysis and influences of migration, together with issues of separating out the risk factors under investigation from possible confounding factors. In the USA, Morrill's report on the beginnings of a $15m. study into the possible radiation doses received as result of radiation releases by the Hanford (Washington State) nuclear complex would seem to cry out for GIS skills to be applied (Morrill 1989). The research project will employ plume dispersion models in order to model dispersal by wind and will need to integrate this and other environmental data with detailed demographic records. To some extent this line of approach was anticipated by Johnson (1981) in his study of exposure to plutonium fall-out from the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant near Denver (see Zeigler et al.1983: 47–8). Using soil samples he constructed a contoured risk surface and then mapped excess cancers in various distance bands, detecting a marked distance decay effect. Research problems and prospects The work reviewed above suggests that the application of GIS techniques to hazard assessment, emergency planning and environmental monitoring is both actually and potentially an important research area with many challenging problems. Undoubtedly, the GISs of the 1990s will look very different from their rather primitive ancestors. Computer power is becoming cheaper, digital data more readily available, and GISs are becoming hybrid systems involving other technologies. In this last section we highlight some important research areas as we see them. Doubtless there are many others, such is the surge of interest in GIS technology. Data availability We should first consider the availability and quality of data concerning the populations who may be at risk from the storage and transport of hazardous substances, from toxic air pollution, from flooding and so on. Such data are crucial, either for assisting the emergency services to make assessments about resources they need to deploy in such events, or for high-quality estimates to be made of risk. Within the public domain in the UK we must rely in general on data from the most recent Population Census, the lowest level being that for enumeration districts (EDs). As is well known (Rhind 1983) these contain  on average perhaps 150–200 households and 400–500 people. The boundaries of EDs have not been widely digitized, unlike the higher-level electoral wards. However, the centroids of EDs are available as 100 m grid references and artificial ED ‘polygons’ can be created if necessary. In some instances such data will suffice; in many cases they will have to suffice as nothing better is available. But in some areas EDs are very extensive physical units and the shapes will be quite distorted. Furthermore, the scales at which population estimates are often required means that even EDs are too coarse for risk assessments. For instance, in performing its quantitative risk assessments the Health and Safety Executive will rarely deal with distances from hazardous sites in excess of 1 km (Petts 1988) and census data will not offer sufficient resolution for accurate population estimates to be made. It should be pointed out, however, that the National Radiological Protection Board currently uses 1 km grid square resolution population data from the 1971 Census in its radiological protection studies (Hallam et al.1981). It would seem that, despite the costs involved, they should consider investing in the very detailed digital data (Pinpoint Address Code (PAC)) provided by Pinpoint Analysis Ltd. This area of application would appear to be an obvious market for such a product. A useful research exercise would be to compare the use of census and PAC data in deriving quantitative risk assessments and this is an interesting research problem. Even with PAC data some assumptions would need to be made about numbers of persons per household if good population estimates were to be made. More generally, we need to consider the availability of large databases for hazard studies and emergency planning and this is an area ripe for major initiatives. In the UK we seem to be lagging well behind the USA in the construction of databases on hazardous sites and especially hazard events such as those involving toxic releases. For instance, Lioy and Daisey (1987), in their work on the monitoring of toxic air pollution in New Jersey, construct what they term a ‘microinventory’ for each of three towns, comprising the locations of chemical plants, metal processing plants, paint spray manufacturers and so on . Some attribute information is available for these. More closely linked to GIS is work by McMaster and Johnson (1986) who perform a very detailed inventory of hazardous materials (both stored and transported) in Santa Monica, California. Although the raster displays are very crude it is simple to answer spatial queries concerning the locations of people (for instance, particular age groups) within certain distances of toxic hazard sites. We have data on some hazardous sites (e.g. those regulated by CIMAH) in the UK but a much more comprehensive approach should be adopted, especially if we are serious in the search for environmental associations with chronic diseases. The same is true for toxic releases. In the USA the Environmental Protection Agency produces an Acute Hazards Events Database while the Department of Transportation has a database recording details of 25 000 releases of toxic materials; such details include locational information, type and amount of material released, mode of release and resulting injuries or  deaths (Cutter and Solecki 1989). Can we not use GIS technology to construct ‘risk mosaics’(Zeigler et al.1983), at a variety of spatial scales, akin to Hewitt and Burton's ‘hazardousness’ of a place? In the UK only a handful of county emergency planning departments (Cumbria, for instance) have built up resource databases in digital form and this needs to be promoted. Further afield, we need to recognize that some disasters (most obviously Chernobyl) will have implications for more than one country so that environmental monitoring should take place with some kind of international co-ordination. There will also be movements of hazardous cargoes across frontiers and there are clearly problems of risk assessment and planning for emergencies at or near international boundaries, or at sea and airports. As noted above, the work of Fedra (1989) is a major step in this direction, and links need to be forged between initiatives in the UK and the rest of Europe. In terms of databases on hazardous wastes, attention has already been drawn to the waste disposal plans prepared by WRAs. These give details of present site locations and some indication of permitted wastes, though little or no information on closed and abandoned sites. However, for details of disposal the individual site licences must be consulted. The former Hazardous Waste Inspectorate operated a large database on all sites, with details of permitted wastes, including allowable quantities. The database was created by a commercial company, Aspinwalls Ltd. There are numerous potentially usable databases for environmental epidemiological work. OPCS, of course, is a major data repository for medical statistics and their various Monitor Series are of use, though only at the scale of district health authority and above (see Gatrell and Lovett 1988 for an example). Regional health authorities will from time to time produce mortality data at ward level. However, if cancers are of interest it is more appropriate to obtain data from regional cancer registries; these data are morbidity rather than mortality data and are therefore more valuable. The data are postcoded and may have some occupational details. For example, we have received data from the Regional Cancer Registry in Manchester comprising all cancers of the larynx and lung notified between 1974 and 1984. This large data set, to which grid references have now been added, comprises information about nearly 40 000 individuals. It has now been copied into INGRES, a relational database management system, permitting queries to be made about subsets of the data; for instance, all males between the ages of 25 and 64 suffering from laryngeal cancer. Other data sources on cancers are independent registries of malignancies. An example is that on leukaemias, managed by the Leukaemia Research Fund Centre in Leeds (Alexander et al.1989). It should be noted that there are frequently major discrepancies between the regional registries and the specialist registries, partly because the latter receive notifications directly from consultants. Indeed, working directly with consultants proves invaluable in gaining access to high-quality morbidity data. Two other potential sources of data are worth mentioning. First, attention  should be drawn to the new directive from the Department of Health to regional and district health authorities to review the health of the population. This means in practice that district medical officers are charged with preparing an annual report, presenting and interpreting epidemiological data, identifying local health problems and evaluating service outcomes. Lancaster University is already heavily involved in the work of Preston District Health Authority in this area. Second, family health service authorities (FHSAs), are also required to take on these roles, but from the viewpoint of primary health care services. FHSAs (which correspond to non-metropolitan counties and to metropolitan boroughs) hold large databases on services provided by general practitioners; for instance, uptake of immunization and screening for breast and cervical cancers. Is it, we wonder, possible to contemplate bringing together some of these data sources to form a National Online Health Information System (NOHIS), to parallel that for employment and unemployment (Townsend et al.1987)? This might include data on morbidity and mortality, uptake of preventative medicine, service use and availability, at both primary and hospital level. It would be a useful management tool, particularly in view of the reorganization taking place in the National Health Service. It should not be forgotten that hazards themselves have geographical distributions yet there has been little effort in the UK to develop public domain databases. Are there hazard-prone areas? Is there a regional differentiation in hazard type? These are, of course, commercially important questions and a good deal of money is going into the collection of such data by insurance companies. One well known database is Major Hazard Incident Data Service (MHIDAS) global industrial hazards database which is currently being developed by the Safety and Reliability Directorate on behalf of the Major Hazards Assessment Unit of the UK Health and Safety Directorate. This system currently runs in dBASE II and contains in excess of 3000 items of professionally assessed information on major hazards coded into some 24 separate fields. Unfortunately, the spatial referencing is poor and with some effort this could easily be remedied. It is, for example, little use when recording a chemical spill into an Egyptian river to have entered into the appropriate field ‘the Nile’— after all, this river is some 6480 km long! Here, in our view, is a classic case of the absence of a geographical input rendering the data of limited value. In some cases, good hazard data exist but have simply not yet found their way into a GIS. A case in point is inland and coastal flooding. Most river authorities have detailed maps showing the geographical limits of floods in relation to their return periods. Within the next decade, as the privatized water companies develop their GIS, we shall see a massive amount of data conversion in this area. This development, together with the availability of digital terrain models, will allow quite sophisticated flood forecasting models to be developed within a GIS framework. As sea-levels rise in the next 20–30 years due to the ‘greenhouse’ effect, this very practical use of GIS technology is likely to become commonplace and of considerable practical importance. Spatial statistics Another way in which there needs to be a rapprochement between statistical methods and GIS is in the area of spatial sampling and estimation from spatial samples. This is clearly an important issue in radiation monitoring as the discussion of RIMNET above implies. As an example, Peirson (1988) has reviewed the evidence on artificial radioactivity in Cumbria and shows maps of the distribution of certain radionuclides as contoured surfaces. The point worth making here is that there are many alternative schemes for interpolating from irregular point data (Lam 1983). One method in particular, kriging (now available as part of the UNIRAS software), offers not only a contoured surface but also an estimate of the standard error at any point on the map. Where this is high it suggests that an additional sampling station might be set up. Such techniques are now standard in environmental science (see Streit 1981 for an application to rainfall monitoring) and need to be promoted vigorously in hazard studies (Estes et al.1987). Related to this problem is that of making population estimates for new zones that result from overlay operations. We may want to count numbers living within plumes, circles of fixed radius, buffer zones and so on. Existing GIS techniques usually base the estimates on area-weighted shares, so that a new polygon created by ‘slicing’ an existing area in half is assigned half the population of that source unit. This may be quite absurd in some cases, notably where population is spatially clustered within a physically large ED. At the NWRRL work is under way(Flowerdew and Green 1989) to solve such problems using the EM algorithm and the statistical modelling package GLIM, which has been interfaced with ARC/INFO. Operations research methods and simulation While there is some research activity in linking statistical models to GIS there would seem to be scope for further applications of operations research techniques to GIS problems. Within some sophisticated GIS such as ARC/INFO there are some useful algorithms (such as shortest path calculations), but GIS developers have in general failed to realize the natural links between GIS functions and many operations research techniques. Over the last 20 years or so a large theoretical literature has been developed to provide tools for the solution of many problems associated with emergency planning (Kolesar 1981). One important class of problems is the selection of locations for the emergency service units. The choice of locations need not be for permanent bases, but can also include dynamic repositioning of units as circumstances dictate (Kolesar and Walker 1974). In any major emergency a typical problem is the assignment of resources to demands. If resources are held at one set of locations and the demands are at another and the costs of transportation are known, how do we allocate the resources most efficiently? In a major emergency, for example, there might  be a need to supply blood products held at regional blood banks to hospitals. This, of course, is the classic transportation problem and its solution is well known. As far as we know the microcomputer-based emergency response system devised by Belardo et al.(1983), is the only GIS-like software to incorporate this algorithm. In this system, the solution to the transportation problem is shown graphically on the road network, which is displayed on the computer screen. As a last example of the potential role of operations research in GIS and disaster management we are reminded of the logistic problems that faced the Peel Regional Police Force during the Mississauga evacuation mentioned previously (Scanlon and Padgham 1980). During the early states of the phased evacuation the logistical problem facing the police was the street-by-street warning of the population to make ready for evacuation. Speed was of the essence and manpower was limited. Here, then, is a familiar operations research network problem: all roads have to be traversed such that the journey length/time is a minimum. This is the so-called Chinese postman problem, which provides a Hamiltonian circuit through the arcs (as compared with the travelling salesman problem which is a minimum route through the network nodes). In fact, the police force lacked access to any digital information and although the evacuation went off without a hitch there is little doubt that a GIS containing the Chinese postman algorithm could have provided efficient routes and also have guaranteed that no road was missed from the warning sweep. Simulating the likely consequences of real events is an important, but almost untouched, GIS research area. As an educational tool, simulation is not only an invaluable training aid for personnel who may one day be confronted with a real situation but is sometimes the only method for dealing with improbable but possible events. In the UK the Institution of Chemical Engineers has produced a computer simulation program specifically for training personnel at large chemical plants who may one day have to manage major fires and toxic releases (Institution of Chemical Engineers, no date). Although not a thoroughbred GIS, this package, based on an IBM PC, does make use of map data and site plans can be displayed. Decision support systems and GIS A decision support system (DSS) can be considered as an integration of computer hardware and software specifically designed to complement the human thought process in problem-solving, decision-making and information processing (Benbasat 1977). According to Berke and Stubbs (1989) a DSS can often be conceptualized as a tool to be used as part of an interactive learning process allowing the user to undertake ‘what if’ analyses and view the consequences of such alternatives. The basic components of a DSS comprise: data storage files; data analysis models; display and interactive use technology. These three components are  managed by: a data management subsystem; a model management subsystem; and an interactive dialogue subsystem. Berke and Stubbs indicate that the interactive dialogue subsystem and the display and interactive use component are particularly critical for the effective use of a DSS because they provide the interaction between the user and the machine. These features isolate the user from the technicalities of the computer and encourage a dialogue based on the user's judgements rather than imposing the hardware engineer's or computer programmer's discipline on the user. In this sense ARC/INFO macros, do, to a certain extent, shield the novice from a bewildering number of options, though such a system is most certainly not conversational and in several respects is very simple as compared with a comprehensive DSS. The integration of GIS and DSS for hazard mitigation is an active research area in the USA, Japan and Europe. Dong et al.(1988), for example, have developed microcomputer-based DSS for earthquake hazard mitigation. This system provides a map display of the threatened region and access to spatially referenced data to facilitate hazard zoning for a given earthquake magnitude. In addition, the software calculates damage estimates and building repair costs for any geographical area. Fedra and Reitsma (1989) describe a DSS-GIS developed by the Advanced Computer Applications group at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA), Austria, which provides an interactive, graphics-oriented framework and post-processor for the risk assessment package SAFETI (Technica 1984). Raw data such as plant locations, weather data and population distribution can be displayed as overlays on a basic land-use map. The graphical interface provides a link to SAFETI's databases and consequence modelling and risk estimates and risk contours can be produced. Expert systems are likely to have a significant impact on DSS and GIS in hazard management (Fedra and Reitsma 1989). Important characteristics of expert systems are that they provide advice in problem-solving based on the knowledge of experts, facilitate learning through experience and allow the use of natural language processing. One of the most advanced applications of expert systems to DSS and GIS is a hazardous substances and industrial risk management system (IRIMS — Ispra Risk Management Support System) developed at IIASA in conjunction with the Joint Research Centre of the Commission of the European Communities at Ispra, Italy (Fedra et al.1987; Fedra 1986). This large system, designed for a SUN workstation has the following main elements: an intelligent user interface; an information system including knowledge bases, databases, inference machine and database management system; a simulation system; a DSS. The large geographical database held in the system covers Europe as far east as the Urals. Roads, railways, lakes, rivers, major settlements, chemical storage facilities and political boundaries can be displayed and used as overlays for the various modules that examine the impacts of chemical spills into the atmosphere and river systems. IRIMS uses a number of expert systems techniques including: a language input parser based on sideways chaining and rule values which allow Bayesian  probabilistic reasoning to identify possible user intentions/hypotheses; fuzzy set methods to translate uncertainty and ambiguity in the databases or user specifications into linguistic or graphical descriptions; and various rule-based pre- and post-processors to define appropriate context-dependent default input values. Even in this brief description of DSS it can be see that, as presently configured, most GIS are rather dumb systems requiring intelligent, very computer-literate users. But in an emergency or disaster situation, the knowledge base must be in the computer system and there should be no skill barrier to access the system. In this respect we believe that the next generation of GIS will be more akin to DSS than to sophisticated mapping packages, as is presently the case. The development of such GIS will surely be at the forefront of any research agenda. Real-time GIS The ultimate test of the role of GIS in emergency/hazard situations is their response time as external information is fed into the system. Two approaches can be adopted to minimize the response time: a simple approach is to devise portable GIS which can be taken to the hazard; a more complex solution is to couple the GIS to real-time monitoring systems. Probably the outstanding example of the portability approach is the USA's National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) award-winning emergency response package called CAMEO (NOAA 1988). The best implementation of CAMEO runs on an Apple Macintosh and makes full use of the Hypercard environment. The system comes with three components: CODEBREAKER which uses intelligent software to identify hazardous chemical labels, summarize the chemical properties and indicate health risks; MAP which can display digital and scanned maps of the incident site; AIR MODEL which is an atmospheric modelling program linked to CODEBREAKER and MAP. AIR MODEL also has the facility to link on-line to weather data sources and can estimate the scope of potential downwind hazard zones. CAMEO is designed to be carried on emergency vehicles and has undergone successful on-scene field trials with the Seattle Fire Department. An alternative approach to real-time monitoring is to develop software capable of receiving data from external monitoring systems. Southworth et al.(1989) describe an operational, prototype Real-time Traffic Monitoring and Analysis System (RTMAS) whose purpose is to record and warn of the build-up of significant urban population evacuation in times of threat. RTMAS integrates three software components: GURU, an expert system; AUTOBOX, a time-series module; CROSSTALK proprietary software for transferring traffic count data from roadside counters to the IBM PS2. In tracking an evacuation build-up, RTMAS collects and cumulates net traffic movements, building up a quantitative picture of the timing and directions of  evacuation. RTMAS has been developed for an IBM PS2/Model 80 connected via modem to software initiated by direct dial up to a sequence of traffic counters. Currently, the system monitors traffic movements in Florida and Georgia but ultimately national coverage could be achieved. Systems such as RTMAS have great practical potential in those emergency situations where there is likely to be self-evacuation by the public. For example, there were major traffic congestion problems, as a result of self-evacuation, during Hurricane Hugo which threatened large parts of the south-west of the USA in October 1989. In a similar vein, Martin (1989) describes work by Marconi Defence Systems which integrates an automatic vehicle location system with Marconi's GIS (called Tactic Plus). Emergency vehicles can be supplied with computers that track their spatial location. This information can be continuously monitored by a receiving station and then delivered to the map component of the GIS. What seems to be a very advanced GIS with real-time monitoring capacity for use in emergency planning has been recently developed by Plessey Defence Systems. The software, called GENERICS, is from the same stable as Plessey's defence and military research. Quite obviously, there is a good deal of, as yet, classified technology which might one day be available for all sorts of hazard mitigation purposes. Conclusions It is useful to return to the earlier typology of hazards (Fig. 10.1) and to stress the links that might be made between those working on natural hazards and those working in the socio-economic domains. There are several examples of natural hazards whose impact might benefit from a GIS perspective that cuts across the science-social science divide. These include snow and ice hazards, where impacts on transport and the need to plan road salting or gritting strategies are obvious (see Perry et al.1986 for the beginnings of a GIS approach). It would be foolish to imagine that GIS can assist in all hazard studies, emergencies and disasters. It is hard to imagine what role it could have played in the prevention or aftermath of events such as the Piper Alpha oil platform explosion in the North Sea, the Zeebrugge ferry disaster or the sinking of the Marchioness pleasure boat on the Thames, for instance. But it might have assisted in suggesting search areas for victims of the Lockerbie air crash and, at a very different scale, in helping firemen navigate their way around King's Cross underground rail station. Why, for instance, could there not be a library of scanned plans of all underground stations, showing the detailed topography and assisting fire personnel unfamiliar with the site to direct their efforts in the search for casualties? In general, however, GIS surely has a function to perform in simulation and role-playing exercises. The Cumbria emergency planning system outlined above can, for instance, be used as an experimental tool, permitting police  and emergency planners to simulate a hazard event and to call up information on resources, to identify possible areas for evacuation, to plan routes through the transport network, and so on . There must be many opportunities for user-friendly GIS to be employed in these kinds of scenarios, either as special-purpose systems or by employing proprietary GIS packages with easy-to-use macros. Anyone working in the GIS research field is conscious of the links that need to be made to groups of researchers in other disciplines. Nowhere, it seems, is this more apparent than in the area under consideration here. We need the skills of environmental scientists, statisticians, epidemiologists and chemical engineers, not to mention those of the geographer and planner. Given the spate of recent disasters, notably in the UK the time is ripe for a major initiative in the field of emergency planning and hazard studies.

ACA ACA-B2K-005 9.06 "SOLUTION-GENERATING TECHNIQUES For stationary axisymmetric space-times many solution-generating techniques are known. These are associated with the two Killing vectors, and with the internal symmetries of the Ernst equation. Colliding plane wave solutions also have two Killing vectors, and the main field equations can be transformed exactly to the Ernst equation. The main difference is that the solutions of the Ernst equation now contain the metric functions explicitly rather than the field potentials as in the stationary axisymmetric case. It is therefore to be expected that many of the familiar solution generating techniques can be used to obtain new colliding plane wave solutions from already known, or ‘seed’, solutions. In this chapter we will consider only vacuum solutions. This will enable us to continue to concentrate on the collision of gravitational waves. Various techniques will be discussed here, and the main solutions that have been obtained using them will be described in the next chapter. Many techniques are also known by which solutions of the Einstein-Maxwell equations, and other non-vacuum solutions, can be generated from known vacuum solutions. These will be discussed later in Chapter 15. The colinear case Consider first the case when the approaching waves have colinear polarization. The metric can be taken in the form of the line element (6.20) with . In this case, given any solution  of the field equations (6.22), then another solution of the same equations again with  is given by U ,V and M , where  (12.1) where a is an arbitrary constant. This transformation is well known (Halilsoy, 1985). It can clearly be seen that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions appropriate for colliding waves, then so does the new solution. It can also  be seen that the transformation (12.1) is equivalent to adding to V the Stoyanov solution (10.29). It may also be observed that the transformation (12.1) can be used to obtain the soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ) described in Section 10.4, using as seed the Khan Penrose solution. Ferrari and Ibañez, however, originally obtained their solution using the soliton techniques mentioned in Section 12.6. Another transformation which maps one colinear solution of (6.22) on another, whether or not they satisfy the boundary conditions, is given by  (12.2) where b is an arbitrary constant and . When , it can be seen that the transformation (12.2) is singular on the boundaries of the interaction region where  and . It follows that the necessary boundary conditions cannot be satisfied for both solutions, if the same expressions for f and g are used. If the seed solution satisfies the boundary conditions as described in Chapter 7, with  and M containing the terms  (12.3) with  (12.4) then the new solution containing the terms (7.10) will also satisfy the boundary conditions if f and g are replaced by  (12.5) where  (12.6) provided  and . These equations give the new expression for U in terms of the null coordinates u and v . It may be noted that the inequalities (12.6) provide strong constraints on the range of permissible values of the parameter b in (12.2). It can thus be seen that this transformation with  may be used to change the profile of the approaching waves. For example, it could  be used to derive the Szekeres solution described in Chapter 9 from the Khan-Penrose solution. The two transformations (12.1) and (12.2) may also be used in conjunction. It may also be noted that the transformations for V in (12.1) and (12.2) may be restated in the form that, if a real Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.18), then  (12.7) and  (12.8) are also real solutions with arbitrary constants a and b , though as explained above, the possible values of b are constrained by the boundary conditions. These results are, of course, implicitly contained in the general approach to colinear solutions described in Section 10.1. The point to note is that, when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization so that Z and Ε are real and , the main field equations can be linearized. In this case a general superposition of solutions is possible, as illustrated in (10.16) together with (10.20). Further generating techniques for this case have been described by Kitchingham (1984). In the more general case, however,Z and Ε are complex, and the field equations are essentially non-linear. In this situation, the generating techniques described in the remainder of this chapter are particularly significant. Rotations and Ehlers transformations Consider first the well known result that, if E is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.14), then  (12.9) where c is a constant, is also a solution. In terms of the alternative function Z the equivalent result is that, if Z is a solution of (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.10) By applying the coordinate rotation  (12.11) to the line element (11.12), it may be shown that this rotation is exactly equivalent to the transformation (12.9), indicating that this transformation may be simply interpreted as a global rotation of coordinates. In terms of the metric functions of the line element (6.20), this rotation can be shown to be equivalent to the result that, if U ,V ,W and M are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.12) It may be noted that, in (12.12), the function M is unaltered. Thus the boundary conditions are not affected, and so neither are the functions f(u) and g(v) . In fact, it is clear that (12.12) does not generate a new solution, but merely a rotation of the original. It can also be shown that, if the seed solution is colinear so that we can put , then the transformation (12.12) reduces to the transformation suggested by Ray (1980) as corrected by Halilsoy (1981). Another well known result is that, if Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then  (12.13) where c is a real constant, is also a solution. This is loosely referred to as an Ehlers transformation (Ehlers, 1957). Equivalently, if Ε is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by . (12.14) In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), we may start with the solutions U ,V ,W and M of (6.22). After integrating (11.21), it can then be shown that another solution is given by  (12.15) Since the metric function M is unchanged, it follows that the boundary conditions for the new solution are satisfied if, and only if, they are satisfied for the seed solution. The above transformation is also related to the well known result that, if Z is a solution of Ernst's equation (11.8), then another solution is given by  (12.16) where b is a real constant. Equivalently, if Ε is a solution of (11.14), then another solution is given by  (12.17) In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), this leads to the transformation that, if U ,V ,W and M are solutions of (6.22), then another solution is given by  (12.18) This can clearly be seen to be identical to (12.15) but with the sign of V interchanged. All of the above transformations can be shown to be obtainable from a general rotation and rescaling of the coordinates in the  plane. This can be described by subjecting the Killing vectors  to any  transformation , where . (12.19) This leaves U and M invariant but, by considering the line element (11.6), the Ernst function Z can be shown to transform as  (12.20) The transformation (12.20) clearly incorporates (12.10),(12.13) and (12.16) which include both pure rotations and those referred to as Ehlers transformations. When applied to metric functions on its own this transformation clearly has little physical significance. It follows that these transformations on their own can not be used to generate genuinely non-colinear solutions from colinear ones. However, they may be combined with some other method to obtain such solutions. In particular these transformations may be applied to the potentials for the metric functions that will be described in Section 12.4. Strictly speaking it is only these transformations, applied in the potential space, that should be referred to as Ehlers transformations (Ehlers, 1957). It is then possible that a sequence both of coordinate transformations (12.19) and Ehlers transformations (12.20) in the potential space can be applied alternately to generate a further class of solutions with an infinite number of parameters. Geroch transformations Geroch (1971) has presented a general technique for generating solutions of Einstein's source-free equations from known solutions which possess a Killing vector. As originally presented, the method is to consider a vacuum space-time with metric , and to solve the equations  (12.21) for G ,P and Q subject to the following conditions:. (12.22)(A solution of these equations is known to exist.) Then, the basic result is that a new solution of the source-free equations, depending on an arbitrary real parameter x , is given by  (12.23) where  (12.24) It can be seen that f and g are respectively the norm and twist potential of the Killing field. This technique determines a new solution with one extra parameter α. A second application of the method simply yields another member of the same one-parameter family of solutions. It may be observed that the new space-times also have the same Killing vector as the seed solution. It may also be shown that these transformations include both the Ehlers transformation and the rotation described in previous sections. The case when there exist two commuting Killing vectors, which is the case for colliding plane waves, has also been considered (Geroch, 1972). Clearly, the above technique may be applied using any linear combination of the Killing vectors. Successive applications of the method using different combinations of the Killing vectors yield metrics which depend on the order of the vectors used. The resulting class of solutions depends on two arbitrary functions, and retains the same pair of commuting Killing vectors. The algebraic structure of these transformations has been analysed by Geroch (1972). The Geroch transformations, which relate one vacuum solution to another, in fact form an infinite-dimensional group. The first really useful realization of the Lie algebra of the Geroch group was formulated by Kinnersley and Chitre (1977, 1978 a , b), who demonstrated the action of the infinitesimal elements of the group in terms of an infinite hierarchy of potentials. Kinnersley and Chitre, and also Hoenselaers, Kinnersley and Xanthopoulos (1979), exploited this approach to derive new stationary axisymmetric solutions. This formalism has been extended to space-times with two space-like Killing vectors by Kitchingham (1984), although he initially applied it only in the cosmological context. Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) introduced a realization of the finite elements of the Geroch group. They also showed that the Kinnersley-Chitre transformations can be carried out by solving an appropriate homogeneous Hilbert problem. A simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations which is specifically applied to colliding wave solutions has been found by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ). With this, colliding wave solutions with any desired number of parameters may be constructed. When applying the original transformation (12.23) to colliding plane waves, it is convenient to start first with the Szekeres line element (6.20), in which the two Killing vectors are  and . It is then appropriate to consider a general Killing vector  (12.25) where a and b are arbitrary constants. It follows immediately that . (12.26) It is then possible to put two of the components of  each equal to zero. Putting  (12.27) the remaining components of  must then satisfy the equations . (12.28) These equations are automatically integrable in view of(6.22). It is then possible to put  (12.29) and to choose the components of  such that . (12.30) Equations (12.21) are then satisfied. The new metric is then given by (12.23). The expressions for the new functions are rather involved. However, it is clear that  (12.31) which indicates that the boundary conditions are satisfied for the new solution, if they were satisfied for the seed solution. In the case when the initial solution has colinear polarization, this method can be considerably simplified. Such a situation was considered by Panov (1979 b ), and will be discussed further in Section 13.2. The Neugebauer-Kramer involution Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the main field equations for colliding plane waves can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.18) involving the complex function Z . In this case, the real and imaginary parts of this function, denoted by , are the metric coefficients given by (11.2–4). Using these components, the main field equations can be written as  (12.32) and . (12.33) These are respectively the real and imaginary parts of (11.18). The second of these equations immediately implies that there exists a function Φ such that. (12.34) It follows that must satisfy the equation  (12.35) At this point, it is convenient to introduce a new function Ψdefined by  (12.36) From (11.1) and (10.11), it may be seen that -Ψ is the coefficient of dx 2 in the line element (11.4). With this definition and (12.34), the equations (12.32) and (12.35) can now be rewritten in the form  (12.37) and  (12.38) These equations may be seen to be identical to (12.32) and (12.33) with Ψ and Φ replacing X and w . Thus, if  is a solution of (11.18), then another solution is given by  (12.39) where Ψ is given by (12.36), and Φ is chosen to satisfy (12.34). This correspondence is known as the Neugebauer-Kramer involution. It is known to map real metrics to real metrics only for space-times with two space-like Killing vectors. In modern terminology, it is clear that the equations (12.34) provide an auto-Bäcklund transformation for the Ernst equation (11.18). In order to obtain the remaining metric function M it is necessary to integrate equations (7.9), which may be rewritten in the form  (12.40) which is equivalent to (11.21). In terms of the alternative functions Ψ and Φ these become  (12.41) It follows from this that, for any solution with  and M there exists another solution with  and M where . (12.42) This immediately indicates that, if the initial solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, then so also does the new solution, provided . (12.43) A second application of this technique only leads back to the original solution, apart from an arbitrary complex constant. The presence of such a constant has already been considered in Section 12.2 following equation (12.16). It may be noted in passing that, in the colinear case in which  and , this generation technique is equivalent to putting  which is effectively contained in (12.1) but with a change in the sign of V . This, for example, would generate the Ferrari-Ibañez solution from the Khan-Penrose solution. It is of interest to observe that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times, the main field equations can be written in the form of Ernst's equation (11.8), whose solution  is considered as a complex potential for the metric functions X and that are obtained from (12.36) and (12.34). In contrast, for colliding plane waves, both the potential (12.39) and the metric function (11.5) satisfy the same equation. Thus, in this case, the Neugebauer-Kramer involution is equivalent to a generation  technique in which any solution has a dual solution in which the metric functions and the associated potentials are interchanged. A combined transformation In a recent paper, Halilsoy (1988 b ) has considered a technique which he applied initially in the context of colliding shock electromagnetic waves (Halilsoy, 1988 a ). This can be described as follows. If V is a solution of the vacuum equations (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) corresponding to a collision of colinear gravitational waves (with ), then a non-colinear solution is given in terms of the function Ε satisfying (11.14) by  (12.44) where  (12.45) where α is an arbitrary constant. The original solution is obtained when  and . In terms of the alternative function Z , the original solution may be described by a real function Z and the new solution satisfying (11.8) is then given by  (12.46) This can thus be seen to be a transformation of the type (12.2) followed by an Ehlers transformation in a slightly more general form than (12.13). In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the original solution is described by the three functions U ,V and M which are each functions of f and g where, as in (7.8), it is convenient to put  (12.47) and, as in (12.4),(12.48) The new solution (12.44) is given by . (12.49) With this, equations (7.7) can be integrated to give  (12.50) which is similar to (12.2). Now, using the same arguments as in Section 12.1, the new solution will only satisfy the appropriate boundary conditions if the forms of the functions f and g are modified. Accordingly we now put . (12.51) The parameters f and g are now expressed in terms of the null coordinates u and v in the form  (12.52) where . (12.53) With this restriction, the boundary conditions are satisfied, and . (12.54) If, in the original solution, the functions f ,g and M have been chosen such that the terms  in (12.47) have already cancelled the terms  and  in S , then the new solution for M will be given by . (12.55) The method described in this section has been used by Halilsoy (1988 b ) to obtain a class of solutions which appears to generalize the Szekeres solutions. However, since it has been obtained by a real transformation followed by an Ehlers transformation, as described at the end of Section 12.2 it is essentially simply a rotation and rescaling of the Szekeres solutions. It does not therefore describe the collision of genuinely non-aligned gravitational waves. Other methods Within the context of stationary axisymmetric space-times, many techniques have been developed in recent years by which new solutions may  be obtained from initial vacuum solutions. Most of these methods can be applied also to the colliding plane wave situation. The main difference being that, in this case, the solutions of Ernst's equation may themselves either be metric functions or potentials for those functions as described in Section 12.4. The other difference relates to the change of boundary conditions. For stationary axisymmetric solutions, it is usual to impose the condition that the space-times are asymptotically flat, and techniques for generating new solutions of Ernst's equation in which the space-time satisfies this condition have been developed. One of the most general of these is that of Cosgrove (1977), which generalizes the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions to arbitrary continuous deformation parameter s . However, for colliding plane waves, the boundary conditions are of a totally different character, and many of the solutions of Ernst's equation that are appropriate for axisymmetric fields, such as the Tomimatsu-Sato solutions, are now found to be inconsistent with the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves. Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have adapted a generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) for stationary axisymmetric space-times to derive solutions which describe the interaction following the collision of plane gravitational waves. This technique generates solutions in which the approaching waves have variable polarization from a ‘seed’ solution V of the equation (10.13) for the colinear case. A solution of the Ernst equation (11.17) is then given by  (12.56) where α is a constant and the functions  and  are obtained by integrating the equations  (12.57) The boundary conditions then have to be applied. One particularly important technique that has been developed in recent years is the inverse scattering method of Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) which had previously been developed as a soliton technique. This method has been applied by Carr and Verdaguer (1983) to plane-symmetric space-times, and their results have been interpreted in terms of cosmological gravitational waves. The relation between this and other techniques has been analysed by Letelier (1987). The first solution for colliding plane gravitational waves that was obtained using the inverse scattering method was that of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ), who obtained the solution described in Section 10.4 using the method in the form developed by Carr and Verdaguer (1983). In this paper they took as seed metric the Kasner solution (10.26) which is equivalent to the Stoyanov solution (10.29). It may therefore be noted that, although the new solution satisfies the boundary conditions for colliding plane waves, the seed solution in this case does not. Non-aligned solutions have also been obtained using this method by Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 b ). Another solution-generating technique that has been developed in recent years is that associated with Bäcklund transformations. These were first applied to general relativity independently by Harrison (1978) and Neugebauer (1979). Bäcklund transformations can also be described as double-Harrison transformations, or as quadruple-Neugebauer transformations. The explicit relation between this technique and other methods has been discussed by Cosgrove (1980, 1982). The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques. Hauser and Ernst (1979, 1980) developed a method which involves solving a homogeneous Hilbert problem. Cosgrove (1981) has shown how Bäcklund transformations can be conveniently expressed in this formalism. The method has been applied to colliding wave problems by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988)(see also Ernst, 1988), and a class of new colliding wave solutions has been obtained. It has been observed by Witten (1979) that Einstein's vacuum equations for stationary, axisymmetric space-times are equivalent to a form of the self-dual Yang-Mills equations. He therefore suggested that it should be possible to generate solutions of Einstein's equations by using twistor methods to construct self-dual Yang-Mills fields with appropriate symmetries. Such an approach to stationary axisymmetric space-times has subsequently been developed by Ward (1983), Woodhouse (1987) and also by Woodhouse and Mason (1988), who showed how this approach relates to the other solution-generating techniques mentioned above. It follows that this approach may also be applied for other types of space-times  which contain two commuting Killing vectors. Woodhouse (1989) has applied these techniques to generate cylindrical gravitational waves. Twistor techniques may also be developed to generate colliding plane wave solutions. Any of the above techniques may be used to generate new solutions of Ernst's equation. Most have been applied mainly to stationary axisymmetric space-times. They may, however, also be used to generate solutions of Ernst's equation that can be considered as possible to colliding plane wave solutions. The difficulty is then to find under what circumstances the appropriate boundary conditions are satisfied. Whether or not a new solution in region IV satisfies these conditions will generally depend both on the particular technique that is employed and also on the initial seed solution."
ACA ACA-ECV-003 9.15 "3 Women's Right: Reflections on Ethics and Gender Brenda Almond There is a view that is as old, probably, as the human race, and certainly as old as Homer and the ancient Greeks, that there is one ethical structure that represents right for men: a composite of manly virtues, such as courage, endurance, physical stamina, wiliness and political judgement, and a corresponding but complementary conception of what is right for women, womanly virtue being seen as a mixture of timidity, tenderness, compliance, docility, softness, innocence and domestic competence. Views about the exact composition of virtue, male and female, have changed over time, and they may vary, too, with differing social and geographical contexts, but the underlying theme is constant: the theme, that is, of difference. It is recognisable even when it appears in feminist dress, as it does, for example, in these remarks of Hester Eisenstein (1984): ‘I argue that feminist theory has moved from an emphasis on the elimination of gender difference to a celebration of that difference as a source of moral values. A woman-centered analysis presupposes the centrality, normality, and value of women's experience and women's culture’(p. xviii). Clearly, a distinctively feminist conception of women's moral values will differ significantly from traditional stereotypes. But it is worth asking, nevertheless, whether the old and the new might not be rooted in the same set of facts. Any discussion of ethics and gender, then, must involve some reference to facts. But the primary question is not one about facts at all. It is about moral ideals. Should we — women and men — be aiming at a common ethical conception, a shared moral perspective? Or should we — women alone — be working to rewrite the map of morality to promote a separate moral perspective? Must we, in other words, accept an ultimate sexual apartheid as far as ethical values are concerned? The larger question, then, is not about what is, but about what  ought to be. But since answering this question involves reference to some matters of fact, it is necessary to say something about those facts. Essentially, they are of two kinds. First, there are facts about what different people's moral ideals actually are. Here it is important to know (a) whether male and female ideals diverge: whether, that is, the moral outlook people have depends in some causally related way on whether they are male or female, and (b) whether the ideals themselves are gender-relative: that is to say , whether what is good in a woman or right for a woman might not be bad in a man, or wrong for a man, and vice versa . Secondly, there are facts about the lives of men and women and the systematic ways in which their lives differ, which it would be unwise to overlook. A systematic difference in the life-experience of women and men can have ethical implications both in generating a different moral ideal making women think differently about morality from the way men think about it — and also in justifying a different moral ideal justifying, that is, a genuinely alternative moral perspective. These last points may seem to imply a flagrant disregard of the well-known difficulty, first pointed out by the philosopher David Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature (1739), of reasoning from ‘is’ to ‘ought’(Selby-Bigge ed., 1952, pp. 469–70). But no transgression against Hume's stricture is involved in pointing out that people's views about what ought to be — their moral stance and outlook — may be directly related to certain distinctive features of their lives. And no transgression, either, is involved in accepting that moral views and ideals must take account of, and be responsive to, facts. Ideals are not formed in an aseptic vacuum, but in the chemical brew of interacting personal lives and events. So let me begin by making some impressionistic guesses about the views women do in fact currently hold on morality. I can do this best by way of a personal anecdote, which might be called the Incident of the Taxman and the Philosopher. Discussing the case of a headmaster who had reported his pupils to the police for criminal behaviour, the Philosopher, who was female, expressed the opinion that, since the headmaster is in loco parentis , he should have tried to avoid resort to law; he should have dealt with his pupils himself, privately and without publicity — as would, she suggested, a loving parent. The Taxman expressed moral outrage at such a suggestion, declared that this was not his conception of the implications of being in loco parentis , and said that he, as a parent and husband, would have no hesitation in reporting  the criminal actions of his child or indeed his wife, particularly if he saw no sign of either remorse or an intention to reform. He added that apprentice-Taxmen are coached in the matter of the known duplicity of women and their willingness to lie to protect members of their family. At this point, the Taxman's wife expressed moral outrage at the discovery that her husband would, without compunction, report her misdeeds, or those of her daughter, to the authorities, and the Philosopher was left with a sense of having stumbled upon a set of basic moral presumptions which are held in common by one sex, and entirely inverted in the case of the other — a looking-glass reversal of priorities and values. As it happens, of course, this conclusion conforms to the observations of Freud, who believed that women had less sense of justice than men and are more often influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility. It conforms, too, to some more recent observations of Piaget, Kohlberg and Gilligan. Lawrence Kohlberg's empirical work on moral development follows, as far as its basic stance is concerned, the structure and assumptions of Jean Piaget, who has demonstrated apparently invariant sequences of change, not only in relation to moral development, but in other areas, too. The underlying assumption is that there is a necessary maturation of cognitive processes, just as there is of physical and motor processes. Just as every normal human child first learns to crawl, then to stand and then to walk and the motivation and capacity to do these things comes from within the child, and is not artificially imposed from outside — so, the moral development theorists hold, there is a necessary sequence of stages of emerging moral judgement. Their empirical research is directed to establishing what these stages are, and to describing the circumstances surrounding the transitions. Kohlberg's stages of moral development are usually described as a progression from lower to higher — itself an inbuilt and at first unrecognised value-judgement. The early or lower stages that he has identified are first, a stage in which children's thinking is rooted in obedience to adults, fear of punishment and acceptance of authority; then a stage of an essentially self-interested acceptance, for the sake of reciprocity, of a principle of fairness between peers; and then a further stage of seeking approval and desiring to be well thought of by one's community or group. Later comes a stage of respect for justice: recognition of the importance of rules for community living, followed by an awareness  of the universality of some of these rules and their embodiment in principles of individual human rights applying across varying cultures and societies. Kohlberg has speculated on the existence of a seventh stage in which the universal human perspective is replaced by a holistic cosmic perspective which might have a religious or even a pantheistic orientation. All this is framed in gender-neutral terms, but researchers have become aware of difficulties in finding women who can be placed by this classification in the ‘higher stages’ of moral development. Women's answers to the questionnaires by which assignments to ‘stages’ are made show them to be more heavily represented in the early stages of development rather than the later. Women desire to please. Women rebel against impersonal principles of morality which, when rigorously applied, ignore individual pleas for sympathetic concessions, for mercy rather than justice. Carol Gilligan's research, which focused on the distinctively female moral dilemma of an abortion-decision, suggested that what was emerging here was not a moral deficiency of women but a ‘different voice’ on morality. The findings of the male researchers, she claims, are dogged by what she calls the problem of women ‘whose sexuality remains more diffuse, whose perception of self is so much more tenaciously embedded in relationships with others and whose moral dilemmas hold them in a mode of judgment that is insistently contextual’. While she concedes the broad outline of the developmental model — a model which proceeds from an egocentric through a societal to a universal perspective — she sees this development as taking place, in the case of women, within a special moral conception. The nature of this moral conception is recognised by a distinctive use of a particular vocabulary: a vocabulary of selfishness and responsibility; or morality as an obligation to exercise care and avoid hurt. The particular sequence of moral development revealed by Gilligan's research is described by her in this way: first, as in Kohlberg's findings, a stage of focus on the self; then, a second level of development in which the notion of responsibility is used to balance the claims of self against the claims of other people; this stage brings a notion of the good as caring for others; it involves a protective care for the dependent and unequal. It is succeeded by a third stage at which the tension between conformity and care, selfishness and responsibility, is dissipated by a self which, in Gilligan's words ‘becomes the arbiter of an independent judgment  that now subsumes both conventions and individual needs under the moral principle of non-violence’(Gilligan, 1977, p. 492). Gilligan sees this as a morality of responsibility that stands apart from the morality of rights underlying Kohlberg's conception. In it, a positive conception of caring contrasts with the purely negative policy of non-interference suggested by an emphasis on rights. What is missing from the latter, and its omission is deliberate rather than accidental, is the detail and texture that comes with knowledge of particular people and particular circumstances. Kohlberg's research is based on questionnaires which demand a response to hypothetical and imaginary situations in which concrete detail is necessarily omitted. Gilligan points out that Kohlberg thus divests his moral actors of the history and psychology of their individual lives. Many women, confronted by Kohlbergian questionnaires, ask for, or contribute out of their own imagination, concrete detail which might help them resolve the moral dilemma with which they are presented. They are told that this sort of question or embellishment is inappropriate. Kohlberg's dilemmas are not about real people — they can't be if the aim of the research is to discover objective principles of justice. Gilligan mentions here the anonymous woman whose nonlegalistic thinking enabled Solomon to display his legendary wisdom. She contrasts that woman's sacrifice of self and principle for the life of her child with the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son for principle and personal integrity. What both of these examples demonstrate is the concreteness and particularity of real life situations. It is interesting to compare Gilligan's criticisms of Kohlberg on this point with Robert Nozick's parallel and equally cogent criticisms of Rawls. John Rawls, in A Theory of Justice,seeks to arrive at abstract principles of justice by means of a device which strips the procedure of arriving at principles bare of all reference to the particular and concrete. His principles are chosen by people behind a hypothetical ‘veil of ignorance’, where they know nothing of their social position in society, their sex, race, abilities or conceptions of the good (Rawls, 1972, in particular pt. I, ch. 3). Nozick points out that the very nature of Rawls's thought-experiments guarantees the type of principles that will be chosen: that they will be impersonal and grounded in future-oriented principles of distribution, rather than being personal and grounded in current or past circumstances (Nozick, 1974, in particular pt. II, ch. 7). To accept Nozick's criticism  is not to judge in favour of Nozick's conception of justice against Rawls, any more than acceptance of Gilligan's argument involves rejection of Kohlberg's abstract principles of justice. It is simply to recognise that the structure of the ‘proof’ in both cases, in Rawls's case an a priori proof, in Kohlberg's case an experimental one, actually presupposes what it sets out to establish. The outcome is guaranteed before the procedure, whether logical or empirical, is embarked upon. But Gilligan does not, in fact, reject the notion of a rights-based morality. Instead, she argues that the feminine strand should contribute to an enlarged and revised universal conception of morality, in which the ideals of compassion and care are added to the more impersonal ideals of autonomous judgement and action. She believes, then, that a morality of rights can be integrated with a morality of responsibilities — that the two conceptions are essentially complementary. This coincides with the views of some other feminist writers who have been impressed by this distinctively ‘female’ contribution to morality. Hester Eisenstein, for example, looks forward to women transforming the world in the image of what she calls ‘the woman-centered values at the core of feminism’. This means, she believes, associating feminism with the liberating traditions of Western thought, from Locke and Rousseau to Marx and Engels, tending in the direction of greater equality, shared decision-making and justice. But it means, too, transforming these traditions, by imbuing them with the woman-centered values of nurturance and intimacy, as necessary and legitimate goals of political life. (Eisenstein, 1984, pp. 144 5) Reflecting on the same contrast, Carol McMillan refers to Hegel's view of the family as an inferior organisation to the state because it is based on love. She points out that much of a woman's life is based on a spontaneity of moral response that many philosophers, in particular Hegel and Kant, would say had no moral worth (McMillan, 1982). The idea that acts of love are inferior to principled acts is a deep-rooted philosophical tradition. This area of love, care and spontaneous response which ignores, or deliberately flouts, principle and convention is one, then, where an initial impressionistic guess about male and female differences can be given an impressive weight of support. There is a second  impressionist guess, however, which it is harder to document. This is the extent to which women's moral perceptions are tied to the aesthetic. The link between awareness of beauty and recognition of the moral good was a fundamental aspect of Plato's ethical theory, but few writers since Plato have tied awareness of beauty in nature so closely to a deeper notion of the good. However, it is a striking observation that women's moral sensibilities are, more often than men's, triggered by an awareness which is essentially aesthetic. The following account is given by Helen Weinreich-Haste of a response to a question designed, not to explore this point, but simply to discover more about significant changing points in people's lives: I was driving on my way through beautiful scenery in Wales where I live and it suddenly occurred to me how this would all be altered in a nuclear war. And it just stopped me dead in my tracks. I couldn't keep driving. I had to stop and I felt really physically very unwell. And I was crying. I sat for about three quarters of an hour before I could continue the journey. (quoted in Weinreich-Haste, 1987) The woman who gave this account thereafter changed her established way of life to become an activist in the Greenham Common protest against the siting there of cruise missiles. To cite a personal response of a comparable nature, I find in myself an apparently irrational extra revulsion at the occurrence of bombings or murders that take place in beautiful places on beautiful days. It would be absurd to approve of such events taking place on grey, sunless days in dark, depressing places. Nevertheless, there is a sense of incongruity and inappropriateness about an ugly act which involves the destruction of what was, in some wider and more general sense, previously beautiful. But this, even more than the previous example, is not, of course, an attitude confined to women. It must be something of the sentiment that inspired the war poets, enduring indescribable ugliness — the mutilation and destruction of people and places amongst the fragile flowers that nature silently but abundantly proffered in the stench, decay and squalor of the trenches. The sentiment was expressed many times over, but it is succinctly put in the following lines by R. E. Vernede, who was killed in action in 1917: The sun's a red ball in the oak And all the grass is grey with dew, A while ago a blackbird spoke He didn't know the world's askew… Strange that this bird sits there and sings While we must only sit and plan Who are so much the higher things — The murder of our fellow man… Or, as Edmund Blunden put it: Bold great daisies' golden lights, Bubbling roses' pinks and whites — Such a gay carpet! poppies by the million; Such damask! such vermilion! But if you ask me, mate, the choice of colour Is scarcely right; this red should have been duller. The early war poems had promoted patriotism, justice and principle. It is striking that there was this shift from principle to aesthetic response as the war progressed. It might be that it was the incessant closeness to blood, death and suffering that brought out these sentiments in men who had, on the whole, been raised in an education system that rejected such responses as feminine and unmasculine, and that promoted an abstract conception of justice and a stern morality of obedience to rules. If so, it could be that the impact of that experience parallels in a sharpened and intensified form the impact on women of the experience of child-bearing — a potent, personal experience that, however sanitised, brings a woman face-to-face with these three realities. Again, as in the previous case, if this aesthetic response is accepted as especially characteristic of women's moral awareness, it can be argued that it is an important element to incorporate in any full account of the moral. It should be encompassed within, rather than competing against, any universal conception of morality. These are, then, two ways in which women may, and probably do, see morality in a different light from the way men typically see it. This means that the first set of questions about facts mentioned at the outset can now be answered. Male and female do appear to diverge in certain identifiable and significant ways. The moral  outlook a person has may — though this is, of course, only a statistical or average truth — depend on whether that person is male or female. But these ideals are not necessarily gender-relative. And indeed, it is the potential complementarity of the views that is their most striking feature. But before turning to the central question of what ideals men and women should adopt, it is worth speculating a little about what it is that causes these observable differences of moral outlook. Answering this question involves reference to the second group of facts which were mentioned at the beginning of this discussion facts about the systematic differences in the life-experience of women and men. Two main types of explanation are offered as accounting in these terms for the distinctive ways in which women and men approach moral questions: these are, first, predominantly biological explanations, and, second, predominantly social or cultural explanations. Differences, it is assumed, must either be biologically based, or they must be culturally induced, the result of education, upbringing and social pressure. One important aspect of attributing differences to biology as opposed to attributing them to culture is that the second type of explanation leaves room for views to change, while the former appears to rule this out. This contrast may be more apparent than real, however, for new technologies of birth and reproduction may alter the biologically given so as to make possible a changed perspective that would have been inconceivable in the past. Anti-patriarchal utopias in which male power, if not man himself, has been eliminated, and in which women have created a new social structure, are convincingly depicted in feminist science-fiction, and advocated as social policy by some radical feminist writers (see, for example Firestone, 1971). Both biological and cultural explanations, however, have sceptical implications as far as morality is concerned. If moral scepticism is to be avoided, then, it is important to appreciate both the scope and the limits of these sorts of explanation. The Biological Thesis This, which may also be called the socio-biological or ‘geneticist’ thesis, asserts that innate biological factors determine a person's morality. Thus, in the case of the sexes, it sees different moral qualities as part of male or female ‘nature’— qualities and contrasts  such as aggressiveness or docility; kindness or cruelty; selfishness or unselfishness; conscientiousness or carelessness. The thesis is essentially deterministic: we cannot escape from what our genes make of us. And so it considerably curtails the scope for morality, for it leads to such questions as: Why, if it is genetic factors that make people what they are, praise or blame them for what they do? Why not simply accept the way they — men and women — behave? The Sociological Thesis This is the thesis that it is social or cultural factors that determine a person's moral view-factors such as environment, upbringing and social context. Coupled with this factual thesis is the full-blooded relativist view that there are only these different views; that to talk about morality is to make reference to them; and that there is no fact-of-the-matter; no independent concept of right and wrong; of good and bad; of duty or responsibility. Within this second type of explanation, two very different theses may be distinguished: (i) the view that dominating differences are related to non-gender-related contrasts: for example, social class, economic structure, and a broad range of cultural factors. (ii) the view that the salient and overriding cultural phenomenon is gender. This view, then, may be distinguished from the ‘orthodox’ sociological view for separate consideration: it is the patriarchy thesis. The Patriarchy Thesis This is the thesis that women's morality, which in certain vital respects, particularly in relation to sexual behaviour, often differs from men's, has been imposed on them by centuries of conditioning by men. It differs from the standard sociological thesis in that it regards the gender difference as the most fundamental and most fully explanatory division in human society. It holds that across all cultures and forms of social arrangement women have been kept in subservience to men. In so far as there is this domination, it must be acknowledged that men have been aided in their domination of women by women themselves — sometimes older women, whose own conditioning has  matured in conformity with that of men. In other words, men's moral requirements may not be imposed directly on women, but indirectly through the filter of female complicity. Recognising this paradox lends weight to the patriarchy thesis, explaining away many apparent counter-examples. For instance, if clitorectomy often known as female circumcision — is a ‘moral’ requirement to serve male interests, it is nevertheless women who carry out, maintain and insist upon the practice, and it is women who express their moral offence if it is not carried out. This may lead those who would otherwise oppose the practice to defend it on cultural grounds. Because of its far-reaching effects on individual women's lives, however, it is difficult not to see it as, on the contrary, a potent example of the weakness of an orthodox relativist view — a view, that is, which attempts, incoherently, to maintain the equal validity of all moral perspectives. For many feminists resist the relativist conclusion in this case to demand that both women and men shake themselves free of their conditioning. This reveals a fundamental contrast between either biological or sociological determinism and the patriarchy thesis. Characteristically, the patriarchy thesis generates a revolutionary ideology rather than a fatalistic acceptance of determinism and relativism. It rejects the tyranny of local culture and regards even biological ‘necessity’ as manipulable. It results in an appeal, a call, to women to throw off the bonds of conditioning, to take freedom to control their own lives. But it must be asked how far such autonomy is a realistic possibility. If there are some brute facts, perhaps social, but founded in biological difference, which separate the lives and experience of women from those of men, may these not continue ineluctably to affect the moral ideals they may hold? Is there something about woman's experience as a biological and social being that gives her a common identity and differentiates her forever from the male? Or are differences only superficially cultural? Was Margaret Mead (1935) right to see woman as ‘an infinitely malleable clay figure upon which mankind has draped ever varying period-costumes’? And was Simone de Beauvoir (1972) justified in believing that, because women ‘live dispersed among the males, attached through residence, housework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men — fathers or husbands — more firmly than they are to other women’, they can have no common identity or history? I want to suggest that whatever anthropological and economic truths are embodied in these and similar statements, the fact is that  there are indeed certain systematic differences in the lives of women and of men, and that this fundamental contrast in life-experience does indeed account for and to some extent also justify a difference in their moral outlook and assumptions. This is not simply a matter of those aspects of women's sexual lives that are so often cited in evidence as disqualifying women from running the affairs of nations, or even from running a small business: menstruation and premenstrual tension; conception, pregnancy and childbirth; lactation and child-care. These are important, but they are surface phenomena, overtly physical. What they connect with is a much deeper and more significant fact. This central fact is the fact of change, together with the problems of identity and self-concept that this generates. For women characteristically experience change in their lives in a way which is only experienced by a man if he is unfortunate enough to be the victim of some mutilating accident or illness. The horror depicted in Kafka's Metamorphosis , in which a man awakens to discover that he has become a large insect, invites comparison with the norms of women's existence — her passages from childhood to puberty, from mature womanhood to menopause and old age; her experience of pregnancy. Kafka's Metamorphosis begins with the following passage: As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were armour-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. What has happened to me? he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human bedroom, only rather too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. It is interesting to compare this with Sylvia Plath's poem about her own experience of pregnancy and child-bearing: I am a mountain now, among mountainy women. The doctors move among us as if our bigness Frightened the mind. They smile like fools. They are to blame for what I am, and they know it — They hug their flatness like a kind of health. And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did? They would go mad with it. Pregnancy, however, is a relatively brief and dramatic bodily change, succeeded by reversion to something like the former state. As Plath later continues: I am not ugly. I am even beautiful. The mirror gives back a woman without deformity. The nurses give back my clothes, and an identity. This contrasts with the two major irreversible shifts of a woman's life, first to puberty, then to menopause. These not only cause a change in self-concept — the way a woman sees herself — but, more important, a change in the way she is perceived by other people. In vain she may cry, as Gregor Samsa does to his parents, sister and employer, that the same person is there inside, looking out in the same way at the world. The world sees a woman, in a way it does not see a man, as old or young, sexual or non-sexual, defining her frequently by nothing other than her biological role: mother, spouse, grandmother, widow. It is not surprising, then, that both the phases of major transition, as well as the experience of pregnancy and childbirth can bring mental disturbance and breakdown in their wake. These are rightly described as pressure-points in the lives of women. It would not be surprising, either, if this flux and change in the self were to generate a more flexible response to morality, and one that is peculiarly sensitive to the aesthetic dimension. Women's experience continually forces them to react to situations in which all the parameters have shifted. If one adds to this one other incontrovertible fact — that the overwhelming majority of women have lived their lives without economic freedom or autonomy, but as dependants or chattels lacking control over the crucial fixed aspects of their own lives — then it becomes clear that the chameleon nature of women is their necessary self-protection. As in the case of that animal, their clothes must fit their habitat, changing in response to external change. In this respect, a famously offensive passage by Rousseau on the education of girls may be seen as, after all, no more  than realistic for period and place: recommending that girls be taught to break off games they are enjoying to return to work without complaint, he writes: This habitual restraint produces a docility which woman requires all her life long, for she will always be in subjection to a man, or to man's judgment, and she will never be free to set her own opinion above his. What is most wanted in a woman is gentleness; formed to obey a creature so imperfect as man, a creature often vicious and always faulty, she should early learn to submit to injustice and to suffer the wrongs inflicted on her by her husband without complaint. (Rousseau, 1762, trans., p. 333) The ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy, then, has been no more in woman's grasp than it was within the grasp of the Stoic slave of ancient times. And just as the ethical perspective of Stoicism was shaped by the slave-status of some of its principal proponents, so the ethical perspective of women has evolved within a framework of powerlessness to affect external events — even the lives of her own children within the family structure — and powerlessness to resist the inexorable internal cycle of obtrusive biological change, with the social and economic concomitants of that change that are absent in the case of the more modulated maturing and ageing processes of men. The conclusion to be drawn from these reflections is, I believe, that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are indeed morally significant. It may be that the effects of those significant differences can be mitigated by social change, and by education for mutual understanding. But because the weight of explanation is preponderantly biological rather than cultural or social, it may be that women's moral perspective will continue to be one which reflects a distinctive range of values. The feminist goal must be the interweaving of those values, which have a richness, complexity and spontaneity lacking in more abstract conceptions, with the universalistic goals of traditional moral theory. In practice, this may mean as little as insisting on modest changes in decision-making procedures and modes of academic debate; or it may mean as much as the sacrifice of a whole way of life for activism in some major political cause. But if there is to be a new morality — new values for the new situation resulting from  technological and political change in the closing years of the twentieth century — then the creation of that new morality must in the end be a joint enterprise of both women and men."
ACA ACA-ECV-006 9.13 "6 Autonomy and Identity in Feminist Thinking Jean Grimshaw Issues about women's autonomy have been central to feminist thinking and action. Women have so often been in situations of powerlessness and dependence that any system of belief or programme of action that could count as ‘feminist’ must in some way see this as a central concern. But what is meant by ‘autonomy’ and under what conditions is it possible? This has been an important and contentious question in philosophy. But questions about autonomy, and related questions about self and identity have also been important to feminism, and within feminist thinking it is possible to find radically different ways of thinking about these things. In this paper, I want to look at one kind of way in which some feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be ‘autonomous’, and at the implications this has for ways of thinking about the human self. I shall argue that this conception is not only philosophically problematic, but also has an implicit politics which is potentially damaging. And I shall try to suggest some ways of beginning to think about ‘autonomy’ which seem to me to be more fruitful and adequate, and to draw on different traditions of thinking about the self which have become influential in some recent feminist thinking. Feminist thinking does not, of course, exist in a vacuum, and in thinking about women's autonomy, feminists have drawn on different (and conflicting) approaches to questions about the human self, some of which have a long history. I want to begin by going back to an argument that Aristotle put forward in the Ethics , since I think that the point at which his argument breaks down can illuminate the nature of the problem some feminist thinking has faced. Aristotle's argument concerns the question of what it is that makes an action ‘voluntary’, done of a person's own free will, and  in order to answer this question, he distinguished between actions whose origin was ‘inside’ a person, and those whose origin was ‘outside’, which resulted from external influences or pressure or compulsion. He discussed at some length the problems that arise over trying to define ideas such as‘compulsion’, and in estimating the degree of severity of pressure that could make an action not voluntary. But in this sort of model of autonomy, what defines an action as autonomous is seen as its point of origin ; it must have an ‘immaculate conception’, as it were, from within the self. Now ultimately I think that it is this definition of ‘autonomy’ in terms of origin, and the associated distinction between an ‘inner’self which can in some way spontaneously generate its ‘own’actions, and ‘external’influences which are not ‘part’of the self, that will need challenging. But I think it is possible to defend the Aristotelian version of autonomy up to a point, provided notions of ‘inside’ and ‘outside’the self are defined in a certain way. If a person is prevented from doing what they would otherwise intend or desire to do, or if they are coerced into doing what they would not otherwise want or desire to do, they are not acting autonomously. Under this interpretation, actions which originate from ‘inside’ the self are those which are seen as in accordance with conscious desires or intentions, and those which originate from ‘outside’the self are those which one would not do if one were not coerced. The pressure here is to consider the sorts of circumstances which do, in fact, coerce people in these sorts of ways. And, of course, a central concern of feminism has been to identify and fight against the kinds of coercion to which women have been subjected, including things like physical violence and economic dependence. But it is at this point that an Aristotelian-type argument fails to be able to deal with the most difficult questions about autonomy. The Aristotelian view, as I have interpreted it, ‘works’ only to the extent that it is assumed that there is no problem about what I shall call ‘the autonomy of desires’. Autonomy is defined as acting in accordance with desire (or intention). But what of the desires themselves? Are there desires (or intentions) which are not ‘autonomous’, which do not originate from ‘within’ the self, which are not authentic, not really ‘one's own’? Feminist writers have wanted, of course, to indict the various forms of brutality and coercion from which women have suffered. But this brutality and coercion has been seen not merely as a question of physical or ‘external’ coercion or constraint; the force of  subjection has also been seen as a psychic one, invading women's very selves. The language of ‘conditioning’, ‘brainwashing’, ‘indoctrination’, and so forth, has been used to describe this force. The female self, under male domination, is riddled through and through with false or conditioned desires. But set against this conditioned, non-autonomous female self are various images of a female self that would be authentic, that would transcend or shatter this conditioning. I want now to look at some of these images of the female self in feminist discourse: my particular examples are from the work of Mary Daly, Marilyn Frye and Kate Millett. Daly, Frye and Millett all stress the way in which women have been subject to the power of men. Much of Daly's book,Gyn/Ecology (1979), is an account of the barbarities inflicted on women such as suttee, clitorectomy, foot-binding and other forms of mutilation. Millett, in Sexual Politics (1977), sees patriarchal power as something so historically all-embracing that it has totally dominated women's lives. Frye, in The Politics of Reality (1983), uses the situation of a young girl sold into sexual slavery and then systematically brutalised and brainwashed into a life of service to her captors as an analogy for the situation of all women. And all three writers stress the way in which they see the female self as ‘invaded’ by patriarchal conditioning. Millett writes: When, in any group of persons, the ego is subjected to such invidious versions of itself through social beliefs, ideology and tradition, the effect is bound to be pernicious. This should make it no very special cause for surprise that women develop group characteristics common to those who suffer minority status and a marginal existence. (Millett, 1977, p. 55) Women, she argues, are deprived of all but the most trivial sources of dignity or self-respect. In her discussion of Lawrence's depiction of Connie in Lady Chatterley's Lover , what she sees Connie as relinquishing is ‘self, ego, will, individuality’(p. 243); all those things which, Millett argues, women had but recently achieved,(and for which Lawrence had a profound distaste). Mary Daly's picture of the way in which women's selves are invaded by patriarchal conditioning is even more striking. She describes women, for example, as ‘moronised’, ‘robotised’, ‘lobotomised’, as ‘the puppets of Papa’. At times she seems to see women as so ‘brainwashed’ that they are scarcely human; thus she  describes them as ‘fembots’, even as ‘mutants’. In Millett, Daly and Frye, women are seen primarily as victims : the monolithic brutality and psychological pressures of male power have reduced women almost to the state of being ‘non-persons’. And indeed, as Daly sees women as having become ‘mutants’ or ‘fembots’, so Millett sees them as not having been allowed to participate in fully ‘human’activities (which she characterises as those that are most remote from the biological contingencies of life), and Frye sees them as simply ‘broken’and then ‘remade’in the way that suits their masters. But behind this victimised female self, whose actions and desires are assumed to be not truly ‘her own’, since they derive from processes of force, conditioning or psychological manipulation, there is seen to be an authentic female self, whose recovery or discovery it is one of the aims of feminism to achieve. The spatial metaphor implicit in the word ‘behind’ is not accidental, since this model of self is premised on the possibility of making a distinction between an ‘inner’and an ‘outer’self. Ibsen's Peer Gynt compared his quest for identity to the process of peeling layers off an onion; but after shedding all the ‘false selves’, he found that there was nothing inside, no ‘core’. The sort of spatial metaphor implicit in Peer Gynt's account of himself is also apt in the accounts of self given by Daly, Millett and Frye, except that there is assumed to be a ‘core’. This is clearest in the work of Daly. In GynlEcology , discovering or recovering one's own self is seen as akin to a process of salvation or religious rebirth, and Daly writes of what she calls the unveiling or unwinding of the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy to reveal the authentic female Spirit-Self underneath. And this Self is seen as a unitary and harmonious one. Splits and barriers within the psyche, she argues, as well as those between Selves, are the result of patriarchal conditioning. In the unitary and harmonious female Spirit-Self there will be no such splits. Millett's picture of the authentic female self is rather different from that of Daly. It does not draw, as Daly's does, on religious metaphors of salvation and rebirth. It derives, rather, from a picture of the self as fundamentally a unitary, conscious and rational thing, a picture which, in Western philosophy, can be traced back to Descartes. It emerges most clearly in her discussion of Freud. She describes Freud's theory of the Unconscious as a major contribution to human understanding, but her account of the self owes, in fact, scarcely anything to Freud. She is scathingly critical of Freud's  theory of penis envy: Freud, she argued, ‘did not accept his patient's symptoms as evidence of a justified dissatisfaction with the limiting circumstances imposed on them by society, but as symptomatic of an independent and universal feminine tendency’(Millett, 1977, p. 179). He made a major (and foolish) confusion between biology and culture. Girls, Millett argues, are fully cognisant of male supremacy long before they see their brother's penis; and what they envy is not the penis, but the things to which having a penis gives the boy access — power, status and rewards. Freud ignored the more likely ‘social’ hypothesis for feminine dissatisfaction, preferring to ascribe it to a biologically based female nature. What we should be studying, Millett argues, are the effects of male-supremacist culture on the female ego. And what will undo these effects, she writes in the Postscript, is altered consciousness, and a process of ‘human growth and tru The ‘social’ factors of which Millett writes are here seen as pressures which are ‘external’to the self, and which have the effect of thwarting the conscious and unitary rationality of female individuality, or the female ego. And the task is that of removing their influence. If, in Lady Chatterley's Lover , the scales were to fall from Connie's eyes and she were to see the worship of Mellor's phallus for what it is, a means of subordinating and oppressing women, she could free herself and develop her authentic will, ego and individuality. The paradigm of coercion, writes Frye, is not the direct application of physical force. Rather, it is a situation in which choice and action do take place, and in which the victim acts under her own perception and judgement. Hence, what the exploiter needs is that the will and intelligence of the victim be disengaged from the projects of resistance and escape but that they not be simply broken or destroyed. Ideally, the disintegration and misintegration of the victim should accomplish the detachment of the victim's will and intelligence from the victim's own interests and their attachment to the interests of the exploiter. This will effect a displacement or dissolution of self-respect and will undermine the victim's intolerance of coercion. With that, the situation transcends the initial paradigmatic form or structure of coercion; for if people don't mind doing what you want them to do, you can't really be making them do it. (Frye, 1983, p. 60) And, she writes: The health and integrity of an organism is a matter of its being organised largely towards its own interests and welfare. She is healthy and ‘working right’ when her substance is organised primarily on principles which align it to her interests and welfare. Co-operation is essential of course, but it will not do that I arrange everything so that you get enough exercise: for me to be healthy, I must get enough exercise. My being adequately exercised is logically independent of your being so. (Ibid., p. 70) Frye is writing here as if it were possible to distinguish the interests of one self sharply from those of another, and as if , were the effects of male domination to be undone, it would not be too much of a problem for the self to know what its interests were. In various ways then, underlying much of the work of these three writers is a set of assumptions about the self. First, that it is, at least potentially, a unitary, rational thing, aware of its interests. Second, that ‘splits’ within the psyche should be seen as resulting from the interference of patriarchal or male-dominated socialisation or conditioning. Third, that the task of undoing this conditioning is one that can be achieved solely by a rational process of learning to understand and fight against the social and institutional effects of male domination. And implicit in these assumptions about the self, I think, is a conception of autonomy. Frye writes that ‘left to themselves’ women would not want to serve men. Daly writes of unveiling or unwinding the ‘shrouds’ of patriarchy. Millett writes of the individuality and ego that women can discover in themselves once they recognise the effects of their patriarchal socialisation. And in all three, what is autonomous (or authentic) is what is seen as originating in some way from within the self; what is in some way untainted by the conditioning or manipulation to which a woman has previously been subjected. Before I come to discuss the philosophical problems that are raised by this sort of account of self and autonomy, I want to look at what I have called its implicit politics; and what I mean by this primarily is its possible consequences for the way in which women might think about their relationships to each other, and the way in which they might think about themselves. The first consequence seems to me to be this. Any view which sees self-affirmation  in terms of an ‘authentic’ inner self arising from the smashing of a socially conditioned ‘false self’, or which sees autonomy as a question of the origin of actions from ‘inside’rather than‘outside’, is almost bound to adopt, however implicitly, a derogatory attitude towards those who are not yet ‘authentic’. The precise nature and tone of this attitude may vary. But Mary Daly, for example, in GynlEcology , sometimes writes as if most women were really little more than the programmed, robotic puppets to which women were reduced in Ira Levin's novel The Stepford Wives ; the language of ‘fembots’ and ‘mutants’and ‘puppets’, whilst intended, I am sure, to enunciate a critique of women's oppressors, veers perilously near to sounding like contempt for those who are subject to that oppression. And this is related, for example, to Daly's scorn for ‘tokenism’— for those women who participate in what are seen as patriarchal institutions. Kate Millett's language is less obviously extreme. But the picture she paints of women is nevertheless often a derogatory one. She describes them, for example, as ‘infantilised’; she accepts without question research which purported to show that most women despised each other (Millett, 1977, p. 55); she sees women as having little ‘self-respect’, and as devoting almost all their time and attention to pleasing and flattering men. This implicitly derogatory attitude to women is linked both to an overmonolithic account of male power, and to a failure to give much attention to the ways in which women have, in fact, often spent much of their lives, and to the activities which have been particularly theirs (such as the rearing of children, for example). Sometimes women are depicted almost as a caricature of a male stereotype of themselves — they are servile, weak, powerless etc. (Millett even suggests (p. 56) that the fact that women commit less ‘crime’ than men is due to their patriarchal conditioning in passivity.) Millett basically dismisses the activities which have tended to dominate women's lives as ‘infantilising’, because they restrict women to the level, she argues, of the merely biological, and do not allow them to enter upon the ‘fully human’ activities which have been the province of men. And it is interesting, as Toril Moi (1985) points out, that in her discussion of literature, Millett concentrates almost wholly on male authors, with the exception of Charlotte Bronte, of whose work she tends to be very dismissive. Furthermore, as Moi suggests, she seems to avoid much in the way of recognition or acknowledgement of feminist work prior to her own, or of the existence of female traditions and strengths which  might have tended to challenge or subvert the supposedly monolithic nature of the male power which it is the main aim of her book to describe. Mary Daly's indictment of male power and brutality similarly allows little space for a consideration of the patterns of women's lives, or the strengths and capacities that these might have enabled them to develop. Her female Spirit-Self simply seems to rise mysteriously like a phoenix from the ashes of patriarchal conditioning. And Frye is sceptical about the possibility of women looking to their foremothers as a source of inspiration; of seeing some women, at least, as having led lives that were not wholly male-mediated. Feminist vision or imagination has no real resource to turn to. Now these kinds of accounts (or perhaps one might say failures to give an adequate account?) of women's lives are implicitly divisive and threatening. They are divisive because they have a tendency to divide women into two camps; those who have and those who have not shaken the dust of patriarchal conditioning from their feet. And they are threatening, because it is offensive and undermining to be told that the life one has led has merely been one of servility, that it has not been of truly ‘human’ value, that one has been a ‘fembot’or a ‘puppet’. I think that one important strand in the rejection of feminism by many women has been a feeling that feminists are saying that their lives have been of no value, and that their activities and concerns have been trivial. But this image of autonomy and of the self can be threatening, too, to women who do have a strong allegiance to feminism; and the threat intersects with assumptions that have been made in some feminist discourse about who is or is not ‘really’ a feminist. The threat arises because this account of autonomy is in fact often a strongly normative one; it presents an image of what a ‘feminist self’ should be like. To be autonomous or authentic one should be strong, independent, rational, coherent or consistent, able to distinguish clearly those aspects of one's previous self which derive from male-dominated conditioning and reject them. If one is ambivalent, conflicted, uncertain, confused, unwilling to make wholesale rejections, one stands to be accused, whether by oneself or by others, of bad faith, of lack of courage, of ‘selling out’, of tokenism. I am here giving an account of just one (influential) strand in feminist discourse. There are other strands which have rejected this account of self and autonomy. As I have said before, a picture of the  self as conscious, unitary and rational can be traced back, in Western philosophy, to Descartes. I do not have space here to discuss the various ways in which versions of this conception of self have been influential, in philosophy and psychology, for instance. But the major tradition which has queried this view of self has been that which derives from psychoanalysis. Feminism has had a complex relation to psychoanalysis. Freud's theories have been the target of a great deal of feminist criticism. In Sexual Politics , for example, Kate Millett sees Freud simply as the proponent of a biologistic theory of male supremacy, and as one of the arch-villains in the male plot of patriarchy. Other feminist writers, however, have tried to reevaluate the significance of psychoanalytic theory for feminism. And they have argued that, whilst feminism should indeed always have a critical relationship to psychoanalytic theory, the latter has within it the potential for allowing a better understanding of the complexities of human desires and of the psychological construction of ‘masculinity’ and ‘femininity’. Now any adequate account of self needs to be able, I think, to encompass and try to make intelligible the ways in which women and men experience themselves. And the central reasons for rejecting the ‘humanist’ paradigm of the self — as I have outlined it above — are, firstly, that there may be aspects of the development of self which are not easily accessible to consciousness, and secondly, that there are conscious experiences which are not easy to make intelligible within the humanist paradigm. I want now to look at some aspects of self-experience that I think should be central to any theory of self, and hence to any discussion of women's autonomy. Fantasy The dream (on which we may try hard to impose a narrative structure, to make sense of it) is unlike much fantasy in that it often doesn't, of itself, contain any such structure, and the ‘story’, if it tells one, may be deeply unintelligible to us. Much conscious fantasy is different; we may ‘tell a story’ to ourselves (or listen to a story and fantasise it as about ourselves); and sometimes we may attempt an imagined resolution, through fantasy, of some aspect of our social situation. One might, thus, fantasise the death of someone seen as a threat, or imagine oneself as possessing enormous fame or wealth. But fantasies, not always in the form of a coherent narrative, may  irrupt or intervene; one can be plagued, dominated or obsessed by them. Freud wrote of the way in which fantasies or desires, often seen as evil or dangerous, could come to dominate a person's life. Fantasy may be a threat; it may be inexplicable, bizarre and intrusive. Discovering the fantasies of others, too, may be threatening; the discovery, for example, as Rosalind Coward (1984) suggests, that the ‘mild’ man one lives with is a secret addict of sadomasochistic pornography. Female sexual fantasies can be disturbing as well. Why do many women find The Story of O erotic, and why is there a ‘split’ between sexual fantasy and that which one might find pleasurable or erotic in real life? Fantasy may be experienced both as pleasurable and as dangerous. But sometimes it can just be pleasurable. Coward discusses, for instance, the importance of the fact that one of the biggest growth areas in publishing in recent years has been women's romantic fiction. Unlike the ‘modern’ women's novel in which, usually after a series of disastrous sexual misadventures, the female heroine ends up (more or less)‘her own person’, romantic fiction is stylised, formulaic and unrealistic. It offers women, Coward argues, the fantasised pleasure (and apotheosis of sexual desire) of finding security in the strong arms of the hard-bitten patriarchal hero, along with the pleasure of having ‘tamed’ him and domesticated his wild ways by the power one enjoys over him in being a woman. We have to understand the pleasure there is for women in such fantasies. We have to understand what seems often to attract women more than men to soap operas, or to a passionate interest in the doings of the Royal Family. We need to understand how and why male fantasies may commonly differ from female ones, and why the sorts of fantasies I have mentioned, which may in some ways seem antithetical to feminism, may still have a strong appeal to women who have a feminist allegiance. The ‘Split’ Between Reason and Desire I will suggest, as a first example of this, a book by Suzanne Lowry, on Princess Diana, called The Princess in the Mirror (1985). The appearance of the book is at first glance like that of any other glossy book about the Royals. But it sets out, its author says, to deconstruct the image and appeal of the Princess. At the end of the book, Lowry states that the image of the Princess is conformist and reactionary, that it acts as a powerful form of social control, and that Diana is an unwitting agent of that. Yet the presentation of the book, and Lowry's text, often speak of a fascination with the Princess that is more than simply the fascination one can derive from the exercise of deconstructing an image. And this fascination is often in tension with the attempt to articulate a critique. Or think about the Fonda phenomenon. The text of Fonda's book,Women Coming of Age (1984), exhorts women not to ‘think thin', and its theme is mainly that of health. Yet the illustrations are nearly all of women who are pencil-thin enough not to be out of place on the catwalk in a Paris fashion show. The discourse of ‘health’ is almost inextricably intertwined, in the case of women, with discourse about youth and beauty and sexual attractiveness. The reasons women have for concern about fitness and health are often multiply overdetermined. Notions, for example, of Ageless Ageing (Kenton, 1986)slide between discussions of how to preserve a youthful skin and a young-looking body and how to stave off the ravages of appearing older, with discussions of mental vitality and energy, and so forth . A young-looking body is a sign of an alert mind. There is a type of feminist criticism, both in literature and other media (and in fields such as education), which has been called ‘Images of Women’ criticism. This has supposed that feminist effort should be devoted, first, to showing how the ‘images’ in question oppress or denigrate women, and second, to offering positive images of women to replace these. One problem with this kind of criticism is that the ‘images’ in question have often been misinterpreted, since they have been discussed without reference to the context or narrative structure in which they may appear. But there are two other problems with this type of criticism which I want to focus on here. First, what this approach often fails to recognise is the importance of understanding the appeal of the ‘images’ that are criticised; the relations they may have to women's pleasures, desires, fantasies, fears and conceptions of themselves. Second, it fails to recognise what is signally obvious in the experience of many women, myself of course included, namely that it is perfectly possible to agree ‘in one's head’ that certain images of women might be reactionary or damaging or oppressive, while remaining committed to them in emotion and desire. I suspect that this ‘split’ happens at times in all women, and perhaps particularly in those who have some commitment to feminism. And what it suggests is that structures of desire, emotion and fantasy have deep roots of  some sort in the self which are not necessarily amenable in any simple way to processes of conscious rational argument. An adequate theory of subjectivity has to recognise and try to understand these roots. Contradictions I have already identified more than one type of contradiction; those that can exist between one's fantasies and what one would actually do or enjoy in real life, and those that can exist between one's understanding of the oppressive nature of some discourse or practice and one's continuing investment of desire and finding of pleasure in it. In his Introductory Lectures on Psychoanalysis (1973), Freud discussed the way in which symptoms are experienced in certain forms of obsessional neurosis. He wrote: Obsessional neurosis is shown in the patient's being occupied with thoughts in which he is in fact not interested, in his being aware of impulses which appear very strange to him and his being led to actions the performance of which give him no enjoyment but which it is quite impossible for him to omit. The thoughts (obsessions) may be senseless in themselves, or merely a matter of indifference to the subject; often they are completely silly, and invariably they are the starting-point of a strenuous mental activity, which exhausts the patient and to which he only surrenders himself most unwillingly. (p.297) Obsessional neurosis is characterised, Freud argued, by the fact that the symptoms are not only debilitating, but are experienced by the person as alien ; they do not seem ‘part’ of him or her, and they seem discrepant with an everyday or normal sense of the self. In the case of many of Freud's patients the disruption and debilitation caused by the symptoms was so extreme that they were scarcely able to carry on their lives adequately at all. But Freud insisted that there was no sharp dividing line between ‘normal’ and ‘neurotic’people, and would have argued that similar, though less extreme, obsessions and apparently inexplicable compulsions can be found in all of us. In these cases, the self is, as it were, split against itself, subject to desires and impulses that seem ‘out of character’. But one cannot assume that an everyday ‘coherent’ sense of self is  readily available. One reason for this is that women (and men, of course) are often faced with the problem of negotiating contradictory or conflicting conceptions of themselves. Women may, for example, be required to be both sexually exciting and available,and modest and chaste. And gender relationships may be subject to the problems that can arise from conflicting discourses about femininity or masculinity. Men may, for example,both see themselves as ‘stronger’ than women and tend to see women as more weak and passive, but also see women as having a power over them that can seem to engulf the man in forms of emotional dependence by which he may feel threatened. Discourse about femininity and masculinity is by no means a homogeneous or stable thing. In the twentieth century, the advent of a ‘consumer culture’ and of mass communications has given questions about self and identity a peculiar intensity and difficulty in some respects. They have led, for example, to a focus on appearance and ‘style’, and the way in which these may ‘express’ one's individuality, that is historically novel. The clothes one wears, the ‘room of one's own’ in the Sunday Supplements: one may, apparently, now ‘try on’identities as if they really were clothes. And women have often tended to be the main target of fashion and ‘lifestyle’ talk. For all the rejection of what was sometimes called ‘woman garbage’ by American feminists, the issue of appearance is something that no woman can wholly avoid. Feminists too, of course, have used style of dress and demeanour to express a sense of self and of political commitment. (Elizabeth Wilson recorded once realising that she was more than usually anxious about the question of what to wear when she was going to talk to a feminist group.) Self-knowledge and Self-deception The concept of self-deception is one that has constantly puzzled philosophers. How can one both know and yet not know something about oneself. I do not have space here to discuss the question of self-deception in detail. But an important thing to recognise at the outset is that knowing about oneself can never be a matter of ‘mere information’. One cannot be distanced from or emotionally neutral about issues of self-knowledge. (Freud stressed this in his account of the transference in the analytic situation.) Herbert Fingarette (1959) uses the concept of ‘avowal’ to give an account of the concept of  self-deception. We do not see everything that we think or do or fantasise or desire as equally ‘central’ to ourselves. It is quite common, in everyday discourse, to say things like ‘I wasn't really myself’ or ‘It wasn't like me to do that’. Sometimes this process of rejection, of not avowing, is quite conscious. At other times it may be barely admitted to consciousness, if whatever it was is seen as threatening to the self. And sometimes it is, I think, not conscious at all. Psychoanalysts have talked, for example, about the process of ‘projection’, in which aspects of oneself of which one is fearful may be projected on to other people. (A number of writers have seen ‘projection’ as involved in the problem of masculinity, and have suggested that men may sometimes project their own fears of such things as emotional intimacy on to women, who are then seen as ‘bad’because they cause these problems.) Self-knowledge can never be a matter of easy or immediate introspection. This is partly because aspects of oneself may be disavowed, sometimes unconsciously, and partly because the ‘meaning’ of the deliverances of introspection is always dependent on an interpretation. One may be aware of feelings, sexual ones for example, that one is not able to conceptualise as sexual at the time. Freud believed that at the root of all neuroses lay repressed sexual desires, but even if one does not follow him in this, it would be hard to resist the conclusion that this was true of some of his patients. Sometimes his patients lacked the kind of knowledge that would have enabled them to interpret the experience as ‘sexual’ at all. Sometimes they possessed knowledge about sex, but could not admit that this was sexual, or that they had those sorts of desires. I have outlined above some of the experiences and the problems about subjectivity that any adequate theory of self must be able to encompass, in a way that the ‘humanist’ paradigm is, I think, unable to do. There are approaches to understanding and theorising self which depart radically from the humanist paradigm. I shall not attempt to enumerate them all here, nor do I think that feminism should accept any of them uncritically. What they share, despite their differences, is an insistence that there is no ‘original’ wholeness or unity in the self, nor a ‘real self’which can be thought of as in some way underlying the self of everyday life. The self is always a more or less precarious and conflictual construction out of, and compromise between, conflicting and not always conscious desires and experiences, which are born out of the ambivalences  and contradictions in human experience and relationships with others. Accounts of the construction of the self vary, in the degree of stress, for example, that they lay on the period of infancy and early childhood, and on the importance given to sexuality. But it seems to me that the theories of Freud must be seen as centrally important. It is sometimes argued that Freud's theories must be accepted or rejected all of a piece, and that one cannot simply accept or reject ‘bits’ of them as one fancies. It is true, I think, that there is a certain sort of eclecticism, practised for example by some neo-Freudian writers such as Erich Fromm or by the American ‘ego psychologists’, which may undermine anything useful that Freudian theory really has to offer. But whatever we may take or reject from Freud, what I think we should not lose is the way in which he raises questions and problematises things which are sometimes taken for granted. Freud questions any easy (or utopian) idea or ideal of the unity of the self, he questions the idea that self-knowledge could ever be a matter of simple introspection, and he sees issues about desire and fantasy as central to subjectivity. He stresses the way in which the acquisition of a gendered subjectivity is necessarily conflictual and involves struggle. And above all, perhaps, he forces a radical questioning of the concepts of the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’. Nothing could be further from the truth than Kate Millett's accusation that Freud believed that women's destiny was a simple outcome of their biology. In Freudian theory, there is a constant concern with the way in which entry into culture and human relationships, and the conflicts and struggle this causes, should be seen as constitutive of the human self. Freud's particular view of human culture was problematic. He stressed that psychoanalysis was never concerned solely with desires seen as arising unmediated from the body, but always with psychic representations of these. But he also believed in a sort of Lamarckian view of the inheritance of a ‘primal schema’ of desires and fantasies which determined the form taken by the Oedipal situation. The French psychoanalyst, Jacques Lacan, argued that Freud himself (as well as virtually all the psychoanalysts who revised Freud's theories) never managed to escape fully from the assumption of an already existing gendered subjectivity which entered into the Oedipal situation. And Lacan argued that the human subject must be seen as constituted through language, through entry into the Symbolic Order. According to Lacan, the aim  of psychoanalysis should be rigorously to deconstruct and expose the contradictions and radical fissues in which human subjectivity is born. Feminism, as I have said, needs to preserve a critical distance from all theories of self. But it needs also to engage with those theories which deconstruct the distinction between the ‘individual’ and the ‘social’, which recognise the power of desire and fantasy and the problems of supposing any ‘original’unity in the self, while at the same time preserving its concern with lived experience and the practical and material struggles of women to achieve more autonomy and control over their lives. The appeal of what I have called the ‘humanist paradigm’ lies, I think, in the way it can seem to conceptualise the need women have experienced for this greater degree of autonomy and control, for overcoming the fragmentation and contradictions in their lives, and for a capacity for self-definition. No theory of self should lose sight of these things. I have argued, however, that there are also aspects of women's experience which the humanist paradigm is unable to conceptualise adequately; hence the appeal of theories which attempt to ‘deconstruct’ the self in more radical ways. But the danger in some ‘deconstructionist’ theories, however, is that they seem to leave no space for the material struggles or ordinary aspirations of women. Thus it seems that Lacanian psychoanalysis, both in theory and practice, aims merely to show what a fragmented, decentred thing the human subject is, and Lacan has dismissed all talk of ‘unity’ or ‘identity’as an illusion. It can be argued (though I do not have space to do it here), that there is an incoherence in a view of the subject which regards all notions of unity as an illusion. But there is also a practical and political problem, since it is difficult to see how such a theory could speak in any way to the practical or material concerns of women. The problem, then, is not to be seen as one of whether we should continue to use concepts like ‘identity’ or ‘autonomy’at all, or simply reject them out of hand. It is a problem, rather, of how to offer an interpretation of them which neither assumes the original unitary self of the humanist paradigm, nor ignores the needs of women. And Freud can again provide a useful starting point. It is true that Freudian theory questions any notion of the original unity of the self. But it is not true that Freudian theory has no space for ideas of unity or autonomy. The purpose of psychoanalytic therapy, according to Freud, was to remove the power of the symptom by  making it intelligible, by showing the sense that it had. Psychoanalysis aimed to trace its roots in unconscious desires (though this was not a process merely of intellectual understanding). The unintelligible, alien quality of the symptom will be removed. But for this to happen, a person's conception of themselves must also be transformed. They must, for example, be able to think of themselves as ‘the sort of person who does have incestuous sexual desires’, is prepared to avow them as ‘part’ of the self, and ceases to be so threatened by them. Part of this process of change is a greater tolerance of certain aspects of oneself, and a lesser propensity for these to cause guilt or anxiety. But, paradoxically perhaps, this greater tolerance may result in less fragmentation, more coherence, and less subjection to the forms of anxiety or guilt or compulsive behaviour that may once have been so deeply disturbing or threatening. It seems to me that there is a sort of dialectic we need to preserve when thinking about autonomy. There is no authentic or unified ‘original’ self which can simply be recovered or discovered as the source of ‘autonomous’actions. But we are often faced with the experienced need to make ‘sense’ of our lives and our feelings and goals, to relate confused fragments of ourselves into something that seems more coherent and of which we feel more in control. We are often also faced, however, with the need to tolerate contradictions, not to strive for an illusory or impossible ideal, and to avoid self-punishing forms of anxiety, defence and guilt (and feminist guilt can be as punishing as any other kind). The dialectic of autonomy is one in which a constant (but never static or final) search for control and coherence needs balancing against a realism and tolerance born out of efforts to understand ourselves (and others) better."
ACA ACA-HWV-001 8.84 "ARTICLES Immunogenicity of a supplemental dose of oral versus inactivated poliovirus vaccine In many developing countries, the immunogenicity of three doses of live, attenuated, oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) is lower than that in industrialised countries. We evaluated serum neutralising antibody responses in 368 children aged 6 months and 346 children aged 9 months in Coôte d'Ivoire who had previously received three doses of OPV at 2, 3, and 4 months of age, and who were then randomised to receive a supplemental dose of OPV or enhanced-potency inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV) at the time of measles vaccination. Although both vaccines increased seroconversion to all three poliovirus types, antibody responses were greater in the IPV group. Among children with no detectable antibody at baseline, IPV was 2 to 14 times more likely than OPV to induce seroconversion (type 1, 80% vs 40% at 6 months [p < 0.001]and 81% vs 14% at 9 months [p < 0.001]; type 3, 76% vs 22% at 6 months [p < 0.001], and 67% vs 5% at 9 months [p < 0.001]). Among children with detectable antibody at baseline, IPV was 1.4 to 7 times more likely than OPV to elicit 4-fold or more rises in antibody titre (p < 0.01). Geometric mean titres (GMTs) to all three poliovirus types were also consistently higher among IPV recipients than in OPV recipients when measured 4–6 weeks and 13–17 months after vaccination. Administration of a supplemental dose of IPV or OPV, which requires no additional visits or changes in the existing immunisation schedule, might improve protection against paralytic poliomyelitis in communities with suboptimum seroconversion rates after three doses of OPV. Introduction Widespread use of trivalent oral poliovirus vaccine (OPV) has almost eliminated paralytic poliomyelitis from industrialised countries. However, the vaccine's effectiveness in developing countries, particularly in inducing serum neutralising antibodies against poliovirus types 1 and 3, has often been lower than expected. There have also been poliomyelitis outbreaks despite high vaccine uptake, which suggests that strategies that rely exclusively on routine administration of OPV are inadequate to achieve global eradication of poliomyelitis by the year 2000. Biannual national vaccination days and house-to-house visits to vaccinate children in high-risk areas have been successful in eliminating wild poliomyelitis infection from Latin America, and have become the cornerstone of the current global eradication strategy. Nevertheless, supplements to the OPV regimen that might hasten eradication should also be evaluated. One option would be the use of enhanced-potency, inactivated poliovirus vaccine (IPV), which induces detectable neutralising antibody in almost all recipients after three doses. However, because of important limitations of IPV compared with OPV, which include low secretory antibody responses and absence of secondary spread to susceptible contacts, use of IPV alone in polio-endemic countries is thought unlikely to achieve eradication. Combined regimens have greatly reduced the incidence of  poliomyelitis in the Israeli-occupied West Bank and Gaza, but the cost and complexities of this schedule have precluded use of both vaccines in other developing countries. To assess the relative immunogenicity of one supplemental dose of IPV or OPV at the time of measles vaccination, we did a randomised trial in Abidjan, Coôte d'Ivoire, among children who had previously received three doses of OPV. Subjects and methods Population and study design The study population consisted of 6-month-old and 9-month-old childen who, between October, 1990, and April, 1991, attended a large primary health-care centre for the poor in Abidjan. ‘9-month-old children’ entered the trial consecutively, at the time of their visit to the clinic for routine measles vaccination with standard-dose Schwarz measles vaccine. These children were eligible to enter the trial if they were between 37 and 43 weeks of age and if their immunisation record indicated that they had received their first dose of OPV between 6 and 12 weeks of age and their second and third doses at 4 to 6 week intervals. ‘6-month-old children’ were eligible if they were between 24 and 30 weeks of age and had been immunised with OPV as above. By use of a computer-generated list of codes, 400 9-month-olds and 406 6-month-olds were randomly assigned to receive one dose of IPV or OPV (6-month-old children also received Edmonston-Zagreb measles vaccine; results have been reported elsewhere). Although the parents and the study staff were not blinded to the vaccine groups, parents gave informed consent before knowing which vaccine their child would receive. Active follow-up of all children, which included home visits to the last known address, was done approximately 1 year later (March–April, 1992). Vaccines Single lots of OPV packaged in 10-dose vials and IPV packaged in single-dose syringes were used. The potencies of each vaccine (as measured by an independent World Health Organization [WHO]collaborating centre) were 6.52, 5.50, and 5.93 log 1 50% tissue culture infectious dose (TCID 5 ) of poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3, respectively, per dose (OPV), and 37, 8, and 30 D-antigen units per dose of types 1, 2, and 3, respectively (IPV); these potencies were within the range recommended by WHO. Cold-chain monitors were used during shipment and storage. Vaccines were kept in a cold room in Abidjan, and limited supplies were kept at the clinic in a refrigerator that was used exclusively for this study. Temperature was monitored and recorded twice daily at both storage sites, according to standard WHO procedures. No breaks in the cold chain were documented at the central storage facility, although vaccines kept at the study site were discarded on two occasions after power failures that lasted several hours. No more potency testing was done during or after the trial. Specimen collection and testing Blood specimens were obtained from each child by venepuncture at the time of vaccination and then 4 to 6 weeks and 13 to 17 months later. Sera were separated by centrifugation within 8 h of collection, transferred to another container, and labelled with a unique identification number so that antibody assays could be done blind. Samples were stored at -20°C until they were shipped on dry ice to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Atlanta, for testing. Neutralising antibody titres against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were measured with a modified microneutralisation assay. Approximately 80 to 100 TCID 5 of each vaccine virus and serial dilutions of serum (from 1:8 to 1:1024) were incubated at 35.8C for 2.5 h, and then 7.5×10 HeLa cells were added to each well. After incubation for 3 days at 35.8°C, each microtitre plate was stained with 0.05% crystal violet in 25% ethyl alcohol. Optical density in all wells was measured by an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay reader to minimise variability in interpretation and to eliminate errors in transcribing results. Each specimen was run in triplicate, and the final result was determined by the method of Spearman-Karber. The sensitivity of reproducibility of the assay had been established previously by direct comparison with the standard microneutralisation test and with international reference sera. Statistical analysis Differences in antibody responses between the study groups were assessed by comparison of (i) rates of seroconversion (defined as a change in antibody titre from undetectable [<8]to detectable [8];(ii) rates of secondary 4-fold or greater rises in antibody titre in seropositive children for whom additional 4-fold rises could be reliably documented with a neutralisation upper limit of 1:1024 — ie, children with baseline titres of 8–256; and (iii) type-specific geometric mean titres (GMTs) among the total study population and among children who seroconverted or had secondary 4-fold or greater rises in antibody after vaccination. Overall seroprevalence and GMTs 13–17 months after vaccination were extrapolated from titres measured in the 164 participants who could be located in March–April, 1992, in proportion to the serological state of children within each age group and vaccine subgroup at baseline and at 4–6 weeks after vaccination. Chi-squared, Fisher's exact, Student's t, and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to detect significant differences among vaccine groups; 95% confidence intervals (CI) for proportions were calculated on a logit scale and converted to the original scale, and 95% CIs for GMTs were calculated with the method of normal approximation. Results Study participants Of the 806 children enrolled in the study, we obtained a second serum specimen from 714 (88.6%) 4–6 weeks after vaccination, and a third specimen from 164 (23%) 13–17 months later. At the time of entry into the study, overall seroprevalences among 6-month-old and 9-month-old children, respectively, were 75% and 84% for poliovirus type 1 (p < 0.01), 92% in both age groups for type 2, and 62% and 75% for type 3 (p < 0.001). Within each age group, however, there were no differences between OPV and IPV subgroups (table I). The proportion of children who could be found 13–17 months after vaccination was also similar in  each subgroup (table I), with no significant differences in demographic characteristics when compared with children whom we could not locate (data not shown). No paralyses or other serious adverse events after OPV or IPV were reported at the 4–6 week visit. 4–6 weeks after vaccination Figs 1 and 2 illustrate the effect of supplemental IPV and OPV on the immune state of the whole study population, pre and post vaccination seroprevalences, and GMTs for all 714 children. In both age groups, increases in the proportion of children with detectable antibody to poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 were significantly greater after vaccination with IPV than with OPV, even after adjustment for minor differences in baseline seroprevalence. In 6-month-old IPV recipients (fig 1), overall seroprevalences 4–6 weeks after vaccination increased from 73% to 94% (21%) for type 1, from 93% to 100% (7%) for type 2, and from 67% to 89% (22%) for type 3. The OPV recipients' increases were from 76% to 85% (9%) for type 1, from 91% to 95% (4%) for type 2, and from 57% to 65% (8%) for type 3. In 9-month-old IPV recipients (fig 2), overall seroprevalences 4–6 weeks after vaccination had increased from 85% to 97% (12%) for type 1, from 93% to 100% (7%) for type 2, and from 76% to 92% (16%) for type 3. Increases in the OPV recipients were from 83% to 85% (2%) for type 1, from 91% to 94% for type 2 (3%), and no change (75%) for type 3. Pre versus post vaccination GMTs at 4–6 weeks of all three poliovirus types also increased significantly among 6-month-old and 9-month-old children who received IPV, with smaller increases among those who received OPV (figs 1 and 2). The responses to measles vaccine were equivalent in the two vaccine subgroups. 13–17 months after vaccination In both age groups, the estimated (projected) proportion of children who remained seropositive 13–17 months after vaccination tended to be higher in the IPV group than in the OPV group, although few of these differences were statistically significant. Among 6-month-olds (fig 1), estimated seroprevalences among children who received IPV were 96% for type 1, 100% for type 2, and 92% for type 3, compared with 89% (p < 0.01), 99% (p=NS), and  76% (p < 0.01) for types 1, 2, and 3, respectively, among children who received OPV. Seroprevalences for types 1, 2, and 3 among 9-month-olds (fig 2), were 100%, 100%, and 91%, for IPV recipients, and 96%, 95%, and 90% among OPV recipients (p=NS for all comparisons). The extent to which wild type 1 and 3 infections may have contributed to rapid increases in seroprevalences in OPV recipients between 4–6 weeks and 13–17 months after vaccination is uncertain, since clinical and virological surveillance for poliomyelitis was not done in Abidjan during the study. Estimated (projected) GMTs of all three poliovirus types remained stable in both OPV and IPV recipients 13–17 months after vaccination (figs 1 and 2), although 2.4-fold reductions in GMTs to poliovirus types 1 and 3 were seen in 9-month-old children who had received IPV (fig 2). Seroconversion in seronegative children Of the 714 children, 301 (42.2%) had no detectable antibody against one or more poliovirus types at the time of vaccination. As shown in table II, seronegative children who had received IPV were 2 to 14 times more likely to seroconvert than those who had received OPV; seroconversion rates in the IPV group were from 67% to 100%, compared with only 5% to 53% in the OPV group (p < 0.001). GMTs 4–6 weeks after vaccination tended to be lower among IPV recipients for types 1 and 2, but were significantly higher for type 3, particularly among 6-month-olds (table II). Most of the children who seroconverted and who could be located 13–17 months after vaccination remained seropositive (table III). For those subgroups with numbers sufficient for comparison, there were no significant differences in seroprevalences or GMTs between children who received IPV or OPV (table III). Antibody titre rises in selected seropositive children As shown in table IV, rates of secondary 4-fold increases in antibody titre in children with baseline titres between 8 and 256 were significantly higher for all three poliovirus types among children who received IPV compared with children who took OPV. IPV recipients also had significantly higher post-vaccination GMTs to poliovirus type 3 (p < 0.001), but not to types 1 and 2. Discussion Although the production of type-specific secretory antibody has been associated with protection against poliovirus infection, large-scale efficacy trials and more limited case-control or cohort studies conducted during outbreaks of poliomyelitis indicate that detectable serum neutralising antibody is correlated with clinical protection against disease. For this reason, the variable and often unsatisfactory seroconversion rates in developing countries after routine administration of OPV are of concern, especially in tropical areas where wild poliovirus infection remains endemic. The percentages of children in the present study who had detectable neutralising antibody against poliovirus types 1, 2, and 3 after three doses of OPV are similar to percentages reported from other developing countries, and contribute to the increasing evidence that routine vaccination with OPV at 6, 10, and 14 weeks of age might leave many children susceptible to infection. Because of the association between clinical vaccine efficacy and detectable serum neutralising antibody, children who remain seronegative after three doses of OPV are of great importance in the control and eventual eradication of poliomyelitis. Compared with a supplemental dose of OPV, one dose of IPV administered at the time of measles vaccination at 6 or 9 months of age induced significantly higher seroconversion to one or more serotypes at the time of vaccination. Seroconversion rates in these children (67% to 100%) were much higher than rates after one dose of IPV administered to newborn infants (20% to 43%), which may be because of maturation of the immune system, the priming effect of previous OPV administration, or a reduction in interference from maternal antibody when IPV is given to older children. Although seroconversion rates after a supplemental (fourth) dose of OPV were, in contrast, somewhat lower than expected, rates of secondary 4-fold rises in antibody (‘booster’ responses) in seropositive children who received OPV were similar to those found in earlier studies, which suggests that the low response rates in seronegative children were not due to vaccine subpotency. Lower seroconversion rates in 9-month-olds than in 6-month-olds could be due to a higher incidence of infections with non-polio enteroviruses or other enteric pathogens, which are known to interfere with antibody responses to OPV. Administration of IPV resulted in substantial increases in the seroprevalence and GMTs 4–6 weeks after vaccination, but there were few differences between the study groups when antibody titres were measured 13–17 months later. These findings are unlikely to be due to delayed antibody responses in the OPV group, since peak antibody concentrations are usually attained within 2–4 weeks after vaccination. Besides secondary exposure to vaccine virus, an explanation for high seropositivity rates in the OPV group was a high incidence of wild poliovirus infection during the study period; this hypothesis is supported by differences in seroprevalences to types 1 and 3 between 6-month-old and 9-month-old children at the beginning of the study. Natural infection may have also contributed to the high seroprevalences in the IPV group 13–17 months after vaccination, although evidence from previous studies in poliomyelitis-free areas suggests that this finding is more likely to be due to brisk secondary responses in children who had been primed with OPV and who later received poliovirus antigen parenterally in the form of IPV. Even if antibody concentrations began to decline 4–6 weeks after vaccination with IPV, the high titres achieved initially would be likely to persist throughout much of the period of maximum risk of paralytic poliomyelitis, which in most developing countries occurs between 6 and 18 months of age. An important question that could not be addressed in this study is whether a single dose of IPV would also reduce the risk of infection with wild poliovirus and subsequent spread to susceptible contacts. Although the effect of combined schedules on wild virus circulation has not been established, large reductions in the incidence of paralytic disease were achieved in the Israeli-occupied territories of the West Bank and Gaza following routine administration of two doses of IPV and five doses of OPV during the first year of life. In addition, Sabin observed that seronegative children who were previously immunised with OPV often develop secondary immune responses when challenged with IPV, and have low rates of virus excretion when rechallenged with vaccine virus. Other investigators have also shown that the magnitude and duration of excretion that follows a challenge with vaccine virus is correlated with the concentration of serum neutralising antibody. Because IPV recipients typically have higher post-vaccination antibody concentrations than OPV recipients, particularly for types 1 and 3, a combined schedule might be expected to reduce the risk of wild poliovirus infection and spread to susceptible contacts. Nevertheless, until direct evidence of such an effect has been obtained through the supplementary use of IPV, combined schedules should not be regarded as a substitute for the proven strategy of mass vaccination campaigns for the global eradication programme. Although changes in global policy cannot be made on the basis of the present study alone, the results suggest that a supplemental dose of IPV or OPV administered at the time of measles vaccination might increase a population's immunity against poliovirus types 1 and 3. Such increases can be achieved without additional visits in the routine immunisation schedule, and would also provide an added incentive for programme managers to ensure high rates of compliance at the 6 or 9 month visit for measles vaccination. The incremental cost of implementing either regimen (US$0.08 per dose for OPV and US$0.35–0.50 per dose for IPV) is similar to or lower than the cost of mass vaccination campaigns (US$0.68–3.60 per dose), and would also be less than expansion of the routine immunisation schedule to provide even more doses. Although its effect on the circulation of wild polioviruses has not been established, the incorporation of a single supplemental dose of IPV into vaccination regimens could substantially reduce the number of paralyses in countries where immunisation coverage with 3 or more doses of OPV is high (90%), but where immunogenicity studies have revealed large gaps in immunity to poliovirus types 1 and 3. Although reductions in the number of clinically apparent cases may mask the circulation of wild polioviruses in the absence of highly sensitive surveillance systems, and potentially delay implementation of control measures, further advances in laboratory techniques to detect wild poliovirus in the environment should increase the likelihood of detection of ‘silent’ spread of infection. In countries that have not yet achieved high immunisation coverage with OPV, resources would be better spent in raising a population's immunity through a combination of improved routine services and the initiation of mass campaigns. This study was supported in part by grant no AID 698-0421.81 from the US Agency for International Development to the Combatting Childhood Communicable Diseases Project. The study protocol was reviewed and approved by the Direction Générale de la Santé Publique, Coôte d'Ivoire; by the Institutional Review Board of the CDC; and by the Secretariat Committee on Research Involving Human Subjects, WHO. Vaccines were kindly donated by Smith Kline Beecham (OPV) and Pasteur-Merieux Serums et Vaccins (IPV). Expression of endothelin-1 in lungs of patients withcryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis The vasoconstrictor and mitogenic peptide endothelin-1 (ET-1) is believed to play a part in fibrosis and collagen production. We examined expression of ET-1 in lung tissue from 52 patients with interstitial lung fibrosis, of whom 45 had cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA), 10 had CFA and concomitant pulmonary hypertension, and 7 had non-specific focal fibrosis. 17 normal unused donor lungs were studied as controls. Immunohistochemistry and in-situ hybridisation were done with polyclonal antisera to ET-1 and its precursor big ET-1, and complementary RNA probes for preproET-1. Normal lung tissue and that from patients with focal fibrosis expressed very little ET-1. By contrast, there was striking expression of ET-1 in lung tissue from patients with CFA. Immunostains for ET-1 and big ET-1 and expression of ET-1 mRNA were most prominent in airway epithelium and type II pneumocytes, particularly those lining areas of young granulation tissue. ET-1-like immunoreactivity and mRNA were also present in pulmonary vascular endothelial cells, particularly in specimens from patients with pulmonary hypertension. In all patients, there was a significant correlation between ET-1-like immunoreactivity and histological parameters of disease activity (r=0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.87, p < 0.001). These findings suggest a possible role for cell-specific expression of ET-1 in the pathogenesis of CFA and associated pulmonary hypertension. Introduction Cryptogenic fibrosing alveolitis (CFA) is a fatal condition of unknown cause. Common functional abnormalities of this condition include reductions in forced vital capacity (FVC), carbon monoxide diffusing capacity (DLCO), and oxygen partial pressure. The pathology of CFA is characterised by inflammation, type II pneumocyte and fibroblastic proliferation, and collagen deposition. Macrophages and other inflammatory cells produce several cytokines and growth factors that could contribute to the early pathogenesis and progression of CFA. The pulmonary epithelium itself produces growth factors that may influence the proliferation of underlying mesenchymal cells in the alveolar wall. A putative growth factor expressed in the respiratory epithelium is endothelin-1 (ET-1), a vasoconstrictor and mitogenic peptide. ET-1 belongs to a family of peptides (endothelins 1, 2, and 3) that possess close structural and biological similarities. ET-1 is produced by transcription and translation as a 212-residue precursor (prepro) molecule, which is subsequently processed to ‘big ET-1’ and finally cleaved by an endothelin-converting enzyme to ET-1. Binding sites for ET-1 and its receptor mRNA are found in the airways and pulmonary vasculature of various species including man. Apart from its vasoconstrictive and bronchoconstrictive characteristics, ET-1 is a mitogen for smooth muscle cells, fibroblasts, and other cell types. ET-1 mRNA and mature peptide have been localised to the pulmonary epithelium of healthy subjects and those with asthma. We have demonstrated expression of ET-1 in pulmonary endocrine cells, and reported that ET-1 expression is increased in the lung vasculature of patients with pulmonary hypertension, which may contribute to the medial hyperplasia and intimal fibrosis of this disorder. In the latter study, we also noted prominent type II pneumocyte expression of ET-1 in a small number of patients with pulmonary hypertension and fibrosis. In view of the biological and pharmacological activities of ET-1, we wondered whether production of ET-1 by respiratory epithelium may contribute to cellular proliferation and fibrosis in CFA. We describe a study designed to determine the sites of ET-1 expression in patients with CFA, and to correlate these findings with histological changes in the disease. Patients and methods Patients The study was approved by the ethics committees of the participating hospitals. Lung-tissue specimens were collected from 52 patients who had undergone open lung biopsy or lung transplantation and had a clinical and/or histological diagnosis of interstitial lung fibrosis, and, as a control group, from 17 lungs intended for transplant but unused. The patient population was divided into three groups: group A consisted of 35 patients with CFA only, group B of 10 patients with CFA and pulmonary hypertension, and group C of 7 patients with various lung disorders other than CFA or pulmonary hypertension (usually with focal non-specific fibrosis). Patients in groups A and C had no clinical indications of pulmonary hypertension in their records and no flexiform lesions in histology sections. Patients' final diagnoses were based on histological and clinical findings (table I). Tissues were obtained at open lung biopsy or at the time of transplantation, and fixed in formalin for immunohistochemistry and in 4% paraformaldehyde in phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) for in-situ hybridisation. Formalin-fixed tissues were embedded in paraffin. Paraformaldehyde-fixed tissues were washed in a 15% solution of sucrose in PBS, placed in Tissue-Tek embedding medium, and stored in liquid nitrogen. Immunohistochemistry Multiple-step paraffin sections (4–5 m) were immunostained with two ET-1 antisera — one for the c-terminal pepetide of ET-1 and one for the c-terminal peptide of big ET-1 (big ET-122–38)— µby the avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex method. Rabbit antiserum to von Willebrand factor VIII (Dakopatts, Glostrup, Denmark) was used as a marker for endothelial cells. Sections were dewaxed in toluene, dehydrated in ethanol, washed in PBS, and immersed in a solution of 0.3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to eliminate endogenous peroxidase activity. Sections were washed three times for 5 min in PBS and incubated in 10% normal goat serum for 30 min. The serum was drained and sections incubated with ET-1 antiserum overnight at 4°C. After three 5 min washes in PBS, sections were incubated with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit IgG antiserum for 45 min, washed in PBS, and incubated with avidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (Vector Laboratories, Burlingame, California, USA) for 45 min. Sites of immunoreaction were visualised by immersing sections in a solution of diaminobenzidine and hydrogen peroxide. Sections were counterstained with haematoxylin, cleared, and mounted in Permount. As a control, sections from all patient and control lungs were stained with ET-1 antiserum that had been immunoabsorbed with synthetic ET-1 overnight at 4°C, or incubated with normal goat serum instead of the primary antisera. Additional lung sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological diagnosis and semi-quantitative grading, the grading being done by a modification of the system of Hyde et al. Specifically, sections were graded from 0 to 4 for chronic inflammation, granulation tissue, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, dense fibrosis, and pulmonary-vessel-wall changes. Grade 1 included focal mild changes, whereas grades 2, 3, and 4 represented diffuse mild, moderate, and severe lesions, respectively. The airway epithelium, type II pneumocytes, and vascular endothelium of ET-1-stained sections were also graded semiquantitatively from 0 to 4, with grade 0 representing no staining, grade 1 focal staining, and grades 2, 3, and 4 diffuse weak, moderate, and strong staining, respectively. Grading was done and agreed upon by four pathologists (A. G., R. P. M., Q. H., M. S.) without knowledge of the patient's diagnosis. In-situ hybridisation In-situ hybridisation was by a modification of a method reported previously. Briefly, cryostat sections were picked up on poly-L-lysone-coated slides and dried at 37°C for 2 h. Sections were permeabilised in a solution of proteinase K and the reaction stopped by immersion in 4% paraformaldehyde. To prevent non-specific signals, sections were washed in a solution of acetic anhydride and triethanolamine. Sections were then dehydrated in ethanol and air dried. Hybridisation of sections took place in a mixture containing 1×10 counts per min per section of S-labelled ET-1 complementary RNA probe for 14 h at 42°C. Sections were then washed in decreasing concentrations of standard sodium citrate, and unhybridised probe was removed by incubation in a solution of RNAse A (20 mg/mL) in double-strength standard sodium citrate. After dehydration in decreasing concentrations of alcohol, sections were air dried, dipped in autoradiographic emulsion (Amersham), and exposed in light-tight boxes for one week at 4°C. Consecutive sections were stained with haematoxylin and eosin for histological evaluation of in-situ hybridisation results. As a control, sections from patient and control lungs were hybridised with a probe with a sequence identical to that of the coding ET-1 mRNA (sense probe), or treated with RNAse A solution before hybridisation with the ET-1 complementary RNA probe. Statistical analysis Results were expressed as means (SE). We used the Systat program (Systat, Evanston, USA) for statistical analyses by analysis of variance and the Tukey post-hoc test. Correlation coefficients were calculated by Spearman rank correlation test and, in selected instances, the chi square test. Statistical significance was taken to be p < 0.05. Results Most patients were hypoxaemic, had a reduced DLCO, forced expiratory volume in 1s (FEV 1 ), and FVC, and a high FEV 1 /FVC. Patients in group B had high pulmonary arterial pressure and pulmonary vascular resistance (table I). Patients in groups A and B showed moderate to severe interstitial fibrosis (fig 1). The architecture of the lung parenchyma was disturbed with rearrangement and simplification of the airspaces, which were separated by wide bands of fibrous connective tissue with variable degrees of chronic inflammation. The interstitium was thickened by either granulation tissue or dense fibrosis and in the worst cases showed honeycombing. Pulmonary arteries showed an arteriopathy that varied in severity and extent, often demonstrating medial thickening and eccentric intimal proliferation. Semi-quantitative grades for all histological parameters except chronic inflammation were higher for groups A and B than for group C (fig 1). The only notable difference between groups A and B was the more severe arteriopathy in group B. When the histological parameters associated with active disease (ie, granulation tissue and type II pneumocyte hyperplasia) were summed, values were 4.6 (0.4) and 4.0 (0.6) in groups A and B, respectively, and 1.0 (0.5) in group C. Endothelin-1-like immunoreactivity (ET-1-IR) was seen only occasionally in the pulmonary vascular endothelium and neuroendocrine cells of the control lungs, and there was no staining over other epithelial cells. In patients with CFA (groups A and B), ET-1-IR localised predominantly to hyperplastic alveolar type II pneumocytes, undifferentiated epithelial cells, and small airway epithelial cells (fig 2, panels A–C). Epithelial cells lining the airspaces adjacent to granulation tissue showed greater ET-1-IR (fig 2, panels A and B), whereas those adjacent to areas of dense fibrosis usually showed a weaker immunoreaction (fig 2, panel C). ET-1-IR was also seen occasionally in inflammatory and neuroendocrine cells. Variable ET-1-IR was seen in the vascular endothelium, this being particularly the case for Fig 2 — ET-1-IR in diseased human lungs. ET-1-IR in airway epithelial cells (A) and type II pneumocytes (B, C) of patients with CFA; ET-1-IR in vascular endothelium and type II pneumocytes in a lung section from a patient with pulmonary hypertension secondary to CFA (D). Only focal immunostaining for ET-1 was seen in lung sections from patients with focal non-specific fibrosis (E). Panel F demonstrates expression of ET-1 mRNA in a lung section from a patient with CFA. Magnifications: A, D, and F ×250; B, C, and E ×125. vessels with medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis (fig 2, panel D). Specimens from patients with non-specific focal fibrosis (group C) usually showed weak focal staining in a few epithelial and endothelial cells (fig 2, panel E). Most patients in group A had greater staining for big ET-1 than for mature ET-1. No staining was evident in the control lung sections. Semi-quantitative analyses of ET-1-IR in groups A and B showed similar magnitudes of epithelial-cell staining; however, vascular-endothelial-cell staining was greater in group B. Both groups with CFA had significantly more epithelial-cell staining than group C patients (fig 3). We summed the ET-1-IR grades for all epithelial cell types (ie, airway epithelium and type II pneumocytes), and found  higher values in groups A (3.09 [0.4]) and B (4.0 [0.3]) than in group C (0.9 [0.5])(p < 0.01). ET-1-IR in both airway epithelium and type II pneumocytes correlated significantly with young granulation tissue and type II cell proliferation (table II). Arteriopathy grade correlated significantly with ET-1-IR in both epithelial and endothelial cells, whereas there was no significant correlation between either chronic inflammation or dense fibrosis and ET-1-IR in any cell type. To analyse the correlations further, we summed the histology grades (young granulation tissue and type II pneumocyte proliferation) and correlated this with the summed airway epithelium and type II pneumocyte staining. This correlation was highly significant by both Spearman rank correlation test (r=0.78, 95% CI 0.65–0.87, p < 0.001) and the chi square test (). The distribution of ET-1 mRNA demonstrated by in-situ hybridisation was similar to the distribution of ET-1-IR. ET-1 mRNA was expressed mainly in hyperplastic type II pneumocytes and airway epithelium (fig 2, panel F). Comparison of hybridisation sections with consecutive sections stained with haematoxylin and eosin revealed clusters of silver grains deposited mainly over the epithelial cells adjacent to young granulation tissue. By contrast, the density of silver-grain deposits over airway and alveolar epithelium underlined by dense fibrosis was only slightly higher than the background density. Hybridisation signals were also detected in the vascular endothelium of pulmonary arteries, especially those with severe arteriopathy. Only scattered signals were seen over sections from group C patients' lungs or normal lungs. No hybridisation signals were seen over control sections. Discussion Our findings demonstrate for the first time increased expression of ET-1 in the lungs of patients with CFA compared with the lungs of subjects without CFA. Alveolar type II pneumocytes and airways epithelial cells were the main sites of ET-1 expression, and the magnitude of immunostaining correlated well with the extent of type II pneumocyte proliferation and adjacent granulation tissue. ET-1 was also expressed in the vascular endothelium of pulmonary vessels with severe morphological changes, this expression being particularly striking in lungs of patients with both CFA and pulmonary hypertension. Therefore, increased expression of ET-1 in epithelial and endothelial cells may reflect a disease-specific activation of the cell types, which possibly contributes to the pathogenesis of CFA and associated pulmonary hypertension. Semiquantitative analyses of ET-1 immunostaining in lung sections revealed significant differences between the control groups (group C and normal lungs) and patients with CFA (groups A and B). Prominent staining was seen in the lungs of patients with CFA, which was localised predominantly to the airway epithelium and type II pneumocytes. By contrast, only weak and infrequent staining was seen in group C or normal control lungs, a finding that is consistent with our previous results. In addition, ET-1-IR grades for all patients correlated significantly with histological parameters of disease activity — ie, presence of granulation tissue and type II pneumocyte proliferation. Previous studies have shown that ET-1 is a mitogen for fibroblasts and acts synergistically to amplify the response of these cells to other growth factors. Furthermore, raised plasma ET-1 concentrations and ET-1-induced deposition of collagen by fibroblasts have been reported in patients with scleroderma and systemic sclerosis. Indeed, ultrastructural features of CFA include, in the exudative phase, loss of type I pneumocytes and exposure of the underlying basement membrane, and, in the proliferative phase, increased contacts between epithelial cells and fibroblasts. Moreover, Adamson et al found that in epithelial-cell-fibroblast cocultures, direct contact between these cells greatly increased the rate of fibroblast growth. Thus, the proliferation stage of CFA may depend to large extent on mitogenic factors produced by the epithelium, including transforming growth factor, tumour necrosis factor, and ET-1, acting synergistically to stimulate fibroblast growth and extracellular production. Increased ET-1 production by the epithelium could also have an autocrine role, by promoting proliferation of type II pneumocytes. There are several possible mechanisms for increased ET-1 expression and for a role for this molecule in the pathogenesis of CFA. Bronchioalveolar lavage samples and lung tissue from patients with CFA show increases in polymorphonuclear leucocytes and macrophages. These cells release enzymes, lymphokines, cytokines, and growth factors that can act on parenchymal and mesenchymal cells. Some of these products have been shown to induce ET-1 synthesis and release in various cell types. Endo et al have shown that tumour necrosis factor, transforming growth factor, and interleukin-8 increase ET-1 synthesis in guineapig tracheal epithelial cell cultures. Therefore, increased ET-1 expression in epithelial cells may be mediated, at least in part, by cytokines released from inflammatory cells. Patients in group B had more severe arteriopathy than those in group A and greater staining of the endothelium. These findings are in agreement with our previous observations of increased ET-1 expression in pulmonary arteries with severe morphological changes in patients with pulmonary hypertension. In addition to its potent vasoconstrictive actions, ET-1 is also a mitogen for vascular smooth muscle cells. Therefore, our data support the notion that ET-1 may contribute to the functional and morphological abnormalities of pulmonary vasculature associated with CFA. To determine whether the ET-1-IR was the result of increased local synthesis, and not of uptake of ET-1 from the circulation, in-situ hydridisation with a complementary RNA probe was done. Specific cellular localisation of silver  grains, indicating the presence of preproET-1 mRNA, was found over the same cells that demonstrated ET-1 immunostaining. Most patients in group A showed greater immunostaining with big ET-1 than with ET-1 antisera, suggesting a predominance of precursor and providing evidence of increased local synthesis of ET-1 in the lung of patients with CFA. The abundance of big ET-1 suggests that conversion to the mature peptide by endothelin-converting enzyme may be a rate-limiting step in the processing of ET-1 in lungs. Alternatively, this abundance may be a feature of the cytokine-stimulation profile, since interleukins 1, 2, and 6 have been shown to increase the relative production of big ET-1 to ET-1 in cultured tracheal epithelial cells. Our demonstration of increased expression of ET-1 mRNA and production of ET-1, particularly the propeptide, by alveolar type II pneumocytes and airway epithelial cells points to a pathogenic role for this peptide in the morphological changes characteristic of CFA. Moreover, the finding that increased ET-1 expression is closely related to the active stage of the disease, which has the most favourable prognosis, suggests that ET-1 is a marker of disease activity. With the availability of effective pharmacological antagonist of the endothelin system in the very near future, it may soon be possible to test directly the contribution of ET-1 to the progression of disease in patients with CFA. Randomised controlled trial of nasal ventilation inacute ventilatory failure due to chronic obstructiveairways disease Acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) are a common cause of admission to hospital, and have a high mortality. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been used successfully in patients with respiratory failure due to neuromuscular and skeletal disorders, but the outcome of treatment in patients with COAD is less well known. We carried out a prospective randomised controlled trial of conventional treatment versus conventional treatment plus NIPPV, in 60 patients with acute ventilatory failure due to exacerbations of COAD. For the NIPPV group there was a rise in pH, compared with a fall in the controls (mean difference of change between the groups 0.046 [95% CI 0.06–0.02, p < 0.001]), and a larger fall in PaCO 2 (mean difference in change between the groups 1.2 kPa [95% CI 0.45 to 2.03, p < 0.01]). Median visual analogue scores over the first 3 days of admission showed less breathlessness in the NIPPV group (2.3 cm [range 0.1–5.5]) than in the control group (4.5 cm [range 0.9–8.8])(p < 0.025). Survival rates at 30 days were compared for intention-to-treat and efficacy populations. In the efficacy mortality comparison, mortality in the NIPPV group was reduced: 1/26 vs 9/30 (relative risk=0.13, CI=0.02–0.95, p=0.014). This effect was less in the intention-to-treat analysis: 3/30 vs 9/30 (relative risk=0.33, CI=0.10–1.11, p=0.106). In patients with acute ventilatory failure due to COAD who received NIPPV there was a significant rise in pH, a reduction in PaCO 2 and breathlessness, and reduced mortality. Introduction For patients with chronic obstructive airways disease (COAD) admitted to hospital in ventilatory failure, mortality ranges from 6% to 34%, the most reliable predictors of mortality being increased age and respiratory acidosis. Nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) has been used in patients with acute and chronic respiratory failure due to neuromuscular disease, chest wall deformities, COAD, cystic fibrosis, and obstructive sleep apnoea. In a small controlled study, Ahmed et al showed an improved outcome for patients with COAD treated with NIPPV compared with the respiratory stimulant doxapram. We have compared NIPPV with conventional treatment in patients admitted to hospital with ventilatory failure due to acute exacerbations of COAD. Patients and methods After ethical committee approval, we did a randomised controlled trial at King's College Hospital, Southampton General Hospital, and the London Chest Hospital (centres A, B, and C). Patients gave informed consent, or if they were too ill to cooperate, the consent of a relative was obtained. Patients admitted with an acute exacerbation of COAD and who were aged 80 or less, had an arterial PaO 2 <7.5 kPa, and an arterial PaCO 2 >6 kPa, were eligible for inclusion. Patients were excluded if they had severe disease not attributable to chronic respiratory disease, severe psychiatric disease, or if they used NIPPV at home. Patients were randomly allocated to receive either conventional treatment alone (control group), or conventional treatment plus nasal intermittent positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV group). Conventional treatment was that deemed appropriate by the clinicians responsible: oxygen at 24–28%; inhaled bronchodilators; and all, or a combination of, antibiotics, diuretics, respiratory stimulants, intravenous or oral corticosteroids, and bronchodilators. Patients were assessed and treated as necessary by a physiotherapist. Volume-cycled nasal positive pressure ventilation was started as soon as possible in the NIPPV group with either a Lifecare PLV 100 (Lifecare, Lafayette, Colorado, USA) in the assist-control mode, or a Brompton-PAC (PneuPAC Ltd, Luton, Beds, UK). Ventilation was through a silicone nasal mask (Respironics Ltd, Murrysville, Pennsylvania, USA; UK distributors: Medicaid, Pagham, Sussex) with O 2 at 1–2 L/min. The ventilated group were encouraged to use NIPPV for up to 16 h per day, including all night, with ventilation discontinued for eating, drinking, and moving around. As the patients improved, the duration of NIPPV was reduced, at first during the day, and then at night. Arterial blood gases were measured on admission, after 1 h on allocated treatment, on day 3, and day 7, while breathing room air (except at 1 h after admission when the patient was using either O 2 or NIPPV). Visual analogue scores (VAS) for shortness of breath, well-being, and quality of sleep were obtained from the patients; and for nursing care requirements from a senior nurse, daily until day 3, and then on day 7. FEV 1 , FVC, and peak expiratory flow rate were measured during the hospital stay. Patients were followed-up for at least 30 days. Ventilation was started and VAS measured by physiotherapists and medical researchers not otherwise involved in the management of the patients. Statistics Arterial blood gas measurements were compared in the two treatment groups with unpaired t-tests on differences, and between the three centres using analysis of variance. The VAS were averaged over the first 3 days of admission (any patient with data missing was omitted from the analysis) and these means compared by Mann-Whitney U tests. Proportions of patients surviving 30 days were compared with Fisher's exact test. Results Patients and treatments 60 patients were entered in the trial: approximately 10 in each group at each of the 3 centres. The 2 groups had similar ages, arterial blood gases, and spirometry. Patients at centre C were less acidotic (pH 7.369 [SD 0.043]), than the patients at A,(pH 7.340 [SD 0.065]), and B (pH 7.310 [SD 0.087]), p < 0.05. Mean PaO 2 and PaCO 2 were no different. Although patients at centre C had a somewhat lower PaCO 2 (mean 8.2 kPa [SD 1.24]), compared with centre A (8.7 kPa [SD 1.65]), and centre B (8.9 kPa [SD 1.67]). Of the 30 patients randomised to NIPPV, 4 did not receive it: 2 because they were confused and could not cooperate, 1 because he was unable to breathe through his nose, and 1 because he requested the withdrawal of all active treatment. 5 patients allocated conventional treatment were ventilated on the decision of the clinician in charge: 3 Figure 2 — Mean visual analogue scores.received NIPPV, and 2 were intubated (1 of whom died). All patients received controlled O 2 and nebulised bronchodilators, and about 75% of patients in both groups received corticosteroids and antibiotics. In the NIPPV group, 18 (60%) were given diuretics, 7 (23.3%) methylxanthines, and 4 (13.3%) doxapram. In the control group, 13 (43.3%) were given diuretics, 14 (46.7%) methylxanthines, and 13 (43.3%) doxapram. The 26 NIPPV patients received 7.63 (1–23) h of ventilation day, over 6.0 (2–9) days, taking 1.86 (0.25–4) h to settle on ventilation. Median stay in hospital was 9 (1–39) days for the control group and 9 (1–22) days for the NIPPV group. Arterial blood gases There was a mean rise in pH in the NIPPV group from 7.348 to 7.376, and a mean fall in pH in the control group from 7.331 to 7.313 after one hour of treatment. This was a mean difference in change of 0.046 (CI=0.06 to 0.02, p < 0.001)(fig 1). PaCO 2 in the NIPPV group fell from 8.6 kPa to 7.3 kPa; and in the control, from 8.6 kPa to 8.5 kPa. This was a mean difference in change of 1.2 kPa (CI=0.45 to 2.03, p < 0.01). There was no statistically significant difference in arterial blood gas measurements between the two groups during the rest of the admission, although the values of the control group tended to be more variable for both pH and PaCO 2 . Symptoms and nursing care Visual Analogue Scores over the first 3 days showed a significantly lower score for breathlessness for the NIPPV group, median 2.3 cm (range 0.1–5.5), than for the control group, median 4.5 cm (range 0.9–8.8), p < 0.025 (fig 2). The VAS of quality of sleep and general well-being, and for the amount of nursing care required, were not statistically significantly different. Survival Survival rates at 30 days were compared for an intention-to-treat and an efficacy population. In the NIPPV group, mortality within 30 days was less than with the conventional treatment group: 1/26 vs 9/30 (relative risk=0.13, CI=0.02 to 0.95, p=0.014). However, when analysed on an intention-to-treat basis with inclusion of the 4 patients who were not treated with NIPPV, 2 of whom died, the survival advantage was lower: 3/30 vs 9/30 (relative risk=0.33, CI=0.10 to 1.11, p=0.106). Short-term survival differed between the centres. In the first 30 days there were no deaths at centre C, 5 at B, and 7 at A (centre C vs centre A and B: Fisher's exact test p=0.005). One patient (centre B) continued with NIPPV at home and remains well. Patients who subsequently died were more acidotic on admission than patients who survived: pH 7.310 (SD 0.078) vs pH 7.347 (SD 0.067)(p=0.01); and more hypercapnic: PaCO 2 9.4 kPa (SD 1.45) vs 8.4 kPa (SD 1.51 (p < 0.05). Both groups were equally hypoxic, PaO 2 5.1 kPa (SD 0.93) and 5.3 kPa (SD 1.05). Discussion Blinding in this study was impossible, as ‘sham’ ventilation with NIPPV cannot be done. To minimise potential bias, the study investigators set up the ventilators but were not involved in the clinical management of patients. There was a rapid improvement in pH and PaCO 2 for the NIPPV group, and for the first 3 days they were less  short of breath than the control group. Although many patients were unable to complete a VAS on the day of admission, it is unlikely that the NIPPV group were less breathless as the groups were otherwise well matched. Sequential data were not available for the patients in the control group who were intubated and ventilated, nor for the NIPPV patients who could not be treated with nasal ventilation. Comparison of arterial blood gas tensions and VAS necessarily, therefore, excluded the most sick patients in the conventionally treated group. This may have masked further treatment benefits of NIPPV. Comparison of the data for the 26 patients who received NIPPV with that of the 30 treated conventionally demonstrated improved survival (1 death in 26 vs 9 in 30). Analysed on an intention-to-treat basis the mortality of the two groups (3/30 vs 9/30) was not significantly different. The mortality in patients randomised to receive conventional treatment alone, 9/30 (30%), was higher than in some previous reports. The criteria for inclusion in the study ensured that all patients had severe COAD with ventilatory failure, and so could be expected to have a substantial mortality. Centre C had no deaths during the study. The patients at this centre were less acidotic on admission, indicating that they were less critically ill at the start of the study. This may reflect differences in hospitals rather than patients since centre C has no casualty department and most patients are admitted direct to the ward. Jeffrey et al have suggested that doxapram should be given to all patients who are acidotic and hypercapnic, although Ahmed et al found a poor outcome in 5 patients treated with doxapram in a controlled study comparing doxapram with NIPPV. Patients in our study fared better with NIPPV, and in the conventional treatment group (43% of whom received doxapram) some patients had to switch to NIPPV. Although the application of NIPPV on a general ward has been described as a difficult and time-consuming procedure for nurses we did not find this to be the case. We conclude that this treatment should be offered to patients with an acute exacerbation of COAD who are acidotic and hypercapnic, compliant, with no nasal abnormality and in whom conventional therapy does not produce a prompt response. This study was supported by a grant from the British Lung Foundation. A table of patients' results is available from the corresponding author  Placebo-controlled trial of essential fatty acid supplementation in atopic dermatitis Treatment of atopic dermatitis with essential fatty acids remains controversial. A double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel-group study was done to investigate the response of patients with atopic dermatitis to essential fatty acid supplements. Patients with atopic dermatitis were randomised to receive evening primrose oil, evening primrose oil and fish oil, or placebo for 16 weeks. Disease activity was monitored by clinical severity scores recorded by the investigator, topical steroid requirement, and symptom scores recorded by subjects. Of 123 subjects recruited, 102 completed the treatment period. No improvement with active treatment was demonstrated. Our study, which avoided the methodological and analytical problems of previous studies, found no effect of essential fatty acid supplementation in atopic dermatitis. Introduction Evening primrose oil contains n6 series essential fatty acids (EFAs). Epogam, a product containing this oil, is widely prescribed in the UK for treatment of atopic dermatitis (AD). Clinical trials of evening primrose oil in AD have been inconclusive, and the use of fish oil, a source of n3 series EFAs, to treat AD has also yielded conflicting results. The possible mechanisms by which EFAs might improve inflammatory skin disease include modification of eicosanoid metabolism so as to favour synthesis of relatively non-inflammatory prostaglandins and leukotrienes. Since both n6 and n3 EFAs may possess this property, it is possible that giving both together will have a synergistic effect. Our study was designed to investigate whether evening primrose oil was effective in AD, and whether any additional response might be gained from the simultaneous administration of fish oil. Patients and methods Patients The study had a double-blind, randomised, parallel-group design with three treatment limbs. Subjects were examined at baseline, at 4, 8, and 16 weeks on treatment, and again after an 8 week washout. Outpatients attending the dermatology department for treatment of AD, of either sex and all ages, were recruited. The diagnostic criteria of Hanifin and Rajka were used. To avoid a disparity in age distribution between treatment groups, adults and children aged up to 12 years were randomised separately in blocks of three. Equal numbers of adults and children were recruited. All gave written informed consent. Treatments Patients were randomised to receive epogam, Efamol Marine, or matching placebo (Scotia Pharmaceuticals Guildford, UK). Epogam capsules contained 500 mg of evening primrose oil, largely made up of the n6 series EFAs linoleic (321 mg) and gamma-linolenic acid (40 mg). Efamol marine capsules contained 430 mg of evening primrose oil and 107 mg of marine fish oil. This fish oil included the n3 series EFAs eicosapentaenoic acid (17 mg) and docosahexaenoic acid (11 mg). Placebo capsules contained liquid paraffin for adults and olive oil for children. Six capsules of each treatment were given twice daily for 16 weeks. Capsules were cut open, if necessary, to administer the contents to children. Compliance was monitored by questioning patients and counting remaining capsules at each outpatient visit. Patients taking less than 70% of their capsules (50% for children) were defined as non-compliers. Patients were allowed to use topical steroids and emollients as required. They were advised to use topical steroids only on severely affected areas of skin, in accordance with our usual practice. Apart from changes in the quantity applied, no changes in topical steroids were allowed during the trial or the preceding 4 weeks. Treatment with sedative antihistamines was continued throughout the study if they were in use on entry. Assessments of disease activity The following parameters were used to monitor disease severity. Clinical severity scores — The body was divided into 10 zones: face, neck, abdomen, back, elbows, antecubital fossae, dorsa of hands, palms and wrists, popliteal fossae, and feet. Each zone was scored on a scale from 0 (absent) to 3 (severe) for: erythema, excoriation, dryness, cracking, and lichenification. Total scores from each zone were added to give a maximum of 150. We have termed this system the ‘Leicester score’. Because we had an interest in comparing methodologies, a second, simpler scoring system for clinical severity, as described by Costa et al, was also used. In this system, only the most severely affected site was assessed. Erythema, oedema, vesiculation, crusting, excoriation scaling, lichenification, pigmentation, pruritus, and sleep disturbance were each graded on a 7 point scale. This score is only briefly reported. Percentage of skin affected — This was assessed by the ‘rule of nines’, as for burns injuries. Topical steroid requirement — To allow monitoring, topical steroids were prescribed by the investigator. Usage was assessed by weighing returned tubes of medication. Some patients who used potent corticosteroids also used a mild compound for the face, in which case only the potent steroid was monitored. Patient diaries — Every patient was given a diary containing a page of 10 cm visual analogue scales for baseline and each of the next 24 weeks. Scales were provided for itch, dryness, scaling, redness, and overall impression. All scales were labelled ‘none’ at the left-hand end and ‘worst ever’at the right. Scores were added to give a maximum of 50 cm. Statistical methods We decided before starting the study that the primary response criterion would be mean change from baseline in Leicester score (the most comprehensive single assessment) at 16 weeks. The study was designed to have 80% power to detect a treatment response of 20% with a standard deviation (derived from existing data) of 30%, at significance level 0.05. We estimated that 37 subjects would be required in each treatment limb. For each active treatment, mean changes in Leicester score between baseline and 16 weeks were compared with the placebo group by 2-tailed t tests. Results were corroborated by non-parametric tests. In addition, several secondary analyses were done. The individual components of the Leicester score, Costa scores and components, percentage of skin affected, and diary scores and components were analysed separately with t tests. As an overall test of response, improvements from baseline in Leicester scores, Costa scores, and percentage of skin affected, at all visits during treatment, were compared by repeated measures analysis of variance. We used  BMDP statistical software 5V (BMDP Statistical Software Inc, Los Angeles, USA) for these analyses with the unstructured covariance matrix option. We also did comparisons between the placebo group and the two actively treated groups combined, and separate analyses for adults and children (aged 12 or under). To investigate the effect of withdrawals, we repeated t tests at the end of treatment using the last available assessment before withdrawal of treatment. Results 133 patients were enrolled. The three treatment groups were well matched at baseline for age, sex, and disease severity (table I). At 4 weeks, 9 subjects had defaulted or been withdrawn, and this number increased to 14 by 8 weeks, 21 by 16 weeks, and 27 after the washout (table II). 4 subjects failed to attend for assessment at 4 weeks although they remained in the study. Data from the patients who withdrew were included in the analysis up to the point of withdrawal. Decisions to withdraw were made before unblinding. There were no apparent differences at baseline between the patients who withdrew and those remaining in the study. With the exception of patients withdrawn due to deterioration, there were no apparent differences in response to treatment. At 16 weeks, the mean (SE; number of patients) improvements in Leicester scores were 8.48 (2.85; 33) for patients on epogam, 2.54 (2.89; 35) for patients on efamol marine, and 7.15 (2.88; 34) for those on placebo. On neither active regimen was mean improvement significantly different from placebo at 16 weeks (p=0.74 for epogam, p=0.26 for efamol marine; fig 1). Mean changes at 16 weeks in individual components of the Leicester score relative to placebo are shown in fig 2. The only significant differences were in favour of placebo over efamol marine for responses of erythema (p=0.04) and cracking (p=0.05). Overall, analysis of variance for improvements in total score on each treatment at all visits showed no significant treatment effect (p=0.17, n=114, 2 degrees of freedom). Identical analyses of Costa scores showed no significant differences, with the exception of improvement in oedema at 16 weeks in favour of epogam over placebo (p=0.04). The mean percentage of skin surface affected at 16 weeks fell 3.26% (4.49%; 33) on epogam and 0.11% (4.56%; 35) on efamol marine, and rose by 3.62% (3.52%; 34) on placebo. No significant difference was found between either treatment and placebo. Complete data on topical steroid requirement were available from 26 patients on epogam, 25 on efamol marine, and 30 on placebo. Of these patients, 2 did not use any steroid, 9 were applying formulations classified in the British National Formulary as ‘mild’, 17 were using ‘moderately potent’ compounds, 49 were using ‘potent’compounds, and 4 were applying ‘very potent’topical steroids. There was a reduction in steroid requirement in all three patient groups, with the largest reduction in the placebo group (fig 3). Diaries were returned by 30 patients on epogam, 35 on efamol marine, and 32 on placebo. The greatest mean overall reduction in visual analogue scales was seen in the placebo group (fig 4); however, there were no significant differences from placebo at 16 weeks in total score or in any component. In particular, there was no significant difference in pruritus score. When analyses were repeated with both active treatment groups combined, there was no significant difference from placebo in the mean improvement of any parameter (mean improvement in Leicester score at 16 weeks was 5.43 [2.05; 68]on treatment and 7.2 [2.88; 34]on placebo [p=0.63]). Analysis of variance for improvements in total Leicester score at all visits again demonstrated no significant treatment effect (p=0.98, n=114, 1 degree of freedom). Separate analyses for adults and children gave results similar to the overall analysis. Analysis with the last available assessment did not indicate any bias resulting from withdrawals. Discussion Our study has demonstrated no response of AD to EFA supplementation, nor any evidence of an additional effect  when n3 series EFAs were used in combination with EFAs of the n6 series. Since both treatments consisted predominantly of evening primrose oil, we felt it reasonable to perform an analysis with the two active treatment groups combined. This analysis would be expected to provide the best chance of demonstrating a treatment effect, but no such response was found. 21 (17%) patients were withdrawn during treatment, presenting a potential source of bias. A perceived lack of response may have been a factor in the withdrawal of these patients, but deterioration of eczema was the principal reason for withdrawal in only 8 patients, 7 of whom were assessed at least once on treatment. Loss of data was therefore small, and analyses with the last available assessment for each subject did not indicate that any bias had been introduced. The numbers withdrawn were similar in each treatment group. It is, unlikely, therefore, that withdrawals influenced the outcome of the trial. Our results are in agreement with those of Bamford et al from the largest study yet performed on evening primrose oil in AD. These researchers recruited 154 adults and children into a placebo-controlled crossover trial and found no response to treatment. The results have been called into question because plasma lipid assays raised the possibility that placebo and active treatments had been intermixed, but Bamford et al have no reason to believe that this occurred (personal communication). A similar lack of response was seen in a study of 24 subjects by Rilliet et al, in which blackcurrant seed oil was used as a source of gamma-linolenic acid. The differences between our results and those of some published studies may be partly explained by variations in design and analysis. In a crossover study of evening primrose oil and placebo in 32 adults and children with atopic eczema, each treatment was given for just 3 weeks. A significant improvement was found with active treatment but not with placebo. A more meaningful analysis — µcomparison of the mean improvement on each treatment — µcan be done from the data provided, and this analysis shows that there was no significant difference between active treatment and placebo (t test). Wright and Burton performed a crossover study of evening primrose oil and placebo in 99 adults and children with atopic eczema. They reported a highly significant, dose-related response with active treatment, which reached a 43% overall improvement in patients receiving the dose used in our study. However, there are slight differences in flavour, appearance, and, possibly, laxative action between active treatment and placebo, which may have unblinded the crossover format. Furthermore, baseline comparability of treatment groups was not established. As already pointed out, it is possible that the apparent difference in response between the two groups was due to greater severity at baseline in subjects receiving active treatment. This group would then be likely to show greater spontaneous improvement. A response to evening primrose oil was also reported by Schalin-Karrila et al in a parallel-group study of 12 weeks duration with 25 adult subjects. They reported large and significant reductions (30–50%) in surface area affected and severity of signs and symptoms of atopic eczema. The group on active treatment used 60% less topical steroid. However, there are clear baseline differences in disease severity between groups and the analysis did not properly address differences in response between treatments. A parallel-group study with 24 children given half the dose of evening primrose oil that we used for 4 weeks, demonstrated a significant difference between active and placebo groups, a finding that we cannot explain. Three of the studies described above and five others have been the subject of a meta-analysis on the use of evening primrose oil in AD, which showed a dose-related response that increased progressively with treatment duration. A particularly consistent response was claimed for pruritus. It is important to establish baseline comparability of treatment groups in terms of disease severity in such an analysis but this issue was not addressed. We believe that the results of a meta-analysis containing unpublished trials and inadequate baseline data must be regarded with caution. Our study is the first to examine a combination of n6 series and n3 EFA supplements in AD. However, n3 series EFAs have been investigated in two smaller placebo-controlled, parallel-group trials. In the first trial, subjects' grading of symptom severity showed a significant response, although the investigators' assessments did not. The second trial showed no significant response. In conclusion, we believe that our study avoided the methodological and analytical problems of previous reports, which have given rise to a great deal of controversy over the efficacy of EFA supplementation in AD. No therapeutic effect was demonstrated."

Oh she usually goes after bingo. They'll probably be in all night and she's just walked up from the bingo and  toddle in there. No I didn't see anybody looking like that so  I don't know. I wouldn't think they'd be in the lounge. They could be but I wouldn't have thought so. Thursday night anyway I wouldn't, does she go to the Empire   Well I don't really know do I? Empire. Do they have it Wednesday night  bingo? Thursday night don't they, bingo? Is it Thursday night? No oh I don't know . Thursday night not at the Empire. Wednesday night the Empire, Friday night .

Yeah they live up  yeah. So it's not that far for The Loco really. No just a  short walk. It's sort of their local type of thing. anyway but  Well Ann is going  to retire. I suppose you're gonna have a bottle and a fag. Mind you, the smell of you I think you've had sufficient bottles but well   Told you not to drink much. I did n't. Ooh.

I'd better have a bottle then. I drunk them as well. Oh you drunk them as well? Oh. ah  oh  now what am I gonna do? Without. I'm without. Crafty devil. Put them round the corner where  where I didn't know where they were. Falling over now. No I'm not. Oh that young couple next door   ah! Yeah? They been at it, have they been at it again? Oh I wish you'd have been at home, I'd have gone round there. What've they been up to now then? Oh god! She's been screaming. He's been  reckon she must have locked herself up in the dark. And the only place with a lock on is the bathroom and I reckon they'll blooming knock the blooming door down by the sound of it. Gawd. She was screaming, he was swearing. Running up and down the stairs. What time was this? Quarter to ten till about half past ten. Or half an hour till half past ten  Well that wouldn't please them next door would it? No. Coo. And and really I mean you can't  I'm I'm s I'm saying that you, you can't interfere but  by god I'd long for someone to come in and interfere. I really would have done. And er er I  I could never understand why people  that obviously could hear what went on  and pretended they never. I know you don't wanna get involved Mm. and this that and the other  but people must have heard what went on and and  you know the next morning they'd see a black eye and just carry out a normal conversation as though  and you know they hadn't heard it all and Yeah. ooh have you had a fall or something? Then you know I mean they must have  what was going on oh aye they just completely  ignore it. Mm. I'd be walking round  if I could get around. Mm. It were just you know oh it's a nice morning when I'm hanging the washing out as though everything was wonderful you know   Yeah. normal. Yes. Ooh I thought he was going to, ooh I felt  made me go cold and I  I thought if, if I hadn't been here on my own I'd have been very tempted to go round and  and say is there anything I can do. Or I'd have called the police I think. I weren't sure what I'd have done but Bad as that? Oh . He was a calling her effing this, swearing oh it was dreadful. She was screaming and you could hear her crying. Then you hear, she pounded up the bloody stairs and he was after her  and I reckon  well the only room with a lock  As you say is the bathroom. is the bathroom, so she must have been in there cos he's hammering on the door and bashing it and kicking it. Bloody hell of a row. Or whether she opened it or whether she was in the front bedroom with something behind the door I dunno but  That's his and she run back down the stairs and the front door was opening and banging and shutting, whether she run outside or what  I don't know what happened, the dog was bloody barking. Oh lord. Well it's a wonder Ann and Rita haven't done something about it. Well I say it's er  amazing they've not said, said something   And they had company as well there's a car there, blue car. Who Ann and Rita or? Or Ann and Rita. I don't know. Sally innit? I don't know who it was. It was Sally if it was a blue e , blue cavalier. T D O something something something. Sally can't drive so it must be some Can't she? Her latest beau I should think, I don't know. Maybe. Maybe maybe. But it was  I mean I could hear it over the telly. I know I don't have the telly on full blast but  I could hear it Mm. above the telly. When I first heard the first noise I thought what the bloody hell's that and I turned the sound down. Yeah. Thought bloody hell, put it back up but you could, it was really distressing me cos You knew what was possibly going on. Yeah. Mm. A woman and that don't s I mean  if you're having just an argument  it's raised voices but a woman doesn't scream and  cry like that unless  Unless there's something really something awful going on. Mm. I mean Ann and Rita reckon they're not married or anything but why the hell does she stay with him then? She's not got a bloody Well there you go I mean  she's got no children. They're only young. It's her house. Isn't his. He couldn't, she bought it without, with her father and Mm. and he come and lived with her in it. Bloody hell. I know I mean I stayed with him but I had three kids. Gonna say you're you're  I had three kids, where could I go with them? Mm. Mm. If I'd have been on me own I mean that's all I was waiting for, mine to grow up so I could clear off. Yeah. If I'd have been on me own I wouldn't have stopped bloody long. I mean even if she walks out he doesn't, no court in the land would give him the house if it's hers. evicted and then she could come back again. Mm. Well if she went to the police they'd chuck him out. He has no legal rights to the property. It's in her name, she's, her father's helping her  paid the deposit or something and she clears the mortgage  she has no right, he has no right to it all if she went to the police. They'd just turf him out wouldn't they? Mm. Well why stay in a relationship like that? Don't understand it. Certainly a bit rough, a bit hard. Went quiet about half past ten so whether he buggered off out or what I don't know. Mm maybe. Certainly the front door was opening and banging and shutting. Say I'm surprised Ann and Rita haven't sort of didn't Well banging on the wall probably with all the other banging and   May maybe. Maybe. They  part of the banging. So much bloody banging going on. Probably part of the banging  Ann and Rita. And the people on this side  you don't know how they were reacting as well. Say, they was a quite young couple. We don't hear them that much do we? Mornings is the  time I hear them most. Cos they go out to work at half past eight and you hear them between half past seven and half past eight"

When rainfall goes up does temperature up and vice versa? Dunno just gotta describe them. Well that's what you have to say, is there any correlation between What does correlation mean? They all correlate. Yeah. It's connection isn't it Kev? Mm. Yeah  and you've gotta see That's level six, you should be doing that. What's level six?

Yet the January, February, March the temperature is  high  which is temperature  I can't tell by looking at that, which one's temperature and which one's rainfall. That's temperature and that's rainfall. Yeah but which line refers to which, how can I tell? You need to put the dotted line there  and square there  No you can look like that. How? Rain, ten millimetres of rain equals one millimetre  ten of rain equals one millimetre and this one  one degrees  celsius  equals Well I'm sorry  I don't think that is very clever  for you! there and  one degrees, how can temperature What? one degree celsius equals one millimetre Yes. So it's twenty five degrees celsius in January? No. Well I thought it wouldn't be a bad idea to put some sort of  clue on it. We've got twelve people coming, right? Er yep  what's that gotta do with anything? Well cos I'm gonna have  pairs  I think here  And one you! Oh  singles then? It's more  No  fun in pairs isn't it cos the people can have the scraggle and talk to each other. You'll have to have pairs and put one three. Chips. Well that's not fair then. Put Michael with Oh yeah if you put Michael with two other people, it's completely fair. But then your implying something aren't you. Why don't you say if you're a child  you can go in a group of three, if your adults you'll have to be in a group of two, so the children can attach themselves to any group. Right. Right. You've got eleven people you need four groups  you don't have four groups it's not worth doing is it? Gotta share it all out perfect even  why don't you say, stick it on the wall, give them each a piece of paper and they've gotta do it  I've got an idea, you can compile a quiz Fine I'm   and then you could have a treasure hunt for the children you know Couldn't I. Most amusing  Are you gonna sort of read out the question and they each gonna scribble down their answer. Nope. What you gonna do? No, just leave  Have a chart. your father! What? Have a chart. Heart. You'll let people  overlook each other then  sort of overlooking  Cheating you mean! Yes I mean that's the first thing you have to say, you have to think  when you look at   you keep, anybody who does the whispering  Is Mum. is giving their answers away  in fact, what we did, the team of four, is they all had a little pad of paper, if you spotted something you knew, you went  and you wrote it down  because people we there. You did it in silence. Yeah  tried to do  and they obviously can't. Why aren't you gonna  for faces. Well this th this is the the faces and I thought I'd do the maps and the rest were questions I don't know whether y should do some questions. Well you'll have to think of some. Yeah  I'll see how I go any  You got the maps of South America? Yeah. I've got one at work  a blank, you should of asked me for it. What all split up, yeah? Yeah. Oh. I could get it tomorrow morning  in my  Yeah could you? Blanked out without the er the countries names  Yes  in it? Oh yeah. I've got all the countries blanks  might not oh I might not even have the countries on but if you had blanks you could put countries in, that'll be easier than   No that'll be harder. No  what the boundaries? Yes  because if you've got the scale  you just drop, trace it all off  where as you got the you've the you gotta sort out work out  i th the scale of everything, haven't you? No you just draw the lines. Yeah but how do you ge  What scale? How you going to know exactly where the boundaries go or i in between some land-lock countries  that you got it in the right position  How many land-lock countries are there in South America? Well enough anyway, I mean I thought you were giving me something easier to do not   Well I think  why would you do it tonight if I didn't have it? Yes  Say I didn't have it tomorrow you'd  well  do it tonight? probably ni or tomorrow I was gonna do that. I seem to think you should take the easy bit, cos that's gonna be miles too hard! No I like to balance it, I ju there's some balance there, there's some easy ones and some hard ones. I'll tell you what's best for Michael. I don't feel that's very good  because you're just gonna get children totally pull out of it unless they're  No. really really good. Children are allowed to go   You find that if if if i in a team, if there's teams  i you find that in a singles, but if there's a team e if everybody feels the everybody feels they can contribute something to it  when you've got  You can have those   allowed to be the idea of that, you don't wanna make it  Yeah I know  too easy   No there are no husbands allowed to be with any wife  and children can attach themselves to which group they want. So work out the groups, you work out the groups. Well there's going to be  apart from your father there's going to be seven adults. Listen, a man with a woman  but not wi not  by marriage  cos say like Andy with Nanna  Well I could go with two children, I expect. Well write down the names let's have a go at, let's work out, let's work out the teams  Cos I'm the cleverest person, I can go with two teenies! lo , write down the names. Modest! No and I could be the only adult with two children cos I'm so clever. Write down the names and th work out some balanced teams then for me please. Ah, give me a pen! I'll write it out with her. Can I, thank you. Then people don't argue then  do they, if they say look that's the team then th people are h happy. There's Nanna and Margarite, if I find him another  Yes, they don't know  cos they're both Daily Mail readers and I'm cutting the majority of these out. And   and maybe an adult   Don't put  No four groups, is all you'll get out of twelve people. don't put Michelle and Andy together. I'm not? Don't put  Papa a Nanna and er Adrian And Kevin with Andrew  yeah  no not Kev and Andrew because erm Mooty  Yeah. Mooty and Michelle  Hang on  i  What other adult is there? There's only me  Is Karen quite good? One, two Yes Karen is  three, four  will be as sharp as iron  Can I be with Papa then? It'll have to be me with Papa. Okay  . That's the eight adults. Who're you putting Karen with? Be careful cos Karen is the  Andy. Andy. No that's far tha well  think again isn't that   Nanna and  Michelle and Mooty, why you think that's too clever? Andy an Andy and Karen will  streak through. What better than Michelle and Mooty? I bet you. She  generations though. I bet I'll give you a bet  Karen will win it. What about Papa? Who you gonna put Karen  Because  with? she thinks , she reads papers. Well I put Karen with Papa and me with Andy then. It's just her her what? Put me with Andy then, and Karen with Papa. No that'll be too easy cos you and Andy'll streak through that. Mm. It should be  No it'll have to be Karen and Andy cos  Mooty and Andy! Yeah? Cos the others are different generations, they're at a disadvantage cos they're the same generation  Andy  Yeah. and Karen. Yeah so  Karen doesn't read The Mail  and nor does Andrew. You'd be surprised, Karen's well read, newspaper wise she's not  Oh of course  or something. Right you got that'll do, I think  unless your father wants to   No. Now three of those groups can have a child  should be with Nanna and Adrian. No. Why not? You mean you with Nanna and Adrian  yeah I think you should  Okay. be with them  put Michael with Andrew and Karen  tha  Which one are you gonna have? Who can have Lisa, me and Papa or Michael an Mi Michelle and Mooty? See I'm  in so me th th they'll all be able to contribute. Michelle and Mooty. That's right  Cross Michael out then? Where's does Lisa go? Cross Michael out. Why? Just cross him out. Why? You've gotta think of the generations  they would be more likely to lead a pop star  or sort of person that would know all those  those sort of things, put Michael with Michelle and Mooty    and Lisa with Papa and Mum  Be careful who you put Mooty with  cos Mooty  I've put her with Michelle! Oh that's alright, that's fine, yes. and  Lisa with Papa and  you. So that left Andrew and Karen on their own? Yes  that's fair  Do you think that's fair? Sorry? Andrew and Karen, you think  Yeah. they're so clever that they're  Yeah. going to beat anybody else? They will win. Yeah, so listen to this  Nanna, Adrian and me  Go to Dad. okay I'll read it out, Nanna, Adrian and me, Dad? make up on. Okay? Sorry? Nanna, Adrian and me  Papa, Mum and Lisa  Andrew and Karen  He's not listening  he's not listening  I am yes  Michelle , Mooty and Michael. That's alright. Is it after lunch, I presume? Yes. I knew Michelle and Mooty would need somebody else cos  you know Michelle  Mooty would have a .

But, and now, and now we're gonna go to the things what  parents have  wrong, like their, like, they spoil their child and everything at home. Or, here's a letter that was sent to me by  Teresa   from Birmingham. Dear Anthony, our five year old son, our five year old daughter is a very bad loser. When we play games with her sh , and she doesn't win she either gets upset  and  cries or gets angry. We've trying showing her that  we don't mind when we lose but it doesn't seem to work  work. Any ideas ? Well yeah, for,we ,what I will say to you is, try giving her a surprise, when you  when you or the father lose again  you should react by getting upset or angry. This is serious suggestions, often children can learn  from seeing themselves as others see them. When you get angry about losing your husband can,yo ha , losing your husband can ask for his wife, from your daughter about how to deal with it? Do this lightly so you can  so she can see  you're  you are acting and doesn't get frightened. Yet, seriously enough so  she hasn't had  she hasn't, so she has an opportunity to put herself  in your shoe. If you feel this  too much to do for you, stick to what you are, are already doing. Don't pay close attention to the detail. What happens, when you do show her you mind losing what do you next, what do you do next? And how can you tell her  you don't want to play any more games or, if you analyse her reactions carefully  you'll see how some encourage  encouraging, that changes your looking, for you, for you're likely to find she begins to, to modify her behaviour . That was from Teresa  from Birmingham. Now I wanna go onto a Dear Anne one, which is very interesting. Hold on. Right. Dear Anne, can I give him up? I'm divorced forty ye , I'm a divorced forty year old woman with two grown up children  and I am in a terrible situation. The thing is that  my  infa , infatuated with my  bo with my daughter's boyfriend who is also my son's best friend. It started when I, when I came home drunk after his, like,. He was  started flirting with me saying how older women turn  on. I was flattered. And one thing led to another. Af , I thought that first time would be the last, but since this, Steve's been dropping in during the day  while my son and daughter are at work. I know this sorried affair is wrong, that I end up breaking my daughter's heart, or upsetting my son, son's ha , but  I don't think I can give up Steve? Am I feeling desperate? Can you help ? Well  one thing is fucking kick him out! In our fucking house! Kick him out your house! Or you move and leave your kids at home really, that's what I'd do. And there's another one. Am I prepared too old? Perhaps I'm too hold, old. I am a twenty seven year old woman who can't swim. I've never enjoyed a beach holidays because  I'm too scared to go in the water. Now my moth , now  my friends at the mother, mother and baby group have joined the water babies class at the local pool, but I feel so nervous I can't go. How can someone my age learn to swim. Summer is coming this year and I really want to learn . Well, what you do is you go to your nearest leisure centre and  ask if you could do the  training classes for the adults who can't sa , who can't swim yet. And then, by about four months performance you should be able to do about ten metres whatever, you can do. Okay? Okay? Bye. Yeah, and here's a little funny picture out of the newspaper. There's a woman in the be and there's a man underneath the bed and it's got  underneath it,Frank, can't you forget you are a mechanic for once? Don't you get it? Man under the bed, and a woman up the bed. Ah ah! God! That is disgusting! And there's  erm  mm  oh erm  there's  there's erm  a boy  with a big umbrella  who's got, and it's raining and he's got,I didn't know April showers were like this .

FIC FIC-AC2-007 4.75 "Mark had a very full fortnight ahead, for which he was grateful. It gave him little time to think of his own problems. First, there was a meeting in Whitehall of the Economic Planning Council, followed by the conference at Trinity College Dublin, at which he had been invited to speak on the subject of European investment. He had accepted the invitation gladly, knowing full well that it would be his last opportunity to speak in public as a European executive of United Motors. He hoped to make it a fitting swan-song. At the Economic Planning Council he had expected to see Clem Bunker, but he was absent, holding his own meeting with the vehicle plant conveners in an attempt to determine the truth about the sacking incident and to resolve the dispute. What he didn't know, couldn't know, was that nothing he could now do would make any difference. There had been trouble on Merseyside just once too often, and muddleheaded militants who believed that revolution was spawned in deprivation and poverty would be able to hold a little holiday in their hearts, secure in the knowledge that several more thousand British workers had been gulled into inflicting poverty and deprivation upon themselves. Opening the meeting of the Economic Planning Council, the Chairman, Lord Hampshire, surprised members by announcing that the Prime Minister intended to sit in on the transport debate, which was the subject of a White Paper about to be discussed on the floor of the House. As this was the first item on the agenda, the Prime Minister made her  appearance at ten thirty-three, immediately after the Chairman had made his announcement. After the usual preliminaries and courtesies from the Chair, the Minister of Transport outlined the Government's proposals before the Chairman threw the subject open for discussion. But, before doing so, he asked the Prime Minister if she wished to say a few words. The ‘Iron Lady’ as she was called, smiled the steely smile which was so familiar on the television screen and in the press. ‘I am here to listen and learn, my Lord Chairman,’ she said in her clear and authoritative voice. ‘But I am particularly interested to know if the United Kingdom incurs a significant transportation cost penalty on its exports to Europe which puts this country at a commercial and economic disadvantage to the rest of the Community. I am also keen to know,’ she continued, ‘if any such cost penalties operate to our disadvantage when European investment decisions are made, in particular those international mobile investment decisions which are made by the multinationals. I understand that Mr Sanders has accepted an invitation to address the European Commission on the subject in Dublin, and I look forward to hearing his observations.’ Lord Hampshire had folded a piece of paper which was being passed around the table. It arrived in front of Mark with his name on it. He unfolded the paper. ‘Don't put your pads on, just yet,’ it said. ‘Want you to come in lower down the batting order.’ It was signed ‘H’. The Chairman of the National Docks' Authority opened the batting by reviewing plans to meet the ever-growing volume of docks' traffic, particularly the substantial growth in roll-on, roll-off between Britain and the continent. The Chief Highways Planner followed, outlining the Government's intentions to provide further motorway links between industrial centres and the ports. He also described the various channel tunnel options currently being studied by the Ministry. The rail, airways and waterways chiefs then outlined their plans, before the Chairman threw the subject open to the Council members. Several members then questioned the planning assumption  of the Chief Planning Officers, making pertinent observations based on their own particular knowledge and experience. Mark Sanders was called by the Chairman after an hour's discussion. ‘Now let's have a multi-national view point,’ he said cheerfully. ‘Particularly on the points raised by the Prime Minister. Mark would you like to face the next ball?’ Mark smiled and nodded. ‘Before we begin, Mr Sanders,’ the Prime Minister said, warmly, ‘will you tell me which hat you will be wearing today? Your European hat, or the British one?’ she smiled a thin smile. The Chairman smiled. Mark smiled. Everyone smiled. ‘Whichever one you wish me to wear, Prime Minister,’ he replied. ‘Can we see you in both?’ she rejoined. ‘Then we can judge which one we prefer.’ ‘I'm afraid I don't look particularly good in either,’ Mark said, ‘but, putting on my British hat first: yes, Prime Minister, the United Kingdom is at a considerable disadvantage when multi-nationals consider investment locations in Europe. The transport cost penalty, to which you referred, varies of course with the nature of the product being manufactured, and ranges from two per cent to twenty per cent in the motor industry.’ ‘So why is it called a penalty?’ the Prime Minister asked. ‘That's right, isn't it? Transport cost penalty?’ she added with a pained expression. ‘Yes, Prime Minister.’ ‘But why? Surely the expression suggests that we are being penalised into paying more than our EEC partners. How can this be? We ship exports to Europe and it costs X pounds. Our partners in the EEC ship their exports to us, and again it costs the same X pounds. So where does the penalty come in? ‘It comes in,’ said Mark, ‘when you consider exports as a proportion of total output. A European plant will probably sell around four fifths of its total output on the European mainland, principally within the so-called Golden Triangle countries of West Germany, France, Belgium and Holland at the centre of the market. The remaining one fifth of output will be exported to the long-distance peripheral markets of  the United Kingdom and Italy, etcetera, so when you export from a UK manufacturing base you ship four fifths of the output over relatively longer distances, hence the UK transport cost penalty.’ The Prime Minister was nodding agreement long before Mark had finished. ‘Yes, I see. But doesn't that mean that most of the European investment will always tend to go to the centrally placed Golden Triangle countries who occupy this privileged position rather than to the United Kingdom and other peripheral countries who are in less favoured areas? ‘Yes, it does mean just that,’ Mark said. ‘But such a situation simply strengthens the strong, and weakens the weak, doesn't it?’ the Prime Minister said, eyebrows raised. ‘How does a large industrial country, such as the UK rebuild and expand its industrial base, and correct a worsening balance of trade in manufactured products, if investment location decisions by the multi-nationals go against it on such grounds?, ‘I am afraid, Prime Minister, the answer is that we have to be more efficient than our European competitors.’ Mark answered in a matter of fact voice. Transport costs do impose a penalty. We've got to live with it. And beat it. We've got to absorb these costs by being super-efficient.’ Again the Prime Minister was nodding her agreement. ‘But,’ Mark continued, transport costs are only one of the factors which have placed British industry at a disadvantage in recent years.’ ‘And what are the others, Mr Sanders?’ ‘If you'll forgive me saying so, Prime Minister,’ Mark replied cautiously, ‘successive British Governments and the trade unions haven't exactly helped.’ The steely smile was glimpsed briefly. ‘I think that's something you are really going to have to explain, Mr Sanders,’ she said quizzically in a pained expression. ‘If you will allow me to say so, Prime Minister,’ he continued, ‘Britain has consistently lost out because….’ He had been speaking for some five minutes or more with force and conviction, carried away by the things which concerned him greatly. Now, suddenly, he had an uneasy feeling that he had allowed himself to go a little‘over the top’. At these meetings viewpoints were expressed in a suitably detached manner. ‘I'm afraid I've gone on a bit, My Lord Chairman,’ he said apologetically. ‘I think I've said enough. Probably too much.’ ‘Not at all,’ put in the Prime Minister, reassuringly. ‘It's only when you let your hair down that others can see the real person hiding under the hat. I personally have found your candour very refreshing. It's such a change to hear someone say what he really believes….’ and a warm smile blazed. ‘Almost never happens in politics.’ The laughter was general. ‘Now Mr Sanders,’ she continued, ‘can we ask you to wear your European hat? Spain and Austria are peripheral countries aren't they? So why is it that your company, and certain other major multi-nationals, plan to invest heavily in those countries?, She cocked her head to one side after she had posed the question. ‘Spain erects huge barriers which make it difficult, if not impossible, for vehicle and component imports to enter that country,’ Mark said. ‘So if my company wishes to supply the domestic market of this large and expanding population, it has no alternative but to manufacture from within the country itself. Spanish rules and regulations then determine what percentage of total output will be exported and what the local component content will be. ‘Similarly, the Austrian Government has made it clear that unless multi-nationals manufacture vehicles or components within the country to correct its trade deficit, then it will be obliged to take appropriate steps to close its domestic markets to their products.’ The Prime Minister clasped her hands together. ‘How very interesting. And pray do tell me which countries will have to accept the exports of motor vehicles or  components from Spain, say, as a result of anything which might be agreed between United Motors and the Spanish Government?’ As Mark began to reply, she said the first name with him, nodding her head the while. ‘Great Britain…of course, of course . And is that free and fair European trade, Mr Sanders?’ She asked with more than a hint of sarcasm in her voice. ‘My company doesn't make Government rules and regulations, Prime Minister,’ he replied. ‘We comply with them or we are excluded from these markets.’ ‘Quite so. But would you accept that such discriminatory rules and regulations operate to this country's clear disadvantage?’ ‘Of course,’ Mark agreed. ‘Without question.’ The first lady nodded and went on nodding for several seconds in quiet contemplation before putting two further questions to him concerning European regional incentives, Government grants and subsidies and their cost distorting influence on investment location decisions. Mark answered in the traditional matter-of-fact manner, parading all the relevant factors and letting the facts speak for themselves. The Prime Minister departed a short time later with the Ministers of Transport and Energy escorted by Lord Hampshire. In all, she had spent ninety minutes at the meeting. During the lunch break, the Chairman took Mark to one side. ‘Before she left, the PM told me how pleased she was that you were so frank. And she's delighted that you have accepted the invitation to address the European Commission on the subject in Dublin. She's looking for ways and means of redressing Britain's excessive contribution to the European budget which, as you know, is the highest in the community. She believes that with your practical experience at the sharp end in Europe you will be able to provide much needed ammunition to support her appeal which is to be submitted to the Commission and the Council of Ministers. The next day, Mark told Millie, his secretary, that the Corporation's plans for reorganisation would involve the elimination of regional management. She had been expecting the news, because of her privileged position in the ‘Petticoat Mafia’ but it none-the-less visibly upset her. She had what was generally regarded by other top secretaries as the most interesting job in European component operations, and took a great personal interest in her work. As a long-service employee she knew from first-hand experience the contribution Mark had made to the expansion of the Corporation over the years. ‘It isn't fair!’ she exclaimed angrily. ‘Fair or not,’ Mark said, trying to speak lightly, ‘it's what's going to happen. The parting of the ways, I'm afraid, after all these years. But don't worry. It has already been agreed that you'll be offered another position within the Corporation at the same salary.’ The classically attractive forty-year-old secretary smiled uncertainly. Her eyes brimmed. ‘I'm not really concerned about myself. It's so heartless and unfair after all you've done.’ ‘That, as the Americans say,’ Mark told her wryly, ‘is how the cookie crumbles. I suppose I'm going to miss the old firm after all these years. And I'm going to miss you too,’ he added with a smile. ‘We've worked together for a very long time.’ She blinked and touched the corners of her eyes. ‘Certainly have.’ ‘I've really enjoyed working with you, Millie. Thank you,’ Mark said with sincerity. ‘And I've enjoyed working with you too. I really have,’ she blurted, and hurried from the room into her own adjacent office. And there, privately, she cried. It was a demoralised Don Peters who drove away from The London Hilton and the all-American farewell party that had been laid on for him by Clancy McGillicuddy. In response to the many toasts from his American colleagues he had made a light-hearted speech at dinner, which belied his deep disappointment at being sent back to  the States on a Public Relations assignment. Sure, the newly created position with its impressive job title sounded important, but that was only to impress the media and the public. It impressed no-one at corporate management level. Don Peters had failed in his UK assignment and had effectively blown his chances of being moved further up the corporate ladder to a Vice Presidency and, maybe, to the Presidency itself. He turned the car into Park Lane and drove quickly and skilfully through the maze of traffic converging on Marble Arch to emerge in the correct lane for the Edgware Road. By his side, the magnificent cosmetically-engineered Eleanor graphically expressed what she thought of the farewell party through blazing eyes which darted alarmingly under false eyelashes. She wasn't demoralised. She was absolutely livid. ‘Don't you ever put me through that situation again,’ she snarled through clenched teeth, tugging irritably at the sleeve of her mink jacket. ‘I've never been so uncomfortable in all my life. It was utter humiliation.’ ‘Aw, come on now honey…it wasn't that bad,’ he replied dismally, pulling over to allow a wailing police car through the heavy late night traffic. ‘Huh,’ she scoffed dismissively. ‘Who's kiddin' who? It was sheer bloody hell listening to all those fatuous nincompoops saying what a great guy you are. Bullshit! Sure you're a great guy in their eyes…you've done 'em all a favour by writing yourself off the promotion list. Jeez, they couldn't conceal how pleased they were. It made me want to throw up!’ He screwed up his eyes with pain. She was right of course, he knew that, but her words hurt just the same. For the first time in his career he had failed to produce the goods and that hurt his pride. He was also finished as a rising executive. He had been shunted into a side-line and was now out of the mainstream traffic for good. He knew that. Trance-like he drove down the Edgware Road, responding to the multitudinous traffic lights with mechanical movements, while the agitated Eleanor continued to lash his unreceptive ear with a never-ending stream of abuse. He reflected on the options which had been open to him, one of which had led to his downfall. Eleanor was right when she had said at the very beginning that he should have gone along with the corporate planning proposals to phase-out the UK Vehicle Division as a manufacturing operation. He would have survived if he had accepted the plan in the first place and done what the Corporation had wanted him to do instead of putting forward his own counter proposals. But that was easier said than done. How could he have accepted such a proposal without letting down the fifty thousand people who worked for him? He was their leader. If he didn't fight on their behalf, who the hell would? He switched on the headlights as the car entered the M1 at Brent Cross. Eleanor's waspish voice ranted on and on. ‘You should have seen the smug self satisfaction on the faces of those bitches as they lined up to kiss me,’ she rasped. ‘So sorry, darling’,’ she mimicked. ‘We're really goin' to miss you both, we really are….’ The lousy hypocritical bastards! I could have spit in their eyes!’ She swung her head in his direction. ‘Well for God's sake say something,’ she yelled. ‘Even if it's only ‘Goodbye’. Don't you have any feelings for what I'm goin' through?’ ‘Waal, I don't exactly feel too good myself,’ he replied morosely. ‘Then, why did you do it?’ she cried bitterly. ‘I said you were crazy not to go along with the Corporation's proposals, didn't I? But you wouldn't listen to me. Oh no! Not you, you had to be the good guy. You had to do a Custer. Well, look where it's got you. And do you think for one minute they care a damn about you? You've got to be joking. And what about me? Do I go back to modelling for a living?’ ‘What choice did I have?’ Don Peters asked with a shrug. ‘I couldn't have lived with myself if I hadn't put up a fight on behalf of the men.’ ‘Waal, how are you gonna live with the Corporation execs from here on in?’ she asked caustically. ‘And how am I gonna live with those two-faced blue-rinsed bitches back home? We're both losers, Don, and everybody knows it. How do we stomach that without choking?’ He winced visibly. ‘I'm sorry honey… I know I've let you down…but we'll  get by.’ ‘Get by…! Get by!’ she yelled. ‘I don't wanna get by, Don, I wanna get on. You and I have always been winners. I wanted you to make it to that goddamned fourteenth floor just as much as you did! You could have made it too, if you hadn't been so stupid.’ ‘How do you think I feel?’ he asked. ‘But I had to make the effort, on behalf of the Division. It would have worked too, if I'd been supported.’ ‘But you weren't supported and it didn't work…so what have you achieved?’ she asked sarcastically. ‘The Corporation isn't interested in effort…it's only interested in results. You know that. So where do we go from here?’ ‘You tell me,’ he said flatly, with the air of a tired and unhappy man who has had enough. And she did. Over and over again. It is said that nothing so concentrates a man's mind as the knowledge that he is to be hanged in the morning. It was Sunday and Mark was working on the address he was to give at Trinity College, Dublin. To his pleasant surprise he discovered that he was now able to think with an objective clarity which stemmed from the knowledge that he was now free for the first time in his life to speak his mind without fear or favour. He had touched on some of the reasons why the United Kingdom had been outsmarted and disadvantaged when he had spoken before the Prime Minister at the meeting of the Economic Planning Council. Now he would debate the subject in depth before a cosmopolitan audience of European and international politicians, bureaucrats, academic advisers and international managers. Having dined ‘not wisely, but too well’ on one of Georgina's extra-special Sunday lunches, they were relaxing in the garden of their Buckinghamshire home when Mark broke the news. In a very low-key, matter-of-fact way he described the meeting in Muldoon's office and explained Detroit's decision to eliminate regional management. Throughout, Georgina remained calm and expressionless. ‘Does that mean we shall see a great deal more of each other than we have in the past?’ she asked. ‘I should think so,’ he said. ‘Much more.’ She smiled. ‘I think I would like that.’ Mark returned her smile. ‘But what about our standard of living?’ he said. ‘That will have to change if I don't land a job with much the same salary, and jobs like that don't exactly grow on trees, you know, particularly when you're over fifty.’ ‘Nonsense, my dear,’ Georgina told him. ‘You'll be snapped up in no time.’ ‘But what if I'm not? We're still faced with the mortgage and school fees. They won't go away.’ ‘In that event, we'll just have to lower our standard of living, won't we?’ she said. ‘It doesn't particularly bother me. I don't crave all those materialistic things we used to crave when we were young. Not any more. Oh, I don't deny that it was all great fun striving to get to the top,’ she went on, ‘but we've done it, haven't we? We've made the effort together. And if we didn't get to the very top, well, it was near enough, wasn't it? And what do we have to prove? That we're both getting older? That you still want to compete in a young man's race, even though it might kill you?’ She gripped his hand. ‘We've had a lot, and we've got a lot,’ she said. ‘We've lived good and bad times together and, no doubt, we'll share more. I'm not afraid of the future and, knowing you as I do, nor should you be. You'll win through. You'll show them all!’ She stood up and kissed him lightly on the lips. ‘Now if you'd like me to tell you what I really think of United Motors after all these years, I'll do so.’ she said. And her voice took on a keener edge. ‘But I don't really like swearing, and I'm sure you've already sworn quite enough for both of us. So, for the moment, we'll just leave it at that shall we?’ She linked an arm through his. ‘Now let's take a walk over the fields with Honey and Harriet. The countryside is looking beautiful right now.’"
FIC FIC-AC2-009 4 "Shortly after his return to England, Mark received an invitation to address an all-party Committee of Members of Parliament. He was invited to develop his Dublin address with particular reference to the economic and commercial disadvantages of peripheral industrial countries, such as the United Kingdom, within the EEC. He was also specifically asked to speak not as an executive of United Motors, but as an Englishman. As he had been invited to dine with Members afterwards, his secretary had booked him into The Howard Hotel, a few hundred yards from Parliament Square on the Victoria Embankment, overlooking the Tower of London to the east and the Houses of Parliament to the west. As Mark strolled from the hotel and crossed the road to the riverside walk, he had a strange feeling that the evening ahead would re-shape his future. Outwardly he was calm and composed as he walked in the warm evening sunshine towards the House, but like the swans gliding serenely across the water, he too was paddling like hell underneath. Big Ben struck the quarter hour and he checked his watch. Ahead of him, the tail-end stragglers of the daily rush hour traffic scurried across Westminster Bridge. The House of Parliament loomed up and his heart began to thump. He recalled the first time he had seen the impressive building as a schoolboy on a day's outing to see the sights of London. He could picture the scene as if it were yesterday. The history master had gathered up his flock and had paused outside the source of power in the Commonwealth and Empire to eulogize on the great men of the past who had entered the hallowed portals. Mark was one of twelve young boys and girls clustered around him to lap up his words of wisdom. ‘Through these portals passed such illustrious men as Pitt, Walpole, Disraeli and Gladstone, to carve their names on the glorious history of England,’ he had said to his young and captive audience. At the mention of the name Disraeli, Mark had been transported into a world of his own. His grandfather had been a master baker and, in one of the many family stories Mark had heard at his grandfather's knee, he had been told of how his great-grandfather had served Benjamin Disraeli with a standing daily order of twelve French loaves, burnt and rasped. It was the burning and rasping bit which had fascinated Mark. His grandfather had explained that the only true way to bake bread was to burn it black and then rasp off the burnt extremities with a coarse file. Mark had adored his grandparents and would listen spellbound to their stories for hours on end. The history master had interrupted his reverie with a smart clip round the ear. ‘Stop daydreaming, Sanders, will you boy? Give us, pray, the benefit of your undivided attention. Now sir, he had continued acidly, gripping Mark by the ear, ‘tell me, if I may be so bold as to ask, precisely what I have been talking about.’ ‘Disraeli, sir. Twelve French loaves, burnt and rasped, sir.’ blurted the surprised boy, and the other children giggled hysterically. ‘You stupid boy,’ cried the master. ‘What in the world are you talking about? If it's not cricket and Frank Woolley it's something else. Now it's twelve French loaves, burnt and rasped, whatever that means. I despair of you, boy. One thing for certain, Sanders, you won't be coming here to the Mother of Parliaments to give us all the benefit of your profound wisdom. It'll be some factory workbench for you boy, where, if you continue to dream your stupid little daydreams, you'll end up chopping your fingers off. Is that understood?’ ‘Yes, sir.’ Mark had been twelve at the time and beset by emotional turmoil. His parents had recently parted. Now he recalled how, on the second night after his mother had left home, he had climbed out of bed in the late evening and slipped unnoticed from the house to run over a mile to Bournemouth Central Railway Station to catch a train to nearby  Christchurch, where his mother had gone to live with her sister. It was a cold night in late autumn and the rain had lashed down unremittingly. By the time he had reached the shelter of the station he was soaked to the skin. He had paid three pence at the booking office for his ticket and, after waiting ten minutes or so on the cold and draughty platform for the next London-bound train, he had arrived at Christchurch some ten minutes later to run through torrential rain toward the group of cottages which flanked the open park in the town centre. He was not certain which cottage his aunt rented during the winter. In the spring and summer she lived in a cottage on the banks of the river Stour just below Tuckton bridge. Mark had spent many idyllic summer days sailing and fishing with his brothers and his aunt on the beautiful river, but had never been to her winter cottage. The rain continued to beat down upon him as he ran across the dark and sodden park just before midnight. With the exception of one cottage, where a light still shone in the window, all the others were in total darkness. Mark ran to the one and only cottage with the light and was as surprised as his aunt when she opened the door. She gave a great gasp of anguished amazement at the sight of the drowned rat of a boy standing before her, the rain pouring off his sodden hair to run in rivulets down his pale face. Oh my God, Mark sweetheart,’ she cried, pulling the soaked boy to her bosom . ‘Grace,’ she called out to his mother, ‘it's Mark.’ His beautiful and adored mother quickly appeared from the sitting-room and hugged him nearly to death on the doorstep. But despite his repeated and heartfelt pleas to his mother to come home, she steadfastly refused to do so, and she never did. The divorce was made absolute two years later. Mark stood for a few moments at the corner of Parliament Street and Bridge Street. It was nearly forty years since the history master had bawled him out on the pavement over there, in front of the House of Commons. ‘One thing is certain Sanders…’ he had said, ‘you won't be coming here….’ Mark crossed Parliament Square and even the statue of Churchill appeared to be growling at the sorry state of affairs in the land where a pettifogging ex-apprentice was invited to address Right Honourable Members of both Houses. He climbed the steps leading to the central lobby and was stopped by a burly policeman who asked the nature of his business. ‘Name's Sanders. I am addressing an all-party committee,’ Mark replied, feeling rather important as he uttered the words. ‘Bully for you, sir,’ replied the policeman with a smile. ‘Go ahead sir.’ Mark passed through a security screen to make his way to the impressive central lobby where the Chairman of the Committee was already waiting to receive him. It was six twenty-seven. After the usual pleasantries he took Mark along one of the labyrinth of corridors flanked with busts of the famous, and stopped before a heavy oak-panelled door attended by a liveried usher. After exchanging a few words, the usher opened the door and Mark was escorted into a debating chamber shaped in the form of a horseshoe, with a raised dais at the open end upon which were two heavy oak chairs, one for the Chairman and the other for the speaker. The room had seating capacity for about eighty and Mark saw that it was about half full. Before being taken to the platform, he was introduced to those members of the Committee who happened to be milling around the entrance. He recognised familiar names and faces from all parties, and also noticed that everybody carried copies of his Dublin paper. He was then escorted to the dais, where the Chairman launched into a brief introduction. ‘Your Dublin paper whetted our appetite, Mr Sanders,’ he said in conclusion. ‘We now look forward to the main course this evening.’ Mark rose from his chair fully aware that politicians believed themselves to be the best informed people in the world, which made them a very sceptical audience for any  speaker. They sprawled across the padded benches before him with the somewhat jaded air of men who expected to hear nothing new. He began jocularly by saying that he rose to address them with some apprehension, reminded of a piece of graffiti he had seen on a Whitehall notice board which had read, ‘I used to be indecisive…but now I'm not so sure,, which brought a few chuckles from the floor. ‘I propose to describe the very considerable commercial and economic disadvantages incurred by the United Kingdom by comparison with other European countries when investment locations’ decisions are taken by multi-nationals,, Mark continued. ‘And also to offer some suggestions as to how the UK handicap could be reduced and its disadvantages turned to its advantage.’ A few eyebrows were raised at such unequivocal presumptions. ‘You have also invited me to wear a British hat,’ Mark continued. ‘It will be a pleasant change to do so.’ He began by giving several examples of how Governments in both West and East Europe had obtained major United Motors' investment projects by highly discriminatory and blatantly unfair means, which had operated to the detriment of the UK. He was suddenly thrown off balance by the hurried departure of a Minister. He was aware that Members had to come and go at irregular intervals at the behest of their lords and masters when the House was in session, but he feared the worst. He faltered, cleared his throat, drank liberally from the glass before him, and continued. His morale was uplifted a few minutes later when the same Minister returned with a gaggle of additional members evidently called from the floor of the House. Mark warmed to the task and continued with renewed confidence. ‘There are many instances where UK investment and product costs have been up to twenty per cent below other European countries, but the investment has still been located on the continent because of unfair political pressures and highly discriminatory practices,’ he added to gasps of pained surprise. ‘The Treaty of Rome rules on competitive costs and prices have been blatantly disregarded by certain countries and the multi-nationals,’ he added. ‘Just consider, for example, the adverse economic effect on Britain of Ford's highly discriminatory investment plan agreed with the Spanish Government….’ For the best part of an hour he exposed what was really going on in the international motor industry. His audience was very quiet. Hardly a muscle moved. ‘Corporate plans of the Fords, UMs and Chryslers of this world influence and shape our destiny. They determine whether Britain is to be a winner or loser country. Sadly for Britain they have already made the decision that Britain is to be a loser country,’ he said dramatically. Pained expressions crossed the faces of the now alarmed politicians. ‘For example,’ he went on, ‘The corporate plan of United Motors is to phase-out vehicle and component manufacture in the UK and import its requirements from new plants on the continent, from East Europe, the Far East — including Japan — and from the United States itself, with the loss of fifty thousand UK jobs, one hundred and fifty thousand if one includes jobs lost in the UK supplier chain.’ he added. There was a gasp at this disclosure. Constituency problems now loomed large. ‘By the late eighties the global plans of the major US multinationals will have created a massive UK trade deficit of around seven billion pounds which will go on increasing with the growth of the number of vehicles in use. These companies have been Britain's top exporters in the past. Seven years from now they will be Britain's top importers. What will be the effect on the pound sterling and on Britain's economic standing in the world as the trade gap widens? What will be the employment?’ he asked ominously. ‘And yet, this frightening scenario I outline to you this evening is precisely what will happen arising from the global plans of these major American-owned multi-nationals.’ Mark's voice had trailed away to a whisper. His words had produced group paralysis. Not a muscle moved. Mark was now speaking out with a vengeance. For the first time in his life he was free from corporate restraints, to say  what he really thought. He had no qualms in doing so. If those with inside knowledge of the facts didn't speak up for Britain, who the hell would? That was his justification. His eyes ranged the room. ‘The Prime Minister has clearly stated her intention to bring about the industrial regeneration of Britain to correct the decline of the last few years,’ he said vigorously. ‘She has appealed to industrial leaders to help her redress the trade imbalance.’ ‘What price the American contribution toward that objective?’ he asked in a hushed tone. ‘How can the Prime Minister achieve her national targets when US corporate plans move in a diametrically opposite direction to compound Britain's trade problems. What would the American Government say if the roles were reversed?’ he added to nods from all quarters. Mark paused again to take a very long drink. ‘Fortunately Britain can win if we learn from past mistakes, and I would now like to conclude by outlining certain strategic proposals for your consideration, which would put Britain firmly on the upward path to meet the Prime Minister's long-term objectives.’ Mark then described a ten point plan and summarised its resultant effect. The UK vehicle and component industry sectors alone would progressively benefit to the value of eight billion pounds sterling by year five. This would correct the Motor industry trade imbalance without the need to export one additional unit. Unemployment in the sector would be reduced by two hundred thousand, and existing manufacturing capacity, previously made idle by imports, would once more be fully utilised, thus improving operating profit and return on investment. Mark ended his address by saying, ‘The European and international trade war is really between those Governments who fix the rules of the game to suit themselves, and those who play the game according to Treaty of Rome rules. Britain has been a loser country in a manifestly unfair trade environment. It has allowed itself to be outsmarted by governments who are not afraid to bend the rules in their favour, aided and abetted by American multi-nationals whose allegiance is to the United States, naturally. Britain is expendable.’ He looked around him. ‘Why not think and act as Great Britain Incorporate?’. he asked. Unbeknown to Mark, one of the titled politicians present also happened to be an international banker and financial advisor to several US corporations. He phoned New York immediately after the Westminster meeting. A voice at the other end said wearily in a faintly Irish accent. ‘Ah well. I suppose we will have to take appropriate action will we not…. Thanks for putting me in the picture, Patrick.’ The magnate placed the phone back on the receiver…slowly. ‘Thorns left to fester…’ he mused. ‘Maybe we should contact the special outside Agency.’ He thought very, very carefully for a minute or more and then picked up his private phone and dialled a number. Two days later, Mark received a phone call from 10, Downing Street, asking for permission to publish the Dublin paper, and his submission to the House Select Committee, as an appendix to the Government's proposed White Paper shortly to go before the House. He readily gave his approval. At Question Time in the House, the Prime Minister agreed that a paper submitted by a European Planning Manager, now being studied by the Government and the European Commission appeared to offer real solutions to Britain's excessive contribution to the European budget. Mark received several letters and phone calls from Members of Parliament, all but one in support of his two papers and proposals. The Member who wrote to express his disagreement invited Mark to the House to discuss his reasons for taking the opposite viewpoint. He received Mark in the central lobby and took him to the Members' tea room for a chat over a pot of tea. He was a young lawyer of about thirty in his first year in  Parliament, who had sufficiently impressed someone in Government to have been given the job of Junior Minister at the Trade office. He came straight to the point in a rather superior manner, saying that he was a European federalist and that, in his opinion, it didn't matter a tuppeny damn whether industrial investments took place in Germany, France or the UK. He went on to say that it was irrelevant whether Britain had an industrial base at all if it could be shown that it would be more sensible, from a European point of view, for Britain to become a service nation importing its manufactured product requirements. Mark listened aghast at the naive and dangerous idealism of the young, starry-eyed politician, who was light years away from knowing what really went on at the sharp end of European and international trade. ‘If you believe that, sir,’ said Mark with as much politeness as he could muster, ‘you will naturally not share the concern I have expressed in my papers. We are obviously poles apart. Do you wish to discuss the subject further, or would we both be wasting our time?’ ‘Wasting our time, I think.’ said the young Minister, forcing a laugh. ‘But as I have invited you here, let's discuss the subject a little further at least.’ Mark asked him how he could reconcile his views with what was clearly Britain s basic needs; the need to maintain a strong manufacturing base as a defence capability; the need to correct a massive and worsening trade deficit on manufactured products; and the need to provide talented school-leavers with creative career opportunities in the manufacturing sector as designers, physicists, chemists and engineers as opposed to the more mundane jobs in the service sector as warehousemen and handlers of other countries' goods. The young politician shrugged his shoulders. ‘Irrelevancies,’ he said dismissively. ‘Top talent will always be in demand where the jobs are, and if the jobs are on the continent, so be it. National trade deficits will become meaningless under a European monetary system with a common currency. And as for defence,’ he went on, ‘Britain would be defended by arms manufactured in Germany or France just as well as by arms manufactured in  Britain, if this were necessary for good economic reasons.’ Mark raised an eyebrow. ‘Your belief that Germany or France would unfailingly defend Britain and British interests against an aggressor is not one that I share. Does the Minister of Defence share your views?, ‘No, he does not!’ snapped the Junior Minister of Trade. ‘Thank God for that,’ Mark declaimed. ‘Your views are too simplistic for me,’ said the young politician loftily. ‘As you say, we are poles apart. Let's leave it at that.’ He rose to leave and Mark followed. ‘Before you entered Parliament, what did you do?’ Mark asked. The young man's head went up. ‘I was… I am…a barrister.’ ‘But you are a Junior Minister of Trade. You're not attached to the Attorney General's office,’ said Mark with an air of feigned surprise. The Junior Minister pulled himself up to his full height of five foot three, and in a plummy voice rich with haughty disdain said, ‘What difference does that make?’ ‘Well, you wouldn't expect an industrial manager to be made Attorney General, would you?’ Mark asked. The young politician tugged at an ear lobe and eyed him narrowly. ‘By that remark, I take it you mean that I know little or nothing about industrial or trade matters?’ Mark looked him straight in the eye. ‘I think it would be a great presumption on your part if you thought you did,’ he replied firmly, putting the young man down. The self-important politician smiled coldly. ‘You have a nice way of expressing yourself which, I suppose, reflects your industrial background.’ The word ‘industrial’ came out like a swearword. ‘Good day to you, sir,’ the Junior Minister said formally. ‘Thank you for responding to my invitation.’ They shook hands, but it was clearly on the unspoken understanding that they could still come out fighting. They went their separate ways: the young politician to the floor of  the House to promote new industrial and commercial legislation which would, no doubt, exercise his legal mind, and the industrial manager to the central lobby, and the way out. Mark drove home along the M1 reflecting that the French and Germans in particular would be pleased to erect monuments to the idealistic young English politician who had said all the things that Britain's trade competitors wanted to hear. The Germans had got their priorities right. Unlike Britain, they put national industrial supremacy first and foremost. European interests were secondary to national objectives, except where European political unity carried more clout in the international political scene. The British had been taken to the cleaners because foolish politicians in post-war Britain had elected to produce sociologists instead of engineers, and the predictable end result was that Britain had been short on wealth creators and long on spenders. The creative and talented nation that gave birth to the Industrial Revolution and produced more inventions and patents per head of population than any other country in the world, had turned its back on industry and commerce. Mark felt bitter and sad. Sad that his country had fallen from the top of the European industrial league, to joint eighth out of nine, and bitter toward the foolish leaders who had been largely responsible for its decline. The supercilious young Minister of Trade was a typical product of the British post-war school of Parliamentarians whose motto should have been ‘words not deeds’. In the eyes of such politicians, industrial managers were not seen as the creators of the nation's wealth, and the providers of job opportunities for the people, but as despoilers of the environment; obsolete men, peddling obsolete views, who didn't really fit in with the new social scheme of things. They were yesterday's men. In their eyes, Mark Sanders was such a man."
FIC FIC-FAJ-001 4.01 "TWELVE It's no news that memory is deceitful. I have tried to explain that in Claudia's case memory is particularly treacherous, but Letterman likes the idea of ambiguity. He sees it as European, a kind of intellectual chic, useful to our story. He has come a long way since he worked as a production runner with James Wong Howe and Martin Ritt in a coal-mining village in Pennsylvania. I suspect his own memory is a little unreliable; in his telling he was Martin Ritt's right-hand man and Sean Connery's golfing partner after just one week. He is self-deprecating but ail his anecdotes feature his achievements. Whatever the ostensible subject matter, Letterman — as clapper loader, assistant director, co-author, executive producer — emerges from the narrative undergrowth muddled, festooned in foliage, sometimes even bloodied, but always victorious. Muthaiga Club, where I am staying, releases forgotten gusts of memory, like those lilies which only exhale their sweet perfume at night. My father was happiest in places like this. He loved clubs and wardrooms with the pre-dinner drinks, the discreet signing of chitties, the smiling elderly waiters (from a class almost extinct now, men who lived to serve other men). I remember arriving in my father's Pontiac at clubs just like this, sweeping (not always silently; the car was old) down to the front door to be deposited and greeted, to be called ‘sir’ by elderly black men. I remember running on the rolling lawns of Kikuyu grass before dinner, the night noises of the exceptionally vocal African insect life striking up as it quickly grew dark, night unrolling from the ground upwards; bullfrogs — in fact all manner of rana and bufo-frogs the size of a pair of roiled-up rugby socks, toads with  great horned eyebrows, and tiny, reddish, darting amphibians, starting to howl, shriek, growl, and purr, a backdrop to our dinner on the terrace to which we have been summoned by the stirring, thrilling, beating of a gong hung from a pair of tusks. We sit straight, elbows tucked in, endless soup spoons, fish knives and butter knives to deal with. ‘A gentleman is a man who uses the butter knife even when his wife is not at home,’ said my father, only two-thirds joking. The dinner itself, a ritual of many courses, begins to emerge in relays from the swing doors of the kitchen, the food bland and unexceptionable, but plentiful and somehow sanctified by being served by the immaculate waiters in sashes and gloves. So Muthaiga Club is instantly familiar. My room looks out over a croquet lawn, at the end of which is a pond thickly planted with papyrus — the eponymous plant always mentioned by school teachers in any history of written language — in which, I know with certainty, all hell will break loose as dusk falls. High on the wall of my room, near the open window, waiting for the lights to come on, a gecko is clinging on hopefully to the knobbly plaster. Unlike other members of the reptile family, the gecko is a benign creature, cheery, opportunistic and patently useful. I am troubled by the thought that this familiar world into which I am able to slip without a moment's readjustment, is a vanishing world. The club is now written up in style magazines; models are photographed with the head waiter. (Models are often photographed surrounded by nearly naked Masai warriors.) The world of fashion and advertising (from which Victoria has not quite made her escape — she is like someone with one boot stuck deep in the mud, unable to move either way) now uses places like that as themes for new looks or as inspiration for ‘lifestyles’. S. O. Letterman has something similar in mind, a re-creation of colonial Africa, as seen from Santa Monica Boulevard. Right here, in Muthaiga, colonial Africa lives on. But does it live self-consciously, or blithely as it did when I was a child? I am as aware as anyone of the changes going on in the world. I earn my living by observing them and commenting on them. But coming here has made me realize how much time has passed since, as a small boy, we used to set off for dinners and functions. I have probably not heard or read the phrase ‘beetle drive’ in my adult life, yet on the noticeboard of the club, just under the list of aspirant members duly proposed and seconded and posted, is the announcement of a beetle drive in aid of the library fund. The notice is signed by Sir Thomas Fairfax, Hon. Secretary, Library Committee. I remember the frenzy of a beetle drive, the wings, the little legs, the stubby pencils, the cries of ‘beetle’, the powdering of the noses, the soda siphons fizzing. Proust (who was a near neighbour and acquaintance of Léon Cohn-Casson) thought that memory could unlock the imagination. He was always searching, rummaging:Les vrais paradis sont les paradis qu'on a perdus . I fear it can throttle imagination. These memories which are summoned here in Africa seem to me like tendrils of vines attaching themselves to me. They have in them presages of mortality; I have a feeling that there is now more of my past life than my future. And I am aware of my past life; I feel it looming up behind me, breathing lightly on the nape of my neck. Nineteen fifty-eight, small boy arrives in pontiac at club. Servants bow and scrape. Khaki shorts replaced by abrasive long trousers for the evening. My father, exuding his insubstantial charm, his hand-me-down cosmopolitanism, signs us in. ‘Good evening, Shadrach.’ ‘Good evening, sir.’ ‘This is my son.‘ ‘Nice boy, sir. Big boy now. Before, small.’ Shadrach — can he be this pleased to see me?— smiles as he cups his hands to indicate the tiny creature I was previously. ‘Too big now,’ he says. Muthaiga has the same system. The privileged sign in at  a large book attached by a thin chain to a sort of lectern. The head waiter already has my name memorized. I take a stroll in the sonorous gardens. There is a sudden flurry outside the main entrance, a Gothic porch. The evening is closing, a mist rising in the hollows of the golf course. The waiters are folding napkins, the insects are tuning up vigorously, the first croaks and ululations rise from the pond, the damp earth breathes out aromatically, the exotic flowers pump out their night perfumes, the sky in the distance over the knuckles of Ngong, the direction of Masailand, flails with electricity. (It seems more like buckets of thin paint dropped from the sky than lightning.) In the Delamere rooms a pianist is playing ‘Young Love’ and from the kitchen comes a waft of roasting meat. The flurry is caused by the arrival of an old car, of a type that retains a kind of dignity as it ages. Lady De Marr arrives every evening, God willing, in this old banger. I watch her arrival. She knew Claudia very well; they used to go to parties together dressed as boys. Now Lady De Marr staggers into the front door, saluted by the guard, the askari, disdaining the proffered help of the major-domo, who wears a fez and a sash. Another man drives her car away to park it. He does this gravely, perhaps fearing — with some justification from what I can see — that the whole thing might collapse like a car in a Laurel and Hardy movie, falling absolutely fiat on to the ground in its component parts. I hear her voice complaining of the ill-manners of the police at a road block. It is a voice unaffected by the changes in articulation which have taken place since the 1930s. She pronounces the word ‘damn’ with a little gurgle of amusement: ‘Dem cheek. Bloody road block outside the club. Silly arses. Somebody should tell them to bugger orff and catch some criminals.’ Nobody can reproduce this intonation. Actors and actresses produce a version of Noël Coward when they try. I follow after an interval towards the entrance. The frogs are already deafening. Claudia Cohn-Casson often had dinner here when she was in Nairobi. She sometimes had dinner with Sir Thomas Fairfax, who tonight is having dinner with Lady De Marr. I wish to observe this, because I find the prospect of two octogenarians having dinner in the middle of Africa moving. The intensely familiar surroundings, the froggy air, the starched linen earnestly folded, even the little fake candle holders on the wall with their chintz shades, shunt my real life, my sexual wrangles with Victoria, my work, to one side. This uninvited, almost uncontrollable, welling of memory is like finding a hard splinter in the soft, flabby flesh of my real life. But also I am suffering a pleasurable and painful feeling, a feeling so often made banal by film, of time reprieved and relived. Here I am, for Chrissakes, about to dine alongside two people who knew Claudia Cohn-Casson, in surroundings she knew well, in an ambience which I know ail too well, although I have only just arrived. After dinner, like some cultural tourist, I will introduce myself to these envoys from the past. A gong booms. The sound makes small silverfish run down the back of my neck. I am, as my father used to say, going to have the works. I start with a consommé Lady Curzon. Even in the soup, the old order is commemorated."
FIC FIC-FAJ-008 4.41 "NINETEEN Victoria is thirty-two now. She is wary of platitudes and would never use the magazine phrase ‘biological clock’ but, like Captain Hook, she is prone to hearing a fateful ticking. She resents being prey to such banal anxieties. But we both know, although I haven't said it, that the consequence of her unfaithfulness is that I have been able to take the high ground. We also know that this is unfair. I have hardly thought of her for at least a week; I am free of the little stabs of pain and the scudding dark clouds which had a habit of appearing from nowhere, uninvited and unexpected. I now see the whole episode (do I know everything?) in the way that Victoria paints it: a minor sexual frolic which, without the mistimed floral tribute, would have meant nothing. But my new detachment is bad news for Victoria's cause. As all lovers know, the other's unease is balm for the soul. I feel guilty about having engaged her for weeks in close and auto-erotic questioning. So I settle down to write her a letter explaining my erratic behaviour. I am proposing to dress it up a little, as Joyce did to his Nora, as a symptom of high-mindedness. In these matters, high-mindedness takes a holiday: Joyce wanted to watch Nora crapping. I write to her with my window open to catch a breeze which is coming from over the plains where the short rains are expected. They are announced by atmospheric restlessness: papers in the street below suddenly dance and the trees on the mountain ripple. The Masai feel the air, hoping that the rains will produce nutritionally supercharged grass, which will return to their cattle the smooth, lustrous flanks and moist eyes which they love. Can I tell Victoria this? Can I explain to her that I am fully in sympathy with their monomania? I tell her of my travels, although none of them is to a  place you could easily find on a map, and of the people I have met. I then reassure her that I have forgiven her, although I am aware that the word ‘forgiven’ implies that I have absolution in my gift. (The truth is I don't want to forgive her, because it will free her from the grappling irons I have on her. Also, I don't want to forgive her because it will suggest that I have settled for something.) After a few minutes I realize this letter cannot be written truthfully. Instead I write half-truths. I tell her of my trip to Nairobi and the contacts with the laibon, but I am unable to explain to her how my personal relationship with the subject matter is developing. I gaze out of the window and see in the distance a flash, like a tourist's Instamatic, of lightning. I make a determined effort to rummage around in the jumble of our years together for some of the intensity of feeling I had for her. I would like to be able to find at least an oddment of eroticism. But I can only retrieve her lips, those lightly ribbed, juicy lips, studded and patterned in close-up like a mulberry or a raspberry, their almost leathery texture if you were to brush them with your fingertips or tongue tip (that snaky little organ equipped with ideas of its own). Nothing else. Her lips, like a Man Ray picture or a New Age sunrise, straddle the horizon of my imagination. All our conversations — we have been great talkers — have now been dumped to join the countless other discarded conversations, arguments and recriminations. There must be some evolutionary purpose to this constant verbal skirmishing and foraying. What I see now is the complete futility, the gross over-production, the immeasurable waste of emotion and words. It is as though we had to talk in order to reassure ourselves that we were living. Maybe it is radar, coming back to confirm the solidity of objects around us. But then our conversations took a dive into the murky waters of sexuality and jealousy. I am glad to be free again. The clouds have dropped down over the mountain so that the evangelicals and charismatics on the first contour above the town have vanished into the mist. With their  invisibility comes silence. The mist has doused their singing. I try to write but we have run out of words. We expended them too recklessly. The ones that are left are lifeless. Instead, I find myself wondering what Tom Fairfax was concealing behind the seal face and marine eyebrows. Then I remember the unopened letters, the reminders from the grey and fog-bound north. They are in a drawer of the flimsy wardrobe. Reluctantly, first examining the postmarks at length for clues, I open them. S. O. Letterman's office sends me the announcement made at Cannes of the imminent Franco-American production of the moving story of Claude Cohn-Casson, to be called Masai Dreaming . I am credited as the internationally known journalist and writer. Casting is in hand in Paris and Los Angeles. A number of well-known directors have expressed an interest in the script, which is in first draft. My bank also writes about maintenance payments. I leave Victoria's letter to last. It contains a doctor's certificate, declaring her free of HIV."
FIC FIC-FAJ-014 4.43 "TWENTY-FIVE The koko served us tea as we sat in the middle of the boma after the cattle had gone. (We were probably sitting on about three feet of dried dung, crumbly and friable.) She poured the tea into large enamel mugs. I had seen the donkeys plodding reluctantly up the escarpment to fetch water miles away. Donkeys are not natural enthusiasts; they walk as if they have arthritis. I felt guilty that this hard-won water should be wasted on a tea ritual when I had gallons of mineral water at my camp. But she ministered to us as the tape-recorder whirred. The tea was loaded with sugar, and milk from a gourd was added in a thin stream like milk being drawn from a cow's udder. As she was pouring the tea it occurred to me that maybe she knew Claudia too. She was the first of the laibon's four wives many years ago. Now she is a benign presence which gives the engang a heart. I am now reading Uitsmijter's transcript of what the laibon had on his mind. The owl of Minerva flies as dusk is falling: the laibon believes he is not long for this earth. He has had some revelations which he wants to pass on to me. They are that the rains are going to cease falling and, because of the restrictions placed on their movement, the Masai will not be able to follow their tradition of moving on. As I read, it seems to me that this is not his literal meaning. He is voicing the complaint of all old people about the closing down of their universe. Death is the removal of all the possibilities which sustain us in our lives. But also, I guess, he is exercising his right as a laibon to prophesy. Headmasters, senators, judges, priests all see themselves as having a particular duty in this regard. A politician invited to make the wedding speech can be relied upon to dish up some  predictions along with the eternal verities. The laibon retells the accounts of his illustrious ancestors of the great migration from the North. He wants me, for some reason, to realize that he knows the lights are going out in the Masai world. He sees that finally the Masai myths have been overtaken. He tells me of a great battle his ancestors fought near Lake Victoria. He speaks of a battle against the Germans. He prophesies a war of the Masai against the townies. (I wonder if he realized that there are serried ranks of townies behind the front line that he has encountered.) The pebbles he has thrown have shown these things. The uprising against the townies will take place after the next eunoto, which is the gathering of thousands of warriors at the end of their time as morans. Thousands of warriors collect from the huge Masai district to have their heads shaved by their mothers before undergoing rituals to launch them on their new — somewhat dull — life as elders. There is no music, only the hoarse, erratic bellow of a kudu horn and the chanting, a strange noise which comes from inside the earth itself, as though the rocks and the soil were singing as best they could. The infinite possibilities of Masai life, on the face of it a simple desire to wander the earth following the cattle, have been denied. Every single thing the Masai value depends upon this possibility. This is the object of life. It is life. Uitsmijter, under the academic compulsion to explain, adds a note about the nature of prophecy among the Masai and — the comparative method — among other tribes such as the Dinka and the Nuer. Prophecy is expected of the laibons. It is usually expressed in the vaguest terms, like a horoscope in the newspapers. Another disciple of Nostradamus, S. O. Letterman, has been throwing the pebbles in LA and finds the omens good. So far no progress with the female lead. But Mel Gibson likes the treatment, which Letterman himself has had to work up  a little. In principle he would like to do the movie, but you know how it is with agents. (I don't, as a matter of fact, but this is the chummy method at work.) In many ways the time is right — fiftieth anniversary, uncertainties in the world, French self-examination and so on— for just such a movie. It feels right. The response is good. He is off to Paris to interview actresses. This sounds like a wonderful opportunity for Letterman to bring to bear his feminine understanding on eager actresses, although something tells me that his Californian slightly-absurd-boyish-middle-aged charm will not go down well in Paris. I wonder if what Mencken called ‘the usual hypocrisies’ aren't too well understood by women in Paris. I am sure that Letterman would like to have some of Polanski's assurance with young women, a knowingness which makes the Californian mania for self-presentation look quaint. The success — I am looking out of the window at the thickly carpeted mountainside — comes from the knowledge of shared weakness, the weakness of both men and women in matters of sex and passion. It does not arise, as Letterman imagines, from impressing on women your sympathy and sensitivity to their imagined plight. This is why bastards continue to score heavily with women who should know better. For all his working of the flesh and his golden suntan and his deployment of pop philosophies and credos, Letterman is too contrived an individual to be successful with the sort of Frenchwoman — my gaze descends from the mountain to my backyard where they are pegging out a goatskin — whom he desires to play the part of Claudia. But I can't be sure."
FIC FIC-FET-004 5.32 "3. Christmas The nuclear Potter family had practised a muted and aimless version of the British family Christmas rite. They had inhibitions about concentrating on what might be called the Dickensian essentials; a great deal of specified food and drink, presents wanted and unwanted, the gathering of friends and relations. They had no available extended family: there were Potters scattered about North Yorkshire who had not been seen since Bill's Congregationalist parents had cast him off for unbelief. Winifred was the only child of dead parents. Their household gods were created, not inherited, and were meagre and fleshless. This was partly — in the Dickensian context — because of uncertainty of manners, owing to upward social mobility. They had ideas about respectability and propriety which as intellectuals they despised but as Christmas dinner-eaters they endorsed. Daniel's Dad, the engine-driver, when living, had got drunk in the pub first and at home later: there had been gusto, jollity, somnolence and regret. Bill Potter took a glass of sherry, and shared out a bottle of sparkling wine. No neighbours called and they visited no neighbours. They were blameless of seasonal road accidents: they were closed in with themselves, more than usual, since no shops were open and no employment was possible, except to ""enjoy oneself"" and wash up more plates than usual, as Frederica frequently pointed out. They ate frugally: they had learned in the war to make do with the plain, avoid waste, make things go round. Winifred had aesthetic uncertainties. As she had little dress sense, only a vague fear that any hat or dress she chose might be vulgar, so she had no sense of a possible style in which to decorate a house, or even a dining table, for Christmas. She solved the clothes problem with rigorous inconspicuous plainness, and was inclined to solve the Christmas problem, much less successfully, the same way. When the children were little they made paper chains and strings of painted cardboard milk-bottle tops, and these were draped over mirrors. (They were never long enough to cross the room.) When they were little they had a little artificial tree and put out their stockings on Christmas Eve. Neither Bill nor Winifred could bring themselves to lie about the provenance of the gifts they found in the stockings. This was not really because of an absolute respect for truth but was something to do with their inhibited negative sense of style. They could not be seen telling stories: it looked daft. Frederica, frustrated of magic, took it out on her classmates at a very early age by stripping them ruthlessly of their illusions. This made her neither popular nor happy. There was no singing, because they could not sing. There were no games, partly because they didn't know any, partly because all five were united, in this if in nothing else, in the belief that dice, cards, charades, were a frivolous waste of time. So, apart from opening presents, they watched each other and waited for Christmas to be over so that they could resume their intense and private working lives. This year, for Stephanie, had to be different. There was the church, which she helped to decorate with holly, mistletoe, evergreens. There were parish parties. There was the fact of her two families. After thought, she asked her mother to bring the remaining Potters — Bill and Frederica — to Christmas dinner in the cottage. This might, she said, provide a sensible bridging occasion when Marcus could establish some new contact with his parents. Winifred was doubtful. She seemed to have lost some sense that events could be controlled or hopefully directed. Stephanie spoke also, for her almost sharply, to Marcus and told him that the visit would happen and that she trusted him to help with it, to behave well. He seemed to respond and even, to her great surprise and encouragement, took the first active part he had taken in any event for six months, preparing for the feast. She wanted to make the cottage festive, mostly for Daniel. She spent money they didn't have on green leafage and bought a large, real tree in Blesford market place. It was delivered swaddled in raffia, conical and bursting with dark needles. Stephanie unwound it like a cocoon, stroked and spread its spiky boughs, spent time and effort stabilising it in a bucket of earth with the weight from the kitchen scales. It stood there with its thick different life, blue-green and  sombre, smelling of resin and forests. Mrs Orton, who spent every day settled in Daniel's chair, stared, said Stephanie would do herself a damage, and offered no assistance. Marcus, palely flitting past, consented, when asked, to hold the trunk upright with one thin hand whilst she toiled, tamping earth, lashing clothesline round trunk and branches. Marcus said in a thin voice that the smell of pine needles was nice in the house. Mrs Orton said they were messy things, got into everything. Stephanie had a vision of her tree hung with gold and silver fruit and bright with candles. Because she was a plain Potter she wanted her fruit plain, not frosted with garish patterns or stencilled with poinsettias. She could find in Blesford only gnomes, dwarfish Father Christmases, hideous waits' lanterns. She sat down one afternoon with the idea of coiling gold and silver thread into starbursts on milk-bottle tops. Marcus surprised her considerably by saying why not wire, and surprised her still further by constructing, from fine gold and silver wire, a whole series of stars, hexagons, starry hollow globes and complex polyhedrons, an abstract fruitage which glittered brightly, weaving threads of light among the dark threads of the needles. She preferred Christmas to other Christian feasts — a magical tale celebrating birth, a common miracle. Bill had been given to anti-sermons. His children had been lectured on the folly of the Virgin Birth, the slenderness of evidence for shepherds, star or stable, with the intensity of Strauss or Renan, as though ascertainable historical truth was a freedom he passionately desired for his children. And it was desirable, or would have been, if his style had been less intimidating, if the proposed freedom had offered a colour, light or warmth to compensate for astral and angelic voices. Now Daniel was difficult, telling her not to come to the hospital, where he was to be Father Christmas in the children's ward.  ""I want to see you.""   ""Not there, you don't.""   ""Shall I embarrass you?""  ""I'm not in this job to be easily embarrassed. No. I just think — I just think."" He could not say what he just thought, which was that she should be afraid of that place now. As he was himself. She came. The farther in your bed was, the worse you were. At the end were cubicles, out of sight and sound. In the outer ward was a silky-white hygienic artificial tree. Those children who could possibly go home had gone. The very sick had been wheeled into spaces vacated by simple fracture and tonsillectomies. Stephanie visited this ward regularly: the perpetual inhabitants she knew. Two teenage boys, Neil and Simon, with muscular dystrophy, immobilised now forever, propped up side by side with twig-arms disposed lightly on clean sheets and skeletal intelligent faces cocked at unnatural angles, open-mouthed, amongst the pillows. Anorexic Primrose, thirteen years and five stones, delicate eyes closed against a world she refused to recognise, hands folded white and nun-like, or worse, beneath a sharp chin. Gary, shaven, swollen-skulled, brutal-looking, heavy-eyed with his death burgeoning and forceful under the bones. The mobile lower population of younger inhabitants, staggering Dopey-like in dressing-gowns, trotting in party dresses. Charlie aged eight with a stinking cancerous hip who propelled himself flat on his back on a trolley made from a pram base, flipper-hands paddling, olive, oval face — too big, all their faces were too big — grinning with flickering contempt as he wound skilfully round Stephanie's ankles, his foul air preceding him, and behind him decay and a whiff of disinfectant. Legless Mike, trundling on tree-stump hip-pads, his one arm a long puckered cone. Mary in a pretty pink dress out of which stuck yellow claws and a head and face made by plastic surgeons of grafts ranging in colour from vellum to grape-purple. Mary, lashless, browless, lipless, hairless, except for a freshly washed blond tuft above her left ear. Mary had fallen or been pushed into an open fire, more than once. Mary never had visitors. Sometimes Mary went home, and came back with another scar or suppurating patch. Stephanie picked Mary up — Mary liked to be picked up — and perched her on one hip as she walked from bed to bed. Between Mary and the unborn child was a network of expanded muscles and a sealed drum of amniotic fluid, in which it rested, stretched an unfinished limb, rolled and rested. Beyond swing doors were the babies: mended harelips , and small creatures who had constructed for them by human skill gullet or anal opening or separate fingers with which the working cells and DNA during their gestation had failed to provide them. In an incubator a brown-gold boy, naked and perfect except that both his legs had been broken during his birth, and were now suspended from  a delicately constructed pulley and weight inside his perspex container. A gramophone began with a bang on ""Away in a Manger"" . The nurses and the few mothers who had managed to be available on Christmas Eve sang ragged and loud. Stephanie sang. Mary grunted and Charlie whizzed chuntering past on his low wheels. The gramophone banged a bit more and produced Tchaikovsky. Little girls from Miss Marilynne's Blesford Ballet School did a snowflake dance, little boys (fewer in number) a snowman tumbling-dance, melting most convincingly. The gramophone spurted out ""Rudolph the Red-nosed Reindeer"" . Bells jangled. Who do you think that can be, children, said Sister. And Daniel came in on a hospital trolley disguised as a sleigh with scarlet blankets and silver-paper runners, drawn by hospital porters dressed as polar bears. The ballet school children ran up to distribute presents. They took these from Father Christmas and gave them to the nurses, who gave them to the hospital children. There was something not right about Daniel, his wife thought. The Gynae man who usually wore the outfit was thinner than Daniel, so that Daniel's black garments appeared in large and small expanses under and through the red, like coals in a fire. He had left off his dog collar and was losing strips of his white eyebrows, moustache and beard — the undergrowth, the perpetually springing beard-stubble was subversively blue-black. He stumped awkwardly about the ward, asking people if they were comfortable, and occasionally getting answers. He was not really jolly. One or two of the healthier children cried when he came near them; he moved resignedly away on these occasions, as though this reaction were entirely natural. He avoided his wife. Most of the toys distributed by the ballet children were cuddly toys, pink, blue and white, bunnies, ducks, bears. No child, Stephanie had observed, will love a random cuddly toy, uninvested with history or personality. What were needed, and were not given, were constructive things, meccano, plasticine, things bad for the sheets and easy to lose. A puffed-up snowflake, face averted, tried to offer a woolly bear to Stephanie to give to Mary. Mary buried her face in Stephanie's womb and grunted. Daniel strode up, booted and cloaked, ludicrous and blackly angry. ""Put that child down. You'll hurt yourself."" ""No, I won't. She likes it.""  ""I don't.""  He grinned horribly at Mary across his skewed woolly mouthpiece. She cringed and began to whimper.  ""Quite right,"" said Daniel. ""Come on, Steph. We've done our duty""  ""What's wrong with you?""  He could not say, though he knew. He could have dealt with this decently without Stephanie. Now, seeing Mary's shapelessness goblin-like straddling her thick hips he wanted her and his child out of there, as though they were vulnerable to these most bizarre manifestations of the random and the destructive. But Stephanie stood there calm and healthy and said he must speak to Mrs Marriott. Mrs Marriott was a refinement of alarm. She sat all day, by the cot of her son in a cubicle. He was a pale lovely baby with a defective liver and dubious kidneys. They had tried surgery and were experimenting with dieting. The child slept, mostly, very deeply. The woman, not still by nature, moved around the cubicle re-arranging baby powder, water jug, nappies. She had lost four stones in four weeks. When she saw Daniel, shedding red and white fuzz, she said palely that she was afraid now she would lose little Stephen, it was hope that killed you, wasn't it, best not to hope, but what else could you do, sitting there? She felt so useless. He did not know and could not say: he tore off the silly beard and began a sentence about resignation, which he could not finish. He knew that what he was communicating was urgency, irritability, frustrated life and fury, wrong things here, and indeed Mrs Marriott began hopelessly, her head in a pile of clean muslin nappies, to cry. When Daniel saw his wife coming towards the cubicle to offer comfort where he couldn't he flailed his arms and drove her away, leaving Mrs Marriott to cry on, not even telling himself it was good for her to cry, since how could he know, how could he imagine? The Family Service in St Bartholomew's came later. It incorporated the Nativity Play, to which Stephanie thought she looked forward. She had helped enthusiastically with the costumes, making for Mary a trailing blue robe of cornflower taffeta, her own Cambridge May Ball dress sheared apart at the seams, lending or donating bright belts and beads to deck out the three kings, one of whom wore a peacock-feathered turban made of the shot-silk stole she had worn with that dance dress. The organ sounded. The children came into the church, half-skipping  half-marching, keeping uncertain step. A big boy and-a big girl, eleven-plus age, she stooping with embarrassment, stood at the lectern and read alternatively the brief, fairy-tale bits of Matthew and Luke. Matthew's three kings, Matthew's moving star, Luke's stable, ox, ass, shepherds and singing angels. The children mimed the tale, serious, inhibited. Blond, Danish-faced Mary sat solemnly on the chancel steps with a Joseph smaller than herself in a striped towelling bathrobe and a towel tied to his head with plaited wool. He was only too conscious that he had nothing really to do: his hands strayed from time to time above his freckled face to adjust his headgear. A diminutive innkeeper held the flats of unformed hands up to indicate that there was no room in the Inn. Smaller children and deaf grannies in the congregation twittered, as each year they twittered, like starlings on telegraph wires, urgent and aimless, look there's our Janet, look at our Ron, there, don't he look funny, lovely, dignified, daft.  ""And she brought forth her first-born child, and laid him in a manger, because there was no place for them in the inn.""  This central moment was always awkward. Now, as every year, Mary, back to the pews, bottom upended, fumbled in Mrs Ellenby's old wooden crib and brought out her best and largest doll, smiling, pouting, celluloid, with hard eyes on a metal hinge that clattered open and shut, open and shut as the wavering child righted herself, thrust it up briefly and apologetically before the congregation and pushed it back under the blankets. Owing to the permanent rigid curvature of the celluloid limbs swaddling was not possible, so the doll was swathed in someone's pretty Christening shawl. Paper-masked sheep and cows and donkeys huddled in and knelt, adjusting their heads. Three diminutive Kinglets, carrying a Kelly lamp, a silver sugar castor, Mrs Ellenby's Chinese enamelled cigarette box, bowed, wobbled, kneeled. A flock of small shepherds collected in the nave. Down the aisle came a blond choirboy, in sheet and halo, his pure voice just cracking, accompanied by a very limited multitude of the heavenly host. And on earth peace, goodwill toward men. The parents were moved in a confused way. They were moved by their own flesh and blood acting out the motions of birth and parentage with that mixture of awkwardness, ignorance, seriousness and imitation which can be observed in the necessary games of mothers and fathers. It is the childishness of Mary and Joseph that moves, nothing to do with the celluloid Babe which is always somehow  redundant in this set of emotions. Parents are moved because childhood is so swift and vanishing. They are perhaps also more darkly moved by some threat in the law of flesh and blood itself. These small creatures are the future, they are only acting out what they will be. Not only childhood vanishes: men and women, having handed on their genes, are superfluous. To watch this acting is to be marginally caught between times, between roles. Mary looks protectively at the doll: Mary's mother looks, moved and protective, at Mary's childish body and soft face. And time runs on. Herod appeared in the pulpit — he was, as always, the best actor — stamped a small foot, tossed an imperious forelock, straightened a paper crown, despatched a token army across the chancel. The slaughter of the Innocents was offstage. The large boy at the lectern read about Rachel weeping for her children, because they were not. Stephanie had in other years enjoyed this believed fairy tale: this year her own heaviness, fear perhaps of real birth, prevented her. They had a nice tea in the Rectory, with a yule log iced by Mrs Ellenby, and like good children did not receive gifts but brought them, wrapped relinquished Dinky toys and woolly animals to be redistributed to Dr Barnardo's. Daniel told them how at this time God had so loved the world that he had sent his only son to give it life, to be made just like them, so that God might live man's life and man might through him come close to God. God's life and man's life, one life, Daniel said. She thought she would have made a better job of it, not believing a word, just because she was a good teacher. What enlivened the world? Daniel himself, his restlessness, his impatience. The edge in the blond angel's cracking voice. Her belly, churning. Dark trees. Charlie, Gary, Mary. Did he who made the lamb make thee, her dark mind said, and for a moment she loved nothing and no one. She smiled and distributed cups of milk, little packages of brightly coloured Smarties, like magic beans. Her mood of hostile detachment persisted through Midnight Mass, despite the presence of old friends, Miss Wells, the Thones. Mrs Thone sang loud and clear those loud, chanting hymns which Yorkshire people enjoy, who sing the Messiah not with the abandoned full rotundity of the Welsh, but sober and strong, heavy and rhythmically marked. They came partly for the singing, the people. They sang that gloomy invocation, ""O Come, O Come, Emmanuel"" . They sang the Yorkshire ""Christians Awake"" and ""O  Come all Ye faithful"" with a mixture of respectability, sober energy and abandon which always confused Stephanie who associated the noise both with repressive habits and with unused forces finding an outlet. They stood there, still and dark and hatted in rows. The English are ugly, Stephanie thought, not for the first time. There was a preponderance of middle-aged faces, plum-coloured, ashen, pasty, pursed into a combination of too much patience, caution and suspicion. They were not outdoor faces, they were not easy faces. Nor were they suffering faces. They were the faces of people concerned predominantly either with what people thought about their behaviour, property, social standing, or with their own judgment of other people's behaviour, property, social standing. They were more uncertain than their parents had been about these things. It was a generation that had to be brave and now did not know how to be peaceful. See the hosts of Midian, prowl and prowl around. Their clothes were ugly carapaces, designed to show the quality of the cloth and be decent: wine reds, bottle greens, odd strident royal blues. She thought of D. H. Lawrence's requirement of tight white trousers and thought most of these shapeless persons would be worse his way. No good to sit under beautiful Italian trees amongst beautiful Italian peasants and inveigh petulantly against miners and respectable women. She thought instead of The Mill on the Floss, that cruel social history of English religion, locating its true centre in the Lares and Penates, a dense structure of things which defined who you were and what your relation to others was, spotted damask, sprigged china, the graduated expense and display of bonnets kept to be worshipped rather than worn. This had, and George Eliot knew it, little or even nothing to do with Christ's injunctions to his followers, and certainly nothing at all to do with the Incarnation which was now being celebrated as the congregation sang ""Unto us a Boy is Born"" as Daniel at the white-draped altar, with its lovingly embroidered white cloth, watched with Mr Ellenby over the bread and wine. George Eliot, Stephanie thought, was a good hater. She looked long and intelligently at what she hated, with curiosity to see exactly chat it was, and the necessary detachment to imagine it from within and without, these two breeding a kind of knowledge that was love. George Eliot had loved the bonnets and sprigged china — because she knew them, or because writing them down gave her power over them, made her gentle and generous to their meaning? She tried to relate this sudden vision of the things of the pieties of the Dodson  sisters to Daniel's Mum's instructions about how to cook Christmas pudding, and largely failed. Stephanie had hopes that the familial Christmas dinner might in some way restore something of the frail threadwork of decency and courteous behaviour broken by the earlier violence of her father and brother. Mrs Orton, bizarrely enough, represented the necessary public presence of an observer who might inhibit wrath, induce politeness. She would have had no such hopes in the old days, when Bill took pleasure in flouting normal expectations, seemed driven to flare up, to ""create"" as Mrs Orton might put it. He had embarrassed Stephanie forever at her own wedding. But those who ""create"" social terror are vulnerable to those who, ruthlessly or desperately, are capable of creating greater terror. Marcus had embarrassed Bill — as well as hurting him — in a way that outstripped any mischief or shock Bill had ever caused. From what Stephanie had seen of Bill lately, from what Frederica reported, his spirit was daunted, at least for a time. She did not consider, though she could and should have done, that Bill's very real affection for herself might temper any onslaught. He did not like Daniel, or her marriage, and made that clear. She worked at civility. She made Cumberland sauce to go with the turkey, translucent and clear wine-red in little pots, with fine gold strips of peel lying in it. She spent time shelling boiled chestnuts to sit amongst the traditional sprouts. She rubbed bread and herbs and made stuffing. She built little mounds of nuts, raisins and mandarins. She laid out bright scarlet napkins. She built a good wood fire. There were cut glass wine glasses on the table. Stephanie did not like cut glass: she was of the generation that discovered the plain, the functional, the Finnish, Dartington. But the lines of light glittered on the carved glassy flowers and formed a bright hazy enveloping pattern with the triangles of round mandarins, the crisscross of orange peel, Marcus's fine polyhedrons in the tree, the changing firelight itself. When they came, she saw Bill would not ""create"" . She opened the door to them, crimson-faced and breathless from basting the turkey, a butcher's apron inadequately covering a distended quaker-grey dress. He stood on the doorstep between Winifred""and Frederica and seemed so very much smaller than either tall woman that he looked to Stephanie horridly shrunk. He carried several parcels and a box of bottles.  ""My contribution,"" he said, perhaps anxiously, to his  daughter, who found it almost impossible to kiss him across the barrier made by these objects and her own girth. When she tried to take the boxes he summoned Frederica with a touch of his old asperity, and told her to make herself useful. The Potters edged their way in, nerved to meet Marcus, and saw Daniel's Mum, lapped deep in flesh and garments in the armchair, flesh overlapping flesh as her chin folded over her folded neck. Marcus was not there. They took chairs — a little too close, the circle, for elegance in the small space. Stephanie offered sherry. A voice spoke. ""Please excuse me if I don't get up. Truth is, I can't, wi'out help. I can just about get down here of a morning and then I'm stuck until someone gives me a' and up, which they don't want to be doing too often, do they dear?""  ""I'm still strong enough for a tug,"" said Stephanie, too brightly. ""And how are you keeping, Mrs Potter? Bearing up, despite troubles? As long as you've got your health, I always say…"" Winifred said she was well and looked at Stephanie, sitting near the kitchen. Stephanie she thought did not look well. The gloss had gone from the blond hair, the face was sharper, however the cheeks were flushed and the body swollen. There were lines round the sharpened nose and indigo shadows round the eyes. And not much colour in the lips.  ""How are you?"" she asked her daughter cautiously.  ""Thriving,"" said Mrs Orton. ""The amount the young can do nowadays — now when I was carrying Dan I was not able to get up for days together, me ankles swoll so, and I 'ad dizzy spells, something terrible, but she still gets around on that bike, perky as Punch. You'll do yourself an injury, I say, but she knows best no doubt for there isn't a day but she's off for some long trip or other on the thing. One day last week we 'ad to get us own lunch, me young See-all-hear-all-say-nowt upstairs, and then I had to bellow to get him down t'elp or I'd 'ave been stuck 'ere in this chair wi'out a sup or bite from dawn to dusk and beyond. But 'e made a bit o' Welsh rarebit after some coaxing. 'E's not as incapable as 'e looks, I've come to 't conclusion."" Briefly, no Potter could speak. Fortunately at this point Daniel came in, humming, from Morning Prayer, taking up too much space, wishing everyone ""Happy Christmas"" in a clerical boom. He took in Marcus's absence, went upstairs and came down with the pale boy behind him. Marcus stood on the bottom step. Bill stood up and  faced his son. Daniel's Mum issued a disregarded injunction to sit down, do. Bill took two steps forwards and very formally held out his hand. Marcus, limply, but for a perfectly decent period, took it as it was offered, and then moved on to lay a cold cheek against his mother's. Through Stephanie's mind ran an image of a huge rent, in sail canvas or something like it, being stitched with large, clumsy, visible stitches, but stitched. The next thing was the mutual offering of presents, which she proposed. The presents were curiously uniform. Marcus received several anonymous shirts and socks. Daniel too was given garments, some he might wear and some he wouldn't, socks, scarf, tie, all of them not black, as though the company had made a preconcerted attempt to cheer him up. Stephanie had miscellaneous pieces of kitchen equipment and bedlinen: not a book: although Frederica had all books if you included a book token from Mrs Orton. Bill had books, and tobacco, and a book token from Marcus with a Brueghel snowscene reproduced on the front, which he turned over several times as though it must contain some message other than""Happy Christmas, love Marcus' written neatly on the dotted line. Stephanie went back into the kitchen to dish up. Daniel adeptly and too obviously converted a reminiscence of his Mum's about a joint of pork she had once cooked into a general conversation about Christmases past. They remembered wartime making-do. They discussed the new turkey farms. Bill borrowed a corkscrew and opened some bottles of Beaujolais he had brought. Sentence by meaningless sentence they held the occasion together. In the kitchen, Stephanie struggled with the turkey, bloated and slithering in its fatty dish. Her face glistened with heat and effort. She suffered from an excess of exact imagination. They weighed on her. In all of them some private violence pulled against prescribed behaviour. Bill most. If public medical statements have been made about a man's deleterious effect on his son's psyche there is bound to be anxiety and embarrassment attendant on their meeting. On the other hand, there was the infinite English capacity for underplaying dramas, ignoring situations, pretending things were normal. Bill had had his own small share of this sometimes useful refusal to recognise awkward truths, particularly where Marcus was concerned. And there was Winifred, who had tried to teach her son her own form of passive resistance to Bill's rage and had only, perhaps she now thought, exposed him to a homosexual religious maniac. She had  once told Stephanie, whom she trusted, though it did not come easily to her to make confidences to her daughters, that she was possessed by physical loathing of Lucas Simmonds and of what contact — she was not specific — he might have had with her son.  ""I wanted to vomit,"" she had said sharply to Stephanie.  ""Indeed I have vomited.""  Stephanie did not know how far this revulsion might perhaps include Marcus himself. Marcus found large areas of the world untouchable: Winifred brought herself to make contact with them with difficulty. Stephanie could feel Frederica's tolerant and arrogant knowledge that she, Frederica, was now tangential to all this. She could feel Mrs Orton wanting to be noticed, desiring to be liked, preventing these things. And there was Daniel, who was unhappy or angry, she did not know why. She could hear him being professionally cheerful, caricaturing himself and the Cloth, as he did, under stress. She felt every housewife's fury when the guests could not be got to table and the food was ready. She felt irritable, tearful, contemned. She carried in sprouts and potatoes and smiled and smiled. The food was eaten. Chewing took over from talking. Daniel sliced the bird's plump breast and pulled tendons out of the lopped legs, fished for stuffing with a long spoon. Marcus caused the first flurry by refusing meat. He did not say, but looked, that the sight of it made him feel sick. Mild Stephanie felt momentary pure rage at his rejection of her good gravy, her dedicated basting, her care. Mrs Orton took it upon herself, watching him pick at a little heap of sprouts and chestnut, to observe that he had very likely made himself ill with being faddy. It was Frederica who retorted ""Plenty of protein in chestnuts"" and took another helping for herself. They all got hotter and redder and shinier and fatter. When Mrs Orton proposed that they listen to the Queen's Speech on the radio, Bill's only protest was to produce a bottle of brandy from his case, open one of his gift books, roll himself a cigarette with gift tobacco, lean back and stare covertly at his son. Who had his eyes closed in an expressionless face but was still present, in his chair. No, Stephanie thought later, it had been no more and no less than could have been hoped: a reasonable coming together of people close to each other, not by choice, reluctant in many cases. Nevertheless it had, from the first glass of sherry to the momentary blue veil of flame on the  pudding, been what she would have called civilised. They had behaved well. Daniel was unhappy. Stephanie did not understand Daniel's unhappiness because, quick about his attitudes to churchwardens, shirt buttons, Bill's fury, the Ellenbys' lazy matter-of-course snobbery, she was unable to catch the shifts of his feelings about herself, or now, about the two of them. She had her arrogance: she did not believe he had fully imagined her physical battle with the turkey, her anger, and shame at her anger, over Marcus's vegetarian gesture. Daniel had in fact imagined all these, and had also adequately encompassed her relief that small talk and eating were proceeding. He knew a lot about English ways of ""not speaking"" . There was more than one couple in his parish who had communicated for years only by note or through neighbours. And beyond married couples there were siblings, parents, children who froze speech forever, from revenge, terror, hopelessness, small hardened stubbornness. He knew what it meant that Marcus should stay in the room whilst Bill managed for three consecutive hours to make a series of acceptably banal factual observations. But he was not happy. He thought, he had wanted her, Stephanie. Not a Home. Just her. He wished now he had not given her what he believed to be a very beautiful nightdress, creamy and ruffled: he had seen her look at Frederica's books and had understood what he had half-sensed on the occasion of Frederica's telegrams, her sense of loss. He had his own sense of loss: the grim singleness of himself and his job alone in an anonymous bedsitter. He looked at them all. There were three kinds. The pale Potters, the vanishers: Winifred, Stephanie, Marcus, who effaced themselves too quickly. The flaming Potters, Bill and Frederica, today out-talked by his mother, but capable of endless egocentric parabolas of speech. And he and his mother, heavy, flesh and blood. His Mum was a horrible nuisance, no question. And ate and ate and ate: everyone had watched her guzzle, blank pale Potters, bird-like, judging, flaming Potters, fastidious Marcus with his bits of greens dissected and rejected. His child had the weight of all this on it. If it was not born like hospital Mary, it could be genetically fated to resemble his Mum, or Marcus, or the awful Frederica. Flesh of these fleshes and blood of these bloods. He considered the mothers round the table with an almost  superstitious wariness. His own, now saccharine and anecdotal about the good old days of his childhood, when he had in fact eaten pilchards with a fork out of a tin in silence, day after day, whilst she slept. Winifred, washed-away and thinned-down by a lifetime of self-effacement and subordination to these ferocious, pale or fuming creatures. Stephanie, double, self-contained, so egg-inviolate that Charlie did not frighten her nor Mary shake her calm assurance. What would become of her, of him, of his child? He felt the mothers and the family, as in a different way he felt the hospital children, as a threat. He told Stephanie to put her feet up and went into the kitchen for solitude, where he began purposefully on the dishes. He was joined, which annoyed him, by Frederica. Who had, among other disqualifications, no turn of speed with a tea-towel. She used it initially to fan her face with. She said.  ""Well, that went off O.K.""   ""Yes.""  ""Nice to be out in the cool though. Air. I can't bear somnolent groups of people."" Neither could he. He remarked however that there was little to choose between kitchen and living-room in respect of air, since the oven had been on since dawn. He handed her a dripping plate. ""Good practice. I'm going in a week or two. To be a Mother's Helper. Not my forte but a mother's helper in French, at least.""  ""Very nice.""  ""I have wondered if I ought to leave Mummy. She's in a grim state. I don't think she finds me much use. Tells Steph things, not me. I'm unnecessary. Just as well for me. I've got to get moving.""  ""Yes.""  ""You don't like me much. I've noticed. I didn't for a long time, I was only interested in whether I liked you. And when I decided I did, I noticed you didn't like me."" He handed her another plate.  ""I don't spend much time thinking about liking or not liking,"" he said. ""No. But you can do it, without thinking about it. I hope you get to like me. I mean, we shall know each other all our lives. Though I hope we don't go on having family Christmases. I long to be with people I've chosen. Are you afraid of defeat?""  ""What?""  ""Well — you go on — like a bulldozer — like me. Aren't you afraid of  being the other sort — the sort that stops and suffers?""  ""Everyone has to be that.""  ""No — look — some people aren't defeated. Some are. Look at the people in this house. You aren't defeated.""  ""No?"" he said, passing another plate, and regretted it. ""Daniel. You don't feel weighed down — too?"" ""No, no. No more than is inevitable, and manageable. You're young enough to be dramatic about everything.""  ""And how old are you, so wise?""  He was twenty-four. He laughed.  ""You should get Marcus out of your house,"" she said, rattling a handful of cutlery  ""He's unobtrusive.""  ""Is he? I hadn't noticed. He's an energy-absorber, like shock-absorbers in cars or astronomical anti-matter. Since Daniel agreed with this he was reduced to silence. Frederica studied him as he dealt with the roasting-pans. His waist was huge over the sink: his arms black and hairy below rolled-up sleeves: the mass of his black hair ruffled by effort. The back view of a large man in a small space at the wrong height. She did wish he liked her. But she did not care greatly. Her mind was full of the future which presented itself as a bright empty space crossed by tracks of her own shining, clear-cut flights, her passage swift and sunlit. There was going to be very little room in Frederica Potter's life from now on for this imposed world of people and chairs you had to have because they were there. It might be all right for Daniel: his purposes possibly included its transfiguration or consecration or whatever words from whatever language he chose to describe it in. But she rejected. She dropped, and broke, one of Stephanie's wedding-present wine glasses. Daniel swept up the fragments."
FIC FIC-FET-005 5.19 "4. Midi When Frederica left for Nîmes she had no real idea of the South. She knew that Nîmes was a provincial city and would have preferred it not to be, seeing ""provincial"" in terms of the English nineteenth century novel, not of the Roman Provincia, Provence. Drifting citywards in her generation, she had really hoped for Paris and bright  lights. She had booked a sleeper from Paris in terms of time — ""I can't sit up all night"" — not distance ""I am going a long way south.""  When she boarded this train she became involved in an altercation with the sleeping-car attendant, which she enjoyed, because it was in French, and she was able to use her subjunctives and conditionals, and say ""si"" instead of ""oui"" at appropriate moments. She lost the argument, which was about her reservation, which was for berth No. 7 in English which the conductor obstinately read as 1 in French. Frederica explained that in France the 7 is crossed but that this is not done in Thomas Cook's in Calverley, N. Yorkshire. The attendant said there was a gentleman already undressing in No. 1 Frederica received no answer to her question about numéro sept, but was given permission to stand in the corridor of the train, which was already sliding away from its platform. She watched Paris rattle past, foreign blocks of lit windows, knots of wire, and she was offered a Gauloise by a compact little man who leaned his elbow companionably against hers on the window-rail. She accepted the cigarette as she accepted most offerings, and still elated at the sound of her French being understood and responded to by Frenchmen, volunteered the information that she was going to Nîmes, to stay with a family. She would have told him much more, all sorts of improper things, only to hear the old information newly proposed in new words. She would be lucky, the man told her, to see the South in spring. The maquis smells wonderful. For the first time Frederica's imagination touched at the South. He was going to St Raphael himself, the man said. He was a traveller. He sold liqueurs, mostly to the hotel industry. He could offer mademoiselle a taste of Cointreau, Grand Marnier, Chartreuse, if she really had no berth. Frederica replied brightly that would be very agreeable. This was despite a strong sense that the man was unduly anxious about the outcome of his overture: anxiety is a great destroyer of response, and Frederica had no taste for being closed in a sleeping compartment with a worried man. On the other hand she did not want to stand until dawn, and she did want the French words to go on being threaded together. The sleeping-car attendant came back and announced that by great good fortune he had an empty berth for which the occupant had unaccountably not appeared. He ushered Frederica into No. 7, and stood, perhaps awaiting a tip, which she was unable to offer, being provided only with notes of large denominations. This caused her to close herself abruptly in, without  the traveller in liqueurs. And then she was delighted by the solitude of the sleeping-car, and forgot him. She undressed partly and padded about the perpetually shifting floor in stocking feet, suspenders, slip and bra. She investigated ring hooks, water flask, lidded washbasin. She tried to peer out of the peephole in her blind. A station clashed by so fast she could neither read its name or discern the pattern of its ironwork. Black masses of bush, or bull, or thatch elongated themselves howling. She liked that. She liked to be alone in a warm, lit box with the world streaming darkly by. She curled on her bunk, admired her long legs, thought about desire (not for the traveller in liqueurs), read part of Madame Bovary, part of Les Fleurs du Hal and all of a novel by Margery Sharp, bought on impulse at the Gare de Lyon. She saw the dawn when it came and pulled up the blind. There in the pale lemon grey were expanses of espaliered rows of strange stumps like truncated Virginia creepers, squat and tough. These large spaces did not rush past but seemed endless because endlessly repeated. Understanding took time. Vines in her mind trailed over trellises, depended from arbours, clung. Round these orderly gnarled wooden roots the cold soil heated almost visibly as the incredible bright dawn advanced. She dressed carefully, green herring-bone tweed suit, pinch-waisted, court shoes, very plain, and a complicated face, the tricky little eyeliner triangles at the lid-corners almost smudged by the swaying train. She had a sort of velvet cap, from which she had snipped a bit of veiling. She believed cheap clothes could be made elegant by paring them down to essentials. Sometimes this worked, sometimes she looked tarty, sometimes she looked drab. On that morning, descending the steel ladder onto the sandy Nîmes siding in two-inch heels and an inverted tulip skirt, she looked all these things. The Grimaud family had written to say that they would meet her with a blue Corvette. It was only at this late stage that she began to think about them; they had been a means to an end, Frederica Potter's removal from Blesford and Yorkshire. A large man and a small boy appeared at the other end of the platform: she hobbled on her heels, humping her heavy suitcase, towards them. They greeted her and introduced themselves — Monsieur Grimaud and Paul-Marie. Paul-Marie had un-English shorts, long white socks, olive-brown legs. Frederica ignored him. M. Grimaud swung up her bag, smiling. He had a wide waistline, iron-grey hair en brosse, a tanned face with  smile-lines set round the mouth, a signet ring, gold serpent coiled round bloodstone. He was at ease in his skin. He asked about her journey, and sitting beside him in the car she recounted the mix-up over the sleeper numbers, enjoying, still, hearing herself speak French. M. Grimaud laughed. He swung the car out into Nîmes and beyond Nîmes into the countryside, straight roads with plane trees, cultivated wild land right and left. M. Grimaud explained everything easily, with a French educational fervour and a local passion which Frederica was too culturally inexperienced — and too confused — to place. The lovely light, as they travelled, grew and grew. The fields here, M. Grimaud said, were fields of lavender, a major Provincial industry. Here she was in the land of the Langue d'Oc which must be distinguished from the Langue d'Oil. He spoke of troubadours and ancient lords and sang, unembarrassed and unaffected, snatches of song about lavender, about almond trees, about love, in incomprehensible Proven-am. Frederica saw the long ridges of dusty grey-green lavender leaves and imagined violet spikes. She saw unshadowed earth in yellow light, more vines, new shoots of what she did not recognise as young maize. Later, travelling knowledgeably south at thirty, at forty, full of accrued wisdom about good little places, local food and wine, Cafes Routiers and long-vanished sand dunes she tried to remember the surprises, only half-experienced that day, of that land to her unexpecting eyes. It had seemed, because she was, raw and new, dust and brightness. And the smells, the beginning of the smells of the south, more immediately apprehensible, more durable in the memory, at least when re-evoked. Herbs in rough places, juniper, rosemary and thyme, which she would have named but not identified, oregano which she could not even have named. They approached the propriété along an avenue lined with limes — tilleuls, a word, a name, already in her vocabulary, but now suddenly associated with a solid form and gusts of fragrance. M. Grimaud discoursed on the making of tisanes, and made obscure references to Marcel Proust. Tisane, like tilleul, was in Frederica's vocabulary, the word, not the thing, but it was some time yet before she would understand their connection with Proust, who had entered her consciousness largely through a striking nightmare, dreamed the night before her Oxford entrance examination, which she recalled, as M. Grimaud talked and the scented trees brushed past. In this dream she had been locked into the school library with an exam paper containing one question and one only: Compare and  contrast narrative method in Proust and Tom Jones. She knew nothing about either and in the dream wept bitterly from shame and impotence. When she woke she was further annoyed at having dreamed a category confusion, a man and a book, not realising that the category error was partly the answer to the uncouth question, since Proust was coterminous with a book as the eponymous Tom Jones was not. She was never to think of that dream without some of its investing emotions, shame and irritation, even after a man at a party in 1969 had told her such dreams are dreamed typically by those unlikely to fail plausible and real exams. Then, in 1954, as the car passed under what seemed a mediaeval or Renaissance courtyard gate there was Frederica, brooding grimly about a personal failure in a dreamed, unreal competition. In later years, say 1964, 1974, 1984, the first vision of Nozières took on its perfection and primacy, as it is only after the mind has cleared itself of the flow of daily preoccupation, planning, expectation, that the moment of a death can be known for what it is, and one's life mapped, prospectively and retrospectively, to that threshold. The yard was walled in gold stone covered with clean dust and lichen-stains. Hens ran, calling. Madame Grimaud, short and trim with a well-managed waist, solid hips and strictly upswept smooth black hair, stood on the doorstep with two cross-looking and awkward teenage daughters, to whom Frederica was to be required to converse. Mediterranean women in black dresses — Frederica's first sight of these — moved around and behind this group. There was a lot of formal handshaking and Frederica, directed in part by the nature of the language, spoke several formal French sentences of graceful gratitude. Inside, at a huge oak table in a stone dining-hall, dark-walled and tiled, she was given a bowl of hot chocolate, a huge piece of French bread, unsalted butter (again the first) and confiture aux cerises. She was conducted up flights of stone stairs with wrought-iron balustrades to her huge room, whose walls were painted a bright dark blue — a colour which reminded her of a postcard of Van Gogh's ""Starry Night"" , and even more of the colour behind the fleurs de lys on the banners in Olivier's film of Henry V. Its powdery darkness amazed her: no English room was ever dark blue: maybe this was more like Reckitt's blue? The floor was faded blue and tawny tiles. The bed was high, high and curtained, covered with lace and bobbled crocheted cotton. There was a wash hand-stand with ewer, slop bucket and china washbasin. The room was twice the size of the sitting-room at home in Masters  Row at Blesford. There was neither writing-table nor desk, though there was a whole set of heavy, yellow-painted bedroom furniture, wardrobe, cupboard, chest. It was alien. It was interesting. She was excited by so many strange things. She was also exhausted. And, to her horror, briefly homesick for carpets, bookcases, small casement windows, man-made heating devices, the familiar, the known. Later, at least for many years, she was not to see this time as part of her life, and perhaps therefore it need not now be told at length. Frederica's recall of things seen was very much less lucid and automatic than those of Stephanie or even Marcus. Her mind was self-referring and exclusive as theirs were not — impersonal only in relation to the teasing-out of the intellectually taxing problem. In the 1970s Ezra Pound's laminated view of vital and moribund cultures, centred partly on Provence, made her see M. Grimaud's easy educating communications about the land, the lore, the language in which she found herself, as a sign of real energy in his community which had been ersatz, or only wished-for, in post-Festival of Britain Yorkshire. Bill Potter had his local pride: his evening class students collected local words, described patterns of social behaviour and family interrelationship with a kind of Fabian zeal, but without the sun-saturated liveliness of M. Grimaud's sense of what was shared and perpetual in his world. This family, which was not her own, which threw her own, absent and dispersed, into sharp relief, was certainly kind. M. Grimaud was captain of a ship that ran between Marseille and Tunis. He was away for weeks at a time and would return laden with gigots of Algerian lamb, jars of oil, sacks of pulses; Madame ran the propriété, which was large, and not labour-intensive (words that entered Frederica's vocabulary ca. 1960). There were hectares of vineyards — she never knew how many — and orchards of peaches, cherries, melons. There was at least a sufficiency of migrant Italian house and garden servants, who rendered any conventional mother's help more than redundant. Frederica, who did not even make her own bed, acquired one or two odd skills. She learned to cut asparagus daily, in the wide, ridged, humped beds outside the golden walls, spying out newly poking purple heads, slicing, with a gritty sharp knife, just under the soil. She also learned to assist in the preparation of foods she believed herself, in 1954, to dislike: aïoli, estouffade de boeuf, kid stewed with wine, tomatoes and garlic, potage de legumes hand-wound through a  Mouli, dressed salads made with unknown leaves and fronds, crimson, cream-white, spinach-dark, curly pale green. She turned the handle of the spit when the Algerian gigots were roasted, larded with garlic and anchovies, in a kind of oval cage of iron slats in front of a hot fire of vine-stumps inside the huge hearth; she sat on a bench inside the cheminée, turning the ratchet as it wound down, basting the lamb with oil and its own juices from a diabolical long spoon. Her one apparent asset, her good French, turned out to be a disadvantage. Marie-Claire and Monique learned little English because Frederica intimidated them and they intimidated her. She rewrote their homework in respectable English but appeared, at that time, not to have inherited the family teaching compulsion, and was unable to explain the principle by which she was altering their grammar and syntax. Thus, although their marks improved, the two girls were not learning. Only much later did it occur to her that this was her failure: academically self-sufficient and wholly self-centred she saw their sullenness and ignorance as their concern and their fault. Madame Grimaud treated all this with brisk courtesy, remarking on one occasion that it could at least be said that Frederica was a good moral influence. Frederica saw this observation at the time as a mark of signal failure of insight. Later, in England, it occurred to her that it might have been said ironically, but by then she had forgotten the context and intonation of it, could only remember that it was said under hot sun outside the Maison Carrée in Nîmes, where the air was fluent and the stones shone. They made courteous and persistent attempts to amuse her. On the second day they gave her a rubber ball attached on a long elastic thread to a wooden bat. She stood in the courtyard, solemnly playing, seventeen, sex-starved, muscle-bound, an intellectual shark, at Jokari. She was no good at this. The domestiques and Madame Grimaud observed her failure solemnly from doors and windows as they moved about their household works. Frederica was put in mind, mutatis mutandis, starting with the intention, of Miss Havisham bidding the boy Pip to play, of the brewery yard where he had met Herbert Pocket, which (the yard) irked her, because she could not properly visualise it. She was taken everywhere. To the covered fish market at dawn to buy fish for a bouillabaisse, which held no romance for her for she had not then read Ford's description of the great bouillabaisse in the Calanques, nor Elizabeth David's description of the colours and  patterns of fish on the stalls. She went to the dressmaker with Madame Grimaud, where there was a stocky replica, adjustable, of Madame Grimaud's female French form standing headless on a metal leg. Everyone knew everyone and stopped to speak to everyone. She thought she remembered lovebirds at the dressmaker, and did remember dark coffee and langues de chat. The lovebirds in her mind fused into a watching parrot, perhaps made by the metal leg. She visited neighbouring propriétés and sipped aperitifs from unlabelled bottles, white port on terraces, in arbours trailing wisteria, under acacia trees. In two of these families there were young men, sons and heirs who would inherit the land, unspeaking grave Michel, noisy Dany with one word of English — ""bluejeans"" — and an explosive Lambretta churning up pale, clean dust. She had ideas about these two, especially about Michel, but saw that to them she was invisible, not quite real, as au pair girls frequently, perhaps usually, are. She spoke a lot, and they turned and congratulated each other on her French, as though she was some sort of barrel-organ she thought, being not only sex-starved but starved also of admiration. When Monsieur was at home, more cultural and purposeful expeditions were undertaken. They went to a floodlit performance of Mireille in the Roman arena in Nîmes. In the same place, one day, Frederica saw bullfighting. She had hoped to understand the aesthetic excitement of this pursuit, to see and recognise the ""moment of truth"" even if she must simultaneously be revolted. But all she saw was slow, repeated, stumbling, coughing killings at which she retched in a very conventional English animal-loving way, which upset Monsieur Grimaud, who was an aficionado, and had been lecturing Frederica on the provenance and meaning of that word. The place suddenly had its history of bloodletting to be sniffed, and yet even that was not exciting, maybe because the Nîmois did not roar for blood as the Romans had, but sunned themselves and discussed finer points of capework. They did, it was true, have an agitated fit of booing and hissing, but this was, M. Grimaud explained, an expression of spontaneous disapproval of Picasso who could just be made out, small brown face under black beret at the other side of the arena. The crowd, M. Grimaud stated, thought his art was fraudulent and Frederica, trying in vain to imagine any English football crowd holding any communal view about any modern artist, suddenly remembered the Picasso prints on the walls of Alexander Wedderburn's study in Blesford Ride School. She had been in love with  Alexander. Here, distant from home and muddle, she was sure she was still in love with Alexander. She had made, circumstances had made, rather a mess of this love. She did not think he would like to hear from her, or possibly even to think about her. His Picassos had been Blue Period, the Saltimbanques, a strange Boy with a Pipe, crowned with flowers. It was odd to sit here, so far away, in sun and shouting, and see the small dark and light rounds of the face of the man who had made those images. His lines are very economical, she said to M. Grimaud, who looked solidly startled at this view and spoke dismissively of women with three breasts, or single eyes, paintings more infantile than those of Cromagnon man. Moreover, he said, Picasso had discovered and ruined the traditional potteries at Vallauris which now turned out only nasty ash-trays with distorted bulls and gross doves. He has killed the tradition he loved, M. Grimaud said with contempt. Frederica thought he was being philistine and was later to learn that he was being simply truthful. The drawings of bullfights, however, have real merit, M. Grimaud assured her, which silenced her, since she didn't know the drawings and was sick of the bullfight. Afterwards bleeding bull steaks hung from hooks in butchers' windows, or lay overlapping on white plates. The Grimaud family purchased and cooked many of these — it was customary, Frederica was told. Frederica gagged on hers, nauseated by a memory of the foundering black body as the life left the legs, of the crawling sheet of sticky blood over the shoulder under the pics, of trailing hooves and horns dragged over sawdust. She was later to discover that a certain J. Olivier believed that Vincent Van Gogh's self-mutilation in Arles was an aspect of some bull-ritual. The victorious matador, he said, was awarded the ear of the bull, which he would offer ""to his Lady or to a female spectator who has drawn his attention"" . (No ears were awarded on the day of Frederica's visit to the corrida.) So, J. Olivier argues, Van Gogh, vanquished and vanquisher both, cut off his own ear after the altercation with Gauguin and presented it, in his own honour, to the lady, the Arles whore. The vignoble produced a reasonable vin rose which she drank like water every lunchtime. Unlike Marie-Claire, Monique and Paul-Marie, she did not add water, believing it to be childish or in doubtful taste to dilute good wine. The result was burning headaches, dizzy spells and prolonged periods of lassitude which the Grimauds, courteous as always, ascribed to the mistral, to heat, to unaccustomed diet. They may have been glad, since she was turning out to be hard to amuse, that she slept deeply in the early afternoons. There were no books. M. Grimaud told her how Nîmes had been settled by the veterans of Octavius's victory over Antony and Cleopatra, whose names, Antonin, Numa, Flavien, Adrien, persisted, even today, as did the emblem of the defeat of the serpent of old Nile, the Nîmes chained crocodile. He took her to Uzès where Racine had once come to ruralise, contemplate the priesthood, began to write. Uzès was and is a town out of another time, a yellow town on a gently conical hill, geometrical roof on roof, a town that must have been as it now is when Shakespeare wrote Antony and Cleopatra. Frederica tried to talk to M. Grimaud about Racine but, although he could quote several speeches, he was more interested in what Racine was and meant than in what he had written. He had a Racine, a Molière, a Chateaubriand. Frederica borrowed also Hemingway in translation, and read about bullfights and the earth moving, which caused her to feel worse, sex-starved, desperate for life, and love, and action. She also developed a need for the English language. Madame took her to the City Library in Nîmes, a gaunt, dark building with high shutters behind grilles and dusty leather books, ceiling high. There was not much in English: she borrowed the complete works of Tobias Smollett. These were not what she was hungry for, but they were English, and narrative. Narrative is one of the best intoxicants or tranquillisers. They were at least long. Madame then thought of the vélo. On this Frederica explored the unvarying hot flat country. She bumped along furrows between vines, spattered cobalt-blue with spraying. She listened to cicadas and breathed the pervasive liquorice which grew locally and was processed in a factory on the Nîmes road. Whenever she fell off the vélo she sat where she was, nodding, fumed with wine and drowsy with heat, in a classical furrow, under a pale, bright sky. She decided to become a writer. It was almost inevitable, given the excessive respect paid in the Potter house to the written word, and given Frederica's own mastery of, and intense pleasure in, the school essay, that she should decide to become a writer. Foreign places, moreover, bring out the writer in strangers less word obsessed than Frederica Potter. I do not think the compulsion to write about foreign places can be very closely compared to a painter's  sensuous delight in new light, new forms, new colours, Monet seeing the Cap d'Antibes in blue and rose, Turner seeing the bright watery Venetian light in Venice, Gauguin in Tahiti. Pigment is pigment and light is light in any culture. But words, acquired slowly over a lifetime, are part of a different set of perceptions of the world, they have grown with us, they restrict what we see and how we see it. I am trying to account for the paradox of the sameness of so many accounts, in language, of the strange, the exotic, the new. Frederica will do as an example to illustrate the difficulties of writing about strangeness. She wanted to set down the southern landscape. Her tradition of looking at landscape was deeply Wordsworthian, whatever intimations she may have had that Wordsworth's language was for his time and place only. Frederica could, in the Lake District, have seen a ""Wordsworthian"" tarn and been able to render it in Wordsworthian words, and, because these words were known, tested, thought about, she could have introduced minute changes, have seen one little thing he hadn't seen, changed the point of view. There are shepherds in the Andes who have over sixty words for the colour brown in the coats of sheep. But they are shepherds in the Andes. Frederica had words for tea party behaviour and shopping discriminations in North Yorkshire matrons. She had a variety of words, and was adding to them, for the structure of a Shakespearean plot or metaphor. She saw these new things, paradoxically, in old cliches. The same Wordsworth, much-mocked, thought himself back to an innocent vision, told us that grass is green and water wet because he had reached beyond familiarity to some primal wonder that these things were so and not otherwise, to some mythic sense that he was giving or finding the words for the things, not merely repeating. So also Daniel, walking with Stephanie on Filey beach, had suddenly, out of some metaphorical experience as bodily as breathing, known why love was called ""sweet"" and, as his blood banged, why a beloved was a ""sweet heart"" . So now, more mildly, Frederica saw for the first time that the light was gold, that olives were black and warm, the olive trees were powdery-grey, that lavender was a purple haze. But when she saw these things written they seemed, and were, stale, deja-vu, derivative. Frederica was also enough a child of her time to suppose that what she should write should be fiction.  ""The novel is the one bright book of life,"" Lawrence had didactically exclaimed and Bill Potter had  didactically reiterated.  ""The novel is the highest form of human expression yet attained.""  If anyone had challenged Frederica directly as to whether she believed that, she would have argued the toss. But — however Wordsworthian the roots — in the 1950s the recording compulsion took Lawrentian forms. And she had no plot. Or did not recognise those plots she had. And was not primarily in those days concerned with invention. She tried to utilise Dany and his Lambretta or a speechless Michel, and disgusted herself. She was driven back to Alexander, and attempted unsuccessfully to translate that very English poet into a divinity of the olive groves. All that happened was that her sexual needs became painful instead of grumbling and Alexander became unreal in her mind in a bad way. She tried a diary, but it reiterated circuitously and boringly that Frederica Potter was bored and also, to her shame, homesick. She could not see how to see Marie-Claire and Monique, Paul-Marie and Madame, let alone the workings of the wine co-operative, the réglisserie or Protestant Nîmes. She was a good critic, despite her egocentricity, and decided briskly and miserably that writing was not her métier. So she gave up, and sat between the vines in the hot sun, alternately sleeping and working her way through the dusty volumes of Peregrine Pickle, bound in crimson and gold leather, with real bookworms making agitated forays from their dark crannies into the heat and light across the extraordinary scenes where Smollett's elderly ladies retained their urine indefinitely to put out putative fires, or sweetened their foul breaths with violet cachous to deceive desired young lovers. She did not ask herself then under what compulsion he had made his plots or constructed his worlds; she accepted them as one accepts fairy tales in childhood. And Vincent Van Gogh? Provence is as he painted it, we use his images as icons by which to recognise certain things, the cypresses above all, the olives, some configurations of rock and vegetation, the line of the Alpilles, the plain of the Crau, the light itself. He came, as Frederica did not, with precise aesthetic expectations. He expected to see ""Japanese"" subjects, the colours of Monticelli, the forms of Cezanne and Renoir, the southern light lauded by Gauguin as a mystic necessity. He saw all these things, as he expected them. He saw also Dutch things in the French heat, bridges not formally different from those in Delft and Leyden, colours in the glare that  reminded him primarily of the soft blues and yellows of Vermeer. Also, and simultaneously, he saw what no one had yet seen, what was his to see. Sunflowers, cypresses, olives. My dear Theo, I wrote to you already early this morning, then I went away to go on with a picture of a garden in the sunshine. Then I brought it back and went out again with a blank canvas and that also is finished. And now I write to you again. Because I have never had such a chance, nature here being so extraordinarily beautiful. Everywhere and all over the vault of heaven is a marvellous blue, and the sun sheds a radiance of pale sulphur, and it is soft and lovely as the combination of heavenly blues and yellows in a Van der Meer of Delft [sic]. I cannot paint it as beautifully as that, but it absorbs me so much that I let myself go, never thinking of a single rule… Here under a stronger sun, I have found what Pissarro said confirmed, and also what Gauguin wrote to me, the simplicity, the fading of the colours, the gravity of great sunlight effects. You never come near to suspecting it in the North."
FIC FIC-FET-006 3.96 "5. Mas Rose. Mas Cabestainh Mas Rose In the early summer the family went to its summer house, a small pink-washed mas on a hillside in the Basses-Alpes, not far from Mont Ventoux. They took their spiky, useless English girl with them, offering culture, the Côte d'Azur, the Camargue. They took her to the Palais des Papes in Avignon where, on a warm evening, they saw a floodlit trench production of Macbeth, the Théâtre Nationale Populaire, with Jean Vilar, drawn and romantic, more damned troubadour than Scots butcher, and Maria Casares, whitely elegant and frenzied, washing blood from her hands whilst angelic trumpets shrilled from high battlements. Everything rushed forward in strange, denuded fast prose.  ""Demain et demain et demain.""  In the interval Frederica became useful for once, and recited to the bored young Grimauds as much as she could remember — and it was a great deal — of the thick, incomprehensible English verse. This brought an access of homesickness, not for the Yorkshire moors but  for the English language, and also for the long days of last summer's play, for Alexander Wedderburn's blown-rose full-blooded verse on the Elizabethan terrace at Long Royston, English summer evenings. As she was telling the shuffling Grimauds that light thickens, and the crow makes wing to the rooky wood, a voice cried above her from the high scaffolding. ""I know that voice. Young Potter. I will not act or suffer at the sword's edge — Not that — I will not bleed — my dear, do you remember?"" This sound was both welcome, and a blow beneath, very strictly beneath, the belt. It was Edmund Wilkie, polymath, to whom in the unlikely Edwardian luxe of the Grand Hotel in Scarborough she had most bloodily surrendered her virginity. ""Wilkie. I can't see in the dark. Where are you? What are you doing here? Excusez-moi, Madame, c'est un ami, un ami demon pays…"" Wilkie wriggled into the seat beside her. Here in the Palais des Papes, as at Long Royston, the audience was on tiers of scaffolding. They had sat together on the other scaffolding and watched the Graces dance. Wilkie was the same. Soft, dark, animal plump, exaggerated goggle-glasses, a raffish academic. ""Monsieur Grimaud. Madame. Edmund Wilkie. Un ami, un étudiant de psychologie, un acteur. Wilkie, what are you doing?"" ""What are you, is more to the point. I'm staying with Crowe at the Mas Cabestainh. Crowe's French residence. Very pretty. Lots of nice people. You've gone all brown and peeling in patches, like a plane tree. Having an exciting time?"" ""I'm an au pair girl. Everyone is very good to me. We're staying near Vaison-la-Romaine."" ""Not far. We could meet. Lots of old friends at Mas Cabestainh. The girl, the beauty, Anthea Whatsit.""  ""Warburton.""  ""Yes, her. And Wedderburn. Elevated to producing radio talks. I expect you knew.""  ""I'd heard.""  She was put out. The row of Grimauds, wanting not this chatter but Shakespeare, value for money at last, was inhibiting. She managed,  ""Is he well?""  ""Oh Frederica. You great fool. He came to see this play last week. Told me and Caroline to come. But dear Caroline's got an almighty  hangover, sick as a dog, so I brought him over on the back of the bike to see it again. He's up there."" He gestured vaguely at the upper reaches of seats. The trumpets sounded, thin and clear, for the last act, from the palace's high corners.  ""Les anges,"" said Wilkie,""rayonnent toujours, bien que le plus radieux soit déchu. Is that right? It sounds funny. Can you see him? There. I'll be seeing you."" And he scuttled monkey-like up through the rows of seats. Frederica craned upwards. A light from a battlement caught, she thought, a white open-necked shirt, a tentative length of lean man, a grave face. Alexander?  ""Guess what I found there?""  No answer.  ""Frederica Potter being nanny to a row of French children.""   ""Oh Christ!""  ""She seemed very keen on seeing you. Excited you were here.""  ""Oh Christ.""   ""She loves you, Alexander.""  ""Rubbish. A boa constrictor. Always was, always will be. Shut up, and let me watch this play."" Frederica was agitated. She remembered her last encounter with Alexander and failed yet again to understand her own behaviour. She had stalked him with infinite care, she had attacked him frontally, she had thrown herself at him and teased him, and had finally reached the point of consummation where he was coming to dinner, in an empty house, wanting her. And what she had done was to flee to Scarborough on the back of Wilkie's motorbike. She loved Alexander. Wilkie was only a friend to whom she chattered. She had always loved Alexander. She had an intimation that it had been important to her to have an impersonal initiation, in her own control, not over-whelming. But how could she ever explain this to Alexander, who anyway no longer wanted to understand? ""Elle aurait du mourir ci-après. Un temps serait venu pour ce mot."" Something wrong with that? There would have been a time for such a word. Alexander's emotions were simpler. He could hardly remember why, or how much, he had wanted Frederica. He referred to it in his mind as a temporary dramaturgical folly. He remembered very clearly that she had made him look a fool. He remembered kicking cornflowers and moon daisies all over the little square garden. He had no wish to repeat any part of the experience. Tous nos hiers n'ont qu'allumés, pour les sots, une voie vers la Mort poussiéreuse. Nevertheless the two parties collided in the dark antechambers of the Palace. Wilkie rushed up to Frederica, his bush-baby eyes bright. Alexander hung back. Because the motorbike was tucked cunningly under the very rampart of the fortress, much closer than the blue Corvette, Wilkie was able both to reverse the firm family progress of the Grimauds, and to make it impossible for Alexander not to catch up. Wilkie enjoyed such moments.  ""Hello, Alexander.""   ""Hello.""   ""Monsieur Grimaud, Madame, Monsieur Alexander Wedderburn…un écrivain anglais…qui a écrit de belles pièces…tres renommées…un ami…de mon père.""  Everyone bowed. Alexander, his French less flowing than Frederica's, asked, inveterately good-mannered, how the Grimauds had liked the play. They replied. Frederica interrupted with a comment on the strange effect of the translation on an English ear. Alexander fell silent. Wilkie wrote down Frederica's address. M. Grimaud, interested by these strangers, hoping to amuse their English girl, drew on an envelope a sailor-like map demonstrating the approach to the Mas Rose from Vaison and the Mas Cabestainh. He supposed it was named for the troubadour, very famous and tragic, very Provençal. Courtly love, Jealousy, blood, a terrible story. The Mas Rose had no gas, no electricity, no running water, but it was on the mountain, it had a spring, the air was pure, one could see the Ventoux, famous of course for the love of Pétrarque for Laure. He hoped Mr Wilkie would indeed visit it. Also Mr Wedderburn. Alexander looked at the stars and shifted from foot to foot. It was impossible for him to mount the motorbike before Wilkie. Frederica too looked at the motorbike and remembered her sanguinary defloration. She plucked  Alexander's sleeve. She tried, not successfully, to recall something of the pupil-teacher aspect of their relations. ""Alexander. Alexander. I got into Cambridge.""  ""Good.""   ""Actually, I got scholarships at both universities.""  ""Good. That should please your father.""  ""He's too upset about Marcus.""   ""I see.""  Alexander looked at Wilkie who deliberately did not see him. Wilkie asked Frederica if she had seen the Mediterranean the Camargue — Orange? She told him nervously, one eye on Alexander, how she had stayed with one of Mme Grimaud's innumerable cousins in Orange, had seen Racine's Britannicus and a Cocteau ballet on the same subject in the Théâtre Antique. Imagine, she told him, Aricie in ice-cream pink tights and Britannicus in a weird gold curly wig and a little clattering metal skirt. Very Cocteau, said Wilkie, and Alexander buttoned his head very firmly into his Orphic helmet, thus becoming deaf to Frederica's brightness and absurd to look at, globular white anonymity above the beautiful, clean, white-clothed, untouchable long body. He pulled down his visor and folded his arms.  ""Well,"" said Wilkie, grinning broadly. ""It was nice, Frederica. We'll drop in one of these days, you'll see. We'll all go for a skinny dip one evening. If you're allowed out. He pulled out the bike and straddled it, followed by Alexander, who inclined his fat head minimally. They wove off through the theatre crowd, bending and bowing together. Frederica wondered if Wilkie had chatted to Alexander about all that blood. It was about equally likely and unlikely. She did not really expect to see them again. At the Mas Rose she hoped every day to see them riding down the white stony hillside track. Frederica had wanted, but not dared, to ask Alexander how his writing was going. It was not going well. Life at the Mas Cabestainh was ostensibly designed for the enjoyment and production of art. Crowe had bought the house, grey, bullet-pocked, near derelict, for a song immediately after the war and had made it, incorporating its farm buildings, expensively unassuming and very comfortable. It had a large sitting-room with an open hearth, a refectory dining-room  with wooden tables and benches, a small library in which silence was observed. The barns, stables and servants' quarters had been made into more or less monastic cells in which visiting artists or writers could work or sleep off the night's excesses, alone or together. Alexander had a stable-room, white-washed, double-doored, with a yellow wooden bed, a green-shuttered window, a woven rug, a writing table, two yellow-stained rush-bottomed upright chairs and a bookcase. He spent less time there than he meant to: it was a cell, cool and enclosed, whereas from the terrace in front of the sunlit house one could see, sipping wine, the valley of the Rhone away below, lavender fields, olives, vines. On this terrace there was civilised talk, projects for expeditions, a kind of daily life of the mind for which Alexander, in this not unlike Frederica, had longed in a youth unprovided with games of a serious kind. One project of Matthew Crowe's was that Alexander should write a play for the house guests to act, a play about the story of Cabestainh for whom the house had, in a felicitous conjunction at Crowe's twin predilections for violence and civility, been named. Has Cabestainh Guillem, or Guillaume de Cabestanh, or Cabestaing, or Cabestan, had loved the lady of Roussillon, Soremonde, Sermonde, or Marguerite, wife of the seigneur Raymond of Roussillon, who, in a fit of jealous rage, had the troubadour slaughtered and had served his heart to the lady in a dish. Whereupon, declaring that no less precious food should thereafter pass her lips, the lady had, variously, starved herself to death or flung herself from the window, in which case her blood had forever coloured the ruddy rocks of Roussillon. Pound tells and retells this tale, in laminated fragments, in the early Cantos.  ""It is Cabestan's heart in the dish.""  ""It is Cabestan's heart in the dish? No other taste shall change this."" Alexander was excited by Pound's verse, so fluid, so dramatic, so exact. He was excited by the troubadours, who wrote endlessly varied repetitions of inventive metaphors for love, pain, service. He thought he could write Crowe a parody at once elegant and shocking. It turned out to be unexpectedly difficult. This was partly because he was anxious about his next major work. He was a writer of the fidgety, costive kind whose works are long in the planning, and meticulous in the execution — only at the very end  of a project, when the scaffolding, the foundations, the walls and roof and even the plaster were laid down, did spontaneity and delight take over, in the actual play of, play with, words themselves. He was not only a perfectionist about the form of his work: he held beliefs, again rigid and inhibiting, about its subject matter. He believed that the English drama would be improved by the deliberate tackling of large subjects, subjects of political and philosophical weight. He was in no way a precursor of ""committed"" drama — it was, in his case, a question of the scope and ambition of understanding. Too much minor modern art was art about art, inward-looking, narcissistic. Alexander was rattled, disturbed in his habits, by instant fame, by being treated as a major dramatist. His correspondents agents, theatres, drama groups, journalists, students, teachers — treated him as a major writer and waited to see what he would do next. Given the moral seriousness he had already, these expectations intensified his anxiety about his subject. He toyed with the time of Munich, the decisions and failures to decide that had made the world he lived in. But he felt, in a way that must seem absurd when the conflict in the Falklands is dramatised repeatedly before it is even over, when the widow of an assassinated president is recreated in large in her lifetime on the epic screen, that these events were too close to be seen clearly, too large and foul and complex to be treated with decorum. He had now formed a plan to write about the falsely sunny period before the Great War. He could parody the poetry of grazing cows and vicarage lawns, foxhunting and romantic love. He could quote trench poetry. But this project too hung fire, impeded perhaps by the conflicting duty to Cabestainh, perhaps by sun and wine, perhaps by distance — English lawns seemed far""away. And then he was partly taken over by a piece he neither intended nor wanted to write and which preoccupied him obsessively, the dramatisation of the dispute, in the Yellow House in Arles, between Paul Gauguin and Vincent Van Gogh. This work had begun, like Frederica's limp tales, as a kind of tourism. He had visited Arles and walked along the Alyscamps. The Yellow House was gone, swallowed by the railway, but the nondescript indefinite area between nineteenth-century railway and the ancient Roman sarcophagi in their Elysian fields was still there. Van Gogh had divided his painting of the Yellow House with a soft, muddy-brown line, and there still was the soft muddy raised bank of an irrelevant ditch. Crowe had the new edition of the Letter's, and  Alexander borrowed them to read in bed. He also had a copy of Gauguin's Avant et Après which recounted the episode in the Yellow House from Gauguin's point of view, patronising, complacent in its nervousness, making sure the world knew who was the great painter, the great influence, the major man. The impulse to dramatise the events came out of Van Gogh's descriptions of the ""electric"" arguments of the two. They quarrelled about art. They went to Montpellier and quarrelled about Rembrandt.  ""Our arguments are terribly electric, we come out of them sometimes with our heads as exhausted as an electric battery after it has run down.""  Electricity crackled and flashed in the whole relationship, and in Vincent Van Gogh's body, and brain. Gauguin painted Van Gogh painting sunflowers.  ""Afterwards my face got much brighter, but it [the portrait]was really me, very tired and charged with electricity as I was then.""  Gauguin was uneasy. He woke sometimes and found Vincent standing by his bed. ""Between two beings, he and I, he like a Vulcan and I boiling too, a kind of struggle was preparing itself… There followed the Christmas episode of the razor-threatening, the severed ear, Gauguin's precipitate departure, the incarceration. In the asylum a kind of dark Christianity repossessed Vincent Van Gogh. The surface of the letters to Theo about Gauguin's defection, the disproportionate interest in the whereabouts of Gauguin's fencing gloves, spoke of an anxiety for Gauguin, a Christian concern. Underneath was rage and humiliation. Vincent himself was afraid of the way madness brought back a religious intensity he had felt and transmuted: Well, with this mental disease I have, I think of the many other artists suffering mentally and I tell myself that this does not prevent one from exercising the painter's profession as if nothing was amiss. When I realise that here the attacks tend to take an absurd religious turn, I should almost venture to think that this even necessitates a return to the North. He was afraid, particularly at Christmas, of a recurrence of his despair and terrible visions. There was much that was intrinsically dramatic. Vincent's position as scapegoat or demon: A certain number of people here (there were more than So  signatures) addressed a petition to the Mayor (I think his name is M.Tardieu) describing me as a man not fit to be at liberty, or something like that. The commissioner of police or the chief commissioner then gave the order to shut me up again. I write to you in the full possession of my faculties and not as a madman but as the brother you know. And the involuntary malice within the desperate attempts to remain on the safe side of the frontier of madness. If Theo was worried about marriage settlements in the event of death ""why do you not just knife your wife and have done with it?""   ""Indeed I am so glad that if there are sometimes cockroaches in the food here, you have your wife and child at home.""  So transparent, so furious. Alexander became obsessed by the yellow chair, of which the yellow chairs in his own cell were close relations, generic descendants, the rush the same, the back the same, the varnish less lemon and ruddier. He discovered first that it (like the fencing gloves) had been painted in the wake of the Gauguin debacle and as a companion piece to the portrait of Gauguin's empty chair ( ""Effect of Night"" ). Gauguin's chair, an ample, armed chair, was painted in the dark against a lamplit green wall ""in dark brown-red wood, the seat of greenish rush, and in the place of the absent a lighted candle and two modern novels"" . The novels, disposed randomly, had, for Van Gogh, as for Henry James, connotations of French naughtiness. They also, for Van Gogh, represented life. After his pastor-father's death he painted his heavy Bible, in dark light near two snuffed candles, looming over one small yellow novel, Zola's La Joie de Vivre. In Paris, learning colour, with Theo, he painted the beautiful ""Still Life with Books"" , a profusion of yellow novels on a clear, brilliant pink ground. (And behind these in the imagination the heavy tomes, eaten away and dusty, of the Dutch still-life masters' reminders of the vanity of human wishes, of death.) Gauguin's chair, ""Effet de Nuit"" , Alexander came to realise, with its nocturnal colour-scheme of ruddy browns and murky greens resembled the iniquitous ""Night Cafe"" (and by implication the brothels the two painters had haunted in search of subject-matter and what else?, scene of Gauguin's triumphs and Vincent's humiliations).  ""In the Night Cafe I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by means of red and green.""  And the yellow chair? Blue and yellow, the opposing colours, clean and upright, no erect candle on its seat but a snuffed out, horizontal pipe, light and cleanliness, bare sanity? The grief-stricken old man in blue of the St Rémy days sits head in hand on just such a shining chair by a fire with fragile flames. These images had what Alexander desired for his own work and did not have: authority. The man could both paint and name a chair, and bring into play his own terrors and hopes, and behind it, the culture of Europe, north and south, the Church itself. The yellow chair was the opposite of the insane messianic visions and voices. A writer is a man haunted by voices. Alexander walking to and from the water-tank in Crowe's kitchen-garden, where balloon-like tadpoles, the size of half-crowns, dived and plashed their lips, unable to emerge and metamorphose into frogs, was amused sometimes by the counterpoint that wailed in his mind: Cabestan's heart, Vincent's ear, gassed soldiers' throats, Brooke's poppies, the troubadour's lady like rose and gillyflower, Vincent's irises, jealousy rage and fear, fear jealousy and rage, fear and indignation and pity. Sometimes, before he drank the fourth or fifth glass of Côtes-du-Rhone that would incapacitate him, he thought with guilt of the Flanders fields, with impotence of the forests where wolves ranged,— with the sense of temptation, secret delight, and energy welling up from unknown sources of Gauguin's cold bluster, of Vincent's two voices. Mostly he went to sleep, then. Sometimes he wrote verse about colours. He did not think of Frederica Potter at all. He was a man whose personal life, though occasionally exigent, never became a siren song. The most delightful thing about the Mas Rose was the water-supply. It came from a source, a spring, further up the hillside. M. Grimaud showed Frederica how, by building a slate dam here, releasing a little stone floodgate there, he diverted the clear water into its summer channel, a stone-lined gully which ran down beside the house and along its front wall, passing under slabstone doorsteps. Here they washed Vallauris honey-gold dishes and coffee bowls, here, in running water, they dipped and shook salads and peaches. The house was rosy and set into the hill. Frederica slept in a windowless loft that held her suitcase, a camp bed, and no more. She read at night by torchlight, her own little door open onto the sandy hillside. There was not much air: the roof heat persisted from the day. An army of ants marched ceaselessly under the bedhead and sheared away the  edges of her dirty underwear with innumerable mandibles. Owls and cicadas screamed and scraped. Mosquitoes whined and bit Frederica's face into a plump, knobbed, pink parody of itself, giving her an unfair look of the acne from which her dryness of flesh and perhaps of character had preserved her. It was unfortunate that she had seen Alexander. She lacked his detachment and would not even have thought it morally desirable, believing the Byronic tag, ""Man's love is of man's life a thing apart: 'tis woman's whole existence.""  She retreated into clouded vision, only half-saw the Ventoux, the Vallauris potteries, the evening games of boules under the plane trees in the timeless village square. She and Marie-Claire and Monique sat, heavy, sulky, self-absorbed, graceless whilst Paul-Marie darted and chattered like a squirrel after the scaly balls and his parents sipped their white port and admired him. One afternoon, after she had given up hope, stirring aïoli on the doorstep, Frederica heard the crunch of wheels on stones and saw the motorbike winding down the cliff with its two insect-heads swaying in harmony above it. It disappeared behind olives and reappeared lower down the hill. Frederica clutched the oily mortar to her breast. Marie-Claire snickered. The bike drew up in the yard under the tree. ""Dear girl, what have you done to your face? I hope we're welcome. What a divine setting. For God's sake put down that mortar, you are ruining the front of your dress. I brought Caroline, now not hungover."" Not Alexander. Of course not Alexander. Wilkie's girl, as Frederica always thought of her — had he not said, in Scarborough, ""I've got a girl, you know…"" — smoothed blown skirts over thin brown legs and tossed her urchin head free of its case. M. Grimaud came from his vegetable patch up the hill, where, with further engineering of irrigation, he produced excellent tomatoes, courgettes, peppers, beans and salad. He extended a huge hand and invited Wilkie to lunch. Frederica wondered whether Caroline knew the Scarborough story, and, if so, whether it was known as a joke or as something apologised for. She was, she thought, glad she was no one 's ""girl"" though Caroline, assured in this position and two years into Cambridge, was intimidating. Frederica felt she looked frightful: the oil was sticky and stiff on her breasts, the sun had frizzed her hair and the mosquitoes deformed her face. They ate outdoors: sausages, aïoli, vegetables and salad fresh  cheeses and new, raw, indigestible Gigondas, inky purple. Wilkie discussed the Camargue with M. Grimaud, whose cousin had a domaine there, asked Monique and Marie-Claire politely what they were studying and elicited more information in half-an-hour than Frederica had done in several months. He ate vast quantities of aïoli: his firm, plump chin gleamed with it, like a child's, approached with a buttercup in search of an affinity for butter. Frederica talked edgily to Caroline. Cambridge — eleven men to every woman. Wilkie — a genius — effortless Firsts — but perhaps still ready to give up and make a career in the theatre.  ""He wants to have his cake and eat it,"" said Caroline, watching him devour olives and radishes and French bread.  ""Most of us do,"" said Frederica drily. ""What will you do. Marry?"" This was, from Frederica, pointedly rude, but Caroline took it complacently, said,""One thing at a time. First thing, will Wilkie go back to Cambridge?"" ""I hope so. I hope to know someone there.""  ""What's this?"" said Wilkie.  ""Whether you'll stay at Cambridge,"" said Frederica.  ""What do you think?""   ""I hope so.""  Wilkie grinned.  ""I expect I shall.""  Caroline sulked a little. This did not spoil Wilkie's party. He sampled brandied cherries and admired the irrigation. He walked amongst the olives and flirted with Frederica, Caroline, Monique and Marie-Claire whilst talking folklore seriously with Monsieur. Before he left, he proposed that Frederica join a beach party at Les Saintes-Maries de la Mer, next week. M. Grimaud said that would be very pleasant for her: he would deliver and collect her, and visit his cousin on the domaine."
FIC FIC-FET-007 4.3 "6. Seascape Frederica arrived when the beach party at Les Saintes-Maries was posed. It was at some distance from other groups, in those days not numerous, on that beach. It had arranged itself around bright canvas bags and wicker baskets in the part-shade of a fishing-boat. In those days also the boats were unchanged since Vincent Van Gogh had  spent one week there in June 1888 and had painted them, red and blue, green and yellow, with coloured delicate masts erect, and the slanted, tapering yard-arms crossing each other on the pale mackerel sky. Their lines were curved and beautiful; they were more instantly recognisable than the cypress or even the chair. They were probably not much changed since long before Vincent Van Gogh: the Phoenician auspicious eyes, white circled dot, were painted on the high prow then as in 1888. Frederica read the names on these prows: Désirée, Bonheur, Amitié. By these words she would remember form and colour. Words were primary. She stood at the foot of the bare dunes, gripping a string bag of swimming things and a volume of Smollett. Wilkie came up the sand and arranged her return with M. Grimaud. Formed groups are alarming mostly: Frederica had not come in the expectation of enjoying herself. She advanced on them bravely rather than hopefully. You could see they were English, though how this was, since they were mostly gleaming brown and both elegantly and scantily dressed, it would be hard to say. A pinker skin-tone under the brown, and then the pristine, non-domestic look this kind of English had — untouched, however untrue that might be. They rested on elbows, or lay stretched like Stars, stomachs in sand, smooth heads together, a brown hand lifting a white cigarette to a rose-painted mouth, and a line of malachite green smoke going up into the air, which was not here the intense cobalt of the plain of Orange, but pearl-cream-gold, a heavy air, soft and undulating like the pale sand and beyond it the warm, hazed, sand-green sea. The figures were not hard-edged, like the high boats, but soft patches of bright colour, impinged on by soft sand. Two unknown men were blue, one with a fawn skin, just deeper in colour than the sand, caerulean trunks and blackbird-blue hair falling smoothly over one brow. The other, fatter, had stark white skin shadowed, sitting upright against the boat in navy shorts and sky-blue poplin shirt. Between these, gold-dark, dark-gold and violent pink, lay Lady Rose Martindale, solid but not fat or for in less, indeed very woman-shaped, in pink-and-brown striped silk bathing suit, with gold hair spattered softly over the brown flesh of her shoulders and whitish sand speckled on the gleam of her thighs where she had rolled from side to side. Crowe and Anthea Warburton lay parallel, Anthea pale only by contrast with Lady Rose's bright darkness, and with the sunburnt red earth colour of Crowe, who had the look of a  man bronzed against nature by willpower and decisive planning, a man whose ruddiness was made for peeling crimson but who had constrained his skin to stay on — even the thin shiny tonsure — and go terra-cotta. His trunks, largely buried between the rolls of his stomach and thighs, were red-purple, a colour neither heavier nor lighter than his achieved flesh colour, which jangled the eye. Anthea lay as though dancing on the hot folded sand, the pale, lively hair curved as though blown out on the duck egg blue towel on which her lovely profile rested, the skin darker than the tossed gold, the marvellous bones picked out by clear-cut shadows and glitter of sweat. Her bathing-dress was peacock, rippled green and blue like waves of an illuminated sea. At the edge of the circle sat Wilkie and his girl, like photographic negatives, Caroline olive-dark in a white bikini, hair and skin black to Frederica's dazzled eyes, and Wilkie, blacker still, soot-black, except for the neat, white, exiguous triangle of his genitals, the smiling teeth, light striking off the bright black hair and off the huge butterfly-blue sunglasses, reflecting in their inscrutable surfaces pearly sky and sand and pearly sea. The boats stared with their painted eyes and no one else but Wilkie looked up. Grey ash dripped on cream sand. She was decided to be agreeable and unobtrusive. Her highest ambition was to be by the end of the day simply acceptable, to have done no rushing or crashing, committed no vehemence. Wilkie said to Crowe ""Here is Frederica"" and the two strange men lifted a limp and a firm hand in silent salutation. Crowe sat up and stared at Frederica. Caroline nodded and produced with difficulty a half-sound. Anthea Warburton pushed back a strand or two of hair from her mouth and said Hi in a failing voice into the thick air. Frederica's quick mind's eye saw what Crowe saw: a figure broomstick-thin against the dune, splay-footed in sensible sandals, thin-shouldered in the provincial flowered sundress, with its white pique triangles below the straps, butterfly-bowed on the small breasts, plain, yes, but not shockingly or brilliantly plain, smart in Calverley, unexceptionable in Nîmes and Bargemon, dowdy in this company. Her hair and skin were now strangely coloured. The long red tresses which in Astraea had flowed deranged on her shoulders whilst her paper skirts were slit by Seymour's scissors had in the hot sun of Provence slowly crimped, frizzled, and broken off lustreless. They stood out now in a fat triangular fan, with a ginger haze of split ends. Her skin had at one stage, unusual in a redhead, been almost  chocolate-brown and silk-smooth, but she was a northern redhead, and had passed beyond the russet and the Negro, back to a strange peeled patchwork, toast-cinder brown, radish-crimson, freckled bone and the translucent grey of flaking skin still shifting. At the end of the play she had declared to Crowe her ambition to be an actress. Crowe had told her to get a new face. This glaring thin skull, striped and quilted with bites, was hardly an improvement. He smiled benign. ""Well, Frederica, I hear you are employed as a nanny. It seems most unlikely. Do sit down."" Frederica sat down. They all breathed slowly, some with shut eyes, some with open. Everything there was slow, slow: a long minute went by, and no one spoke.  ""Not exactly a nanny,"" said Frederica. No one displayed any interest in what she really was. Crowe made known Lady Rose, who had been a friend of the Woolfs in their later years and was writing an elegant book on cats, and the fat and thin men, who were Vincent Hodgkiss, a philosopher, and Jeremy Norton, a poet. Crowe lit another cigarette for Lady Rose. Vincent Hodgkiss observed in a tight pleasant voice that it was hard to determine the colours of objects in this light, which seemed opaque, though hot and dry. Frederica said obviously that the sky and the sea and the boats were uncannily like Van Gogh, and Hodgkiss said that of course they would never have seen them in this way before he saw them. Wilkie said it was Alexander she ought to talk to about Van Gogh and Hodgkiss said Alexander was an excellent example of what he was talking about, the effect of this light, the difficulty of fixing colours. What colour would they say Alexander was now, In this light? Frederica could not see Alexander at all: indeed she had noted he was not there: she stared around and around now at colourless air and sand as though he might rise from them like a mirage. No, the sea, said Wilkie, and she looked out, at the Stella Maris, anchored off the coast, and there he stood on the curving prow, pale on the pale sky, with a triangular patch of yellow like a painted sun — Van Gogh chrome, not Renaissance gilt — between his thighs and his limbs creamy-brown like the foam on the new cappuccino coffee. And the long heavy hair was creamy too, in the filtered sun, only just darker than the sky. He rode a moment, and then dived into the shifting, opaque water, which ran away from him in rays, like jewels flashing, opals you might call them, emeralds, lapis, rubies, sapphires, as Van  Gogh had said of the stars reflected in that same sea in June 1888. Had she got swimming things, Wilkie said? She shifted her string bag in her rigid lap. Come on in, said Wilkie. So she stood up, and pulled down her pants, and rolled on her dark-brown bathing-costume, under her dress, as she had done on seaside holidays, and then pulled that off too. She was aware that this process exposed first her buttocks and then her breasts, fleetingly, to Crowe, who had seen them and more than seen them, already, but not in circumstances either of them, she took it, cared to remember. She walked with Wilkie crane-like on burning sand to the water's edge. Alexander was disporting himself about the boat. Frederica strode into the water, followed by sauntering Wilkie. She was a reasonable swimmer. She struck out forcefully towards Alexander, which seemed natural, since the boat at anchor was the only thing to swim towards or away from or around on the flat Mediterranean. Alexander now floated near it, on his back, arms outstretched, hair waving under pale green water. She bobbed down and came up more or less inside his embrace, her crimson, browned and pallid face peering like a floating decapitated head in his direction. He brought knees to chin, turned gracefully, and looked at her, both their chins on water. She stared unwavering. She had a nasty habit of simply appearing and staring at him. There had been a time when he had been with the then desired Jenny in the back of a car on the moor at Goathland. There had been a time when she had stared from Crowe's knee, before Crowe's study fire, out at Alexander on the Long Royston terrace. And now in the sluggish sea of the Camargue and the mouths of the Rhone.  ""So you're here,"" he stated, with no apparent note of acceptance or annoy. She stared.  ""Are you here long""   ""I was asked to a lunch party.""   ""I see.""   ""Do you wish I'd go away?""   ""Not particularly.""   ""Good.""  Still staring. ""But I wish you wouldn't stare. It isn't nice. I've never liked it.""  ""I don't mean to stare.""  She performed a somersault, shook her head, and said towards the Stella Maris,""I just like looking at you, that's what it is. As you know."" Alexander's skin crept, possibly with pleasure. To cover this  quickening he pointed out, ""You've got badly burned. Someone should have warned you. With your colouring."" The black and orange skull grinned. ""They did. This has taken months and months to achieve. I was a smooth black girl. Then I peeled. I thought I was past it but obviously not. I'm sorry I look horrid.""  ""No skin off my nose,"" said Alexander, who veered between the absurdly avuncular, the undignified childish — and something else — whenever he allowed Frederica to trap him into talk. He crawled away towards the boat and swung himself up. He thought of diving off again before she, swimming doggedly after, was up. But he gave her a hand and they sat side by side on the hot wood, pouring sea water, steaming.  ""Are you having fun?"" said she. ""On the whole. That is, yes. Of course.""  ""Are you writing?""  ""Not as much as… That is, yes. But the wrong things. Or I think, the wrong things.""  ""What things?""   ""Oh, Frederica.""  He shifted his damp bottom and the planks hissed. ""Come on. Don't catechise people on a swimming party."" ""I want to know. I don't see you much. I really want to know. Why did they say you would tell me about Van Gogh?"" ""Did they? Well, I could. Perhaps I will,""he fatally added, standing up.  ""But now I'm swimming.""   ""Can I come?""   ""I can hardly stop you.""  He dived, and swam, and turned to see her enter the water, neat as a needle, if inelegant. Her curious visage reminded him of something but he could not think what. She looked flayed, or striped. Tiger, tiger. Not that, despite the staring. More simian. There he was, thinking about Frederica Potter, at Les Saintes-Maries de la Mer. He still believed this was an irritating aberration. She bobbed up at his side like a terrier, treading water.  ""Are you writing about Provence, then?""  ""Not exactly. Not intentionally. Not about Provence itself exactly. Oh, come off it, Frederica, try to enjoy yourself.""  ""I am.""  She was. They swam slowly together round the boat. They did not play  water games: he dared not. But she came close on a corner as he turned and humped his body to avoid a rope, and under the colourless many-coloured water their naked legs brushed weightlessly. It was still there. It was still there, they both thought, she with greed and apprehension, he with alarm, a sense of injury, and an animal redirection of intention. She said something he couldn't catch.  ""What?""  ""Dolphin-like. You.""  ""I like dolphins.""  ""So do I. They sing. Melodious hootings and echoings. I heard them on the wireless.""  ""Can't you just be in a place, Frederica?""  ""No. I think. I have to think. So do you."" ""No I don't. To my shame, in many ways, I don't."" But he did. He was very tempted to tell her about The Yellow Chair. The whole problem, the way the plays had got wound into each other, would interest her, she would see it was a problem. He turned on his back and swam away, jerky and splashing. She swam after, outside the rainbow of his thrashing. Inshore, Wilkie, lying lazily along the water, propped by flickering hands, watched the to and fro of their dancing and circling and smiled to himself. At the edge of the water Wilkie's girl cried out that it was lunch, they were going to eat lunch. Lunch was good: little cold herb omelettes, raw smoked ham, huge pumpkin-indented scarlet tomatoes, black olives with garlic and pepper, glistening, wrinkled and hot. There was a lot of red wine, Côtes du Ventoux, and a lot of good crusty bread. There was sharp, fresh goat cheese and rose-orange Cavaillon melons, green-gold like legendary serpents outside, into whose fluted pink hollows Crowe ceremoniously poured pink, sweet Beaumes-de-Venise wine. Sand got into things, of course, and three or four wasps buzzed, straddled and chewed, could be seen chewing, the meat and the fruit. Frederica drank a lot of wine and said nothing, but watched everyone in turn, charged with unsatisfied curiosity as they lay and lazily tossed ideas between them. She did not give their talk her whole attention. Alexander had much if not most of that. He lay in the sun, near Lady Rose and Matthew Crowe, not near Frederica, and seemed intent on the talk, which was mostly talk between Hodgkiss, Wilkie and  Crowe about the perception and representation of colour, on which Hodgkiss was writing a paper in aesthetics, and on which Wilkie had conducted his experiment with the rainbow sunglasses. The latter was now staring at the Van Gogh boats and the milky sea and sky through poppy-scarlet lenses, which Frederica thought was perverse, although she wished she had the courage to ask for a moment to put them on, to see all this. Hodgkiss and Wilkie talked about the nature of colour. Hodgkiss's manner displeased Frederica; he had a mannered Oxford voice, elided words, and used the pronoun ""one"" frequently. He had the voice of a thin languid man and the body of a stocky alert one. He had been reading the notes of Wittgenstein, he said, who before his death had been working on the relation between the private, sensuous experience of colour and the universal language of colour words with which we appear to be able to communicate it. He spoke of a mathematics of colour, Wittgenstein, a Farbmathematik: one knew saturated red or yellow, once experienced, as one knew the nature of a circle or the square on the hypotenuse. Crowe put in that the symbolists of Van Gogh's time had supposed there was a universal language of colour, a primary language, a divine alphabet of colours and forms. Something like that, said Hodgkiss: Wittgenstein asked if there could be a natural history of colour, like the natural history of plants and answered himself that such a natural history was, unlike that of plants, outside time. Alexander said that Van Gogh in his letters in French very rarely made his colour adjectives agree with the nouns they qualified. The result was that they could almost be read as things more real than the things they qualified, a pattern of eternal forms from another world, not part of the solid world of cabbages and pears — yellow and violet, blue and orange, red and green. Wilkie said it was known to psychologists that certain colours had certain psychological effects: red, and also orange and yellow increase muscular tension and the flow of adrenalin: blue and green slow the heartbeat, lower the temperature. The conversation moved on to the human habit of colour-mapping. Crowe said there was an odd passage in Proust where he associated letters of the alphabet with colours. He claimed that the letter ""I"" was red — in Gerard de Nerval's Sylvie, la Vraie Fille du Feu, for instance. Lady Rose immediately said no, no, I was ice-blue, and Anthea said no, silvery-green and Crowe said women's interest in colour depended on what colour showed their bodies to best advantage, a  woman would always decorate a room in terms of her own skin tone and eyes. He asked the others about the letter ""I"" : Hodgkiss said it brought to mind Henry James's simile for the dress of Sarah Pocock, ""scarlet like the scream of someone falling through a skylight"" . Jeremy Norton said ""silver"" , Alexander said ""sage"" , Wilkie said ""inky"" and Caroline muttered ""green"" . Frederica said she did not make associations between colours and other systems like alphabets or days of the week. Perhaps, she said to Wilkie, she was colour-insensitive as she was tone-deaf, if he remembered, and he said no, you have little synaesthesia and vestigial sensory responses you don't encourage, that's all. Jeremy Norton said nothing. Years later Frederica read a poem by him about that beach, a neat poem, orchestrating colour adjectives, unmodified, against indefinite objects and asking subtly how language fitted the world. On that day she decided he looked too much like a poet to be a good one, a view at variance with her view of Hodgkiss, who looked too unlike what he was, profound thinker, Oxford don, to be satisfactory either. Lady Rose went to sleep. Crowe lovingly arranged the wheel of her straw hat to cover her face. Anthea kicked the sand with perfect, active little toes and Wilkie's girl lay down in the shadow of the boat, pulling him down after her, putting an arm over his sweaty waist, claiming. Crowe leaned back and snuffled a snore. Anthea began to oil her skin. Alexander, unusually lively after a meal, proposed a walk, and did not know if he was glad or sorry when only Frederica accepted.  ""Have you seen the church, Frederica?""  ""No. I don't know who the Saintes-Maries were, or why there are more than one."" They mounted the white dune and set off towards town square and church, past a few white cottages. At that time the Camargue had not been invaded by the tourists, who instigated the establishment of mournful-looking groups of tethered, bony horses in American-style corrals, souvenir stalls with gardien hats, and gaucho hats and Texan sombreros, little cotton peaked caps, with Mickey Mouse or pink flamingoes on them. Nor had the later overlapping visitation of hippies of the Sixties taken place, who had followed the gipsy processions, of which Alexander now told Frederica, and stayed and sung and smoked and loved and sat on the white beaches, so that the pale sand came to resemble road-dirt anywhere. In the Sixties any vaguely holy and distant place became heaped and congested with the bodies of the seekers of the holy and distant. Frederica at that time wrote an essay on overpopulation, relics of individualism, the collective soul and Glastonbury. That was before Stonehenge, in 1980, became enclosed in a concentration camp cage, designed to keep people out, not in, and that fence was built before a Frenchman proposed to preserve the crumbling Sphinx by encasing him/her/it in a transparent plastic skin. A world was coming in which it would almost certainly never again be possible to walk quietly, as Frederica and Alexander walked, through the village where Van Gogh tramped and set up his easel in the clean dust. St Mary Jacobus and St Mary Salome, in some versions accompanied by St Mary Magdalene and in all by their black servant, Sarah, had sailed to this coast from Palestine, Alexander told Frederica, after the death of Christ. They had been miraculously wafted to this place after days without food or water in an open boat. Sarah had joined them through another miracle, a cloak thrown by Mary Jacobus which upheld her feet on the water. Every year the saints — all three — were taken down to the sea and ritually dipped into it: every year the gipsies from all over France gathered to celebrate this bathing and rebirth. The gipsies patron saint was Sarah; it was thought she might bear some relation in their minds to a deity of their own, an oriental deity, Sara le Kali.  ""Kali the destroyer,"" said Frederica knowledgeably, who in fact knew little more of this terrifying deity than her name and brief tag. ""Goddesses rising from the sea. Like Venus. I see what they mean when they say the Mediterranean countries have never missed out on a female god. It makes a change. But she was put out — not disappointed but made uneasy — by the images of the Maries in the church. It is an uncompromising fortress-like church, old, high, square with no elaboration of aisle or transept, bare, which chimed with Frederica's northern sense of fitness, and yet, in its dark, after the bright sun, haunted by things her blood rejected — racks of fragile spiked flames of votive candles, elaborate china and metal plaques and pictures offering thanks for favours obtained, the smell of old wax and lingering incense muffling the smell of stone. The sacred images of the two Maries leaned out awkwardly from a plinth on a balustrade. Both had sweet, round, pink-cheeked china-doll faces: both were crowned with wreaths of  globular white silk flowers, wound with pearls. Both were dressed in silk floss, tinsel and gauze, pink and pale blue. Both smiled thoughtlessly. Frederica was irresistibly reminded of the two dolls leaning lifelessly on the doll's house dresser, staring, in The Tale of Tao Bad Mice. They were the first such images she had seen — the Grimauds, like many Nîmois, were staunchly Protestant. She looked at Alexander for guidance: he said that the image of black Sarah was in the crypt They went down. Sarah was different. Her carved, dark, fine-nosed wooden face had both austerity and arrogance or contempt, something indeed oriental, though her flounces and veils were the same frothy pastels as those of the upstairs saints. Round her burned iron-spiked circles of tapering candles, yellow-bright in the dark. Before her lay heaps of flowers — she was the beloved, the tended saint — dying gladioli, eternal silk blown roses, immortelles. Behind her on the altar was a reliquary in which Frederica could see through glass a bone or two — a shin, a forearm? It was like seeing that female body preserved whole in sand in the British Museum, as one feels it should not be, its reddish leathery skin peeling from its temples, crispings of dead gingery hair over its ears. That woman is many English children's first encounter with death, lying there knees to chin, folded, flaking, tendons taut. The thing itself. Image and bones, altar and woman, half-doll, half-idol, iron spikes, flame light on the smoke-stained roof. Let's get out into the sun, said Frederica, let's go. After they had left the church they were a little embarrassed. Alexander, who took refuge from awkwardness in the purveying of information, told Frederica about other Mediterranean goddesses. He told her Ford Madox Ford's delightful story of the portrait-sculpture of Our Lady of the Castle from St Etienne des Grès. The Virgin, Ford relates, appeared to a young shepherd in the Alpilles who was chiselling a rock, and remained whilst he carved her portrait. ""When it was done She expressed Her complete satisfaction with the statue both as a portrait and as a work of art,— I particularly asked the Bishop about that last point. — There at once was presented to the world the final canon of aesthetics."" Ford set out to see this cynosure and found Her so wrapped and swaddled in lace robes and veiling that he could see no trace of figure or countenance. And then, one day, he came to her church and saw a great gold crown on one chair, billows of lace on another, ""two beetle-like old ladies washing something in a pewter receptacle…""   ""And the image,"" Alexander quoted, ""was a rude, carved piece of reddish rock.""  A primitive, such as Gaudier-Brzeska emulated, such as the peasant-Virgin would have recognised. Cybele and Venus, Alexander said, were worshipped as conical stones. How beautiful, how amazing, Frederica exclaimed, associating the red rock of Roussillon with Alexander explaining Rodin's Danaïde to her with his perfect, respectful, abstract sensuality. Alexander told her about the Venus of Arles, who had been dug up in the Roman circus there, classically graceful with both her arms, holding up the golden or marble apple. He quoted Van Gogh, ""There is a Venus of Arles, just as there is a Venus of Lesbos, and one still feels the youth of it, in spite of all…""   ""Ah yes, Van Gogh,"" said Frederica. bas he writing about Van Gogh? They sat in a cafe and ordered citrons presses and Alexander told Frederica about the importunate play, about the evanescent summer of 1914, about Cabestainh. Frederica said she could not see what he was hesitating about, he must write The yellow Chair, it was alive, wasn't it? They talked about how to write The Yellow Chair, whether to make it stark and classical by keeping the unities, restricting the action to the terrible days of the battle with Gauguin, or whether to make it episodic and epic, to introduce Theo at least and maybe other figures, even the looming pastor from Nuenen. Frederica said to Alexander, before he could say it to her, that there was an intrinsic problem in writing about artists, for how could he dramatise the battle with the colours and forms as opposed to the whore and the rival, the father, the brother, the nephew Vincent Van Gogh? They got excited. Alexander's mind shifted from conflict over his intentions to certainty that The Yellow Chair was what he was writing. (Paradoxically the release of tension enabled him in the next week to run up, turn out, patch together, a poetical melodrama about Cabestainh with which the house-guests had some civilised fun.) Was it at this moment that some reciprocal need established an understanding that they two were friends, would know each other for a long part of a life-time? Hardly then, though it did cross Frederica's mind that sex inhibited talk and that to be talked to by Alexander was a pleasure not readily to be forgone. He did not touch her until the end of the day when he stroked the frizzled hair briefly and said ""Thank you"" , meaning it. She went home to her windowless attic, sweltered and turned, remembering Ford's red-stone Virgin  with intense pleasure, plotting The Yellow Chair, remembering the yellow triangle of Alexander's trunks on the prow of the Stella Maris. They did not meet again, that summer. Arles, June 1888. To Emile Bernard. I spent a week at Saintes-Maries, and to get there I drove in a diligence across the Camargue with its vineyards, moors, and flat fields like Holland. There, at Saintes-Maries, were girls who reminded me of Cimabue and Giotto — thin, straight, somewhat sad and mystic. On the perfectly flat sandy beach little green, red, blue boats, so pretty in shape and colour that they made one think of flowers… What I should like to find out is the effect of an intenser blue in the sky. Fromentin and Gerome see the soil of the South as colourless, and a lot of people see it like that. My God, yes, if you take some sand in your hand, if you look at it closely and also water, and also air, they are all colourless, looked""at in this way. There is no blue without yellow and without orange, and if you put in blue, then you must put in yellow, and orange too, mustn't you? Oh well, you will tell me that what I write to you are only banalities."
FIC FIC-H9D-015 5.7 "HALF LIGHT When he woke from an exhausted sleep Greg had — he felt — one piece of the jigsaw definitively in place: the letter from Walter Machin to Hilda dated 2 June 1939 was a fake. Of course there were other possible interpretations: that Walter Machin did not recognize his sovereign; that the people who swept by him in a limousine through Admiralty Arch were no higher in the scale than some uppity Tory MP and his lady wife. But no. That sort of mistake was almost inconceivable, in an age of mass communications. The next step forward would seem to be: that the letter had been forged by Hilda Machin. The transcript had been labelled by Kronweiser, ‘Given me by Mrs Hilda Machin, 21 April 1978.’ Hilda, then, had been forging letters from her late husband. No doubt she had felt safe: probably she still had his old typewriter, not greatly used since the separation. Probably she had found a sufficient stock of unused paper in the attic — yellowed enough with age to carry conviction. She had thought it a foolproof notion, but had slipped up on detail, like so many. Why had she done it? Greg thought back on the Hilda he had known with a surge of affection: he could almost see her, chuckling over the typewriter as she composed the letter. Or perhaps her whole being had been flooded with the personality of the real, dead Walter, as she tried to reproduce his style, the dash of his personality, his  iconoclastic irreverence. Surely she had been enjoying herself. Surely it had been a joke, prompted by the dreadful heavy seriousness of Dwight Kronweiser and the overreverent attitude to Walter taken up for public reasons by Viola. It had been an attempt to let in a bit of fresh air on the subject. But perhaps the joke had had a serious point to it too, or at any rate a serious side-effect: it had enabled Hilda to get her side of the story over to posterity. By forging letters from Walter she, paradoxically, felt she could convey a real image of him to stand against the false one. It was one way of having her say. And the step after that in the deductive process? Who would object to Hilda's little game? Well, Kronweiser, certainly, from a scholarly point of view. But then he had only to ignore the products of Hilda's ingenuity. But what if he had voiced his suspicions to Viola?… Greg's mind played on Viola's concern with keeping the record ‘straight’, meaning that it must tell only her version. He remembered the anguish in her voice as she cried: ‘I wonder what she is saying about me!’ He remembered the row on the day the newspaper interview had come out — so violent as to be heard from the street… If Mr Kronweiser had confided his suspicions that Hilda was forging letters, what would Viola's reactions have been? He registered in his mind one other possibility: that the letters had been forged by Kronweiser himself, to fill out the picture of Walter Machin for his book. He furrowed his brow. Would he have had the inventive capacity, the command of idiom? And why that trip to Olivera's? But he docketed the possibility in the filing cabinet of his mind. Then he went and had a vigorous shower. The vigorous shower did not have any of the beneficial effects such things were generally said to have by public-school games-masters of a previous age. As he rather gloomily put together a breakfast of poached egg and grilled bacon he felt neither particularly healthy nor  particularly clear-minded. He was like a man who has made one step forward into unknown territory and stands looking for a path. If only the will had come. He had sent for a copy, but the bureaucratic machine seemed to be taking its time. Still, he had until two o'clock before he had to go into the College — today was the day he did evening teaching. He shoved his plates into the sink and took his tea into the living-room. There, by the easy chair, he had placed the works of Gerald Seymour-Strachey three fairly substantial-looking volumes. With a sigh, and a glance of regret at the clear, bright day outside, he settled down in his chair and took up the first of the tomes. The autobiography — Sins of My Old Age and Earlier he had already dipped into, and he went back to it reluctantly for a more systematic reading. The story it had to tell was interesting enough: childhood and adolescence in New Zealand, university life in Australia and a stint on the literary pages of the Sydney Morning Herald; arrival in London in the late ‘twenties, when the Katherine Mansfield boom was at its height and there was an unusual keenness to welcome literary talent from New Zealand; London literary life in the ‘thirties — and so on. What Greg did not greatly like was the tone. It grated. This was particularly so in connection with the sexual adventures hinted at in the title — adventures which became a sort of leitmotif, in that the author seemed to feel he had to have one in every seven or eight pages, preferably with some piquant variation. It was rather pathetic, like an ageing colonel looking back on the days of Empire. And they were narrated with a snickering self-satisfaction, a dated coyness, which Greg found unappetizing. After his sexual initiation by a barmaid in an outback pub, while his father was drinking downstairs (at an age which would seem to be about twelve and a half — but Greg felt the incident had been brought forward significantly, from a feeling that the narrative pace of the opening pages was already flagging), Gerald Seymour-Strachey went on to a variety of girls  (occasionally called ‘girlies’) and later women. Most of them were accorded pseudonyms (‘I will call her Sylvia’) and given a few lines of narrative, where their function was little more than to illustrate our hero's appetite and prowess. His marriage was treated very briefly; he recorded it as taking place in 1934, and the bride as being ‘at that time newly arrived from New Zealand and as a writer considered highly promising — alas, of how many has this been said!’ Her name came up now and again in succeeding chapters, though she was not allowed to have played a significant part in his life. The break-up of the marriage was recorded as taking place in 1943, ‘due to the pressures and uncertainties of war’— as if Gerald had been at the very least a fighter ace or undercover agent. The next chapter, however, had him going to Grimsby University, ‘to keep the torch of literature alive in a dark period’. Putting aside the book after an hour or more of solid dipping, Greg decided that Gerald Seymour-Strachey was one of those people who are quite unable to hide the less attractive sides of their personalities from outsiders because these are precisely the sides they themselves are most pleased with. Perhaps this was something he had in common with his elder son. The major critical work revealed a rather different side to Gerald's personality. The title itself was designed to pull you up short: The Heterosexual Strain in Modern English Literature. Greg had first read it as ‘Homosexual’, and that of course was the joke. Heterosexuality among English writers, it was being implied, was so much the exception to the rule as to demand special treatment. The whole of the introduction was a solemnly tongue-in-cheek exposition of this notion, though Greg had the impression that later the joke rather ran out of steam (as the book very nearly did run out of authors to treat). The Ern Malley Affair, a slimmer volume, was an examination of a famous Australian literary hoax of the  mid-'forties, in which bogus poems of impenetrable obscurity were foisted on a literary magazine. It was not clear why the matter deserved a book to itself. Putting the volumes aside, Greg tried to consider the personality they evoked as a whole. They were rather unpleasantly self-satisfied for a start — and this was not incompatible with the impression made on him by the man himself at their meeting. These books were also very dated, in that they were joky — look at me being clever, they seemed too often to be crying. And nothing dates more easily than the clever wheezes of a previous generation. It was rather as if the author — for all the breadth of his experience which he was constantly insisting upon — had never quite grown up. All in all, this was a man who delighted in proving how clever he was and sometimes, as a corollary, in suggesting how dim and credulous other people were. He let his mind play over the man as he had felt him at their meeting, as he now knew him from his books: vain, opinionated, hearty,joky . Why, he thought idly, why had Walter Machin not appeared in the volume of autobiography? Gerald Seymour-Strachey had not explained that satisfactorily at their meeting. On the one hand he had said that he was forgotten, so why mention him? On the other, that he was not forgotten-that there were pockets of admirers who still cherished his books throughout the long years when they were out of print. He couldn't have it both ways. And as far as Greg could judge there were a great many writers who had found a place in the book who were quite as obscure or more so — poets whose flame had died with the end of the war, one-off playwrights whose experimental verse dramas had caused no more than a ripple of interest even in their own time. Why then omit to mention Walter? Surely the reason must lie in the ridiculous sexual vanity of the man: he had left him out to pay him back, posthumously, for stealing his wife. To mention him would be to revive an old  humiliation. Otherwise, if place could have been found for these minor poets and playwrights, not to mention jumped-up journalists who also figured all too prominently, surely a few sentences could have been spared for the man he himself had described as the one working-class writer who remained working-class — the man whom the Sentinel had called ‘the poet of work’. The phrase stirred a vague uneasiness in his mind. ‘The Poet of Work’. It sounded good. And yet, and yet… The man in the pub who remembered one of his workmates complaining to Walter that he had got the details of the factory machinery wrong… Mr Causeley at Jackson's saying in his superior Southern style that people had written complaining that Machin had said ‘bobbin-waggler’ when he should have said ‘throcket-shuttle’. He was flim-flamming, of course, but that must have been the general burden of the letters. But Walter Machin should not have got the mechanical details wrong. There were the other readers, of course. The man on the train, the teacher who had been in Lancashire for three years, but felt he never really knew it until Walter Machin revealed it to him. There were the critics on the newspapers who had praised the vividness and accuracy of the books. But when it came down to it, it was the people who didn't really know Lancashire who found Walter Machin impressive. The ones who knew, the men of his own class, the men who worked in the mills with him, they were unconvinced… Ern Malley… His meditations were interrupted by a plop on the front-door mat. It was the second post. Going absently to see what it was, Greg found it was from Somerset House. The photocopy of the will he had requested. Feverishly opening it, he scanned it through with his mind in a whirl. Most if it he knew: the copyright on his works to his wife Viola; the manuscripts to his former wife Hilda Machin; a  small sum of money to his mother, still alive at the time of the making of the will. There was nothing out of the ordinary. But the surprise came at the end. The signature was not the signature of the letters and contracts he had seen at Jackson's. The name Walter Machin was written in a large, rounded, unconnected and uncertain script. It was the signature of a man who was to all intents and purposes illiterate."
NWS NWS-A1E-002 8.33 "Square Mile: Stock Exchange takes the bull by the horns By JOHN MOORE SLOW developer; confusing thinker who is liable to cause controversy and conflict. These are the characteristics of the International Stock Exchange's own Taurus programme rather than one of the signs of the zodiac. For years the International Stock Exchange has been attempting to reduce the flow of paper on share transactions through the evolution of a computerised system known as Taurus. With its enthusiasm for acronyms, the exchange has taken the ‘Taurus’ title for its computerised settlement masterplan from the full title of the scheme, the ponderously named Transfer and Automated Registration of Uncertificated Stock system. Such a scheme will allow firms operating on the exchange to hold and transfer shares without the need for share certificates. Proposals for the development of a Taurus system have been under consideration for much of this decade. But, even at this stage, there are many hurdles to overcome, as a conference of City experts highlighted last week. At the core of the problems in the development of the Taurus system is the rapidly changing character of financial markets and their structure. When original objectives were set out in the early 1980s for improving services and reducing costs at the exchange through cutting down on the amount of paperwork, more detailed efforts were made to put the objectives into action. These were overtaken by the Government's plans to deregulate the British securities market, announced in 1983, which were to lead to Big Bang. There were then more pressing priorities. But since 1987 there has been added impetus to the development of the Taurus programme, triggered largely by the post-Big Bang boom in share dealing and the subsequent crash in 1987. Huge backlogs of work built up in the securities dealers' back offices as deals could not be completed within the exchange's usual accounts periods. According to Anthony Preece, director of operations at investment group Citicorp Scrimgeour Vickers, speaking at last week's conference, there were at least 13 different design concepts for the future Taurus system under discussion in the City as of March this year. Aside from the technological requirements of the new system, other important issues have to be resolved. The participants in Taurus, the requirements needed for the participants, and the international consequences of the new system, are receiving detailed consideration. Potential members of Taurus include the listed companies affected by the scheme, registrars, private client brokers, retail brokers, custodian banks, institutional investors, and money brokers. Yet as Andrew Palmer, deputy finance director at Legal & General Investments warned at the same conference, ‘like all chains, Taurus is only going to be as strong as its weakest link. And technology could easily become the weak link with some participants’. He said that in the last two years he had met very few institutions which had not cut back their system budgets following the 1987 crash in share prices in the stock market. ‘It would be a serious mistake for them to believe that they could put the whole Taurus market place at jeopardy by cutting back on their Taurus budget.’ On the international front Bill Widdis, director of systems development at the stock exchange, is wary of arguments calling for full transnational integration of share clearing systems. ‘We must note that the nations of Europe have evolved their national clearing and depository systems over many years and, for many reasons, they are all different from one another,’ he says. ‘Some systems serve markets in only one member state, while others, specialising in cerain types of instruments, are of European importance,’ he stresses. ‘Any developments towards integration should take this diversity into account and not seek to prescribe a uniform model when national differences do not compromise the objective of efficient and secure international settlement.’ BIIBA-Fimbra battle worsens THE gentlemanly war between the British Insurance and Investment Brokers Association (BIIBA) and the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (Fimbra) appears to be escalating. BIIBA has now made a strong complaint to Fimbra about the latter's decision to withdraw from an agreement made on 18 September which would have allowed BIIBA members, who held existing professional indemnity cover, to renew their existing policies. Fimbra, as the regulatory body of middlemen who sell investment and insurance products, is attempting to require that these intermediaries hold professional indemnity insurance cover through a centralised scheme provided by Fimbra. The insurance cover is designed to protect intermediaries against suits for damages brought by irate customers. BIIBA, as the trade association attempting to represent most middlemen, is equally unhappy that Fimbra is attempting to bring in a centralised insurance scheme, as most of BIIBA's members have their own professional indemnity insurance cover. A centralised scheme would disrupt existing relationships between BIIBA members and their insurers, and lose them valuable financial advantages such as a no claims bonus. BIIBA wanted a stay of execution on Fimbra's plans and thought that it had gained such a deal when its chairman, David Palmer, met Fimbra chairman Lord Elton. In those discussions BIIBA claims that it was agreed that its members would be allowed to renew their existing policies up to 31 October 1990. A misunderstanding then seems to have occurred with Fimbra writing to its members last week saying that its scheme had not been altered in any way and that members could not renew existing policies if the renewal date was after 1990. BIIBA's director of public affairs commented: ‘Fimbra have clearly reneged on their agreement. In view of the rumours of meetings between it and the underwriters of the Fimbra scheme it appears that the insurers are calling the shots. For a scheme which was claimed to take independent financial advisers out of the power of insurers, this is an ironic situation for Fimbra to have got itself into.’ The campaign continues. A new aroma THE International Stock Exchange started out life as a London coffee shop. Last week it admitted its 400th member, the Swedish-owned United Securities Fondkommission, the first time that level has been reached in its 300-year history. Perhaps the ISE ought to bring out a commemorative and suitably international blend."
NWS NWS-A1L-001 8.8 "Ripping yarns and moral minefields: Allan and Janet Ahlberg talk to Celia Dodd about their bestsellers for children By CELIA DODD THESE days, no one questions the importance of good books for the under-fives. But books that appeal to adults too are just as important; we are, after all, the ones who have to do the reading. There are few things worse than being bludgeoned into reading a book you hate. Story-reading should be one of the great joys of parenthood, a real meeting of adult and child minds. With the Ahlbergs' books, it very often is. The husband-and-wife partnership behind such classics as The Jolly Postman, Burglar Bill and The Baby's Catalogue win children over with ripping yarns and a wicked sense of humour. They win their parents over with a rose-tinted vision of the world which is decidedly reassuring. Their books are usually set nostalgically in the past — the Thirties and Forties are favourite periods — and often feature the perennial characters of fairy tales and nursery rhymes. Yet they are saved from sentimentality by the wry humour of both text and pictures. The Ahlbergs have been accused of not facing up to the harsh realities of life, of being too cosy and sweet, but their latest picture book, Bye Bye Baby, published today, breaks the mould. In it, a small child roams the streets, talking to strangers, until he finally goes off with a woman who has been wandering about pushing an empty pram. Curious subject matter for a children's picture book, you might think, and hardly guaranteed to win the approval of the gimlet-eyed children's book world. But the Ahlbergs have no time for literal interpretations of their work. How, they argue, would Alice, or The Wind in the Willows, stand up against such scrutiny? The way to look at Bye Bye Baby, they insist, is as a ‘light, surreal comedy’. ‘Certainly if you bring a literal interpretation to the story, it's a minefield,’ Allan Ahlberg says. Bye Bye Baby gets away with its particular minefield thanks to the sleight of illustrator Janet Ahlberg's hand. The visual inspiration for the book was the famous advert for Start-rite shoes, showing a small boy and girl walking off down a tree-lined avenue — an innocent image if ever there was one. The Ahlberg version features a solitary figure. The advert gave the story its vaguely Thirties setting. The success of the Ahlbergs' working relationship must have a lot to do with their long and happy marriage. In spite of apparently incompatible personalities — she is small and shy, he is large and does most of the talking — they have an empathy which is essential to the way they work, a persistent mutual pestering. The strength of the partnership is highlighted for Allan, who also works with a number of other artists. The time-consuming nature of Janet's part in the process, combined with a bad back which prevents her spending more than a couple of hours at the drawing board every day, means she cannot keep up with her husband's prolific output. ‘With other illustrators, I work at a distance — we visit and phone, but there is a point at which I can't pester them any more,’ Allan says. They see themselves not as author and illustrator, with separate roles, but as a partnership of ‘book-makers’, contributing equally to the process. Allan Ahlberg says: ‘In the past, a lot of children's books seemed to be the work of talented illustrators whose pictures looked brilliant framed in a gallery, but when you tried to read the book, there was nothing there, because the words started as a coat-hanger to hang pictures on.’ Given the importance they place on the interrelationship of words and pictures, the couple's working lives are surprisingly separate. They claim to see each other less than couples who go out to work, meeting for the occasional cup of coffee in the kitchen. Their 10-year-old daughter, Jessica, who is likely to be seen with her head buried in The Beano or a Roald Dahl novel, has provided the inspiration for many of her parents' books. As a baby, she was fascinated by the Mothercare Catalogue, and so The Baby's Catalogue, which documents the paraphernalia of the infant's small world in minute detail, was born. Allan's experience as a primary school teacher is another rich source of ideas. The couple still maintain close links with local schools, where they spend hours researching, sketching and absorbing jokes. After 10 years of teaching Allan had had enough. ‘I ran out of steam. It's a killing job. Little kids eat you alive, they want so much physically and emotionally.’ Every year he would have half a dozen nine- and 10-year-olds in his class who could barely read. He treated reading as a team effort, getting them to read the Daily Mirror rather than the dull, babyish books on offer. These days, he writes the books intended to help children learn to read. ‘A lot of books used in schools are technically readable but rather drab stories. There's no reason why they shouldn't be funny or gripping even if they don't use many words.’ Writing books for children is becoming increasingly complex, as the arbiters of the modern child's mores — librarians, teachers and publishers — lay down ever more stringent criteria. ‘The problem with children's books increasingly is that there are armies of people who are properly concerned with, for example, the way girls were always discriminated against in the past,’ says Allan. ‘That is bad, and must be thought about. But people seem to think that stories are written to a prescription, that you sit down and say, you don't want it to be sexist, you don't want it to be racist. In reality you just invent a tale, as if you were sitting round a fire in a cave.’ In fact anti-racism and anti-sexism seem to come naturally to the Ahlbergs. Their books are full of female breadwinners and New Men changing nappies and comforting bawling babies in the small hours. Although they are a principled pair — they once turned down the Smarties Award on moral grounds — the Ahlbergs reject the notion of children's author as moralist. ‘I would say, just sit down and tell a good story, and to hell with the morality,’ Allan Ahlberg declares. With that characteristically strong statement, he puts his finger on the secret of the Ahlbergs' phenomenal success with adults and children alike."
NWS NWS-A3M-002 8.25 "Design: Crossed lines over the toytown tram: City transport could soon be back on the right track, says Jonathan Glancey By JONATHAN GLANCEY MODERN trams, as most continental Europeans know, neither shake nor rattle, nor do they roll. Sleek, solidly built, gentle on the environment, they are often an ideal form of city transport. They also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates, flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights. Single-car, articulated or double-decker, trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented. The orange-liveried ‘1500’ series trams in Milan, for example, date from 1927. Eventually they will be replaced, but more than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watch. They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele. Last month it was announced that Britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991. Destined to run in Manchester, they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre, outlying suburbs and satellite towns of Bury, Altrincham, Salford, Oldham and Rochdale. In Britain, with the main exception of Blackpool (not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno), trams had been largely relegated to the history books. Otherwise, the best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comedies. Trams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950s. London's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952. Somehow the image of the tall, thin, mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body, slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the British mind. Trams, it was believed until surprisingly recently, are old-fashioned. They had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper, men in hats, National Health specs, smog and powdered egg. They held up the bright new diesel buses and, even worse, blocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous Austins and lumpen Humbers in canyon-like city thoroughfares. They picked up power from a spider's web of unsightly overhead wires. They were inflexible in operation, draughty, and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled ‘Do Not Spit’ signs screwed to their bulkheads. But the modern tram could hardly be more different. It plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers' desire. In Milan, for example, the commission to design the new generation of ‘Jumbo’ trams, which went into service in 1979, was one that leading Italian architects and designers fought over. After all, the Jumbo, a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect, engineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenig, will be seen on the streets of Milan for the next half-century. Spotlessly clean and popular, the Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig's design skills. The modern tram is a green machine. Assuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanly, the tram is virtually pollution free. Standing at traffic lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo is, save for the chatter inside, completely silent. The overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them. Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable, the latter far greater than any car. But sadly, there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will design, operate and maintain the first of the new generation British trams in Manchester will share the looks of their Milanese counterparts. Artists' impressions show a tram that has more in common with the flat-faced, characterless light trains of the toy-like Docklands Light Railway. There is still time for GMA (GEC, Mowlem, Amec and Greater Manchester Buses) to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer. After all, Mancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first century. Now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve, Manchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its trams. Manchester is not alone. Other British towns, Croydon and Southampton among them, are also considering modern tramways. These are all referred to as ‘supertram’ networks, the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors. What it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train. Although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts — shopping malls, leisure centres, theme parks, amusement arcades and museums — the Manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway lines. The supertram is, in effect, a low-cost replacement for British Rail's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains, those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters. They will perform some of the same functions, but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams. And although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decade, Blackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckers."
NWS NWS-A7Y-008 9.14 "An astonishing shift of power A crucial speech by Sir Peter Imbert underlines the extent of the differences between him and his predecessors. THE EXTENT of the philosophical shift taking place at the top of the Metropolitan Police was illustrated in a speech delivered by Sir Peter Imbert to the International Police Exhibition and Conference in London at the end of September. The brief reports which have appeared of this remarkable address dealt with Sir Peter's appeal for glasnost within the force. ‘Openness must be central to the policing of a democratic and pluralist society,’ he said: all too often, the police had retreated behind ‘one of many walls of silence,’giving one of a series of stock excuses to the press and public for refusing to disclose information. But the depth of the speech's radicalism has not reached a wider public. Sir Peter justified his call for openness in terms which would have been unthinkable from his immediate predecessor, Sir Kenneth Newman, and indeed from any predecessor: ‘Professions, including police, tend by definition to be monopolists of knowledge and through that knowledge, power. Yet to set ourselves up in such a manner contradicts our cherished notion of being part of the community.’ Key parts of the speech signalled a conscious, almost revolutionary departure from some of Sir Kenneth's most cherished notions. Its full title was Preparing Police to Deal with a Multicultured Society, and it was on the subject of policing black communities — still the most vexatious and controversial for both police and their critics — that Sir Peter made his thoughts most plain. The doctrines and policy of Sir Kenneth Newman were set out candidly in an unpublished, private lecture to the European Atlantic Group in 1983, entitled Public Order in Free Societies. The text has achieved great influence, disseminated widely among senior officers, and taught formally at the Bramshill Police College. Its terms and implications are unmistakably authoritarian. All democratic societies, Sir Kenneth said, must strike a balance between order and freedom, and in ‘multi-ethnic societies,’ this posed an acute dilemma. In Britain, as in Germany, the first generation of immigrants had been ‘relatively law-abiding,’ but discussion on ethnic minorities now centred on ‘crime and crime control’. As Lord Scarman, reporting after the 1981 riots, had pointed out, the underlying crisis was social and economic. But this was outside the police remit, and meanwhile, they had to be careful not to jeopardise public tranquillity. A permanent state of war with the community was untenable, but the law must be enforced. In multi-ethnic areas, with their ‘symbolic locations’ like All Saints Road and Broadwater Farm, used for the sale of drugs and stolen goods, police could not act alone. Sir Kenneth said: ‘It is not sufficient to think only in terms of crime control. We need to lift the problem to a higher level of generality, encompassed by the expression ‘social control,’ in a benign sense, in order to provide a unifying concept within which the activities of police and other agencies can be co-ordinated.’ Sir Kenneth's agent in this project was ‘multi-agency’ cooperation, a buzzword throughout the 1980s in police and Home Office circles. But in his vision, the police would be giving the lead, laying down a ‘clear social policy’. It was crucial that the police maintain ‘operational independence’. Party political interference, he said, rejecting the possibility of a London police authority, was especially to be abhorred. He was trying, he said, to avoid a shift in the balance between freedom and order. But nevertheless: ‘We should not forget that an over-regard for individual liberties can put at risk that sense of order and security without which no community can be truly free.’ Sir Kenneth concluded with a sideswipe at his critics. It was in these very multi-ethnic areas with their myriad problems that ‘political agitators exploit civil liberties issues, and play down the issue of communal security…individual liberties are important, but we must not become so obsessed with them that we overlook the importance of communal freedom.’ Like Sir Kenneth, Sir Peter Imbert recalled the riots of 1981 and 1985, and the conflict between police and ethnic minorities. But the intellectual foundation of his proposed solution was diametrically opposed to that of his predecessor. There were some ‘basic principles’ to be adopted in police/community relations, Sir Peter said. But in seeking to broaden this perspective, there were ‘a number of propositions which police officers need to understand.’ First, he said, ‘the community itself should be the primary focus, not the police.’ The community was not homogenous, but made up of a multitude of different groups with different attitudes and beliefs, while ‘relations within the community, between different groups, are significantly outside the control of the police’. Sir Peter then tackled the Newman concept of an interventionist, social controlling police force directly. ‘Members of the community are themselves in the course of events engaged in a great deal of informal social control,’ he said. ‘It is the community who should, in the main, determine whether police are to be involved in resolving community conflicts.’ As police, he went on, ‘we sometimes quite wrongly assume the monopoly of good ideas on good community relations and good policing…the public have a right to be actively involved in determining how policing is developed’. Sir Kenneth Newman's retreat behind ‘operational independence’ was cast out. The major precepts of his philosophy Sir Peter declared to be: ‘Openness, access, power sharing and the sharing of responsibility.’ Such precepts, according to one senior officer, were in the context of the previous 150 years of the Metropolitan Police, ‘simply astonishing’. Again, developing the idea of power sharing, Sir Peter implicitly criticised his predecessor and his vision of the multi-agency approach. ‘If openness and access are problematic, power sharing is likely to be even more problematic. Early efforts to become involved in multi-agency approaches to crime and associated topics were painful experiences…we wanted to maintain the lead in every forum, to be the gatekeepers of power and have the right of veto if decisons were made which did not suit us.’ Those attitudes, Sir Peter said, still lingered. Power sharing was not an easy path to tread. But it ‘does not mean a surrender of power; rather it involves sharing of the knowledge which allows different interpretations and constructions to be placed on that information and which in turn can lead to a different conclusion and different solutions’. Police must ‘find out from our consumers what it is they require from us, how sensitive we are being to their needs and how satisfied they are with the service’. Polls of Asians, for example, had shown that they felt particularly vulnerable and dissatisfied: it was essential to ‘have the will to act’ on this information when allocating scarce resources. The police, he concluded, must possess ‘an unswerving commitment to communication and consultation within which police and the community are equal partners.’ Well-founded criticism could only be met with ‘a willingness to change’.

NWS NWS-AA3-001 9.38 "Another disturbing chapter in the history of the DTI Notebook. By Alex Brummer THERE will be those who portray the report of the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration on the Barlow Clowes Affair as a triumph for the British system of financial regulation. Yes, of course, they will say, there is clear evidence that the Department of Trade and Industry fouled up badly — maladministration as the Ombudsman likes to call it. But what is really important, it will be argued, is that the system triumphed. As a result of the Ombudsman's vigorous and admirably speedy deliberations, the hapless 18,000 investors who put their faith in the DTI imprimatur will be fully compensated and the integrity of the UK's investment apparatus has been preserved. Moreover, if there was maladministration it is of little consequence now in that the new regime established by the Financial Services Act of 1986 has rendered the DTI's role in this matter redundant. Such muddled thinking partly explains the complacency of the Corporate and Consumer Affairs Minister, Mr John Redwood, who accepted the findings ‘without prejudice.’ This cool response almost certainly reflects legal caution, but also a bland faith in the regulatory system. Even before the report went to the printers, the Ombudsman, Sir Anthony Barrawclough, was told by the DTI's most senior officer that it intended to give its own view, in a separate document, on the responsibilities of regulators. This is the kind of self-righteous behaviour at which Mrs Thatcher's Government excels. The DTI's record in regulatory matters is not an honourable one. Few drivers who bought car insurance policies from Dr Emil Savundra's Fire Auto & Marine in the mid-1960s will forget the culpability of then Board of Trade. Nor will those investors and depositors who in the mid-1970s found themselves caught in a hurricane sweeping throught the secondary banking system after the collapse of Gerald Caplan's London and County Securities. Suffice it to say that the DTI was the supervising authority for such fringe banks. More recently its inconsistent behaviour over the publication of DTI reports into important City scandals has also raised questions of judgment, undue political influence and its due care to the public interest. Tiny Rowland may have become a bore with his obsession over DTI's failure to publish the report on the House of Fraser — but on this occasion he is on the side of the Gods. There can be no sense in the DTI's refusal to publish the House of Fraser report on the grounds that it might prejudice a Serious Fraud Office inquiry when it took the opposite course over Blue Arrow. And while one is busy throwing the rotten eggs, who can forget the duplicity of the DTI over the disposal of Rover to British Aerospace. It would be nice to write that despite these lapses of judgment, not to mention the occasional maladministration, investors and other stakeholders in business do not have to worry because of the safety superstructure which has been built since. But there is little in the current regulatory structure which is designed to inspire the confidence of investors. Indeed, even if supervision of Barlow Clowes had passed seamlessly from the DTI to the Financial Intermediaries, Managers and Brokers Regulatory Association (FIMBRA) there can be no guarantee the warning signs at Barlow Clowes, from intermingled funds to accounting inconsistencies, would have been unearthed. With its unwieldly band of almost 8,200 members FIMBRA is an organisation in serious distress. It is engaged in internecine warfare over the general provision of indemnity insurance for investors. But this dispute, which has seen FIMBRA's Lord Elton off the field, is evidence of systemic problem. The organisation, concerned with financial probity, is continuously in debt because its members refuse to pay the bill for self-regulation. Moreover, its attempts to weed out the next Barlow Clowes are not considered impressive. When suspending members for alleged wrongdoing it tends to act in the dark of night, refusing generally to explain its actions. FIMBRA's incontinence is evidence of a system of self-regulation under stress. With the populous FIMBRA offshoot of the Securities & Investment Board (SIB) bucking against the post-Financial Services Act regime, the whole concept of self-regulatory organisations is brought into question. The Stock Exchange, for instance, has been remarkably successful in doing its own policing — witness the quick action taken in the case of the alleged share ramp at Williams Holdings. But in contrast, the DTI has not been notably successful in bringing prosecutions against insiders based on the dossiers provided — as the Geoffrey Collier case demonstrates. Even the SIB itself appears to be having self-doubts about the unwieldly monster it has created, particularly at a time when the City's self-regulation will have to be grafted on a more legalistic European Community framework. The most interesting observations by the Ombudsman in the Barlow Clowes report concern the DTI's vision of regulation. It points out that the licensing functions were lowly regarded and observes that protection of investors by definition requires a ‘rigorous and inquiring approach’. Such comments about the DTI's effectiveness as a corporate policeman could have been made almost at any time over the last 30 years and in a multitude of cases. Similarly, successive attempts by the City to regulate itself have, as in the case of FIMBRA, ended in disappointment. It is easy to forget, for instance, that the Bank of England is still nursing along the remains of that 1970s darling, Slater-Walker. Financial shenanigans clearly will not be eliminated by new, even tougher legislation to protect investors. There is more than enough statutory law around. What is needed are effective regulators and that is the common thread which runs from John Bloom and Bernie Cornfeld to Peter Clowes and Guinness. Investors deserve a stronger, simpler and more tenacious system of enforcement than self-regulation can provide. It is up to government to finance and provide it — but as far from the DTI as possible."
NWS NWS-A9J-001 8.94 "Midwife at the birth of a state. THE INTIFADA is a people's unarmed revolution against occupation. Its two main slogans, repeated countless times in the directives issued by the underground leadership, are freedom and independence. It has employed a dual strategy to achieve these two objectives. First, a comprehensive civil disobedience campaign was begun by which people severed, or minimised, all the contact points by which they were bound to the Israeli occupation authority. This campaign included resignations of Palestinian officials from public posts, the boycott of Israeli goods and products, and the refusal to pay taxes and fines. Partial and full strikes, demonstrations, sit-ins, conventions…all these have in fact only constituted the outer layer of an inner mechanism of civilian rebellion. The second, and complementary, part of the Intifada strategy concentrated on the construction of an indigenous national authority. As Israel's authority was being lifted, the population began creating an alternative authority of their own. Popular committees were established in villages, refugee camps, suburbs, streets, in fact in every community. Some headway was made in expanding self-sufficiency, whether through utilising more land for agriculture, developing home economies, or encouraging local manufacturers and products. Villages and refugee camps were thus being developed into ‘liberated’ or ‘independent’areas, if not militarily, then at least psychologically, politically and infrastructurally. Bloody clashes would occur whenever armoured units raided these villages, storming through makeshift defensive road blocks and responding to rocks being thrown with live bullets and tear gas; but no sooner would these army units be gone than authority would revert to the village residents. Palestinian flags would be raised on minarets and church spires, road blocks would again be erected, and life in all its aspects would once again be run by the local leadership. The structure of the developing national authority has been both diffuse enough to prevent it from being destroyed by any one single sweep of arrests (there have been more than 50,000 arrests since the Intifada's outbreak), and coherent enough to allow for the existence of a unified resistance strategy. While the entire network of popular committees, local institutions and the general public constitute the field commanders in the battle of civilian disobedience and of constructing a political infrastructure, a rotating Unified National Command acts in the role of field-general, issuing a bi-monthly directive outlining policy and determining specific resistance programmes. A high level of mobility in the structure allows for continuous interchange of roles and ideas, and retains for the Unified National Command the closeness to grass roots that is required to make it truly reflect people's wishes and sentiments. THIS expanded network of popular committees and institutions making up the Unified leadership is infused by tens of thousands of activists who belong to, or identify with, the different factions of the PLO. In effect, therefore, the PLO exists at all levels of organisation within the occupied territories. Thus the Palestinian national movement both inside and outside the occupied territories is an organic whole. The pattern of the Intifada has been cyclical. Thrusts of resistance (mass demonstrations, resignations, tax rebellions, etc) would come in crests. The pattern is determined by a wide variety of factors, including what the Israeli army does. But the relation is complex, not uni-directional. Harsh measures — putting an entire community under an absolute curfew for a continuous lengthy period of time, demolishing homes, uprooting olive or citrus trees, physical intimidation and terror tactics employed by raiding army units, shooting, killing, cutting off water or electricity supplies and telephone links to villages or towns, mass arrests, intimidatory interrogation techniques — can either create a temporary lull or activate an eruption. The army never knows which it will be. It is as if it is walking through a minefield. The wave-like pattern of the Intifada, its pains and sufferings, are all reminiscent of the process of birth. The metaphor is apt, as Palestinians regard themselves as engaging in a process of giving birth to their independent Palestinian state. Through their revolution, the masses are both mother and midwife to the birth of this state. The Intifada is the midwife of freedom. Through it, Palestinians are struggling on a daily basis to shake off Israel's authority and to construct their own. The struggle reflects a revolution in mass consciousness, by which people have come to realise that ideas and aspirations must be embodied in manifest acts if reality is to be changed. Thus, wherever one looks, one finds people engaged in the construction of the blocks that will make up the Palestinian state. It is a conscious effort. The masses are being engaged in the craft of state-masonry. In this process of state building, many stages have been covered. The Declaration of Independence issued by the Palestine National Council (PNC) on November 15 last year constitutes a major landmark along this road. Its significance lies in its double message: that the aim of the Palestinian struggle is the establishment of Palestinian independence, and that this independence is regarded as being not at Israel's expense. This has been a constant theme of Intifada policy: that we wish to build (Palestine), not to destroy (Israel); that we wish to achieve freedom (for our people), not to deprive others (Israelis) of it; that we wish to protect and save lives (ours), not to endanger the lives of others (Israelis). In one of several Intifada leaflets written in Hebrew and addressed to the Israeli soldiers on duty in the occupied territories, the message was repeated: Soldier, go home. Return to your family and children. Be with them in peace so that we may remain with our family and children in peace. We do not wish to harm you, or your state. We wish to be unharmed, in our own state. How can the process of state building be developed? If the PNC Declaration of Independence constituted a major landmark in this process, the time has come to embark on another major step, that of declaring the setting up of a state or government structure. AN ESCALATION of the Intifada in this direction would serve two purposes at once. First, it would consolidate the structures of the developing national authority which is competing to replace the occupation authority. Second, it would consolidate the image and essence of the Intifada as a constructive, not a destructive, force. Naturally, to embark on such a step is not necessarily to succeed immediately in realising it. Rather, it is a challenge. It will be a further challenge to Israel's occupation, conceived in the image of earlier challenges of the Intifada. But it will also be a challenge to us, Palestinians, summoning us to work more energetically towards the idea's fulfilment. It would be a natural extension of the Intifada's dual strategy towards disengagement from Israel, and the corresponding process of state building. It would further naturalise and legitimise the evolving skeletal form of Palestinian independence. It would provide the multitudinous popular committees and activities with a more advanced form of organisation and structure. It would enable better planning and performance. It would maximise civilian tactics of resistance and defuse the natural potential for violence, containing and eventually eliminating the marginal but intrusive phenomenon of collaborator activation by Israeli security authorities and collaborator execution by local Palestinians. It would create a further fact that would put Israel on the spot. Israel's reaction, however hostile, could only further our cause. Arresting or deporting the tens of thousands of Palestinian professionals who would be employed in perfectly apolitical, harmless and humanitarian jobs can only further isolate the Israeli Government. Half-way measures can only imply half-way success. A modus vivendi would also imply success. In general, our policy should be to proceed with building our state block by block, without waiting to be given a gift of it through negotiations. We should regard negotiations rather as the means by which we could establish formal agreements between our state and Israel. Such agreements can range from the issue of borders to the issue of free wave-lengths for our future television and radio networks. In the meantime, we have the capacity to bring coherence and organisation to a whole range of activities, further consolidating the institutional linkage between the people in the occupied state and the PLO leadership. Entire departments can be set up, in health, foreign affairs, agriculture, trade, finance, education, justice, religion, information and social welfare. A pyramid administrative structure, establishing links from popular committees in villages right up to the Executive Committee of the PLO (in its capacity as a Cabinet), can be established. During the Intifada the people have been engaged in building the side walls. A government would provide the roof which would bring these walls together. It would add another necessary touch in the process of creating a Palestinian home. Sari Nusseibeh, a leading Palestinian intellectual, is professor of philosophy at Bir Zeit, the West Bank university closed by the Israelis early last year.

NWS NWS-A31-001 8.13 "Law: Why we must tame the state Leviathan: Greater use of judicial review would help people fight bad decisions by public bodies, Anthony Lester says By ANTHONY LESTER WHEN I began practice at the Bar 25 years ago, phrases such as‘judicial review of administrative action’, ‘public law’, or ‘fundamental human rights and freedoms’ sounded strange to English judges and lawyers. They described apparently alien, un-English ideas, taken from Continental or United States systems. Successive generations of politicians, civil servants, judges and philosophers reared on a meagre intellectual diet of pragmatic utilitarianism and positivism had firmly rejected these ideas as a basis for ensuring constitutional government and citizens' rights. For them, written constitutions, Bills of Rights, and a special system of administrative law regulating relations between government and the governed were exotic, inedible fruits of the American and French Revolutions. According to the conventional British wisdom of the middle of the century, our flexible unwritten constitution, our democratic Parliament, the sense of fair play of our permanent civil service, and our vigorous and vigilant free Press were safer and more effective guarantees of personal freedom than a Continental or American-style ‘government of judges’. A quarter of a century later, the conventional wisdom of British mandarins looks complacent, self-serving, ill-informed, and outmoded — especially in the light of the many serious breaches by the United Kingdom of the European Convention on Human Rights. The powers of British central government are greater than those enjoyed by any other democratic country of comparable size. Between elections, a government with a sufficient parliamentary majority obedient to its will is absolute and omnipotent. Because it is not subject to the paramount law of a written constitution, it can make or unmake any law as it chooses. It can legislate arbitrarily to deprive groups of citizens of their basic rights or freedoms, to enlarge its own powers at the expense of local government, to weaken the ability of the media to inform the public, or to sap judicial independence. It can do all these things without the possibility of legal challenge in our courts. The common abuses of public power are not abuses by the sovereign parliament itself. The more usual examples arise from the misuse by public officials of the powers delegated by Parliament to central or local government, or to the many other bodies exercising administrative powers. Judicial review is the process by which the courts decide whether public bodies have acted within or beyond those powers. When judges perform this essential constitutional role, their task is not to usurp the administrator's functions, nor to stultify good government by imposing legalistic requirements upon him. The court's job is to ensure that the administrator has acted within the rule of law, and has not infringed civil rights and freedoms. But there are significant handicaps facing the individual who wishes to apply for judicial review of the lawfulness of a public body's decision. In the first place, unlike normal litigation between private parties, the applicant has to obtain the court's leave at the outset. This gives the courts a useful power to separate the wheat from the chaff among the pending cases. So long as there is a full right of appeal against a refusal of leave — a right which the present Government sought, at one stage, to abolish — this handicap is acceptable, even though it places public authorities in a more privileged position than the ordinary litigant. A less acceptable handicap is the special rule that the application for judicial review must normally be made within only three months from the decision complained of. It is in the public interest for challenges to the exercise of public powers to be made promptly, so that the administration and citizens alike know what the law is. But it is unjust that the individual's right of access to the courts should be restricted solely on the ground that there has been delay in making the application. As the Law Commission recommended in 1976, the test should be whether the granting of relief to an applicant who has delayed would cause substantial prejudice or hardship to any person or would be detrimental to good administration. What is wholly unacceptable is the denial of justice to the great majority of citizens who are not poor enough to qualify for legal aid but not rich enough to risk the costs of litigating an important public law issue in the High Court, the Court of Appeal, and perhaps the House of Lords. Successive governments have refused to implement the recommendation of the Evershed Committee in 1953 that the costs of going to law over issues of general public importance should be paid out of public funds. As a result, many who are genuinely aggrieved by apparently unlawful decisions by government bodies and public officials are effectively denied access to justice. The number of applications for judicial review has none the less increased significantly over the past decade. The process is now used in all kinds of contexts: immigration, prisoners' rights, homelessness, the closure of hospitals or schools, access to local government information and, increasingly, commercial cases with a public law dimension. The decisions of Margaret Thatcher's ministers are struck down by the courts as often as were those of the Wilson or Callaghan administrations. Ministers and senior civil servants are not amused. Recently, senior Whitehall officials considered whether it would be feasible to curb judicial review. After discreet soundings, they prudently abandoned the idea, which would have involved a major encroachment upon judicial independence. The danger is not that the courts will intervene too much, but too little. With a burgeoning caseload, too few judges, and increasing delays the courts may be tempted to block the further development of the law and to cut back on the advances already made. The recent High Court decision in the Rose Theatre case indicates a restrictive approach to what is a ‘sufficient interest’ to permit an application for judicial review. If that approach prevails in the higher courts, it will amount to a major reverse, making it more difficult for the ordinary citizen to complain of unlawful action by a public authority. In the Lonrho case, the Law Lords in effect decided that the Secretary of State had no duty to give reasons for his decision not to refer the takeover of Harrods by the Al-Fayeds to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. The law requires public authorities to be rational in making decisions. In the absence of reasons, the citizen cannot know whether a decision has been rationally, and hence lawfully made. Every independent committee of experts which has considered the subject has recognised the need to require public authorities to give reasons (the current position in Australia, Israel and the United States, as well as under European Community law). It is regrettable that the House of Lords has not taken a similarly progressive approach. This is not to undervalue the change in judicial thinking which has come about in the last 30 years. From the First World War until the mid-Sixties, administrative — or ‘public’— law scarcely existed beyond the pioneering textbooks of Stanley de Smith and Sir William Wade QC. For 50 years, English judges had been unwilling to nullify government decisions. In spite of the inexorable increase in the powers of the modern state, the judiciary had remained subservient: as executive-minded as the executive. It had been a dark age for administrative justice. Ministers and civil servants were naturally content to let the judges remain asleep. Fortunately, they woke up. Under the leadership of Lord Denning and Lord Reid, old common law principles of natural justice were given new content and value. The judgments in notorious cases which had decided that there could be unfettered administrative discretion were repudiated. Archaic restrictions on legal remedies were eliminated. Understandably, the courts are more willing to review a decision because of the way in which it has been reached than because of its actual merits, or lack of them. To hold that a procedure is unfair involves a less apparent interference with the administration than to hold that the actual decision was unreasonable. But our system is defective because it lacks coherent principles for reviewing the substance of decisions. A decision will not be held to be unlawful because it is ‘unreasonable’ in the ordinary, non-legal sense. Whether a decision is so unreasonable as to be unlawful depends, in Lord Diplock's words, on whether it is ‘so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who has applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it’. A test which requires the judge to ask if the decision-maker has taken leave of his senses is too strict and is scarcely judicial. The European Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Justice (and the Supreme Courts of Canada, India and the United States) apply more sophisticated and properly judicial standards when reviewing the merits of a decision. They consider whether the aims of the decision-maker conflict with basic rights and freedoms, such as the right to equality, to liberty or to freedom of speech. They also consider whether the means used are reasonably proportionate to the aims pursued: in European parlance, ‘the principle of proportionality’. It is this gap between ‘reasonableness’, in the English legal sense, and ‘proportionality’ in the European sense, which leaves the United Kingdom particularly vulnerable before the European Court of Human Rights. Again and again, the European Court has noted the narrowness of the English test for reviewing the merits of official decisions, and has gone on to find a breach of the convention by the UK. Two appeals are pending against the High Court's failure to adopt proportionality as the appropriate standard for review. In one case, Dr Colman, a registered medical practitioner was prevented by the Code of Conduct of the General Medical Council, from advertising the nature and availability of his practice in local newspapers. Dr Colman argues that a blanket ban on all advertising is disproportionate to the council's legitimate aims. The court said that to import proportionality would ‘create a monster that could quickly get out of control and cause widespread disruption of the many administrative processes that might attract its application’. In the second case, journalists are challenging the Government's ban on the broadcasting of words spoken by Sinn Fein supporters. They argue that the ban is a disproportionate response to the mischief which the Home Secretary seeks to control, and is in breach of the right to free expression guaranteed by the European Human Rights Convention. Once again, the Divisional Court refused to apply the criteria used by the European Court of Human Rights. Whatever the outcome of those particular appeals (in which I should declare my professional interest as representative of both Dr Colman and the journalists) it seems inevitable that English courts, indirectly influenced by Europe, will eventually develop coherent constitutional and legal principles to review the substance of administrative decisions. The principle of proportionality — do not use a sledgehammer to crack a nut — is straightforward logic. And in the absence of a modern British Bill of Rights, the European Convention provides a convenient source of Lord Diplock's ‘accepted moral standards’ where fundamental rights and freedoms are at stake. In this way we will move towards a fully developed system of public law which will better serve the interests of the state as well as of the citizen."
NWS NWS-BM4-035 8.35 "News from Alresford Does the town want a new cemetery? COUNCIL ASKS FOR RESIDENTS' VIEWS THE limited powers of the parish council, which are in turn further limited by lack of resources cause much frustration, said chairman Roy Downham at Alresford Parish Council's annual meeting held in the Phair Hall of the Community Centre on Friday evening. There is always, he said, more than needs doing, than can be afforded. Mr. Downham asked the public their views on two subjects currently under discussion. One is the need for a burial ground, as the town cemetery, in St. John's churchyard, is very nearly full, and there is no possibility of any extension. A new ground will be costly and a suitable area will need to be found. He asked if residents wanted a new cemetery in Alresford, rather than use the Winchester cemetery. Water fears The second subject was that two dry winters are inevitably leading towards a summer of water shortages. The council are considering asking the Southern Water Authority to impose restrictions on use of water now rather than wait until matters become really serious. Mr. Downham also presented the financial account, saying that it had been decided not to increase the parish council's share from the community charge, by more than five percent. Reporting for the recreation grounds committee, Barbara Griffiths said that £25,688 had been spent on recreation in Alresford in the past year. The major project, costing £20,698, had been the refurbishment of the play area at the Stratton Bates recreation ground, including new equipment and a safety surface. It has been agreed that the changing rooms at the Stratton Bates playing field needs to be replaced and £10,000 has already be set aside in the current budget towards the cost, which is anticipated to be in the region of £55,000. The Sun Hill recreation ground is in need of similar treatment to that of Stratton Bates. A grant has been requested towards the cost of installing a safety surface and a number of residents have volunteered to form a family fund-raising group to help with providing equipment. This has been welcomed by the council. New lights The shelter and the shed at the War Memorial gardens have been vandalised. The tennis courts at Arlebury Park are to be resurfaced shortly, and the football pitches at both Arlebury and Stratton Bates continue to be well used and are an ongoing maintenance expense. Bill Liddiard, chairman of the lighting committee, referred to new lighting in Station Road, additional lighting in The Avenue, and the proposed changes to lighting in Broad Street. The lights in Broad Street are both corroded and obsolete. Lighting columns now have to be to regulation safety standards, and it is hoped that the new lights chosen will be complementary to the street. Two sample lights have been installed, and plans showing the changes are on view in Eddolls shop window in Broad Street. Members of the public expressed some dismay that the new lighting would be yellow, pointing out that the white light gives a character and atmosphere to this conservation area which should not be altered. Chris Webb reported a quiet year for the planning committee, with only 78 applications, most of them for extensions, alterations and change of use, although it had included plans for low cost housing. A new amenities committee had been formed within the parish council during the year, and chairman Ken Yeldham explained that it had been formed to deal with the things that fell outside the scope of the present committees. Six committees of the new committee had taken place, with a watchful eye being kept on environmental improvements, the need for bus shelters, involvement in finding a place for the youth of the town to meet, and consideration of the difficulties faced by the very elderly and disabled in the town centre. The committee had also carried out a survey of parking problems in residential areas. Currently they are seeking suitable permanent parking places for the local St. John Ambulance vehicles, and organising an official Spring Clean Day on April 4th. Hampshire county councillor Peter Maxwell was at the meeting and he said that the community charge had been set at £237, which is £33 below the government guideline. Winchester city councillor Major Dougie Covill requested that more pressure be put upon the county council to improve the footpaths and pavements which are in a very dangerous condition, and a Broad Street businessman wondered if residents were really aware of the changes going on in Broad Street, and the manner in which they were to be undertaken. The meeting ended with a talk with slides presented by Rod Murchie of the National Rivers Authority. Broad Street changes on show OUTLINES to the proposed changes in Alresford's Broad Street are on display in Eddoll's shop window in the street until the end of March. The scheme was brought about by the need to replace dying trees and a desire for a comprehensive improvement scheme. Princes Street limes have been especially selected as replacement trees, paid for by the town trustees. The first phase will begin at the Horse and Groom end of the street in the coming financial year and later works will proceed when finance and opportunities permit. Key aspects of the scheme will be widening and repaving footways, replanting trees, retaining car parking and private accesses and improving lighting. The town trustees say they would welcome any comments on the scheme. Manuscript evening reveals ‘things not generally known’ FROM memories of a journey through Alresford in the 1920s to a paper on Rasputin, the stories told by members at Alresford Historical and Literary Society's annual manuscript evening held the large audience's attention with their detail and variety. Reg Sanders' ‘Things not generally known’ opened the evening with a mish-mash of information gleaned through some 300 historical reference books. For instance, he said that the expression ‘by hook or by crook’ came from the period of Charles II when there were two judges called Hook and Crook and ‘a man of straw’he discovered, was one who could be brought to bear false witness — recognisable by the straw in his shoes. Ursula Oxley read from the memoirs of Henry Hunt who was born Wiltshire, was elected to parliament, and worked for the repeal of the corn laws. On February 15th, 1835, en route to the west country he stopped at Alresford, was seized by paralysis and died. His mistress, Mrs. Vince, wanted his body to be placed in her family vault, but the family objected, and the corpse was eventually removed to Parham. Some years later, another Henry Hunt, Alresford's famous architect, was born but there is no connection between the two. Mrs. Oxley concluded her reading with three poignant poems about her son that she wrote herself. The Russian monk Rasputin, who was influential in Tsar Nicholas II's court, was the subject of Cyril Flack's manuscript. Mr. Flack's own interest began in 1934 when he was in court for the libel case brought against the MGM film company who had made a film about Rasputin. The case became the standard for setting the difference between libel and slander. Early memories of Northern Rhodesia were the inspiration for Robin Grieves-Cook's manuscript. He remembered small birds cleaning teeth of 14ft. crocodiles and a close encounter when he accompanied a hunter and ‘bagged’ six crocodiles. Motorcycle ride One of the highlights of the evening was Roy Robins' beautifully written ‘A journey through Alresford’. This recalled a journey from his home in Farnham to Dorset by motorcycle and sidecar in the 1920s. His lively description had the audience sharing the thoughts of the small boy as he travelled through Alresford, Romsey, Wimborne and Blandford, and almost feeling his stiff limbs and sore bottom. Elsie Sanders concluded the evening with a visit to West Meon cemetery, to the grave of Tom Lord, cricketer and founder of Lord's Cricket Ground. He retired to Hampshire and died in 1832 at the age of 76. The MCC continue to care for his grave. In contrast, on the other side of the same cemetery is the grave of the Burgess family, where the ashes of the spy Guy Burgess, who died in Russia, were placed. Appropriately, this manuscript was called ‘The Famous and Infamous’. CHERITON CUBS GO FORWARD BEAVERS and cub scouts of the Alresford scout district held their annual football rallies in the grounds of Sun Hill Junior School. Beavers from Alresford, Medstead, Ropley and Four Marks took part in the morning rally. Every beaver played in the six-a-side on two pitches, each one receiving the certificate for good teamwork. Referees were Tim Giles — who organised the event — and Mark Appleton. The cub rally followed with eight teams, two Medstead, two from Four Marks and one each from Alresford, Cheriton, Ropley and the Candover Valley cub packs. In the semi-finals Cheriton beat Candover Valley and Alresford won their game with Ropley. A well fought final resulted in Cheriton beating Alresford 1–0. The team from Cheriton will now go forward to the county finals on April 5th. Referees were district commissioner David Harvey, Alan Pritchard and Bob Rodwell. Live frogs at the club LOCAL GP Dr. Michael Clark was the guest of the Alresford Afternoon Social Club recently. He talked about frogs, with a few live examples, plus some tadpoles. After the talk he was invited to select the best dressed carrot in the club's competition for the month. This was won by Ruby Lansley who had turned hers into a caterpillar. Meditation for Lent ALRESFORD Mothers' Union members were welcomed to their March meeting by Pat Ruffle, deputising for chairman Barbara Jones. The Rt. Rev. Leslie Lloyd Rees led a meditation for Lent, which opened with a hymn and went on to consider the ministry of Christ's passion and resurrection. PLAYING SAFE JAMES Linington, aged seven, Peter Rogers, aged six, and his brother, Alex, aged four, were having fun on the side at the refurbished play area at the Stratton Bates recreation ground in Grange Road, Alresford when it was opened officially by chairman of the parish council, Roy Downham, on Saturday morning. Accompanied by Winchester city councillor Major Dougie Covill, Mr. Downham and Barbara Griffiths of the council's recreation committee, watched children enjoying the colourful new equipment with safety surfaces. The cost of this project to the town has been £20,698 and Mr. Downham hoped that it would not only give much enjoyment, but would be treated with respect by all, so that it can be enjoyed for many years. Second time winner MORE than 100 guests took part in Perin's School Association's table quiz evening on Saturday. Questionmaster was Colin Chard, and there was a break for supper. The winners were Hilary and David Carr, Geraldine and Stephen Pinch, Liz and Peter Petherham and Diana and Edward Woolridge who also won the quiz last year."
NWS NWS-CBM-005 9.22 "‘Bland’ Brooke angers unionists UNIONIST MPs rounded on Ulster Secretary Peter Brooke yesterday after he turned down calls for selective internment in the wake of the IRA bomb outrage at Musgrave Park Hospital. He failed to announce any new security initiatives in his Commons statement on the atrocity, in which two soldiers died, and his words were dismissed by Strangford MP John Taylor as ‘bland generalities’. He said Mr Brooke had nothing to offer the people of Northern Ireland and he told the House: ‘There must be condemnation of those who fail to take on the IRA and the finger must be pointed at the Secretary of State and those behind him. ‘It is this Government which introduced Dublin rule through the Anglo-Irish Agreement and gave encouragement to the terrorists and they're responding in kind.’ The Saturday afternoon bombing — in which 11 people were injured, among them a five-year-old girl and a baby of four months — was condemned by Mr Brooke as an act of ‘cynical depravity’. And he rejected the IRA's ‘callous and cynical’ claims that the building was an operational military base. ‘It is purely and simply a hospital, dedicated to healing and the relief of suffering,’ Mr Brooke said. ‘The nearest security force base is more than a quarter of a mile away and was manifestly not the target of the attack.’ The internment calls were spearheaded by Ulster Unionist MP Ken Maginnis and DUP leader Ian Paisley. ‘The need for the introduction of internment is staring us in the face,’ Mr Maginnis insisted. Mr Paisley spoke of the ‘deep revulsion’ over the hospital bombing and said internment should be a weapon in the armoury of any civilised country. Mr Brooke responded to a demand from Mr Paisley that he would not allow his hands to be tied by Dublin. He said: ‘I give the House a full assurance that, in the event of the introduction of executive detention, it would be carried out by Her Majesty's Government in line with legislation passed by this House.’ He said that bringing in internment would be a very serious step, the consequences of which would be difficult to predict. ‘I would only consider using it in very particular circumstances, and for obvious reasons, I would not predict what those circumstances might be.’ Mr Brooke told MPs that the 20lb Semtex bomb was left part way along a service tunnel between two hospital buildings. One contained orthopaedic and children's wards, and the second wards and other medical facilities administered by the RAMC for servicemen, their families and some civilians. He said that, in addition to the deaths and injuries, the blast caused severe damage to both buildings amounting to at least £250,000. In a newly refurbished children's ward in the Withers Block, debris had fallen on a father who was nursing his baby daughter. Other children in that ward were immobilised in traction. ‘So far, 97 operations due to have been performed early this week have been cancelled and 80 out of 200 NHS beds in the hospital have been rendered unusable. ‘I am sure the whole House will join me in utter condemnation of this appalling attack. But the cynical depravity of this outrage must surely mark one of the lowest points in the IRA's inglorious history. ‘I reject all attempts to justify this attack. Let there be no doubt it has shown the IRA in its true colours. ‘It was an attack on the whole community — on sick children and their parents, on old people whose much-needed operations will have to be delayed, on the medical staff who devotedly care for them, and on the security forces who will continue to defend the community and to bring terrorists to justice.’ Mr Brooke said such attacks would not deflect the Government or the security forces from doing their duty ‘in seeing off these evil men who want to destroy all that is best in our community’. ‘The horrible nature of this attack only underlines that these are the sort of people whom all democrats oppose.’ Shadow Northern Ireland secretary Kevin McNamara backed Mr Brooke, saying: ‘The IRA are not soldiers but assassins carrying out a squalid murder campaign.’ He described the attack as a ‘crime against humanity’ and urged Mr Brooke not to be ‘hustled’into steps which could only aggravate the situation. The attack showed that security force members were at risk all the time and they could now best be repaid by finding a political solution to the Ulster conflict. Mr McNamara said the bombing was in complete disregard of the Geneva Convention, which demanded respect for the wounded and sick. ‘Clearly the IRA has cruelly and inhumanely violated those principles. The members of the IRA claim to be soldiers fighting a just war, but real soldiers are bound by the terms of the convention.’ The Labour spokesman called for a quick decision on RUC requests for more manpower and Mr Brooke replied that he expected to make an announcement very soon. Mr Maginnis, the UUP's security spokesman, expressed disappointment that there was still no indication that the means necessary to disrupt the command and control structure of the IRA were being implemented. ‘The need to intern is staring us in the face,’ he said. ‘For people to suggest that to intern is to bring people on to the streets casts doubts on the integrity of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland. ‘The majority of the community from which I come would welcome internment at this time.’ Mr Paisley, MP for North Antrim, said internment should be used to take out of circulation those who were seeking to destroy, murder and maim. He said there was a cry from all parts of the Province for security policies that would extirpate the IRA. SDLP deputy leader Seamus Mallon said he thought he had seen it all but the hospital bombing had broken ‘every precept of human compassion and morality’. He called on those involved in the political process to play their part by trying to end ‘this terrible spiral of killing and despair’. They all had a bounden responsibility to start negotiations to end the nightmare. Mr Brooke said the summer's inter-party discussions were not peace talks as such, but they were one of the pressures that could be mounted on the terrorists. He backed a call by Tory MP Barry Porter for loyalist paramilitaries not to retaliate. Mr Porter had said if loyalists did so they would get no support from the House or the country. DUP Mid-Ulster MP William McCrea said Stormont minister Richard Needham called the Provos ‘Fascist beasts’. Yet the Government expected unionists to sit in the same council chamber with them. PETER Brooke, right, keeps internment option on ice, despite pleas from unionist MPs, including Ken Maginnis, above"
NWS NWS-K4S-009 8.92 "MICHAEL Heseltine taking a break from passing judgement on the schemes of architects and property developers, has decided to put his own house in order. As Secretary of State for the Environment he has decided the three towered 19-storey building nicknamed the toast-rack which his department works out of should be demolished. The Marsham Street development has been adjudged too brutal for the London landscape and will be knocked down to be replaced by a single six-storey scheme. The move has won acclaim from planners and developers in the capital and envy from property professionals elsewhere in the country, including the NorthEast. ‘It seems like a marvellous solution to ridding a town or city of past mistakes. Just knock down any scheme you don't happen to like and have it rebuilt at the expense of the public purse,’ says independent property consultant Jonathan Landes. ‘If only it could happen in the North-East.’ His call has also been taken up over the past week by those with an interest in property, gleefully listing their own particular regional carbuncles ripe for demolition. Neville Whittaker, the ebullient chief executive of the North East Civic Trust, says the region has so many bad buildings a great deal of it would not be left standing if he could invoke the Heseltine solution. But confining himself to Newcastle he lists a depressing role call of both the mediocre and the plain ugly. ‘We don't have too many large office blocks in the North-East so I'd have to knock down a number of housing schemes . Tyne Towers would have to go, as would Cuthbert and Aidan Houses which surround and dwarf All Saints church. ‘They don't present a welcoming entrance to the city as you come across the Tyne Bridge. Neither does Cale Cross House on the left of the bridge. It's a most unfortunate building that disrupts the Quayside skyline.’ In the centre of Newcastle, Whittaker lists yet more tragic examples of the mistakes made by the planners of the 1960s. ‘Swan House is the best, or worst, example of all. It is a boring and ugly building. What I call T-square set-square architecture. It's not what modernism should be about,’ he says. Further south, Wearmouth Hall at Sunderland Polytechnic is ready for the Whittaker treatment. ‘One of the ugliest buildings of the 1950s,’ he shudders. In York, where the brutalists have not been given their head, only one building seems to attract disgust; the Stonebow shopping and office scheme. Peter Summers, past secretary of the York and North Yorkshire Society of Architects, says; ‘The whole city would like to see Stonebow removed.’ Mainly, he claims for its ugliness and its impact in the nearby Elizabethan Whip-ma-wop-ma-gate. New schemes seem to have learnt their lesson, he adds. General Accident's new riverside offices, for example, are complementary to the city's traditional architecture. Further North Stockton and Middlesbrough would come in for some rough treatment at the hands of Rowland Holmes-Smith, principal of P&HS and chairman of the RIBS Teesside branch. ‘In Middlesbrough it would be easier to say which building I would leave standing! For a start I would get rid of the Cleveland Centre. It does nothing to celebrate the town centre,’ he says. ‘The whole of Coulby Newham and Ingleby Barwick would have to go as well. They both show how we are slaves of the car. We need to get back to understanding the purpose of communities. ‘Stockton's Castle Centre should also come down. It has marred the High Street, and the road to its rear has destroyed all chance of a relationship with the river. We're very good at that in Britain; turning our backs on natural assets.’ George Oldham, Newcastle's former city architect and now in private practice under his own name advocates a more drastic solution. ‘We should go in for wholesale demolition of buildings from the Sixties and Seventies. They are, on the whole ugly and outdated, and architects need the work at the moment. ‘I'm not against tower blocks in particular just the bland. John Hall won't thank me for saying this but the MetroCentre falls into this category. ‘It should have been something superb, he had the site for it. I would like to see it made more exciting.’ Back in town, Oldham dislikes the new St Martins developed shopping scheme which dominates Blackett Street. Despite reams of developer publicity claiming it respects Dobson and Grainger's original architecture, Oldham says it is a mere slavish copy of the past. It is definitely not ‘wonderful’ as junior environment minister Robert Key claimed last month. The litany of plain bad and ugly buildings goes on, but perhaps more depressing than that is the realisation that only one modern building seems worthy of praise. Cummins' engine factory in Darlington, built by Roche and Dinkeloo in the 60s, is the solitary recent building to get a unanimous thumbs-up from all the demolition men."
