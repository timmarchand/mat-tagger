HOC HOC-MY -0.06 " Speed cameras; they're a nightmare! How many times have motorists travelling on unknown roads braked sharply because they encounter the dreaded lines on the road and try to slow down? How much added congestion do they create through making sensible drivers go slower than is practical when roads are obviously clear and safe?      Innocent human life versus an immature desire to drive a car fast.      I know what's more important to me, therefore I have no problem at all with Speed cameras. People that have to drive cars fast on public roads (and therefore endangering others) to get cheap thrills obviously have real problems. No matter what their age, they are just silly little boys.      If more speed cameras help to reduce the number of traffic accidents then there's no question: let's have more. However, the real problem is the attitude of drivers. How many times have you seen drivers exceeding the speed limit until they get to the speed traps and then speed away again afterwards? It's really like a child who knows that s/he's doing something naughty and trying to conceal it. These really are the 'children' who we don't want on our roads.      I think that the governments need to fiddle the figures to make cameras look good tells us all we need to know about their alleged effectiveness. Northamptonshire has claimed a massive drop in deaths, yet the resulting number is little different from their average for the last 5 years.      This issue seems to provoke more people talking rubbish than any other I can think of. The government should make public figures from the Transport Research Lab which show Exactly the numbers of accidents and the causes of them. Another point is that if speed cameras are REALLY connected with road safety they should be painted a more visible colour and not hidden behind signs as they are in Northumbria.      How can people like Joe Llwelyn call the covert use of speed cameras 'entrapment'? I mean it's not like they are encouraging you to speed is it? If you do not know where or when a speed camera is going to catch you, then you will be more inclined to stick to the speed limit. As for all those arguing that speed limits are inappropriate in may areas, this may be true, but it is still breaking the law. If you want things to change then go about it legally, and don't whine!      I rather like the argument that speed cameras shouldn't be used because only 1/4 - 1/3 of deaths are caused by speeding. Knowing that the annual death toll on the roads is about 3,500 people, are you suggesting that just because 2,500 lives a year won't be saved, you might as well let the other 1,000 die too?      I support cameras at accident blackspots but using them as a revenue raiser is just another way of taxing the motorist. We already pay 80% on petrol and VAT on anything to do with cars. What we need is driver education not driver criminalisation. It is far better for the police to stop and talk to a driver about their driving than simply to fine him, a fine teaches the driver nothing, a talk from the police might save a life. Education not taxation.      I agree with comments made by several people about the danger of being cut up, particularly on motorways. The safety issue is the real problem here. There as so many people who rarely venture onto motorways and their inexperience transfers into inappropriate and unsafe driving practices. Speed cameras are not about safety, they are a revenue making device and the DETR report supports such an argument. Cameras can be more useful on traffic lights and near to schools and hospitals. This is where there is vulnerability to pedestrians and other road users. If safety is to be improved concentrate on improving the education of the driver not employing due care and attention while at the wheel.      Anything which attempts to catch those who treat the roads as their own personal race-tracks has to be a good thing. However, the most effective - but perhaps not the most cost-effective weapon against speeding drivers, is the sight of a police patrol car on the road. Also, if there is to be an increase in cameras, make sure that there's some film in them - there are too many which don't even work and everyone knows where they are!!      The problem is not the cameras; it's the inappropriate speed limits. Although the standard driver has not altered since horse-and-cart days, the car - and the roads even - have evolved immeasurably. The fact that motorways are the safest class of road in the UK despite the fact they carry the highest number of actual vehicles at the highest average speeds shows that high speed does not automatically lead to more accidents.      More cameras and greater emphasis on speed limits makes drivers believe that all they have to do to be safe is stick to a limit. Nothing could be more wrong. Safe driving is too complicated a process to be reduced to the simplistic formula ""speed kills"". What about observation? Anticipation? Hazard management? If all we have to do is stick to a speed limit, why doesn't the Government give driving licences away on the back of cornflake packets? Sticking to a speed limit makes you a safe driver in the same way that painting by numbers makes you Leonardo DaVinci.      I agree with a previous comment that stated that tailgating at 70 was worse than driving at 80!! Speed DOES kill. We know that but idiotic driving by a growing number of drivers is just as bad. I would support more cameras and also perhaps CCTV at blackspots to identify those who drive without consideration for others. The fines received will easily pay for the cost of maintaining the system and will make the roads a safer place. Those who drive properly have NOTHING to fear!      If the pilot scheme has reduced accidents by 50%, there can hardly be an argument against them.      I wish we had more cameras here in the US, especially in the larger cities. While there doesn't seem to be a need for them on highways, in heavily trafficked areas and in school and hospital zones, they would be a wonderful addition to the neighbourhood. And, they free up the police to pursue other criminal activity. People laugh at speed traps but they save lives and catch drunk drivers. As for the question of whether they are used for extorting money from motorists, if you break the law by speeding, how can you claim to have a proper fine extorted from you?      Speeding is relative to the road conditions and location. It could well be silly to drive at 15mph outside a school when cars are parked either side of the road,. yet on the same stretch at 3am 50 could well be safe. This cozy middle class attitude that everybody who drives above a predetermined ""limit"" are social outcasts is plain daft. When asked in an anonymous poll whether they went over the speed limits,80% of JPs said they did!! There are also countless cases of locals badgering the Police for cameras only for the Police to discover that 80% of the problem is the locals themselves! The hypocrisy of this approach is mind boggling. Last year the Government's own statistics show that 55 people were killed due to excessive speed-far less than were killed due to secondary infections caught while in hospitals. One last point-the current 70mph speed limit was introduced when a Morris Minor took 500 yards to stop. Dave, UK      I personally would like to see some more detail behind the claims that the introduction of speed cameras has saved lives. I suspect very strongly that the police are using statistics to justify the introduction of these cameras when the figures would probably fallen anyway as a result of improved car safety. Can we see comparisons over the same period where no speed cameras were introduced?      Stop cluttering the country with those boxes that are visible for about a mile and a half and make everybody break like crazy just before approaching them. Do something sensible with our money.      Drivers always complain about rules (eg seat belts). One problem is that when driving you think you ""know"" when you are driving safely, but without really knowing the full facts you can easily be a bigger risk than you think, particularly to those not in a car. Speed limits are there to reduce risks and so should be properly enforced. If you don't like it argue to change the speed limit, not against the enforcement of the limit.      Which is the greater menace on the motorway - a clapped out 20 year old car driving flat out in the outside lane at exactly 70mph on a busy road, with old brakes and equally old tires - or a brand new car doing a comfortable 90mph at 2am on an empty road?      Speeding cars are one of the most common causes of child death in this country. Yet drivers see themselves as the victims, when they are caught.      There are no justifiable arguments against speed cameras. The cost should be met by the people who speed. In Edinburgh virtually no one drives at the speed limit. Commuters coming into town are the worst offenders. Not only do they drive too fast they also drive too close. I would like to see cameras set to catch tailgaters as well.      Real safety measures would involve better driver education. Covert 'battleship grey' Gatsos hidden around corners or on main A roads to catch a vehicle at 5 pmh over the speed limit are only a cynical means of raising funds. If they wanted them to be a real deterrent they would be painted in bright dayglow colours to be seen from a distance.      I agree with the view that most of the cameras are now sited to make money not improve safety. What is interesting to read is the comments of how successful the new scheme has been in catching double or more speeders than before... surely this is wrong, if the scheme was working less people would be speeding, you don't see the police jumping up and down for joy when they have a rise in the number of drink drivers caught over Christmas do you? It seems the success is being measured on how much extra money is being made!      Speed kills and speed limits are there to be observed. It is dangerous, arrogant and selfish of drivers to ignore them      I was once at a seminar held by the police and one of the police inspectors stated that speed in itself does not kill. It is the driver who cannot handle the speed who does the damage. I travel about 30 miles to work each day at speeds up to 115mph in a traffic queue without the danger. (By the way, that is in Germany!) It is the lowering of motorway speed limits which causes more accidents because all the vehicles are bunched-up together and cannot go over the low speed limits. Certainly let us have more cameras but in towns and villages where there are a lot more pedestrians and children who need protection, not on the open roads!      If cameras save lives then surely they must be commended. Here in Victoria, Australia we have had them for many years, I have been their victim as well, and they seem to have the desired effect in traffic speed control.      If speed cameras are so successful at reducing fatal accidents, then how come the fatality rate has started increasing in the last few years - after declining steadily for decades? This, despite an ever-increasing number of cameras on roads with ever-decreasing speed limits. I wonder how many people would still be inclined to stick to the letter of the law if they reduced all speed limits to 10mph.      There should be tougher laws for drivers. Tougher criteria for passing the license examination. If the roads have been turned into a dangerous place than that should tell us something ..people are reckless. Automobile accidents can be fatal and people must be aware that how they drive has an effect to the other drivers.      Several of the above correspondents have complained about 'hidden' cameras and suggested that they should be painted in bright colours as a 'deterrent'. Such clearly visible cameras will only be a deterrent for the short time it takes to drive past them however. Hidden cameras have a far greater effect because drivers don't know where they are, and will consequently drive within the limits all the time to avoid the risk of getting caught!      Speed camera's are a must, cars are too fast and no consideration is made for other road users. camera's are much safer than the concrete sleeping policemen across the road. This is the only way people will slow down.      See these cameras and I perceive only a finger of the hand of the Treasury. One doesn't wish to appear overdramatic about this but speed cameras and sneaking coppers (who should be policing instead of acting as tax collectors) are beginning offer shades of George Orwell's 1984 scenario.      If excess speed only accounts for 30 per cent of accidents, why aren't the ""authorities"" concentrating on the other 70 per cent? Excess age would seem to be a good one to focus on.      It is a fact there is little or no correlation between speed and road accidents, so why are we suffering the blight of the cameras? It is stated by the Government that speed is a contributor to a quarter of all road accidents, and whether you believe this or not, this means it is not a contributor in three quarters. We have the lowest road death rate in Europe and it has dropped steadily over the years. Though any deaths is too many it is clearly going to be difficult to get the death rate lower than it is, and focussing on speed will not achieve it      Speed cameras in inner cities at locations like schools etc. yes..g.reat idea...But in the middle of nowhere,.where there is very little traffic and they are hidden behind trees and bushes and road signs...no.They are unfair, expensive and are only yet another way of taxing and persecuting the already overloaded motorist....The police should spend more resources catching REAL criminals!      Why not cameras in the fronts of buses to catch motorists who use bus lanes?      I agree with Russell. It really is quite simple: The speed limit exists for safety. Adhering to it is the law. If you exceed the limit, you are breaking the law, and if caught will be penalised. Those are the rules. If you don't like them, don't speed. Or better yet, get the bus.      I would point out that the DETR have published the fact that less than a third of all road deaths are attributable to inappropriate speed and therefore this campaign misrepresents the actual findings. The remainder is attributable to driver error, reckless driving and mechanical failure. I see nothing in this campaign which promotes safety on the roads and it does nothing to educate drivers to be more responsible for their driving actions. It focuses upon but one element of driving, inappropriate speed! The individual on the street cannot but see this exercise as a cynical programme by the government and the police to further fleece the motorist, the easy option!! !      Speed cameras are meant to placed only at 'accident blackspots', but many have been placed on open roads. Speed limits are being set too low and the proliferation of these non-discretionary devices will simply criminalise thousands of safe motorists and bring the police and the law into disrepute. Speed cameras are there solely to raise revenue and are nothing to do with safety.      Why not fine the idiotic parents and owners of animals for creating some of the problems. Some children purposefully play games and run riot on main streets and this needs to be controlled as well. As for the insinuation of making money out of cameras, it more or less hits the nail on the head.      With over 200,000 vehicles daily passing Heathrow, the introduction of the overhead speed cameras and the enforced speed limit has dramatically improved traffic flows. In addition, speed cameras in rural towns and villages have definitely led to a reduction of accidents which has resulted in the lowest car fatality rate since the 1920's.      Speed cameras in Britain are fixed. People quickly know where they are and only ""tourists"" get caught. How about French-style cameras that are mobile, and take pictures not of the back of the car but the front, making sure no one caught can deny they were at the wheel.      I've often found that hidden cameras contribute to the 'cutting up' of drivers, as the overtaking driver finds that what was initially a danger free exercise has suddenly become a threat to their licence. Cameras should placed at accident black spots, and be clearly visible. Perhaps then the police would be rewarded with even higher drops in accident figures.      Put more police on foot patrol in towns centres, urban streets and shopping centre car-parks, catch the licence and tax and insurance dodgers, and take their cars away for not having the legal requirements - that may save as many lives as cameras.      In built up areas, around schools for example, they have their uses. The trouble is when they are used on open roads and motorways. The 60 and 70mph limits were introduced when cars were slower and less safe than they currently are. Also, the driving test does not include adequate testing of how to handle a situation at speed. If this was addressed, then motorway and trunk road limits could be raised to 80 or 100mph. Then I would feel happier with the speed restrictions enforced, because they would be, for once, in the places they were needed.      If placed well, cameras could really be effective. Catching someone travelling at 90mph on an empty motorway isn't really helping society (it is just revenue collection or speed tax). However, catching the dork who jumps lights and causes REAL danger could really benefit all. I see so many accidents (in Japan) that could be avoided by punishing the idiots who disobey red lights. What is the problem? Red is red, don't do it!      Cameras are partially effective but not in the way they were intended. Drivers travelling the same road every morning slow down for each camera, drive past and accelerate again. But then, if they know the road, they also know the speed at which they can drive it safely.      The people who get caught are those driving on roads they do not know. This has a sort of logic to it, because anyone foolish enough to speed on a road they don't know is putting everyone at risk and deserves to be caught and penalised.      However cameras don't stop teenage car thieves racing each other at 100mph and killing themselves and their passengers. For that we need real police officers not gimmicks.      Yes, more speed cameras should be installed especially in cities and villages in order to end ruthless driving. Also I recommend installing them on traffic lights as I see far too many people jumping red lights.      The huge increase in the number of speed cameras over the last few years has resulted in a huge profit increase for the police forces responsible. It is a cheap and easy way of raising cash from the already hard done by motorist. Speeding cannot be condoned, although I feel that with the lowest road death rate in Europe, using the ""saving lives"" pitch is a little misguided. The number of battered cars on the roads with one headlight is a joke, what are the police doing about this?      In our democracy, Russell Long, no-one has the ""right to break the law"", but they do have the duty to uphold it. Speeding is dangerous and usually unnecessary, and I would vote for speed cameras every mile and not these ridiculous signs telling us all where they are so that the more moronic slow down for a few miles, and then speed even more later on.      What would be better is for illuminated signs to be put in place, that light up when you are over the speed limit. They use these very successfully in Spain to great effect. If the individual does not slow down, then of course fine him or her.      The idea that motorists, like myself, will ""feel persecuted by the authorities"" is irresponsible rubbish. If I speed and get caught, that's my choice and I accept the responsibility. Whether I agree with speed limits or not is irrelevant - how much effort does it take to slow down?      Speed cameras do nothing to detect people driving without insurance or driving dangerously. Why do the police not give greater priority to protecting our homes and our children. We have become complacent about violent crime while our roads are comparatively safe. Is it because no revenue is generated from detecting or preventing these crimes? Urban speed limits should be varied to suit conditions and the time of day. This would restore some respect for the law in that technology was being used for common sense rather than misused by the authorities. It is about time that the politicians and police understood that they are public servants paid by us, for us, to carry out our wishes. Let's start with zero tolerance to rapists, murderers and child molesters before we use misleading statistics to justify persecuting motorists.      I can't understand why cars are designed so that they can go faster than the speed limit anyway? What's the point of a car that can go faster than 70mph when it's illegal to do so? You might as well put machine guns on the front but say you're not allowed to use them!      Anything which saves lives has got to be a good thing. And if you're not speeding then you've got nothing to complain about! I wish this scheme all the best.      I agree that the number of people speeding has to be cut. But what infuriates me is when I see police hiding in bushes at 11pm with speedguns, and never around during the times school kids are walking to school in the mornings and evenings. Same goes for the Gatso cameras, why hide them, why not make them visible to act as a deterrent? This just spells one thing to me... money making.     Here in N. Ireland they have caught so many motorists speeding that they do not have the resources to cope with it the fixed penalty notices. The authorities have even told Traffic Wardens outside Belfast to ease up on writing parking tickets due to the backlog!      More cameras and stiffer fines. Anybody caught speeding in built up areas, especially in the proximity of areas frequented by children e.g. schools, playing fields etc. should receive an automatic ban, as do drunk drivers.      Russell Long is spot on. Speed limits are there for a reason and cameras are the most efficient way to catch offenders. Interestingly, no-one has tried to defend breaking the speed limits, but rather they complain about the location of them, is this a relative of Not In My Back Yard?      It's all very well having speed cameras, but hiding them, making them appear as dull colours or hanging them out of the back of vans (like the Welsh police do) is nothing short of entrapment.      I am a great believer in keeping to speed limits, but I must confess that on returning to Britain last year, I had a very uneasy feeling at being constantly 'watched'. If this is the only way to force motorists to slow down, so be it, but on the spot fines are very effective on the continent, and at least the 'big brother' tendency can be reduced, also manifested in the 100 000 video cameras spying on the British population.      So, with these so-called ""self-funding cameras"" are the police actually relying on a certain number of speeding offences to pay for them? In which case, are they actually endorsing speeding? To all the speeding motorists out there: keep up the good work, you're making our community a safer one.      Mr Russell Long is wrong. While not arguing for one moment that you are required to abide by all speed limits and other road traffic instructions, you do have the right to question the justification for the limit, parking ban, etc. in the first place. Why is parking so rigorously controlled and banned in the UK.      Why not have speed cameras for slow drivers on trunk roads? These drivers never let others pass and cause others to do risky overtaking? Speed cameras themselves should be switched on with variable speeds as per road conditions (like the M25). I am fed up with seeing good 60mph -70mph roads calmed to 40mph with cameras when it is safe to do the faster speed at certain times of the day.      In Kingston, Surrey, recently I was given a parking ticket for overstaying my welcome at a parking meter for just ten minutes. The fact was the kids had been slow eating their lunch and I had taken longer than I thought. It will be of no interest to the court to know that I had injected several hundred pounds into the local economy that morning by doing my shopping in the local stores. Basically, the local authorities are having a bal N    If speed cameras are to be used as a deterrent why aren't they painted in brighter colours? There is also the issue of inappropriate speed. Most agree that speeding in urban areas is more dangerous than straight, open A-roads. So why do I see so many cameras on stretches of open road with few or no houses and no pedestrians?      Speeding in itself is not always the problem - tailgating at 70mph is much more dangerous than driving at 80mph on a deserted motorway. Perhaps cameras should be developed to fine drivers who do not maintain appropriate distance instead.      If they were used properly then I would say yes but in a lot of cases these cameras are set up in areas were it is blatantly obvious they are being used for extorting money from motorists. I have seen these cameras on long, desolate stretches of road were they can do no possible good. In built up areas they're fine but unfortunately they are often used to once again persecute the motorist.      Sadly yes we do. If drivers cannot use their common sense to drive at a safe speed, then they must be forced to. Speed cameras should however be used as a deterrent and not as a trap. What is the point of catching someone after the crime when it can be prevented in the first place? Putting cameras behind bushes etc. is ridiculous.      You've only got a reason to complain about speed cameras if you're speeding. In our democracy everyone has the right to break the law, if they so wish. Speeding is still breaking the law. But if you get caught, you have to live with it. There's no point complaining. I got a parking ticket for parking in the wrong place whilst I went to get some money out of a cashpoint. I parked in the wrong place, took a chance, and paid for it. It's the way it goes. On a more vindictive note, it does give me some sordid pleasure to watch the nutter who just cut me up at 60mph get caught in the speed cameras.      More speed cameras and a lower speed limit please! Motorway speed limits are continuously broken by maniacs who have no regard for their, or anyone else's, safety. Cameras are vital, and save lives. Car drivers are, in the main, arrogant to the point of stupidity when it comes to speed and must be slowed down.      I am 31, I have 20/20 vision and my car has good tyres etc, yet I am the one targeted by police and their cameras, whereas a doddering 90 year-old with undetected cataracts, an Austin Allegro with rubbish tyres and drum brakes at 65mph will stop slower than I at 90 mph, you guess who is the more dangerous driver? It is purely yet another tax on the already abused motorist. Also driving with eight kids having a party on your back seat or using a mobile are far more dangerous than 85 mph on a motorway yet when do these offences go punished? Hardly ever! "
HOC HOC-BG -0.16 " It seems like yesterday when I saw you in concert in 1965, since I saw you in San Francisco in 1967, in concert in 1974, since I ran into you in Central Park in 1984 and I looked up and noticed it was you and said, ""Hi George"", and you smiled and said hello. All things must pass, I will never forget your music and the love you have shown. There is no more weeping for you as you have gone to your God but your guitar still weeps. Pray for us all George and say hi to John.      I play in a band and I've been several times to Liverpool to perform at the Cavern. All things must pass but George will live forever.  Though I've never met George, I feel like I have lost a dear friend. He will be sorely missed. I play guitar just for fun, and almost always find myself going back to Beatles songs to play. George has left his mark on millions of people, and will continue to be an inspiration to guitarists, both fledgling and virtuoso alike. Thanks George. Hare Krishna from an atheist.  I got into the Beatles when I was 8. My sister was at college when John was murdered. The radios played non-stop Beatles and my sister decided she liked the music and bought some albums. She brought the albums home the following summer and I got hooked. Hopefully some good will come of this and young people will be introduced to the Beatles. BTW my first child was born earlier this year - named ""Harrison"" of course.  George to me was the best Beatle with my most favourite work of his being ""All the things must pass"" a truly amazing triple album. A huge gap has now been left in the music world. My thoughts go out to his family and Paul and Ringo.  A very sad day indeed. A hugely talented man. A great guitarist and wonderful songwriter in his own right. Lived in the shadow of the Lennon and McCartney phenomenon but the likes of Something, Here comes the Sun and Taxman stand up against anything they wrote. I personally thought the Wilburys were great fun too and wrote some great tracks. I'll be reminising with my ""LP's"" tonight. Goodbye George.  I was living in Paris and I was ten when I heard ""I saw her standing there"". All my life has been backed by the Fab Four's music. Yesterday night, my kids - 7 and 5 -were watching Help. A door shuts on my youth. Goodbye, George. God bless you and your wonderful sound. Your songs are here to remind us how life can be pleasant and peaceful. Thanks for all.  I am just another faceless Beatles fan, but I will truly miss George Harrison. I loved everything he did in and especially after the Beatles. His music was an inspiration.  Today, Liverpool has lost one of it's finest sons who gave oodles of pleasure to millions of fans all around the world. Always a dark horse, he used his immense talent to benefit good causes, quietly and true to his beliefs. As the flags fly at have mast in Liverpool, the city he left to conquer the world with music, George has continued his journey into the next life. Those who knew of him are united in their sorrow of his passing, ""This is Love"" George. God Bless.  I'm so heartbroken that George has passed even though I know he's in a better world now. I just hope it's at least another 21 years until we lose another Beatle. My heart goes out to all his family, friends and fans.  I saw the Beatles live only once - in Blackburn as the main support to Roy Orbison! In those days, George was the only one with any real skill on his instrument. His songs demonstrated clearly the wonderful lyrical gifts he expressed all too rarely on Beatles tracks. John Lennon was always the media choice as the thinking Beatle. For my money, George always did it quieter but better. His concert for Bangladesh was a remarkable individual achievement - still unequalled, even by Sir Bob. A very fine musician and a very fine man. Cheers George.  In a world where manufactured falseness and fakery are strangling the life out music, and where band can't go anywhere without spilling beer and behaving badly. George Harrison stood out as a shining beacon of respect and dignity. His music and now his legacy will outlast any boy band or vocal group that clogs up the charts. A true genius has been lost.      I saw the Beatles in Detroit in 1964, then saw and heard them grow - so much because of the soulful influence and spiritual journey of George Harrison. I lost my father recently to cancer and so also rejoice for George that he is released from all of that and know that his spirit now can fly. In the '60s we thought we could change the world. George certainly did change the world with his sweet music.  You were never in the shadow of Paul and John as far as I was concerned, my eyes always went to you, I fell in love with you and your music when I heard ""Not a Second Time"" as a young girl.  My first 6 months in boarding school were hell cause I missed home a lot. Somehow 'Here comes the Sun' always made me feel better then and now whenever I listen to it. It's a song of hope. 'My Sweet Lord' is a humble song of yearning to know somebody or something greater than you ever will be and 'Something' is probably the best love song ever written, it's so sincere. We'll miss you George. Rest in peace and thank you for the music and the memories.  This is absolutely true: I woke up startled early this morning. I didn't know why. I turned on my computer and slipped a Beatles CD in as I logged onto the web. Needless to say, I was shocked to read the news of George's passing as the CD automatically began to play. I'm shaking as I write this and the tears are uncontrollable. George Harrison, you were appreciated for the music and moments you brought the world, now you will be missed for them.  He not only gave us great music, but he cared about the world. Those of us who were old enough will never forget George's concert for Bangaldesh - the first time rock music got together to help the poor and suffering.     Thanks for everything mate and God bless you  We only know you through our parents but thanks for all the wonderful music sounds that you brought to us. Your music will stay with us forever.  Someone once asked me the question which of the four Beatles I though my own character was closest too. I immediately thought of George. Although he wasn't the most glamorous or outspoken of the four, there was a quiet strength to him that I identified with straight away. I think everyone has a favourite Beatle, George was mine. The great loss of a kind and talented man will be felt by millions - and somehow selfishly more so by me.  A truly sad day for anybody with a remote interest in music. Hopefully he will receive a fitting memorial which he deserves. Rest in peace George  George's death has meant that a light has been extinguished on Earth and relit in Heaven. Goodbye, George - you were a true genius and life without you will be all the more harder to bear.  My favourite Beatle is gone. I don't know if I'll ever be able to listen to the song ""All Things Must Pass"" without shedding a tear from this moment on. It has taken on new meaning. I was too young to have appreciated the Beatles when they first came out, I wish I could have been old enough to understand just what a phenomenon the Beatles were (and are today).      I want to thank George for the wonderful music he left us. We will treasure it always.  George played lead guitar on the soundtrack of my adolescent years. Thanks for all the help through those years and for all the memories.  Both my husband and I have grown up with the music of the Fab Four since the 60's and have tears in our eyes today reading all the wonderful tributes to you from all around the world. A quiet and lovely man. Say a big hello to John. Condolences to all your family and to Paul and Ringo. You will be greatly missed by all your fans. God Bless.  George, your spirit and music will always be with us and take us back to many happy times in our lives. May you at last be happy with the Lord.  Growing up I was so enamoured with the Beatles I made cardboard guitars with broomstick handles so that I could sing along and act out as the Beatles. Peace be with George as you continue your journey.  I would like to thank the city of Liverpool and also your beautiful nation for giving us George and the Beatles. He has touched so many lives all over the world and so many are now grief stricken at his passing. Our grief is lightened only by knowing that he is now at peace and with the God he strived for throughout his life.  I'm grateful to anyone, that is happy or free for giving to me hope while I'm looking to see the light that has lighted the world. Now you are a part of the light and lighting our world. I'm grateful to you. Thank you George. Rest in peace!  Very sad to hear of his passing. Was just in England and Liverpool. I remember that era as the best part of my youth. So much fun! The music has never been topped by any other entertainer.  You said Hello, the world said Goodbye and thank you.  All the world's a stage and the world was your stage. We'll all miss your poetic sounds  There's no words to express what I feel. I had this last deep hope of George's recovery. I suppose God needed the best guitar man around...How can I say goodbye to a friend that was always, every day with me all my life?      My father, (G.J.Peat), who was an electrician maintenance manager of Blackler's Store in Liverpool, used to tell me of his apprentice who played guitar in a local group. One day he came home with a cautionary story. The young man had told my father he was quitting work to go with his group to Hamburg. ""George Harrison"", my father said, ""Mark my words. One day you'll crawl back on your knees pleading for your job back!""  To me, George was a true disciple of music art, and masterfully practiced his craft. Listening to his songs raised my spirit during many dull ""absurd"" moments. In all the Beatles fame, George felt diffidently sufficient simply to be a musician; a lesson that humanity may well benefit from. Since our ""intelligence"" rises with us to the next world when we pass, I'll be very interested to see how George's art progresses in the world to come.  1963 Finsbury Park Astoria (It used to be called that) was where I first saw the Beatles, I was 13. My dad queued for 4 hours to get the tickets (I was ill at home with tonsillitis) I still have the programme, I remember going deaf for a while afterwards and losing my voice, having had the best ever experience at my first music concert. It was love at first sight and still is. My children now 25 and 23 have grown up with the Beatles music and know all the words too! Thanks is not enough, but your family and friends know that you will have floated up to heaven on all the love coming from the world right now. God bless, John is there waiting for that reunion.  I was there in those early Cavern days when you would talk to us at the lunch-hour sessions. You were a gentleman then and have remained one throughout your life. God Bless you George for the pleasure and happiness you brought to the lives of us 60's Liverpool kids.  How appropriate that it is grey and raining today. Goodbye George...and thanks.  Don't mourn his death. Celebrate is his life through listening to his music  He was one of those rare artists whose music could touch your soul. As the Beatles' music evolved so did my respect for Harrison increase. He was an accomplished guitarist who had the humility to appreciate other instruments from alien cultures like the sitar. Quite early on when the hippie movement was more of a fad his quest for inner peace came through in a refreshingly and surprisingly sincere way. He had carved a unique position both as a human being and as a musician.  I just heard - this is so terrible. Not long ago I visited the tiny house he lived in when the Beatles first got together, and was moved by the reminder of George's working class background. Yet he went beyond that and did so very much. I'll miss him.  I read the news today - Oh, boy! And wept awhile, with trembling smile, happy for all the joy that he gave us. My living heroes become fewer and fewer...  At the moment George died I was listening to his music at a Bootleg Beatles concert. When we shouted 'We love you, George' we really meant it. I'm glad he had a quiet, loving and, most of all, private death. He was so loved and respected and will be missed so very much. God bless you George.  I was born a month after John died and as a huge Beatle fan, I can say that you and John, Paul and Ringo have contributed to the world of modern music like no one else. There will be no other group like the Beatles. I expect sales of your solo albums will go up and you were a talent. All my friends' mums said that you were their favourite Beatles. My heart goes to Olivia, your son and all of your family. Paul and Ringo have to go through heartache with losing a college and a friend all over again. A legend. Rest in peace Sweet Lord. Your guitars gently weep with the loss of someone who knew to play them well.      George Harrison was a great performer and shall be missed. I loved his songs such as My Sweet Lord and Got My Mind Set On You. At least he is now at peace and with Lennon. Maybe they are together having a beer or two  You may wonder how far can the Beatles legacy can go, well here is your answer: I live in the furthest corner of the world an yet we are very sad about the death of George Harrison. My mum was a huge fan of the Beatles and I, 20, inherited that passion and listened to them as one of the world's greatest musical legacy. George's death will be long mourned all over the world because he was one of the pillars that kept the British music together, although he was introverted. I send my deepest condolences to his family and to the British people, who have brought up in their homeland one of the greatest musicians the world has ever seen.  Heaven must be having a party tonight  When I was a junior high school student, I put a Beatles cover band together with my friends, and I was George in my band. I bought a white Fender Stratocaster just because George was playing the same guitar at the Concert for Bangladesh. It is still my main and the most precious guitar of mine. George is my favourite guitarist and he inspired me a lot. Thank you for your inspiration  A World with only two Beatles alive is not a good one. We will miss him as much as we miss John.  While I'm only 30 years old, I remember going through my moms record collection when I was just 5 years old, which was at least 400 albums. She must of had every Beatle album they made, and I listen to them to this day. He will be missed by everyone.  The Beatles started out wanting to make good music. They definitely did that, and without intending to do so, they have made a massive contribution to everyones lives. It just goes to show what an effect they have made when a lad from Hunts Cross can trigger the reaction and emotion that has been seen today. Liverpool mourns today with the rest of the world for a great man. Keep playing George.  George was the man who made me doubt about atheism. Until nowadays I reserve a piece of my thoughts to faith despite my scepticism, thanks to him. He was not just a singer, guitarist or songwriter. He was a Beatle. That should resume everything in its greatness. Be in peace, my guru.  I didn't know that George has died but something drew me to listen to 'The Great Gig in the Sky' by Pink Floyd last night. I must have known a great spirit had left my life. I will miss his music but I'm sure John will be glad to see him again.  Having just lost my mother to this terrible disease, George's death is making me feel sad. If everyone who reads these messages could contribute a little to a cancer charity, I'm sure George would have approved.  Truly awful news. A great, versatile, highly influential and much underrated guitarist. He was the link between country blues/rockabilly guitar and the blues boom of the late 60s. He was also one of very few players to develop an instantly recognisable slide guitar technique. A great songwriter and a humorous and spiritual human being, George is a huge and sad loss to music and to the world.      Thanks for all the music and love you gave to everyone. Your songs and music gave so much to us all. Be at rest, blessed be!  George Harrison seemed haunted by his fame which always struck me as a very human reaction to the massive public interest in his life. His music is his legacy and we must be thankful for that. A lot of his work never received the attention it deserved - particularly his distinctive bottle-neck guitar playing. I was lucky enough to be at his Royal Albert Hall gig in 1992 - it turned out to be his one and only solo appearance in this country. It's a memory to cherish. He may be gone but the music lives on.  I was 11 years old when I picked up a guitar. I wanted to be a Beatle, I wanted to be George Harrison. 30 years later I'm still playing your songs. Thanks George. God bless you.      I remember we, Moscow University students, organised a meeting in memory of John Lennon, December, 1980. For that we spent some time in prison. Now George... They were teaching us to be free. And we are.      We were in England, I must have been 10, and my father got Sgt. Pepper's from Ravi Shankar, a family friend. It changed my musical tastes for ever. Thankyou George for being true.      I came to know about George Harrison when I first saw his ""Concert for Bangladesh"" in Bangladesh. Since then I have a special respect for this great personality with enormous talents. I would like to express our deepest gratitude to George on behalf of Bangladeshis for supporting us to achieve our freedom. May Almighty bestow peace on his departed soul.      A Hard Day's Night was the first LP I ever owned and I have fond memories of listening to many great Beatles's songs. Thanks George.. for ""Something"" and ""While My Guitar Gently Weeps""; but also, for your great spiritual attitude to life .. and death.      I was born in 1976 - far too young to have experienced the Beatles first hand. But thanks to my pop loving dad, the Beatles WERE the musical backdrop during my younger formative years. Thanks, George, for the joy and happiness you and your three mates gave my family with your music. We shall miss you.      He was an enlightened spirit who touched us all with his serenity and creative heart. Although it's sad for us all, I'm happy for him. He's truly home with universal loving consciousness, which he was always a part of.     Thank you for your spirit to all the world. Thank you also for the beautifull music.      I screamed in Brighton at 15 - and weeped in Southampton at 53. You gave freedom to feelings in a world where emotions were taboo - so it began and so it ended. So loved by everyone.      I saw the Beatles at the Apollo, Manchester in the 60`s.Four young lads looking as if they were having fun. That is how I will remember George.      i want to express my deep regret and that of many spanish people by the death of one of the greatest singers of the last century.      George has moved and stirred so many good things in my soul that I can't but thank him.      Yes something does seem different - knowing that a great man has passed. I wish everyone could be more like George Harrison. He was truly a great man who acknowledged the beauty of music and enlightenment.      WeALve lost one of the Fab Four, and this is a great lost for the Music, but he leave us his music, and thatALs a treasure for the human being      George your pain is over now. May you rest in peace. I can picture you now jamming with John up there. Thank you for writing Something. Old blue eyes was right when he said that Something was one of the most beautiful love songs ever written.      I thought that if anyone could bring the Beatles back together for just one more concert or record that it would be George. Then John was murdered and that left three, and even then as George became a great solo artist, I thought that he could be the one to bring the last three surviving Beatles together. Now he has been taken away from us and as John once said: ""The dream is over."" RIP George, I hope that you are seeing ""Our Sweet Lord"".      Thank you for the music. Miss you, man.      You're gone but thank goodness the music remains. You'll choose your next life yourself. You deserve it. Thanks, George, I'll never forget you.      We'll miss you George here in Japan. I was only eight days old when the Beatles came to Japan. Your music changed my life so much. Because of the Beatles I learned to love English and see a whole new world. My husband is a Liverpool-born Irishman who plays the guitar and we have a great life together. I wonder if I'd have had the same life I have now if there had never been any Beatles. We miss you but you already did so much for us. Thank you George from Megumi, Martin, Leo and Ken.      I'm listening to a tribute programme on Dutch radio while writing this. In the last hour some very memorable songs were played. He was truly a great musician and songwriter. It's a comfort that through modern technology his music will be able to live forever. He will be sadly missed and I pay my respect to Mr Harrison for all the great music and films he gave to the world.      Thanks George for your beautiful music and your great big smile. Peace and love to you. You're going to be missed but definitely never forgotten.      Half of the magic's gone. George, thank you for leaving such a priceless legacy. May your memory carry on for centuries and the tears turn into a sweet smile.      If you loved George then throw away your cigarettes forever. He'll be watching from up there, if he's not jamming with John, and he will smile.      Thank you for your music, inspiration and imagination. You will be missed but not forgotten.      When John died I felt that part of me had died too. Now George has gone to the great gig in the sky and another part of me has gone. The Beatles meant so much to a generation, and offered us hope for the future. That hope's fading every time one dies.      George Harrison has been a bridge between different cultures and generations. Some of his best work is still underrated - all that wealth of music in his solo output. His music has enriched my life and that of so many other people everywhere in the world.      Like most people my age, I grew up with the Beatles. In fact, three friends and I always kidded ourselves about how much we seemed to resemble the characters of the Beatles. When John died in New York in 1980, we were stunned. But when one of our gang died in 1995, we turned to the Beatles to soothe the pain. Because each of my other friends managed to take the other Beatle roles, I was seen as the George of our group, the one who was the most serious and spiritual. Over time, I came to relate to his music in a special way and cannot listen to All Things Must Pass without being moved. I cannot help feeling as if a part of myself has vanished with George's passing. I will miss his spirit and his inspiration.      George will forever be in our hearts and minds. I was fortunate to see the Beatles on stage in the mid 60's while on holiday in Yarmouth. Let us all allow him to rest in peace.      Thank you George. Your music and spirit will live forever.      There must be a lot of fifty-somethings around the world who, like me, feel a personal loss on hearing of the death of George Harrison. Maybe a George Harrison memorial concert in aid of Afghanistan is just too obvious a tribute to a man who cared deeply about the less fortunate and who, more or less invented the concept of the fundraising rock concert.      George was a great man who will be remembered over the centuries to come. His music will live on forever. But people will also remember him as a man who searched for God, for love, and for peace in this world. Without George Harrison the world would have been a very different place. Thanks George. We love you.      Even though Mr Harrison was a private man he was larger than life. In tribute to him, my department at work is holding a fundraiser and the proceeds will be going to cancer research in his memory. My thoughts and prayers are with Olivia and Dhani at this time.      Simply a great man. May he rest in peace. ""Now my guitar gently weeps.""      George once made a song called the Art of Dying. He passed away with as much dignity as he lived his life. I thank him for the wonderful music and for being a fine human being. Tonight my guitar gently weeps for George.      George Harrison was the best Beatle. He was my idol from the day I heard one of his songs until he died tragically yesterday morning. He will be in my dreams forever more. He will be truly missed. Here's to the greatest Beatle ever.      Thanks for the music, George. You'll always be number one!      George, I'm 24 years old, like Dhani. I want to thank you for all those years ago you gave us and I'll remember you forever. God bless you.      George was a true legend. He was as great as Lennon and McCartney. His song writing was unique and his guitar playing was filled with emotion. He will remain in our hearts and minds forever. God bless you George.      On arriving at the gates of Friar Park, George Harrison's home in Henley on Thames, I was amazed to be the only one there. I checked the time on my mobile phone display, it was still only 8:50. I took a few minutes to look at the many cards, pictures and poems that people from all over had lovingly placed by the wall among glass jars with candles inside them, some decorated with coloured beads. As I looked, it became more and more apparent that those who listened and appreciated his music truly felt a connection with him. Some of the words were very personal, perhaps from friends, but I suspect they were from ordinary people like me, people touched by his music, maybe even his spirituality.     George Harrison was a musical genius and an inspiration to all young aspiring groups and music lovers all around the world. I grew up with the music of the Beatles - it was great stuff. They were superior in their field, and they were four great lads. It was a joy to have been part of such musical history. Our thoughts and love are extended to all George's family. We will miss him greatly.      Sorry to see you leave us but John will be waiting for you.      I'm only 15 years old and yet I still feel that I've lost a friend. I grew up listening to his music and the Beatles. He truly was the best musician I've ever known      Thank you for the memories. You shall forever remain in our hearts and thoughts. May you rest in peace.      There was something in the way he was that made the Beatles the best pop group ever and the world a happier place to be.      The Beatles showed me the meaning of music and today I couldn't live without it. It's with me everywhere and always. Some of my most beloved songs were written by George Harrison and through his songs I have found strength and joy at hard times. My heart is full of music everyday but today it will be full of respect for George and his work. Certain beloved songs will echo in my heart forever since it is divided into four: John, Paul, George and Ringo. Thank you George. Rest in peace. Condolences to family and friends.      I am going through exactly what I went through when I first heard of John's death: It can't be true, I said to myself. My deepest sympathies to his family, Paul and Ringo. I can't seem to get rid of the heaviness I feel in my heart. I am at work and am trying to fight the tears. I shall morn you tonight with your music. Thank you George for giving me some wonderful years in the 60s.      Thank you George, for all you gave to me. All things must pass. See you later.      It is so unfortunate that we only realise what special people we have in our midst when they leave us. A man who was hidden in the shadow of Lennon and McCartney for so long came into his own after the break up of the band. ""There'll come a time when most of us return here, brought back by our desire to be a perfect entity"" - The Art of Dying by George Harrison, 1970. Thanks George for all of your music. If only there were more like you!      The Beatles showed us what a diverse range of music can be accomplished within a single band. And George Harrison is the one who brought a lot of it to the fore. He began by showing John how to play guitar and reached the pinnacle by playing sitar at his concert for Bangladesh. They all reflect his talent in music and his true love for humans. And yet he was the most underrated Beatle. Among all the Beatle members, George Harrison was the one who wasn't really all about being famous. It was his dedication to music that separated him from the other Beatles and made him truly extraordinary.      Thanks George for all the great music you made. I love you like a big brother and I'll miss you so much      Thank you, George. I loved your music the most.      I miss you already man! Have a good trip. And thanks.      George Harrison has always been an idol to a lot of people around the world, not just because he was one of the greatest musicians but also because he always stood side by side with the common people. I am from Bangladesh and his concert for Bangladesh in 1971 heightened the world's attention to the plight of my country and helped us a lot to spread our desire for independence. We here as Bangladeshis bow our heads to this great human being and show our respect for him.      I think I am getting old. When I heard the news I cried and I am not ashamed. It's as if I have lost someone I know. I never met him, never even saw him, he actually belonged to my parents generation but I am going to miss him. Why does God take away good people. I guess he likes the Beatles. Well listen Lord you've got two and we've got two, so shall we call it quits? George we'll miss you.      One of the things that I most admired about the Beatles was that even at a very young age, with the world at their feet, they were searching for the next level. George Harrison was a big part of that and he will always remind me that one should never stop reaching and learning, especially when everyone around you feels you have made it. A beautiful person that I will always admire.      Thank you George. You've made our lives brighter.      In our shared sadness, let us fulfil his will to love one another. This man was underrated, understated and superb at his craft. A good man has passed too soon. My heart gently weeps.      When my mind strays to my earliest memories, they're always punctuated with Beatles songs. George, John, Paul and Ringo, thanks for giving me the soundtrack to my childhood. George, God bless and keep you.      The Beatles were at the centre of my growing up. Each and every song to this day brings back treasured memories. Their music, for me, stands by itself and is irreplaceable. I feel very lucky to have been around when they were. I think of each of them as older brothers that I did not have. Today I feel as though I have lost another brother. Rest in peace George, I'll never forget you.      All things must pass, yes, but oh how I wish it wasn't so. George Harrison, the Beatles and their infinitely great music have always had one of the greatest influences of my life. I will respect a moment of silence in his honour.      It was great to be a teenager in the 60's and savour the Beatles experience first hand. I was one of thousands of American kids who learned the guitar after seeing them on television and George playing that Gretsch. It was all so cool. I am so sad we have lost another member of the greatest band in rock history. George, your music and spirit will live forever in our hearts. God bless.      You inspired me to play. You are my piece of the rock. God bless you George Harrison.      He was a very special person and a wonderful songwriter, and will be very deeply missed by us all. I believe the most important things in life are friends, family and faith and to my friends and me this was what George represented. His songs and style have been the source of so much inspiration, I wish I could thank him - maybe one day I'll be able to tell him face to face. Let us not only mourn his death, but also celebrate a wonderful man who enjoyed his life, as we should.      It can be truly said that we really are unaware of how important we may be to each other until the moment comes when we find ourselves forever separated. George Harrison - the man and his music, have given me strength during the most painful and hopeless periods of my life. He has taken a little bit of me with him. To his friends and family I am deeply sorry for your loss. With genuine love and concern.      George Harrison was really a great spiritual person. His interest in and devotion to Indian spirituality and Eastern religions made him win many admirers in India. He will be remembered forever by his great songs and his charity work. May your soul rest in peace, our dear George. The angels in heaven will compose a song for you dear George and welcome you to be with them. There you can pray for peace in the world.      George may have been the quiet Beatle but when the world needed to hear about the tragedy in Bangladesh he was the first to stand up and shout. Perhaps it would be fitting that he be given the title ""the Beatle with heart"".      Even though I was only fourteen when the Beatles hit North America, I will always remember George as the one who was always in the middle -between Paul and John. I think that he was the one that really kept the band together by simply being the one in between. I will miss you man. Why do the good always have to go so young?      Now you can see now how much the world loves you. Thank you for all the happiness you gave us.      Today I am 53 years old, living in a very little country in South America, and I can tell you that what George taught us about love has no price at all. He had real authentic love for humanity.      It is hard to read these beautiful tributes with rainy eyes! You touched so many lives, George and I hope somehow you always felt all this love and concern.      I remember the very first 45 that I bought as a 10 year old, My sweet Lord, every time I hear this song it brings back great family memories - even more now that I live so far away from my family. Thanks George.      On behalf of the Bangladesh community in Berlin my sincerest heartfelt condolences to the family and friends of George Harrison. My lifeline passion for the Beatles was made richer and more pleasurable by his music. His message of freedom through ""The Concert for Bangladesh"" during the war of liberation in 1971 revealed a man of the most delicate sensibility. I pray for the eternal peace of his departed soul.     I'm just very sad. Earlier today a friend of mine lamented: ""What kind of world only has two Beatles?""      My first contact with your music was as a six-year-old walking home from school singing Beatles songs. Since those early years you have had an impact not only on me but on countless of millions. In many ways you encouraged us to discover our spiritual boundaries. The world has been a richer place for you living. May you rest in peace.      I am listening to the Beatles right now. I was never around when they were at the height of their fame but I know that George Harrison and the Beatles' music still runs rings around the music of today. He and the Beatles will live forever.      George, your songs bring me peace of mind and I will never stop playing them. Rest in peace, quiet one. You have earned it. Hope you and John get some jam sessions going there in heaven!      I was born four years after John Lennon was murdered. But the Beatles were the first band that I really fell in love with and, in turn, I fell in love with music. George led such an incredible life and did so much and gave so much back through music and charity. He is truly an inspiration and I'm incredibly sad at his death.      All proper and heartfelt condolences are hereby extended to the family, friends and countrymen of George Harrison. He may have lived in the United Kingdom, but he was truly loved by the rest of the world. As accomplished as he was in this world, I am moved by how important God, his family, and his work were to him, and of how important it was that these things were in that particular order. I think these things being said about him are about the highest form of honour a man could ask for. I only wish the same could be said for me when I pass on.      Talent speaks louder than words. To me, George was never the ""quiet"" Beatle.      I heard the news driving to work on a damp, dark morning in Liverpool. I live near where George lived in Mackett's Lane; I travel past his former school and my early life was touched by the Beatles. The sense of the loss of this exceptional musician was profound yet his presence seemed there around those Liverpool streets. What greater accolade than if the global village adopted his peaceful philosophy. Rest in peace, George, and thank you for all you have given us.      The World is a different place today. George, along with the other Beatles were so much part of our lives. I always loved hearing George's songs. We work with a lot of young up and coming musicians and the Beatles music is undoubtedly a major influence on them. But George brought a lot more than just music. George opened our ears to spiritual matters as well. God bless you George.      Frank Sinatra said that ""Something"" was the greatest love song that he had ever heard. I think that says everything about the exceptionally talented man that was George Harrison.      As far as I'm concerned, George was my first love and I was just 11 years old. I never had the privilege to meet him but I was lucky enough to have seen the Beatles in concert twice ... in '64 and '66 ... and I'll never forget how exciting that experience was. I am truly saddened by his death and I wish to express to Olivia and Dhani my sincerest sympathy.      Today the world lost a great friend. I met George at the Hammersmith Odeon for their first concert there. He phoned my sister (she was 7 years old) just to say hello. Nothing was to much for him. He was an ordinary guy who you would find in your local pub and we will mourn his lost forever. My heart goes out to his family, at least his in a peaceful place and most importantly he has no pain may you rest in peace for ever George we all loved you and your fantastic music. Thank you.      Our world was enriched with the musical contributions as a Beatle, a Wilbury, and a wonderful solo artist. While others took a brighter light, George Harrison served as a solid foundation and poet that made his mates better. I believe as George meets God, God will in fact say...""Welcome...My Sweet George!"" May your contributions Mr Harrison always be with us in some way shape and form...(but we know they always will!)      Profound sadness made deeper by the long encroachment of his illness. What moves me most is the powerful affection people still have for him - something which comes of his thoughtfulness, integrity, dry wit and perhaps most of all his honesty. These qualities emanated from the best of his music and quietly reinforced the Beatles bond with the public. I recently listened to All Things Must Pass with a friend - who felt it was overly sentimental. Yet I felt exactly the opposite - that these songs retain their value because George, at his best, was capable of being both piercingly unsentimental and warmly loving at the same time. I doubt he was a man for eulogies - so far better to put on one of his best songs - Long Long Long or From Behind That Locked Door - and take time to sit and think. Feel the shiver of recognition at emotion truly expressed - a rare thing for in any art.      I remember myself being 4 years old and watching my shadow on the wall as I were dancing along with Beatles music... This is the sweetest memory I've got from my childhood and you, George, are part of it. Love you forever.      In Strawberry Fields two Masters la B    Mates at last together agai B    Enriched by their livin B    And now poorer for their passin B    Sadly missed tho' gone only a day.      As all other kids were playing around I was trying to learn English to understand Beatles' songs (or was it learning English through Beatles' songs?). Since then I felt I had 4 close friends over there, and now one more is gone. He's with his sweet Lord now, he really wanted to see him and we are sorry it didn't took so long... My Lord... George, you brought joy to my life: may the peace be with you. "
HOC HOC-CG -0.29 " Mr McConnell's private life is irrelevant. What is of more concern to me is that he is the only candidate to replace Henry McLeish. Hardly democratic is it?      Take your pick for leader. A man who drank a quart of whiskey every night, a man who had affairs or a man who worked hard and rarely drank. The first was Churchill, the second Eisenhower and the third Hitler.      Politicians are just human like the rest of us (believe it or not). If Jack McConnell proves to be a competent First Minister then no one will care about these recent revelations. We should be scrutinising the media in this case - their intrusive and salacious coverage will hurt the individuals involved in this 'private' matter, and will not hurt a teflon-coated political career. By the way - Reverend Paul Boorman, how do you define morals in this day and age? Have you NEVER sinned?! What about a bit of forgiveness?      It is vital that this information comes to the public domain. We have already had one first minister who was 'economical' with the truth. Now it seems he will be replaced by a philanderer. Disgraceful. Have we no morals left?      I don't want to hear about ""The Private Life of Politicians"" - unless, perhaps, it's a David Attenborough documentary. If you crave the details of others' private lives, then your own isn't interesting enough. We should be more concerned with how our ministers do their jobs than about the human details of their existence. Of course, integrity is important, but even this isn't a whitewash trait - the most committed politician could be the most faithless spouse. Everyone has facets to their personality.      I believe we should expect the highest standards from our leading politicians. We have too many anti-heroes in the modern world and we need people to hold up and show as examples of integrity, honesty and high moral standards. We should expect our top politicians to fulfil this role. Their failure to do so is one of the reasons that the Country has become turned off by politics.      Their personal life has no influence on whether or not they are good at their job. Imagine if every job were partially judged on these merits. Who does not have a skeleton in their closet? No one would be allowed to work!!      I'm fed up with people attacking politicians and their private lives. All these people who pontificate about politics never actually stand for election - or leaflet in the rain like those of us who are involved in politics. They demand political parties leaflet, knock doors etc in our own spare-time, but they never give up their time to help society. It's the public who are more hypocritical than the politicians.      Politicians don't have a private life. They gave it up when they decided to be accountable to the people. However this does not mean the 'details' should become common knowledge and the media should refrain from 'digging the dirt'. On the subject of electing the leader of the ruling labour party, it seems Scotland is a bit low on suitable candidates. Could Scotland be about to join the list of countries that were actually better off before they went independent.      We expect too much and never forgive our elected officials. If a doctor makes a mistake, he gets a reprimand, if a politician makes a mistake then media/opposition/affected people & NGOs crucify him. Is a doctor who cheats on his wife at every opportunity unfit to treat me, of course not. People need to realise that every time a politician's private life is raked through the media we damage our political system, a system that relies on 'representative' democracy. Is it any wonder that people are put off real politics, MOST people don't vote, and how many of us would be willing to become a politician knowing the grief they get?      Message to all politicians and leaders in public life. If you want to enjoy the privileges of power and all the status that goes with it then don't be surprised if the public demands absolute integrity including honesty in your marriage! If a man or women lies in small things they are not to be trusted in bigger things. You are either honest or you are not.      The personal requirements for a role in politics should be the same as for any other profession - integrity, honesty and a willingness to take on board professional criticism. Unfortunately our politicians seem to think themselves above any such requirements and also above accountability for their failures. The recent debacles of the Scottish First Minister's position and that of Stephen Byers vividly illustrate this point. Not only have these two politicians obviously lied in their respective parliaments without admission, but they continue to attempt obfuscate and repeatedly lie again in order to try to save their careers and further embarrassment.      This type of politician has caused deep cynicism in the whole electorate and have relinquished lost any right to claim the title of ""Honourable members of the house"". Tony Blair's failure to recognise this and his repeated backing for ministers who bring their positions into disrepute shows that his administration is morally no different from the previous ones.      In some respects we do expect more than is reasonable from our politicians - they have their responsibilities, which (as far as we know) for the vast majority of them, they achieve. It is very much like idolising film stars or musicians to put inflated standards onto politicians - they are all human after all and have failings the same as the rest of us. It does strike me as a bit of a put-up job however to just accept the one nomination as gospel - although when one of the alternatives is to call a general election, is anyone surprised? That would really come across as an admission of defeat....      I don't really care as long as they are good at their job. It does strike me as somewhat amusing that we, as a nation, are so obsessed with politicians having to be whiter than white. Is the population at large really that squeaky clean? Of course not. Politicians are just people, why should they be any different? I think it's a case of ""sort your own life out before you start worrying about other people's"".      I fail to see why we should prefer a straight-laced political incompetent to a top class politician who might have had a few stray encounters from time to time. Surely we've gotten beyond expecting politicians to be priests and I'm not convinced that it's any of our business anyway. For once I wish we had Europe-wide elections so that the French could ridicule our stupid ways. Notice, however, that I have not yet examined whether Mr McConnell is in fact a competent politician.      To a certain degree, you'd like to think that someone's personal life was just that - personal, and of no business of anyone's except those directly involved. Having said that why should I trust promises made to me by someone I don't know when he has admitted that he was unable to keep promises made to someone he loves? Most aspects of our politicians' lives should stay out of the public eye, but anything that calls into question their honesty, integrity, decency or honour affects us all and should be one of the things we are able to consider when going to the ballot box.      Officegate has shown that Scottish politicians are nothing but a bunch of chancers. They promote their own self-interest at the public's expense. Take a good look at the farce that is the Scottish leadership race. With only one contender we are looking at a party that has decided it is a much better idea to divvy-up the jobs than have an open debate on ideas and policies. I have no sympathy for our politicians, they deserve all the mud that's thrown at them.      I think that to a certain degree the politicians have to uphold the reputation of the Scottish Parliament, which McLeish certainly did not do. He allowed himself to be dragged into a messy and unseemly stooshie about something that quite frankly most people couldn't give a flying monkey's about. In terms of private, it should be just that - private and I see no need to dwell on the topic of McConnell's marital indiscretions. That's for him and his wife to sort out. At least he has brought it out in the open now and not left it as a weapon for the ""Scottish"" to whip out when they run out of things to say. I have to agree with Mac from Dundee though - one candidate is not a leadership contest.      If the media aren't careful, we will end up with politicians who are mind-numbing dull and lack any sort of personality. To be a good politician you must be able to draw on and adapt your experiences in life and how can you do that if you've never lived?      It is a sorry old state when the Scottish Parliament in its infancy has so few competent politicians to fill the post of First Minister. McConnell looks and acts like a club doorman with the sophistication of a council bureaucrat. Can he really be the First Minister of a UK parliament? Labour need to get their act together and fast - this is not acceptable.      The problem we have is not with our politicians but our press. Here we have the Daily Record going to extreme lengths to prevent an individual who has delivered results for the Scottish people leading the government. Then we have the rest running the 'look what they've written' story. The important thing is that the Parliament delivers progress for Scotland. That requires leadership. Apparently, our Labour MSPs think that Jack is the one to lead them and I tend to agree with them.      Do we really want people with no faults who've never had any problems, running the country? I'd rather have real people who've dealt with real life. Jack McConnell wasn't right to have an affair but the only person with the right to judge him is his wife. If we continue this absurd witch hunt we will end up with useless politicians living in ivory towers, afraid to do anything even slightly risky.      If politicians cheat on their other halves, how can we trust them not to cheat on us? All politicians have to be whiter than white otherwise they are not fit to do the job.      The trouble is that a lot of the time politicians feel that they have the right to lecture the general public on their morals and way of life, from the right wing moralising about whether people should live together and have children without being married to the left moralising about drinking, smoking and all the -isms. So, to be honest, they are fair game. However, an affair should not disqualify them from public office so long as they accept that, if they are caught, they should be prepared to put up with a certain amount of mickey taking.       If a politician espouses ""family values"" whilst in private carrying on an affair their hypocrisy should certainly be made public. "

Ron Williams asks why so mant countries drive on the right. Two words:     Why do 24-hour shops have locks?      1.Napoleo C    2.Vanity      Ron Williams - I've heard a theory on this one, yes it does centre around the way battles were fought on horseback. When cavalry units charged at each other they would wheel to the left to bring the sword arm into action. A general trained his cavalry to wheel right instead and the next battle was won decisively as the opposition couldn't cope with the new tactic. Perhaps other contributors can confirm if this was a ploy used by the French or some other European nation. I'd like to know if there is a scientific reason why I find driving on the right more natural than driving on the left. Admittedly this is on a motorcycle so there is no problem with the steering wheel being on the other side. I've been driving in the UK for over 25 years yet find it takes longer to re-adjust to driving on the left on my return than the reverse.

If the universe is expanding and the universe is all there is, what is it expanding into?      To Len, Finland: The universe is not expanding *into* anything. You only expect the concept of ""expanding into"" because you are only familiar with situations in which space is a constant - where there is always ""space"" to ""expand into"". The fact is that the universe *is* space, and it therefore cannot both *be* space and expand *into* space at the same time. We have to think of the stuff outside of the universe like an equation or something else non-spatial, otherwise our minds will make these misconceptions.

To Alison, UK: Sound is the interpretation of air waves (just like water waves, but in the air!) by a brain. The air waves are detected by an ear and translated into ""sound"" by the brain. If there is no ear with a brain within range, there can be no translation from the air wave into ""sound"". So in conclusion, if nobody is around to hear the tree, it makes no sound.      If a man is standing in the forest and he says something and there is not a woman there to hear him, is he still wrong.      Why do people stop everything to answer the phone?

Frank Hollis and Chris B - Thanks for answering my question. I'm glad you both actually understood what I was asking, since the other respondents clearly didn't. Does this mean that I can now claim to be related to Barbra Streisand?      If you work on the basis that your ancestors produced offspring roughly every 25 years so that every 25 years you go back the number of ancestors you have doubles (two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents etc.) then this means that 1,000 years ago you had 1,099,511,627,776 ancestors. If you go back much further then you'll have more ancestors than there are people on the planet. This doesn't seem logical but my head hurts when I try to think about it.      Terra from England: That conundrum was solved a long time ago. The reason there aren't more ancestors than offspring is because we share our ancestors with other people. Your brothers and sisters do not each have their own separate lineage, after all.      Eden Alvernaz, USA: That isn't what I was asking. I was talking about just my ancestors. If my ancestors double every 25 years you go back (and I don't mean cumulatively) then you'll end up with more ancestors than there were people on the planet.      To Terra: Eden did in fact answer your question. You do not have 'your' ancestors, as they are shared by a lot of other people. All families are 'old' families. You cannot separate out your ancestors from someone else's as they are shared. That is precisely why the numbers don't work out the way you say.      Terra - with regards to your ancestors - yes there would be more people than currently on the planet, however they are dead and did not live at the same time so do not make up a total of the population. The world is after all thousands of years old so there will be many many more people having inhabited the planet than currently live on it.      Terra, England. That's an easy one. As you trace your family tree back you'll find it crosses over regularly. So your mother and father may each have had the same great-great (repeat 10 times) -great grandfather. Indeed scientists have determined that we all share one particular individual as an ancestor - known as the 'Mitochondrial Eve'.      Terra, England: the answer to your question is inbreeding. By way of an example: if you take the population of a small and isolated island and theorise about the number of their ancestors 20 generations ago, you might find they should have been stacked 5 deep the length and breadth of the island. In-breeding across and between previous generations greatly retards the logarithmic increase in the number of our ancestors and helps us make the most of our available space!

And also why is there only one monopolies Commission?      In the early days of the railways the up line was the one to London, hence going up to London      I am always mystified at the immense lengths that some car drivers will go to, to gain a few seconds or take a short cut, but will make no effort at all to secure their children in the back of the car.

Why are people usually quiet in elevators?      Why does your new appliance always break down, two days after the warranty expires? And why does hot water freeze faster than cold water? Surely at some point the hot water will get to the same temperature as the cold and they will freeze at the same rate from that point on?      To Graham: Hot water has less oxygen, oxygen slows the freezing process      To Paul, it's got nothing to do with Oxygen content. H2O is H2O, the only difference between hot and cold is that in hot the H2O molecules are bouncing around much faster. Hot water freezes more quickly than cold water because if you place them in say, a fridge, there is a much steeper temperature gradient between the hot water and the fridge than between the cold water and the fridge. This causes a much more rapid heat transfer from the water to the fridge! It's got nothing to do with chemistry, its just thermodynamics.      To B Roberts, UK: The only portion of thermal dynamics involved in the hot water freezing first, is the extent of the hot water forming a temporarily melted bridge to the surrounding areas in which the containment vessel is in contact with. It therefore has a much more efficient transfer of thermal energy. Conduction vs. convection? I may be wrong.      To B Roberts: It is impossible for it to be true that something hot can freeze before something cold does. Just because the temperature gradient is steeper, it does not mean that it will reach the temperature quicker. By the logic you give, you would expect the reverse of this to be true too. A frozen meal should cook faster than a meal that has been kept in the fridge - because there is a greater temperature difference and therefore steeper gradient. This obviously does not happen!      To Graham, UK et al. Regarding the problem of hot water freezing faster than cool water. It's A-level physics. The solution is in the initially dominant form of heat transport, that is evaporation or conduction. If we use a thermally insulated open container then, initially, the dominant form of heat transport is evaporation.      The effect of evaporation is two fold, firstly the liquid cools, secondly the mass of liquid is reduced. The level of evaporation from a hot liquid is higher than from a cool liquid. So the hot liquid cools rapidly AND the mass of liquid is significantly reduced. On the other hand evaporation is low from the cool liquid, so the liquid cools slowly and maintains a relatively constant mass. As the mass of the initially hot liquid has been reduced it has proportionately less thermal energy to dissipate, so continues to cool at a faster rate. Thus hot water, under certain conditions, can freeze faster than cool water.      Why do outside news reporters adopt strangely affected intonations while those in the studio speak normally?      Toast fall butter side down because in the time it takes to fall from the desk to the floor it can only rotate 180?. If however desks were twice as high toast would land dry side down. Try pushing a piece of toast off with the buttered side touching the plate.      If exceptionally a slice of buttered toast falls on the floor buttered side up, does that mean that it was buttered on the wrong side?      If humans evolved from monkeys, why is it that monkeys still exist?      How come no-one has minted a 99p coin? Everything seems to cost #1.99, #2.99, 99p. Just think of the copper it would save.      We live in a world of starts and finishes, beginnings and ends, births and deaths. The world had a beginning so, apparently did the universe (big bang). But there must be an ultimate 'space' in which our universe exists that just 'is'. It didn't have a beginning and may not have an end. How can anything exist without being created from something bigger? This thought is totally baffling to me. My brain just cannot conceive the idea.      To Roger Sayer: the reality of this situation is quite depressing. Things do what they do and only what they do. Us humans perceive our surroundings in a way that has proved useful to our survival as the gene-vessels we are. Our function is not to understand all about the universe, at this stage of our development at least. No doubt a cat perceives things differently, has different concepts that it's mind will attempt to apply to what it perceives. The point is that we may never get an answer to our question, because like a cat wondering of the sun ""can i kill it?"", the difficulty lies in the unsuitability of the question. We may have come to a head in terms of our ability to understand the universe in our current state. Perhaps it is time to look at ourselves before we once again move forward ""out there""...      To Roger Sayer, USA, scientists and quantum physicists have been wrestling with that same problem; they refer to it as the turtle syndrome; the creation of the earth is one turtle sitting on top of another that was the big bang that sits on top of another that was an even bigger bang. However, the scientists and the physicists cannot get to the turtle at the bottom and guess what, some are starting to believe in a superior being that created everything.      Gerry, Scotland - any idea what created the supreme being? Another supreme being? To follow the ""turtle"" theory will scientists get to the supreme being at the bottom? Can't stop I'm about to try my paw at killing the sun.      Why do people stand by pedestrian crossings without pressing the button? And also, Gerry - nice stuff about the turtles. But where did the ""supreme being"" come from then?      To Jake Hadlee: That is a phenomenon generally observed in London. It's due to the fact that there is no discernible correlation between pushing the button and having the light change in the pedestrian's favour. Most of the crossings I've tested (yes on my own time without pay - I'm such a dedicated scientist) exhibit a seemingly random pattern of changing lights. The buttons are only there to give the pedestrians something to do while waiting for a break in traffic.      How is it that we can put a man on the moon, but back on planet earth we're reduced to clawing and shredding the first ten meters of the toilet paper roll?      Why do people have to ""spend"" more to ""save"" money?      Why can't I write my essay on time for once, instead of procrastinating by reading BBC Talking Point debates?      To Paul, UK, the answer is that humans did not evolve from monkeys but that they both evolved from a common ancestor. That is why monkeys are still around!      Hannah in Oxford asks why she can't write her essay on time for once instead of procrastinating by reading these debates. The answer is ""because she is human"".

HOC HOC-FW -0.0799999999999992 " Russia used to be a feared and respected superpower, whatever her internal problems (and they were many). I feel it is highly unlikely that she will regain that former status and ""compete"" with the US. So why bother trying? The world is facing an energy crisis and the Kyoto protocol has been reduced in effectiveness. Russia has vast unpopulated wildernesses on which she could build windfarms. Imagine the new power to be gained by being the supplier of environmentally friendly electricity to the whole of Europe!      Yeltsin shares as much, if not more, of the responsibility for the destruction of the USSR as Gorbachev. As his influence in the Russian Federation grew (up to his election as President in June 1991), he rocked the Soviet boat. He couldn't forgive his expulsion from the Politburo and wanted to bring Gorbachev down almost at any cost. His moves to make the hitherto right-less Russian republic more independent resulted in less contribution to the USSR budget (which meant its inability to hold together, with much of Central Asia and the Baltics depending on subsidies - the only way to maintain them in a closed economy).      This culminated in the proclamation of the supremacy of Russian law over Soviet law in the 1991 Declaration of Independence. Given this blueprint for a new Union Treaty, the conservatives' reaction (the putsch) is not surprising.      I have travelled in Russia and find that its people are some of the most noble and dignified people I have ever met, whether under the rule of the USSR or the current government they have an incredible spiritual nationalism which in my opinion is unrivalled in the modern world. While times were uneasy to say the least during the USSR's time, we must also realise what the USSR gave us.      Competition with the United States led to Sputnik, Apollo 11, satellites upon satellites, unheard of technological advances and the most rapid evolution of human technological and industrial achievement ever assembled. Without the challenges the USSR presented, we would not have half the technology we have today. A recent article in Time magazine referred to the USSR as ""the only nation the United States was ever afraid of, and its not often lamented competitor."" The development of atomic weapons aside, look at how far we have developed since the end of World War II. Most of it would not exist if it were not for Russia.      In the USSR, every language was official in its respective territorial unit alongside Russian, the nationwide language. In many ""republics"" there were three-four languages, and in Daghestan a whole thirty. Ukraine even witnessed a fierce Ukrainisation in the 1920s--Ukrainian was imposed even on all areas that just happened to be under the jurisdiction of the UkrSSR (such as Odessa), often with comical consequences.      It is also hard to agree that the USSR served the ethnic Russians - most RSFSR territories had the lowest living standards and the least consumer goods. Trips to Moscow, Leningrad and the other 14 republics were used by ordinary Russians for shopping. Meanwhile, the Soviet government gave aid to any third-world country that applied. Russians felt they were being milked by the rest of the eastern Bloc (which I think is true), and this discontent resulted in the June 12, 1991 Declaration of Sovereignty (which made Russia financially independent), which in turn fuelled the August coup and the Soviet collapse altogether.      Why do people need so-called freedom if their stomachs are empty and their children are sick because they can't buy them cheapest antibiotic? For those who live in the land of freedom here is a little food for thought. Do you know that US jail over two million people every year? That is more people than were jailed in ""bad"", nasty, ugly USSR in Stalin's time.      Those who say that people of Ukraine are happy because they can speak Ukrainian again. You probably don't know that about 60% of the people in Ukraine speak Russian as their first language. That all Eastern, Southern majority of Northern and Central Ukraine speak Russian. You don't know that a lot of people at the EAST would gladly be under Russian ""yoke"" then be ""free"" of it. And if you think that I am 60 years old and have psychiatric disorder please note that I am just 25 and I am really sorry that USSR broke up.      Without there having been the ""Soviet"" times, I think the people of the world both in the East and the West would have been much worse off. All the social security, benefits and decent salaries enjoyed by general public in the rich capitalist countries were created to compete with the socialist model and indeed to prevent a popular uprising. However terrible the regime was, the human cost of communist rule (which I personally benefited from) is incomparable to the cost of capitalism: slavery of Africans, commerce driven imperialism, both world wars - I'm sure you get the idea. I think it is shallow to debate whether life was ""better"" during the communist era or not. It was better for some and terrible for others, just like it always will be everywhere in the world. What particular con the people in power are justifying themselves with is quite irrelevant. At the end of the day, it's about what are you willing to make of your situation.      The Gross Domestic Product of Ukraine has declined to approximately 20 percent of its value ten years ago. On top of that, the economic structure is in ruins and today the country is very largely operating on a black market economy. If you don't believe this, you only have to think about the average monthly income for professionals. School teachers and university lecturers, for example, have an official monthly income of around $30 US, and even that often fails to appear for several months at a time. They need at least $100 per month to live even decently. The people in these jobs somehow survive too. How is that achieved? The black market. The country runs on a black market economy.      Chicago is one of the places where every ethnic group looking for opportunity ends up. I can only relate the Eastern European experience to the migration from the farms all over this country and other struggling ethnic groups who have come here. For most it takes two to three generations to become fully part of the new society and to build a support network. You are looking at 50 to 100 years of change if they ""keep their eye on the ball"".      Those of you who write in to say how wonderful it is to have the freedom to travel abroad, enjoy your untethered business enterprises, etc., should be glad indeed. You are in the extreme minority. For the rest of the people life is hard - harder than it ever was under the Soviet Union, but the trouble is that most people do not have the resources to publicise this fact.      I had lived under USSR boot for 16 years in Poland. Was it a good life? Absolutely not! However, I believe in a Russian nation. One can say that this is a first shot at their real freedom. Since its inception Russian folk has been under Tartars, Mongols, Tzars and the Communist boot. A regular Russian does not understand word ""freedom"", but he will. I used to hate Russians for what they did to my country, Poland. However, now I see them as me, good people who want to enjoy life and freedom as I want. A country of Rachmaninov, Tchaikovsky and Tolstoy. How can you not love them? Too much beauty to just spit and discard Russia as nothing because it is poor.      My wife is from Ukraine and I have visited this country recently. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union things have changed, but not necessarily for the better. There was corruption in the USSR and there is still corruption, in fact corruption pervades everyday life from trying to buy a phone, to having to pay for train timetable information. There are more products in the shops, but people have less money to pay for them. In fact most honest people are living day to day on subsistence levels. There are frequent power, gas and water cuts and people live behind steel bolted doors in their old concrete Soviet apartments. The government raise the apartment costs every month - although many people cannot afford to pay anything for their accommodation.      For the people lucky to have a job, incomes are very low and employees often go for months without pay. When they are paid, it may be only a small proportion of what they have earned. Families are split by poverty and alcoholism. The wife often has to find 2 or 3 jobs to support a child, drunken husband and her parents all living in perhaps a two-room apartment. Go to visit a Russian or Ukrainian family and despite their poverty and hunger, they will feed you their last loaf of bread. Their kindness is the one ray of light in a destroyed, corrupt country.      The only way for the Soviet system to have survived and provided its citizens with anything near the living standards that Westeners rely on to sustain democratic institutions would have been to emulate China. Doing so may have maintained and built upon the existing structures, which as anyone who has been to the Third World will tell you could have been a lot worse.      Change to a Western style economy means worship of profit. The haves get more and the have nots get less.      It was very interesting to read messages on a board. First thing I thought about was how these people can have any judgement without having their own experience? Russia is a very interesting and I would say very special country with a great history. Someone said - ""not everything is black and white.."" after living in the States for almost 4 years I can argue with locals about their belief of American freedom.      Freedom here is total illusion. More and more Americans are coming to this understanding. I had been living in Russia for 28 years. It was different, difficult sometime. I did like Gorbachov's point of view - there was no need to change everything so dramatically and so fast, especially after one revolution, two wars, and Stalin's genocide. This great country and these great people will recover. They just need some time, they had been through a lot of difficulties in their history.      I liked the comment about the Russian soul, it is true, anyone that has dealt with Russians would know about the Russian soul, I only hope that the western market free policies do not destroy it. The change was too sudden, no preparation, nothing, Gorbachev, has a lot to answer for, he was hypnotised by Margaret Thatcher who changed the UK, but it took many years to get the UK to a point that resembles little America, with many people like in America right on the poverty line. I am not socialist, I just travel and see.      But for as long as there are people like the Russians I met, that give money to people (even few roubles) just because they say they need them more than themselves, there is still hope that the Russian soul will survive against the free market onslaught. Russians will climb back, Russians are good survivors like cats, and you can see how many there are in Moscow.      While it is certainly true that Russia (and other former Soviet republics) is struggling with economic problems most countries have never even contemplated it should be noted that as others have said the Russian people are perhaps the most resilient in the world and recovery will eventually come and we will all be better off for it, and while life may have been better for the ordinary Soviet citizen under Communism it should be noted that the Russian people are entitled to better than a choice of the current economic disaster and life under a Soviet regime.      The USSR served only Russia. The communists imposed the Russian language to Belarusians, Ukrainians and all others while the local languages were outlawed. Plus the Russians spread themselves to all countries in order to turn all the USSR into a bigger Russia. All non-Russians should be glad the USSR is no more.      Let's not put the Soviet Union and the Third Reich out of historical context. Authoritarian regimes have always existed, though these two were the last in the Western world (forgive me for classifying my savage country as Western). These regimes are rarely established without blood (later on it's more relaxed - we Soviets remember wearing wide jeans and long hair after the 50s: we faced some trouble, but not jail!), but that doesn't mean that everyone suffered and every law-abiding citizen of that regime was responsible for the atrocities. Hence (this may sound wild, but I believe I'm being objective), I don't see the need for Germans or the Soviets to denounce their respective ex-regimes altogether - it's not their fault they were born and lived there. For example, the Americans aren't renouncing the United States altogether with slavery and segregation in the past!      I am amazed at the patronising remarks of you Americans saying the Russians are in transition to democracy. You live in a country where the president got into power because the election was fiddled in the state where his brother was governor. What do you know about democracy? Wake up and smell the coffee. If you're lucky it'll be Cuban!      Democracy, ""Open or Market Economy"" and ""Freedom"" are sugar-coated pills of poison which only make the ""Doctors"" rich and cause the ""Patients"" to perish. Soviet people were poor but they lived with dignity with basic needs met. Their quality of life was much higher and the people were happy. The strong deep-rooted culture and the technological advances even over the US were the evidence of the healthy atmosphere that prevailed. Today, the majority become beggars while a handful of rich enjoy the wealth and praise the newly achieved ""freedom"". From a crime free society during the Socialist time, it rose to a mafia era where lives are so cheap and the law of the jungle has replaced the rule of law. It was the West (US) who won but not the Soviet people.      Was life better in the Soviet days? Emphatically NO. There are some who pine for the continuity of those times, but these tend to be the least able parts of society to adapt to changes. And the Soviet system was only occasionally able to provide for its citizens (actually, subjects). When I worked for PAP in Poland in 1990, we (as government workers) were issued tea, soap and toilet paper along with our salaries - so we wouldn't have to stand in line for these scarce items. Ironically these ""benefits"" were obsolete by 1990 because the collapse of the Soviet-supported system the year before had flooded Polish supermarkets with all the items that had been unavailable for the previous two decades. Remember, the Soviet system was not defeated by the West, it imploded of its own dead weight. That continuity was an illusion.      The majority of the societies liberated from the Soviet yolk are far better places to live now - not perfect, but they offer freedom and the ability to make a decent living. Only in places like Russia and Romania where gangster-style capitalism (replacing gangster-style communism) has taken root have the living standards declined over the past decade. The Soviet empire was one of the most barbaric and unjust creations of humanity, so its passing is not to be missed!      The price of freedom is responsibility. And that means responsibility for yourself, rather than expecting the State to look after you. At least in the Ukraine now, you can get a phone installed in a couple of weeks rather than having to bribe a Party official and ""still"" have to wait several years. The Ex-soviet countries have been starved of investment for the last 70 years. There's a lot of catching up to be done - this just can't happen overnight.      I can't wait until Russia joins the European Union. That is the only way that they will get back on their feet.      I doubt those who populated the Gulags and now rest in their cemeteries would understand the nostalgia for the Soviet system. It is a fact that no communist country has ever resisted the urge to lapse into authoritarianism so it's apparent that it is an inherently-flawed system. A little tweak here and there would not have made the Soviet Union more cuddly. It will take time and home-grown leadership for the trust in capitalism, democracy, and the rule of law to develop. If the leadership is lacking then we may be having the same debate 50 years from now.      I have just got back from Siberia where I asked whether life had improved since Soviet times. My hosts simply pointed to the abundance of food on the table - not to mention the freedom to express their opinions without fear. Westerners are fed a constant media diet of gloom about Russia, so they are far too ready to swallow the old myths about the absence of poverty in Soviet times etc. In contrast, most intelligent Russians recognise that any economic system is better than the blinkard stupidity of Soviet central planning. Few people realise that today Russia and the Ukraine are now the fastest-growing economies in Europe.      We in the West have to take a lot of the blame for what has happened. We insisted that Russia convert overnight to a market economy with ""shock"" economic plans which left ordinary people destitute and created a handful of overnight billionaires when surely the correct path was a gradual pace of change. It should however be remembered with concern that the President Putin is exercising increasingly centralised control over government with press freedoms being limited (there is now no independent TV network) and has shown little interest in tackling the Robber Barons who benefited from privatisation!      Things are considerably worse than what they should have been. Every prescription the poor Russians have gotten from the ""experts"" the West has been poison. None of the snake oil has ever been tried on Western countries - devaluations, inflation, privatising state industries into backroom sweetheart deals. The things that make the US, UK or even France or Germany prosper - an open, transparent market, rule of law and a stable currency - were never even tried by the ""experts"". I would not blame the Russians for thinking we are still trying to beat them into the dirt, only now we are using the IMF, instead of the ICBM's.      People say Russia is now run by the Mafia. Well, when WASN'T it run by a mafia of some sort? First it was the tsars, then the Communist Party and now the current ruling elite. Feudalism, then communism, then capitalism were all imposed from above and the Russians accepted them - or else! Perhaps it's not communism that people are nostalgic for, but tsarism. They're alike in many ways.      Sandman. You said that you feel it is better for the 'people to decide.' This is a good point. However, it disregards the fact that there is a force in society today that is capable of strongly influencing the general population. I am, of course, talking about the media. The growth of the media machine is exemplified by the Murdoch take-over of the UK airwaves, and to suggest that people's opinions are formed rationally and outside the pervasive influence of the media seems to me to be a bit naive. Democracy? Where?      The Soviet Union may not have been ""free"" but it tried to promote some very credible ideals. It has been vilified because they did not match our own. Surely the quality of life in the Soviet Union started to decrease when it was obvious it could not compete with the western economies. Both freedom and equality can be practised only when there is enough money to support them. The sad fact is that state planning was financially unworkable. Are we going to be having this discussion in forty years time? If capitalism's faults cannot be solved, probably not. Whatever replaces it will almost certainly not be free from dictatorship or poverty.      'The Russian people have a long and difficult path to thread before they reach their goal: there will be much more agony and bloody sweat but I am confident that from this young, mighty people new life will come'. This quote is from a book written in 1920 by a visitor to the new Soviet Union. Little did he realise that the process of change would take 100 years! A 'right way' for Russia (or any other country we care to mention) doesn't exist at the moment because we are living through a period of 'interesting times'. We'll all have to see what the next few decades bring...      For my folks it was better during the 'good' old days of the ex-USSR even though financially they are considerably better off now. They miss the certainty and feeling of security, and who can blame them? I personally do not miss the communist system even a bit, but I think the whole transition thing could have been handled in a much better manner.      The majority of Russians are nostalgic for the communist system because, all things considered, they were better off. Just as Cubans are now far better off than Haitians or Guatemalans. That's a fact and I don't see how any degree of ""freedom"" can compensate for not being able to get a decent meal.      Ten years after the collapse of communism, the Russians seem to have more freedom from both the state and party-politics. However, this new found 'economic liberalism' needs to be used wisely. Personal freedom without due consideration for fellow human beings and the environment is chaos. In the long run, chaos only leads to tyranny.      I went to the Former Soviet Union in August 1991, barely after the Coup and lived there for a good part of the 90s witnessing most of the transition. I think that for the majority, life was better in the soviet Union, the change to democracy came about without any safety nets thus leaving a people without the knowledge, skills or capital to survive in a capitalist system.      I have lived in Ukraine for 3 years and I have to say that, despite the fact that people are often much worse off financially, the most important effect has been mental. Peoples' outlook on life appears to be extremely different, if a little insecure. Unfortunately, thanks to the influx of American propaganda, Ukrainians are never allowed to let their turbulent past rest. Clinton came and talked about Democracy - and then the Ukrainians laugh at the most undemocratic Presidential election in the history of modern democracy!      It seems to me that Russia is undergoing a rather turbulent evolution, but at least evolution is a more peaceful process than revolution. Every country in the world can look back nostalgically on the ""good old days"", but doing so won't bring them back. The best chance of future success is to face up to the future with confidence and determination, rather than dwell on the past.      Yes, life was more stable and life standards dropped significantly for most Russians. And when the Russians are hit hard, they eventually bounce back even harder. Check their history. Soviet nostalgia coupled with hard lessons from recent years is what will only expedite their recovery. Politically Russia is no longer in transition, but economically they have lots of catching up to do. Wise contries are seizing the moment and make friends with this great contry while it goes through difficult times. The benefits will be more than Soviet Union could ever offer.      This is a transitional period. The country has made a big change and this has resulted in mass unemployment and business loss. Which in turn leads to economic problems which lead to crime. It will be some time before they recover.      I cannot understand why the only two options for the Soviet peoples are supposed to have been ""remaining communist"" or becoming ""hard core capitalists"". Gorbachev tried to find a middle solution --a Soviet nation ruled by the people (rather than by elite dictators) and still being able to compete with the West when it came to political and social freedoms. He and his political allies were not allowed to complete their efforts --not by the people, but by the cold warriors of the KGB.      To ""Jojo in Canada"": I have lived in big cities & small villages in Russia & Ukraine), and speak the language. So I can comment on this subject. That system was cruel to both Man and Nature, much more so than ""capitalism"" has been in the West. Saying some things were done well (trying to defend the system) is like saying ""Hitler wasn't so bad, look he gave us the Beetle & the Autobahn!""      Russians have had to deal with a drastic increase in preventable diseases, a precipitous decline in living standards and have been reduced to paupers looking for cheap jobs in the West. The collapse of the totalitarian Party was a good thing - no one wants to return to that. But the collapse of the system that took good care of babies born in the hospitals and made sure that people had adequate nutrition has brought untold misery. Everyone I ever met while living in Russia wishes that the Soviet Union were still around - but without the Party.      I have to take issue with one statement I have read. It is NOT the state that makes democracy work - it IS the people. Take a look at recent elections in the UK and the USA where the percentage of people voting has dropped considerably. That is damaging to democracy. Democracy works best when everyone takes part.      If the Germans got misty-eyed over the Third Reich there would be an outcry. But here we are getting nostalgic for a system that murdered far more people than Hitler ever did. But hey...that's OK, because the murderers were left wing and they weren't killing people because they were from a different race, they killed them because they simply didn't agree with the Party.      The problem isn't the move from communism to democracy but rather how it happened. The transition was simply too quick, so the old structures collapsed before new ones were in place. We should welcome Russia back into the European fold and offer them all the resources and expertise we can to help the country. The Russians are a great people - resourceful, courageous and innovative.      I personally think communism and democracy are the same - neither works. If you want proof, then look at all the nations in the world and see for yourself - are they really better? Some governments are spying on their own citizens and the media control what they want you to see and what they don't. So you tell me, is it worse than communism or not?      For any nation genuine democracy is very difficult to obtain and equally as hard to hold onto. However, what can be better than ""rule by the people?"" With the Soviet system the Party decides what is best for the people. Don't the people themselves know what is best? I hope the US will do all it can to help Russia and the CIS during this transition to democracy and to aid in the process of building up their economies.      At least the Cold War is over and the threat of WWIII is less of a threat, although the potential to blow ourselves up remains. Remember Threads? Spine chilling stuff, if you remember this film, then you will remember the fear that was around in the 80's.      How many people on this list have ever even been to Russia? How can you possibly comment on this subject? I wouldn't even try, except to say hats off to Andrei Kiselev who spotted that westerners are far more likely to believe their own propaganda.      I read in many places that Russian independence day is Aug 24 1991, but who are we independent from, the soviets? We are the soviets.      Just because communism in the USSR was corrupt the first time around, is that a good enough reason to entirely scrap socialism in favour of capitalism? The best thing for the people of Russia and for the general good of the evolution of humanity would be to re-attempt the socialist state but without the corruption of dictators, without the censorship or the cover-ups or the murders.      Life was VERY difficult mostly because of the lack of freedom and, also very important, lack of opportunity for the bright and industrious without the proper connections with the ""nomenklatura"". It is not so easy nowadays but the chances are much better for many people. There is only one deficit in Russia - money. This is much better than to spend hours queuing to by some basic goods of inferior quality.      Ten years ago, I was packing my suitcase to spend my year abroad in the Soviet Union. A year later I returned from Russia. Yesterday's dyed-in-the-wool has become today's technocrat. Has life improved for the average Russian? Well, for those people who've read Turgenev's ""Mumu,"" the dog's no better fed, but it can bark as much as it likes.      To those who say they miss the fondness of patriotic fervour, I say that is a state of mind that can be changed within your own mind and heart. Being able to live a free life (travel, engage in political debate or religious exercises, build a personal business) is something not to be taken lightly and should be protected. Love your country, but most importantly, love (and guard) your freedom.      My great-grandparents left Russia to escape the oppression of the Tsar. The oppression of the Tsar was replaced by the Soviet Union. The problem, I believe, is not that people yearn for the old days but that the change was too sudden and abrupt. To declare democracy in a country where people have forever lived under an autocratic government--be it communist or monarchy--is too drastic to do in one swoop.      We, Russians, all are missing the kind and heartful spirit of Soviet people of those days. Too cruel we are nowadays due to 10 years living in the world of money supremacy. Being always famous for our beautiful soul, we must do our best not to lose it fighting for the best place under the sun.      I have a grandmother who is not political. She tells me that in her young days she felt more patriotic and proud of her country, and that the country could be depended on to look after you like a father. She tells me now that she has lost that feeling of security in the state government and I think I can see why.      I'm currently on a long holiday in Ukraine. Ukrainians tell me that their communist bosses just 'changed jackets' to suit the new 'democracy', so nothing has changed, with the ex-communists in total control, even of the prime minister, via the Mafia. Tax is so high that the only way to do business, so I'm told, is to cheat the taxman. The Ukrainians I have spoken to are despairing of change for the better in their lifetime due to the corruption and believe it will take several generations for light to appear at the end of their tunnel.      The discussion about the passed away Soviet Union is, largely, a conflict between collective and individualistic components of our psychology. The USSR was a unique large-scale experiment where the collective part of human consciousness had superiority over another natural part of human nature - individualism - without any outcome for the latter. So, the contest between individualism and collectivism is absolute rubbish because it is a no-win game. History confirmed once more that only social formation with self-adjusting systems can survive. Fortunately or unfortunately capitalism is the only one of that sort.      I was in a band who toured in the Czech republic shortly after the velvet revolution. We stayed at many people's houses on the way and spoke to many young and old. The main points seemed to be that since ""freedom"" they no longer had guaranteed houses and jobs but they did have the ability to travel. However they couldn't travel because there were no jobs, therefore little money and what money they had was spent trying to keep their homes! I invited many of them to come and visit but to this day none have come but they do email me.      It is clear that living standards for the vast majority of people in the former Soviet Union have declined since its demise. It is also debatable how much more political freedom they have. This is not to hold up the USSR as a model system, but the issue is hardly black and white. I would ask advocates of our current system, where they would rather be a poor peasant, in communist Eastern Europe or in one of the 'triumphs of the free market' like Guatemala, Salvador, Bolivia or Honduras?      The Russians born in 30 years time will think that it was worthwhile transferring from a Soviet to a capitalist society. It is those who should be considered, not those who like to look back in fondness of a time where everyone in Russia was socially dead.      After 70 years the Russian people wanted a change and who can blame them? Now they realise that democracy is not all Disneyland and Big Macs. Unless there is a concerted improvement, there will be a socialist backlash equivalent to that seen in the early 20th century      Freedom has its price. Perhaps uncertainty is part of that. The state is not an entity in itself, separate from the population. The state is made up of people and it is they who make democracy work.      It constantly amazes me how Westerners hark back with nostalgia to the old Soviet days. We should note that the Russian people look back on Communism only with relief that it is over and with hope for the future.      In response to Steven James - Why does the west have to help? No one is helping Britain with asylum seekers, the breakdown of our national railway, the appalling service that is the NHS, the rise in violence and drug related crime etc. It is not our responsibility to assist another countries' governments in implementing policy and it would be extremely ironic if we did as this government does nothing to help its own people. I wish the eastern block well in its development but it is a path that they have to take alone and learn from their own errors, not be mollycoddled by a country that can't even give its own citizens decent transportation.      It's easy for you people in Western countries to find fault with everything in Russia. In fact, you are quite blind to realities because whereas people in the Soviet Union were suspicious of Soviet propaganda, people in the West believe the official versions of their governments without ever questioning them. Nobody in Russia wants the Communists back because Communism was exactly the opposite of what it claimed to be. What people do want now is some security in their lives, and not to be left to the ravages of the market and the mafia.      To Mark M. Newdick, who thinks that we have 'seen the light': I'd prefer to have my job, and let him see the light. Another thing: I can think for myself, and that is not the reason I'm without a job. Go and tell your laid-off workers in the US and UK that they are without jobs because they cannot think for themselves, and see what they tell you.      I moved to the UK about a week before the coup in 1991. I never went back there. But I have heard so many stories about it now. Lots of real life programmes were made about the lifestyle there now and how people are oblivious to, say, a shooting - I think it's very scary. I was going to do Russian with economics at university this year, which would involve taking a year out in Moscow. But now I am changing it to just economics, I just want to give Russia time to recover.      History has dealt the Russian people a bum deal, be it various forms of corrupt, tyrannical rule or foreign wars and invasions. As a people, they were always under a yoke of some kind. Nevertheless, as tragic as the Russian modus vivendi is (and has always been), this great people possess spirit and integrity. Left to their own devices, Russians will stand proud again. The Soviet/Communist experiment failed, but I believe Russians have been instilled with the nobler communist ideals. Hopefully sooner rather than later, Russia will stand firmly on its feet, and through its rich history and experience, will again balance the American yoke imposed on the rest of the world, and check this awful 'pax' Americana.      Coming from an ex-communist country myself, I can say that people feel nostalgic because in the past they couldn't get fired and they had a job for life even if they didn't always turn up for work or do much. People were given jobs not because they were needed but to keep them happy. My mother was a bank manager and she could only get rid of someone if they were sentenced to jail! On the other hand, I have never seen a homeless or a hungry person until I moved to West - it was a big shock to me. Now most of Russia is hungry and the ""wild west"" principles rule - it is only natural people will long for the past.      I am glad the Soviet Union collapsed. After the Iron Curtain was removed, I have received a chance to study abroad and get the education which neither my parents nor my grandparents dared to dream about. The life during Soviet times was good only for those people who liked the government to ""think"" instead of them - knowing definitely what was best for them to study, to know and to do. As a result, many of them find themselves now with needless specialities and without profitable skills to support their living. They are upset now because they still believe it is someone's responsibility to solve their problems.      Just read Anthony Bullock's post, it is absolutely bizarre. Stalin was responsible for as many if not more deaths than Hitler! He starved people to death, built government schemes with slave labour and ran a system of death camps. How can you possibly think that the average person was treated fairly well?      The former Soviet Union's economy was powered by the Military Machine. This military build-up literally produced thousands of jobs and was a boon to the economy. Unfortunately for Russia, this build-up proved to be too costly for the country and Russia was unable to compete with the US militarily. The result? A military breakdown with the loss of jobs thereby collapsing the economy. So, yes, the Russians were actually more prosperous under the old Soviet regime but they will in time build up their ailing economy.      Since the changes happened recently the ex-Soviet region is in a state of transition. People are suffering a great deal because the country is changing to the free market and democracy. I would like to see much more generous economic aid for Russia from countries like the UK and USA to help them through the very difficult period of change that they are facing.      My wife is from the former Eastern Bloc and when I visit there it is clear, especially amongst the older generations, that people are not used to taking responsibility for their own economic and social well being. In areas where unemployment is increasing the prevailing attitude is that 'the government should provide jobs - as this is what they are elected to do'. I agree with Mark Newdick it takes time for a culture to adapt to a completely different level of responsibility and during the transition these countries should be helped in this process.      Russia has been appallingly neglected by the West and it is no surprise that many of its citizens yearn for Soviet days. Fundamental changes need to be made in Russia before it becomes a full democracy but the country and its long-suffering people need Western support.      Yes it was better in Soviet days. I was in the British military living in Germany to keep the Russians out. Tax-free booze and cars, it was great. Emm is that what you mean?      I am a firm believer in Stalin's policies - in his native Georgia he is still revered and treated as a hero, which has to tell us something. There is a substantial body of evidence that most Soviets were well-treated under his regime. I think that the automatic assumption that ""capitalism is good"" may be true in some cases, but not all. China does not seem to be doing too badly at the moment (rising prosperity of the people, host of the Olympic Games etc).      In the past, when I visited the USSR on business, I could walk freely down the street. Now under the new regime there has been a huge increase in organised crime, so now I am ferried by taxi from my hotel to the offices 'just in case'. As I am driven through the streets you can see the decay and poverty. I guess that is freedom, but the ordinary man on the street has paid a huge price to get it.      I would rather make half the world hate me to live with decency, than read so many sympathising comments about how pitiful my country's present is compared to its Soviet past - although it is true that Russian mentality (culture and spirituality) has major problems fitting in with the money-driven world. Thanks, everyone.      It depends I suppose on how you define freedom. Freedom for the rich to exploit the poor? Freedom for the gangsters to terrorise the weak? Freedom to starve to death? Freedom for the corrupt to plunder and extort? Welcome to the wonderful world of capitalism.      Unfortunately the people who are in power today in the various former Soviet republics are the same people who were in power ten years ago and are not genuine democrats or reformers. With these people in power who still have a communist mentality and are corrupt and authoritarian, is there any realistic chance that things could change?      After all those years of leaving it to the state to do the thinking and planning (if that's what they called it), it is obviously going to take a long time to get people to think for themselves. Russia deserves our support and respect for seeing the light ... nobody said it was going to be easy! "
HOC HOC-GU -0.190000000000001 " Intelligent, thought-provoking, interesting, funny, challenging....well, we're not talking about Big Brother are we? I find it embarrassing that the same media that slathered over Helen's various relationship woes and avidly and endlessly dissected Brian's future employment prospects can't wait to slate a programme that had the temerity to demand an iota of effort from its viewers. Bring on the bland, thought is dead.      I've no doubt a lot of politicians will be hoping to use this to sneak through some powers of censorship. So I'm delighted to see so many posts from people who found the programme offensive but support free speech. We're not so daft as our rulers like to think!      The best thing about all this controversy is that Channel 4 seem to be returning to their roots. That is making and showing challenging (and sometimes offensive) programmes that make people talk, argue and complain. This is good because it brings the issues to the front and makes people confront them. There is far too much mindless programming around, take Big Brother or Survivor for instance... Well done Channel 4, I for one am very pleased.      I haven't spoken to any of my colleagues, friends or family that aren't disgusted by this. They started to watch it and, like me, turned it off. I reject the arrogant and condescending statements from Channel 4 executives that imply that we don't get the plot. Oh we get the plot alright and we don't want it. As simple as that. Some people are so stupid and gullible, frightened of being found to be out of synch, that they'll laugh at anything these days if it's meant to be cutting edge and pushing the boundaries. This is sick sarcasm - as base as that and no conceited yuppie is going to tell me otherwise.      The media furore which followed the airing of this programme only served to confirm everything Chris Morris was satirising - the worst aspects of sensationalist journalism, the mindless ""commentating"" from politicians and celebrities who were clearly as clueless about paedophilia as they were about satirical comment. Most abused children are attacked by people they know, people their families love and trust. Brass Eye did us all a great service in ridiculing public figures who will spout any nonsense, no matter how serious the subject, to get 30 seconds on TV. For these professional opinion-spouters, their concern is 10% for our children's welfare, 90% getting a smart sound-bite on the evening news.      The Government's role is to formulate and implement policies, not to run TV stations. If current policies are considered inadequate to protect us then the policies should be changed. If the programme is not called into question by the relevant governing body, the ITC, then there is no case to answer. However it is unfortunate that Tessa Jowell intervened prior to scrutiny by the body charged with the job. This undermines their authority and could be seen to be an attempt to exert undue influence over any investigation by them.      I don't think this intervention has any sinister overtones, but would attribute it to the concern of a politician who cares passionately about her remit and the public good. However as a relative newcomer to front bench politics TJ has to learn how to hold back the passion when in front of the microphone and as a parliamentarian take these issues to Parliament before taking them to the press.      I think you will find most of the complaints will come from people who don't find the programme amusing. Fine. They don't have to watch it. As adults, they are responsible for their own behaviour patterns. Including watching television. They are certainly also responsible for their children's watching habits too. I personally find some tabloids highly offensive. But I understand that others find them amusing and so I let them buy them and have a bit of fun. Let's see a bit more grown up behaviour on this one too.      The government intervening in TV programming is the first step towards a police state and a dictatorship and the suppression of peoples' rights and liberties. In a free country, TV channels should be able to broadcast anything and everything, no matter how offensive or gory or indecent without meddling from the government. I may not like everything I see on TV, but I have the freedom to watch graphic programming or change the channel.      It's Chris Morris' job to make satire of important issues, that's what he does and he absolutely needs to be allowed to do it. The press constantly tell us of their need to be able to report things and express opinions without the intervention of government, i.e. The News of the World regarding their offensive, distasteful and exploitive coverage of the Sarah Payne story. Yet they are exactly the same people asking for Brass Eye to be banned! Chris Morris has a better idea of what is wrong with this country than anyone in government, let alone the so-called culture secretary. If she really based her opinion on those of the tabloids instead of watching the programme first, then she should resign for being a complete idiot.      For those who complained against the programme, c'mon folks: it was after the watershed, it was Channel 4, and Brass Eye's reputation precedes it. Anyone accepting to be a guest on ""Have I Got News for You"" knows they will be lampooned. Anyone watching a Chris Morris show knows that the presentation will be near the bone. Nobody told you to watch, and the show was not misrepresented in the listings! So why do the tabloids now rail against it? Considering the lewd content of most of these rags, they are hardly in a position to preach! To close, a quote from Swift, usually accepted as one of the English language's greatest satirists: ""Satire is a sort of glass, wherein beholders do generally discover everybody's face but their own.""      Brass Eye heightens our awareness of the exploitation techniques employed by the media by (slightly) exaggerating them, in order that we recognise these methods for what they are when we observe the ""real"" media. A lesson that will sadly be lost on News of the World readers.      I don't like Chris Morris very much, and I personally find his programmes usually too uncomfortable to watch, but I am quietly celebrating the fact that the British tabloid media (and its all-too-loyal following) is finally being forced to face up to the sheer stupidity and sheer hypocrisy of its sensationalist coverage of paedophilia. A nice, well-balanced debate chaired by Mariella Frostrup might have been more tasteful, but would it provoke this amount of debate about an extremely important issue? Thought not.      Does Atkinson's Blackadder satire on life in the 1st world war trenches demean the people that actually had to live through it? Quite the reverse. Humour is an important mechanism for survival, as many who have had to live through appalling circumstance will testify. When previously taboo subjects are satirised in mainstream ""entertainment"" then real progress is being made in looking at issues beyond the blindingly obvious.      For politicians to pontificate on prime news programmes without even having the courtesy to have watched the programme they claim to be so offended by is, as John Humpreys said, absurd!      As one who did watch the programme I cottoned on to the obvious point the programme was trying to make. Yes it is a horrible subject but that doesn't stop the tabloids exploiting it for all they are worth to the detriment of society and that is what the programme was trying to say.      As Brass Eye pokes fun at the overblown aspects of the News Media, how else do we expect them to react? I see Brass Eye as a piece of modern art, tailored to make our mainstream minions question themselves. It seems that the ones that have too much of a fear of facing up to reality are the first to jump on the bandwagon by casting the stones. As for Tessa Jowell, she didn't even see the programme so I presume she is siding her bets on a non-confrontational safe option, like all of our terrified, gutless MP's.      The Government must step in to ensure that people too stupid to change channels are protected from this sort of humour. All hail Government censorship!      For all those who thought this was a ""Great bit of TV"" try considering the real victims behind all this. Would you find it a joke if you, a friend or family member had suffered in this manner? I think not. Even though the whole idea was to get at the media a more serious documentary would have been more appropriate. Tessa Jowell is listening to what the MAJORITY of this country felt when they saw Brass Eye. If the intention was to ridicule the media, maybe it should have been done with a less sensitive issue, but would that get the viewing figures or the media publicity?      Not that I saw the show, but in general, government is not to interfere with the media, period. Media boards are meant to regulate themselves with the help of independent monitors. And in this case, we are talking about a channel that has time and again proved that it is able to make informed and responsible choices to the enlightenment of its viewers, however controversial the subject might be.      The media does not like Chris Morris and Chris Morris does not like the media. Channel 4 took a big risk in airing this show and they should be supported for it.      Freedom of speech is the first priority! Once government gets involved there is no limit to censorship. The fact that some people abuse the free speech right is no reason to get the government involved. The fact that the US has free speech as its first amendment to the Constitution is no accident. Freedom of the press will survive if government is not allowed to change the rules. It's up to the people to decide whether TV programs are suitable to be watched by them and their families. Wake up Brits before its too late!      The media would seem to be creating yet more raw material for Chris Morris to exploit.      I can only second the defences of the programme set out so eloquently below. One thing I would add is this: there were 800-odd complaints against this programme set against viewing figures of maybe 100,000. Why should such a relatively small number of complainants constitute a catalyst for government intervention? As ever, the vocal minority will exert influence well beyond their proportion. If 10,000 complaints had been received, they would still have been in a stark minority.      I personally found the programme not half as funny as the old one which followed it, partly due to the subject at hand, and partly because I feel some of it was in pretty poor taste. However, even if I'd utterly hated the show, I'd still see no reason for it to be banned. It's quite clearly not encouraging any kind of harmful behaviour, and if anyone found it too offensive for them, the ""off"" button is usually quite prominently marked on most TVs.      It's amazing how many commentaries I've read about this include the phrase ""I didn't actually watch the programme myself""... Are these the rounded opinions of a rational debate? I think the reaction to the programme is exactly what Chris Morris & co were satirising and totally hammers home the point of the show (as if that were necessary). The sort of satire which makes the Government want to ban something is always worth watching!      Whatever happened to freedom of speech? Are we really now back to the days of Lady Chatterley's Lover? If Tessa Jowell looked carefully, she would see that her gross over-reaction indicated just how razor-sharp Chris Morris's satire against media sensationalism has been.      Since people who have never seen the show are allowed to complain about how bad Brass Eye is, I'd like to say how good it is. I haven't seen the show in question, but I can well believe that it is in as bad taste as everyone is making out.      However, the world will be a better place if, after all the fuss about the program dies down, people feel that it is easier to have an open discussion about society's treatment of important issues. At the moment, it seems as though there is a taboo over issues like race-equality and paedophilia. People are afraid of allowing public debate about what is right and wrong, in case the outcome should challenge our current beliefs.      Having spent most of my day in the office reading about this story on various news and discussion sites, it has become evident that a majority of people have expressed an informed opinion that the show has a right to present us with a depiction of our country that challenges us, whether or not they feel that it makes good television. Programmes such as Brass Eye make us continually re-evaluate our perceptions and understanding of society, thus preventing such an apathetic responses to issues of national importance as was demonstrated in the electoral turn out earlier this year.      Yes, there are people who strongly object to the program (whether they have seen it or not) and who feel it should be banned, and I wouldn't want to quash their right to free speech by banning articles and programmes that express this opinion. The majority of moral outrage has come from the national press, who see an opportunity to boost their circulation, thus wholly enforcing the point of Chris Morris et al, and the politicians, who fall over themselves to be associated with fighting this evil scourge that The News Of The World would claim will tear asunder the very fabric of our great nation.      Fortunately I did not see the Brass Eye special on paedophilia the other night but I am sickened by any programme which can glorify this subject. How can anyone show images like I have read about and call this entertainment. The people of Britain do not want to watch filth like this. I say give us more Hi-de-Hi not Brass Eye.      Ms Jowell would do better to direct her energies towards sorting out the monumental mess that is the Millennium Dome rather than pursuing Channel 4. At least the public have a choice as to whether they watch Brass Eye or not - Londoners have no choice as regards ""New"" Labour's multi-million pound eyesore on the horizon...      I saw most of Brasseye - I missed the start - and I think those who want it banned are completely missing the point. Yes it made me laugh - the lampooning of the press's paranoia at the power of computers, the idiot celebrities too obsessed with their own self publicity to even examine what they were reading out, but like all good satire it also made me feel uncomfortable. Satire is like 'proper' dark chocolate, not sweet and bland, but bitter and with real depth.      I didn't see the programme in question, but have to say that I'm rather shocked. I consider myself open-minded, but find it strange that the defence for the show's airing was that it challenges the media's/ society's perception of contentious issues. Surely Channel 4 has fallen into the same trap as those it is trying to expose, by profiting from a shock factor? I disagree, however, that the public need to be protected from shows like Brass Eye. The authorities should credit viewers with enough intelligence to decide for themselves what is within the realms of decency, according to their personal tastes. Would they ban documentaries on the BNP? I doubt it.      It was brilliant TV, and the stir it has caused demonstrates its relevance. Tessa Jowell was on Radio 5 Live this morning, discrediting the programme and then admitted that she had not seen it! Says it all really.      I'd rather ban Tessa Jowell      Typical. The Government will pursue a TV programme with all its vigour, but when it actually comes to targeting paedophiles and locking them up suddenly they don't seem so concerned. No doubt we'll shortly hear how a paedophile is getting legal aid so that they can sue the programme over the distress it caused them.      I saw most of the programme and thought that it was in extremely poor taste at best and in the main offensive. There obviously is a valid message hidden amongst the spoofs but it is way too sensitive a subject to cover in this way. I suppose the Government are the final 'watchdog' so in that respect they are right to intervene. However Ms Jowel should have watched the programme first.      The prospect of government intervention really worries me. We voted in a government so that it would protect our interests which means that we need one with enough intellectual rigour to be able to separate satire from reality. It seems to me that one woman being offended at something should not allow her to dictate what everyone else can or cannot see. I for one don't need protecting from satire.      I rather like the way that the papers that are condemning the programme now are the same ones that, last year, praised mothers for teaching their children songs about hanging and killing, and published names of ""alleged"" paedophiles - which rather proves the point of the programme.      The Brass Eye special was one of the funniest pieces of satire I have ever watched. The tabloid reaction is completely to be expected and shows that the majority of people in this country did not realise what the programme was about. Also, the celebrities involved should be ashamed that they were duped so easily, obviously looking for some publicity. A keyboard that emits noxious fumes? How can ANYONE take that seriously? Nonce-Sense indeed.      After all these years you'd think that people would have learned how to either change channels or switch the TV off! Before I spent time and money banning these kind of programmes, I'd seriously think about instituting college courses on how to operate a TV.      The only reservation I had about the programme was the use of children. Some of the scenes, especially with the paedophile in the dock, could, and should, have been filmed such that the child was not present for the spoken words. Apart from that I expect all the right people have been offended. I am sure others will make the point that it was on late at night and, as always, the off button could have been used. I agree with them.      I watched this episode of 'Brass Eye' realised what the subject matter was and then turned over after about 10 minutes. I felt that as comedy satire it was very poor and in poor taste. The people who find this funny need to seriously look hard at themselves as they must lack the most basic of compassion for abused children who are the most vulnerable people in society. I enjoy good satire, I loved to watch Spitting Image as a teenager and have enjoyed good satire ever since. Brass Eye wasn't funny at all. It wasn't challenging either but rather juvenile. I felt it only served to undermine the difficult work that the child protection agencies do. If this is Chris Morris' supposed genius at work, he's not good enough to be on TV. As for Tessa Jowell, she's no better than the celebs who were on Brass Eye who didn't know what the programme was about either.      Paedophile is the one word guaranteed to provoke a knee-jerk reaction, whatever the context. The deep irony is that this edition of Brass Eye ridiculed the very media and public hysteria that has predictably been generated.     I found some of the programme funny, some of it disturbing. But I didn't miss the point that the satire wasn't aimed at paedophilia in general, but at the media circus that feeds off this disgusting crime. Its a pity that many people can't see that satire can have a serious purpose other than raising laughs.      As a survivor of childhood sexual abuse, I personally found the show to be unamusing and in poor taste. Not because of the attempts to satirise the media, rather because it undermines the work that genuine children's charities such as the NSPCC and Childline are attempting to do.      However, I am an adult, as anyone watching at that time should be, and I know where the off switch is. I beleive that freedom of expression is a basic right, and that it would set a very dangerous precedent for the government to become involved in this issue.      The real pressure against this programme is coming from the 'celebrities' who have been shown up for being unintelligent, self-publicists who are completely out of touch with the modern world. How could anyone really believe that a special set of gloves would allow someone to 'feel up' a user through their monitor?      I actually think this is one my favourite programs on TV. It is offbeat, satirical, judgmental, opinionated, in extremely bad taste, but most of all FUNNY. Anyone with half a brain can surely see the humour in the pseudo-news items.      All the hoo-hah from the government and other groups just goes to show that Chris Morris was right about the media's fascination with and sensationalising of paedophilia. What politicians are really upset about is that so many of them were shown to be so stupid by Morris in the making of many of his shows.      In the 18th century Jonathan Swift proposed that the poor eat their children to allay their poverty. This was a satirical piece. It's purpose, to demonstrate the plight of the poor of Dublin and satirise the attitudes of the ruling classes. Chris Morris has been doing the same for years. It is precisely the kind of media inspired mob frenzy that he regularly satirises that is being directed against him at the moment. The way the paedophilia issue is dealt with by the press and by politicians at this time is exploitative of the victims as well and creates witch hunts rather than a sensible way of dealing with this horrible issue.      Satire is not light comedy. It has a hard social purpose. It is interesting that an attempt is on to use this to in tighten surreptitious censorship.      Should the government intervene? Not without watching the programme themselves first rather than making judgements based on second hand reports in tabloid newspapers.      One can only hope Mr Morris is currently running around in disguise getting daft celebs and bandwagon hungry politicos to lambast Brass Eye for a later show.      I couldn't believe the front page of the Daily Mail - ""the sickest show on TV"" they cried. Yet it is that kind of sensationalism that Brass Eye constantly highlights. I say well done to Chris Morris for exposing the media to what they do worst!      It truly astounds and saddens me when I read about the frenzied backlash created by the media, for the media, in response to the evidently highly contentious episode of Brass Eye. It was EXACTLY this kind of moralistic, one-sided response that was being so expertly lampooned in the programme.      The truly saddest thing to come from all this are the people in power who seem so hell bent to review the regulation of free speech, without actually having watched the programme! Ask yourself this, what is the point of free speech if no-one is listening to what is being said.      What is going on with ""New Labour""? How can the Culture Secretary comment on programmes she has not seen. Maybe she ought to go into film/theatre criticism - she could get a lot done without ever having to leave the house. Brass Eye, as ever, was an intelligent contribution to the debate on the role that the media plays in our society. The show was not about ""paedophilia"" it was about the media's response to it. Frankly, I am more offended by the bland nature of most of the network's output than I was by this. This sort of programme should be celebrated not pilloried. Once Ms Jowell gets 'round to seeing the programme I hope she will agree.      Unfortunately, given the 'normal distribution' of characteristics like intelligence, there will always be a majority of not so bright people who miss the point. It's just a shame when our politicians pander to the lowest common denominator.     People are missing the point. The programme was not about paedophilia. It was about the way in which the media covers such topics. Everything should be questioned! That is why we need programmes like this.      How is it possible to make light of something as serious as paedophilia? I thought the program was insensitive and did not deserve a slot on national television. There are claims that the program was produced to challenge the way in which the media sensationalises paedophilia. What is next? Racism? Cannibalism? Drug abuse? Their motivation is twisted and I don't believe that people so out of touch with reality should be working for a television company. They lost the plot from the start.      Ms Jowell should quietly backdown. The Government did nothing to condemn the tabloids for the name and shame campaign last year, but will consider doing something now to a show that highlighted the hate that such reporting can stir up. Honestly! Is it compulsory for Ministers to make themselves look foolish at the earliest possible time after taking up their duties?      So, hours and hours of puerile toilet humour and cheap 'reality' TV is totally acceptable, but god forbid we should watch any program with a satirical point to make about current affairs and controversial issues? I was not in the least bit offended by the program, and applaud Channel Four's decision to show it.      Censorship is a terrible thing, and a move to ban the Brass Eye program would be the thin end of the wedge. I am more offended by the mind numbing rubbish that passes for Saturday night entertainment these days - leave Brass Eye to get on with an excellent job.      I found this 'Brass Eye' special a witty and well observed satire, which, like previous 'Brass Eye' programmes, was sometimes compelling, sometimes uncomfortable to watch. But I feel the outrage caused by this programme will mean that Chris Morris and co. will find it difficult to get any more material onto mainstream television.      I personally found the Brass Eye Special to be one of the funniest and most relevant satirical shows to be broadcast in recent years. It is surely the role of satirists to point out the knee-jerk reactions of both the press and, more to the point the government, when they are likely to lead to mob rule and persecution of the innocent.      Many of complainants will have watched the show purely to be offended and therefore to have something to complain about. It is this mentality that is giving the government an excuse to interfere with what can be shown on television and pushing us even further towards a nanny state. Top marks to Chris Morris and the team for showing up an overly sanitised and dumbed-down media.      Who has the right to determine what people laugh at? I thought the Channel 4 spoof documentary was hilarious, how dare politicians and do-gooders dictate to us what in their view is or is not appropriate for humour! If they did their jobs properly in the first place, then this wouldn't be as much an issue as it is in our society today!      Chris Morris has a unique talent; to show us commoners how na?ve, hypocritical or simply stupid some of our masters in the realms of media and celebrity are. The media (especially the printed variety) enjoys a wonderful position of being able to treat us like idiots, telling us how we should believe, behave and vote, and gets barrels of money for the privilege. There should be no government intervention in the media, but when some of their base tactics to sell copy are exposed for all to see, this should be a cause for celebration.      It's a shame the effort that has gone into condemning this programme could not have been spent more productively. Once again the tabloids have whipped up a frenzied outcry which has nothing to do with addressing issues and everything to do with increasing profits - something I find far more sickening than anything Brass Eye has ever come up with. "
HOC HOC-HM -0.18 " Legalise. We should aim to keep young people away from drug dealers where they learn about drugs, just as we try to avoid sending them to prison to learn about crime.      I don't think society is ready to legalise cannabis just yet, because it is clear that, while it is relatively harmless for many people, it is deadly to others and destroys their lives (the same is true of alcohol however.) Legal cannabis would magnify all the health problems associated with booze. However, someday science may discover what the genetic markers are that indicate whether a person who tries something is likely to become an addict. Then all drugs could be legalised but only for people who have been ""cleared"" based on their genotype.  Not only should cannabis be legalized, it should be fully exploited. It is the world's most efficient ""bio-converter"" or producer of biomass per sq. acre. It produces fine cloth, though it uses none of the pesticides or herbicides that cotton does. It can be used more efficiently than corn to produce ethanol for clean-burn engines. Its seeds have the perfect essential fatty acid mix for the human body. Perhaps best of all, it has the promise to end the world's dependency on fossil fuel with a renewable resource that can produce four crops per year in a place like Canada. On top of it, you can sell recreational marijuana for one-tenth the current ""street price"", cut the criminals out of the equation, and get the tax money.  It's about time! So much hypocrisy and ignorance surrounds the drugs debate and I take my hat off to Mr Lilley for having the courage to at least address it. The sooner it is legalised, the sooner the British public (and would it be too hopeful to include other societies round the world )will realise that all the other lies about drugs are just that. Prohibition will fail absolutely.  5 million people x 5 pounds per week (in duty) x 52 weeks per year = 1.3 Billion pounds of money to spend on public services each year.  I think cannabis should be made legal and then all the MPs in parliament be forced to smoke it!!!!!  I am a business director and regular user of cannabis. I am not a Tory voter but would if the plans put forward by Peter Lilley were put in practice. I agree that people are being pushed toward the drug underworld, and for young users getting the option of other class A drugs is inevitable.  I smoke cannabis fairly regularly - I socialise with my friends, have a good time with great conversation and many laughs all in the comfort of the front room at home. I don't stagger out of pubs, urinate or vomit in alleyways, spray take-away food litter on the street or get into fights. Nuff said!  In the present situation, large-scale smuggling and dealing in cannabis is under the control of some very unpleasant individuals. This means that a lot of the money spent on cannabis at the moment is also being funnelled into prostitution, racketeering and hard drug smuggling and dealing. I don't know about the rest of the UK, but in Edinburgh and Glasgow, cannabis means a dubious tarry substance of unknown origin and composition. It certainly bears little resemblance to real Hashish as seen in Amsterdam. Regulation of the trade would reduce harm to people who choose to use cannabis by supplying a higher quality product enabling people to get as stoned as they wish to on less smoke.  England is a sick country. First you got mad cow disease, then foot and mouth, now you want to legalise drugs. What kind of society are you becoming? Are you mad???  How many dope smokers smoke cigarettes because they have to mix the resin into a joint and so become addicted to nicotine? If the leafy version of cannabis was readily available, how many people would stop smoking tobacco? The smell of cannabis is not unpleasant, whilst tobacco and the people who smoke it stink! I vote for legalisation of cannabis and criminalisation of tobacco, if only to preserve my nostrils.  As a scientist, my greatest fear about legalising cannabis is the number of extra lung cancers that will come as a result.      In the USA you have an additional problem however: dependence on the automobile. It is no coincidence that in most of the US you cannot drink until you are 21 - but you can drive when you are 16(!) and nearly everyone does. Stoned drivers would magnify the drunken driving problem that exists, and I don't see an easy way around this.  Don't legalise cannabis. Leave the law on this as it is. It's bad enough having to passively smoke normal cigarettes, I do not want to find myself in a pub or on the tube passively smoking someone else's fix. Politicians should concentrate on more important policies like the repeal of section 28 and not be bothered about a law which unfortunately, obviously isn't being adhered to anyway.  Cannabis should be legalised but approached in the same way as alcohol. There should be laws preventing driving under the influence, as the reactions are impaired. You never see cannabis users rampaging through towns on Friday and Saturday nights, fighting and causing general unrest. Alcohol is much more anti-social than cannabis will ever be.  The time has come for cannabis laws in the UK to be reviewed. 1 in 10 adults smoke cannabis and that's a fact. Why should people smoking cannabis in the safety of their own home, or in a pub, be disallowed by law? I really don't understand why this is. Alcohol can cause violence and long-term health problems, yet there is no medical evidence to show that cannabis causes anywhere near the problems alcohol consumption does. The fact is that most people go on to harder drugs because they are available from their cannabis dealer. if you cut this link, drug dealers will be unable to catch young people into the web of class A drugs. Better still, enable the legalisation of cultivating cannabis for personal use, and it cuts out any money changing hands whatsoever. Imagine the revenue the government could make from cannabis tax?  Have you ever seen a stoned person starting fights, or causing trouble? I think not.  I know you can take cannabis by other means, but most people smoke it. I think it should not be legalised since it would encourage smoking, which is far more dangerous. Find another safe delivery method and I would have few objections.  Cannabis should be made legal along with other illegal drugs. The government have lied to the general public for 30 years on this issue. The UK spend upwards of 3 billion pounds last year on the war on drugs. The reality is prohibition creates a black market that supplies bad quality drugs and introduces users to dealers that try and push more addictive drugs. The argument that cannabis leads to harder drugs is only true because of the way it is supplied - the dealers encourage the use of more addictive higher-profit drugs. Take the dealer out of the link and you eradicate the risk of use of harder drugs.  Morphine (heroin) is proved to have no adverse effects on the body (except constipation). Street heroin contains all sorts of contaminates and the doses are not controlled (thus overdoses occur). A new approach to the use of drugs is needed. In a controlled (taxable) environment lives would be saved and people's health would not be at risk.  Cannabis should be legalised. It's not true that it necessarily leads to harder drugs, just as it's ridiculous to claim that your first pint of beer will lead you to alcoholism. Anyway, I think that if English football supporters smoked the weed instead of gulping down 14 pints of lager, perhaps we would not been seen as violent thugs but as chilled out and happy, man!  It's important to separate what a law says from what a law does. By legalising cannabis you change the nature of the system, and therefore the problems associated with that change. The present system of illegality works! People are effectively free to smoke cannabis in the privacy of their own homes; but as soon as you legalise cannabis you change the culture of cannabis use, which is bound to bring with it all sorts of new social problems. The law is merely a technicality that is used to keep things stable, and with cannabis it is clearly working in a useful way.  Don't the government realise that once cannabis is made legal then they'll have an endless source of taxable income to cream off society? How many hospital beds are worth one joint then?      The ridiculous comment from Emma (UK), concerning the ""Kit Kat"" craving from smoking cannabis should be condemned. This kind of attitude is both frivolous and demeaning to all wanting to enter a profound and serious debate on the cannabis issues. As every cannabis user will know, Dime bars are the far superior.  Two points: 1) If you smoke a lot of cannabis you're going to fall asleep, if you drink 10 pints you're going to be a danger to yourself and others. 2) Anti-legalisation people say all those on hard drugs started on cannabis; you'll probably find they also smoke, drink, eat red meat, watch TV, drink water etc etc.  I drink alcohol and I have smoked cannabis on two occasions about ten years ago. I did inhale and I did enjoy it. Nevertheless in my opinion cannabis should not be legalised, for the simple reason that there are already enough mood-altering substances circulating in society as it is. I am very familiar with the well-rehearsed arguments about cannabis being less dangerous than alcohol, but it is naive in the extreme to think that if it was legalised all the alcohol users would switch to the substance. If legalisation occurred, consumption of all legal (and as a knock-on, illegal) drugs would increase. I do not believe that a more stoned society would be a better society.  Yeahhh..... maaaan!!!!  The argument that something is OK just because something else is cuts both ways. If, as Rob Harris says, alcohol and tobacco are as harmful as cannabis, then they should be 'criminalised' too.  It's time to face the facts. Cannabis is so easily available and legalisation would remove many criminal gangs in one go. Also the issue of drugs needs to be addressed. I don't do any hard drugs but through my 'dealer' I know it would never be a problem to get whatever I could think of. Politicians and the establishment need to pull their heads out of the sand, they have been talking rubbish about the war on drugs for years.  I have never voted Conservative in my life, but if the party officially adopted a pro-legalisation stance, they would have my vote in the future without question.  The war against cannabis, hasn't worked. It's about time my tax paying pounds were spent elsewhere - like on health/ education. Let's take drug profits away from the criminal underworld.  There are more than 5 million regular cannabis users in the UK alone. These people are citizens and should demand their right to choose to use cannabis. After all, it's well known that it is no more problematic than alcohol or tobacco. The idea that cannabis should be illegal by default - no discussion - and that some kind of medical justification is needed to end the persecution of users is inherently undemocratic, and requires a grossly puerile, elitist and megalomaniacal authoritarian mindset.      It's important to understand the difference between legalisation and decriminalisation. There's certainly a strong case for decriminalising cannabis use (dealing is another matter) - after all, do we really want to be giving young people criminal records for smoking a joint? However, to actually legalise cannabis is a much bigger step - controlled sales of the drug through a system of off-licence style outlets would probably lead to a big increase in the number of people using cannabis, with the attendant health problems (mainly cancer). Perhaps removing the threat of a criminal record from cannabis users would be a sensible first step.      Clive from Down Under warns of turning ourselves into a nation of ""fuzzy-headed, crisp eating, TV watching vegetables"". I consider that infinitely preferable to the current situation in town on a Friday night which appears to be fuzzy-headed, kebab-spewing, window-smashing traffic-cone throwing thugs.      This is a civil rights issue. The possible negative effects should be dealt with as separate issues - cracking down on drivers who are affected by any drugs, for example, as they endanger others. But where the harm, if any, can only come to the user, let the user decide what to do within his/her body. Use should never be encouraged, but I do not accept that the State has a right to interfere beyond giving advice.      Mass opinion is not always the same as informed opinion. In this case the majority argument seems eminently sensible. Progressive decriminalisation and control would please the law abiders; squeeze the black marketers; and swell Gordon Brown's coffers, with a probable net gain in social side effects.      It's not a perfect answer I grant you, but then Utopia was never around the corner. I just wish that someone would take the policy seriously instead of saying it for effect and popularity, before conveniently neglecting to put their money where their mouth is come crunch-time.      If you take the principle that if a law does not work you should legalise it then what about car crime, tax evasion, house breaking and oh yes, the oldest profession.      The cannabis laws are outdated in western Europe. Only the Netherlands recognise that cannabis is neither more harmful or any less socially acceptable than alcohol. In keeping with their mature attitude their policy of freedom of choice better reflects both the drug itself and the concept that in this modern age we should be treated as adults and allowed be allowed to make our own choices as free individuals.      Criminalisation of any recreational drug simply does not work. It goes against basic human freedom. It puts far too much money into the hands of criminals instead of creating a new business opportunity for many hardworking people. Billions of dollars are wasted jailing people who are in no way shape or form, a threat to society. May die from drugs that are laced with other poisons. Many more die from drug related dealings and having to purchase a simple drug for recreational purposes from usually violent criminals. Drugs are much easier for youths to obtain when illegal (I know from personal experience). Billions of dollars in tax revenues are lost. Medical research of the potential benefits of these drugs is hindered. There is no reason to criminalise a recreational drug.      I have an alcohol problem, it started when I used it to wind down after work and to get to sleep and then got out of hand. It's been over three years since I smoked cannabis and prior to that I took amphetamine regularly for over a year. I couldn't face being caught with either so I stopped outright with no problems. A year ago the drink started and now I have real problems. Get the priorities right, if cannabis was legal I wouldn't be downing half a bottle of vodka each night.      The legalisation issue is not really of concern to me as the drug is readily available and would no doubt be heavily taxed if made legal. I can't think of a single friend or associate who doesn't smoke cannabis and I believe that the figures often seen in surveys massively underestimate how widespread it's use has become. I see no harm whatsoever in smoking cannabis but do not believe that the Government is mature enough or secure enough to discuss the subject properly. It's seems to me that in the cases of Peter Lilley and others, their only real concern is how the subject will affect their chances of getting a nice new office in Downing Street. As a final point, if I were to bump in to a group of lads in a dark alley, I would feel a great deal safer if they had been smoking rather that drinking.      Legalize Cannabis! I suffer from MS and it helps ease the pains. I know more ugly drunks than happy dopers. I believe the world would be a happier place if everyone tried it at least once in their life time. How many police get calls for domestic violence caused by smoking cannabis over those for drunks? I have dated too many drunks and gotten my fair share of bruises from them, but not from those who smoked dope. I agree that car accidents are related to drug use but it is caused by lack of common sense. Have you ever heard of someone killing another person over cannabis? Not me.      I smoke cannabis, but I do believe its legalisation is yet more ""chipping away"" at societies rules, without which society could not exist. Maybe the good of the majority outweighs our individual desires.      Peter Lilley is to be commended for his good sense. Of course cannabis should be legalised. It is a nonsense to criminalize users of a drug that is less harmful than alcohol. Can anyone remember hearing of a case of domestic violence due to cannabis? It's strange that the zero-tolerance brigade have nothing to say about the huge numbers killed each year by alcohol or tobacco.      Aren't countries like Sweden that experimented with this idea now backtracking because its caused more drug related problems than its cured? Do we want to make another mind altering substance legal and add to the problems social acceptance of alcohol has given us? What message does this send to young people when we say that its OK to take something for no other reason than altering your state of mind, as opposed to dealing with the many problems we have in society? Wasn't the disintegration of the US army in Vietnam partly to do with endemic drug abuse, and what does that say for the effect of this drug on order and coherence in any society?      Legalising cannabis would be a disaster. Full stop. It saps the will to do anything when taken in even small quantities. If you want to turn Britain into a nation of fuzzy-headed, crisp eating, TV watching vegetables then go right ahead. And don't believe the people who tell you that it doesn't lead on to harder drugs - in a lot of cases it does - I've seen it.      I do not use cannabis, nor any other illegal drug, nor do I consume any alcohol. However I believe cannabis should be de-criminalized. They tell us it should be illegal because cannabis may be ""harmful and dangerous"" So are tobacco and alcohol - in the US these kill far, far more people than all illegal drugs combined. I'm sure the same is true in the UK      Cannabis is the thing end of the wedge leading to harder and more deadly drugs. You also create an army of part time drug dealers stepping up to full time hard core criminals selling deadly drugs to the same customers. What would you do then legalise the harder drug as they become more ""socially acceptable"" . Just nip it in the bud and lock up drug pushers rather than give them more oxygen.      There are an estimated five million uses in London alone. If they were paying the same tax as cigarettes the UK would be laughing. And it is hard to commit a crime when your world can be made perfect by the timely arrival of a Kit Kat.      As a serving Police officer I often see the results of drug abuse/use first hand, the ruined lives and destroyed minds. I am all in favour of an informed debate to openly discuss the pros and cons of decriminalising cannabis. As for government shops selling dope and taxing it - that won't stop the dealers and the black market who will sell it cheaper ""tax free""!      After the quality online discussion on this page, I should think that you might have done justice to the issue on the BBC World discussion on TV on Sunday by including at least one proponent of the idea of legalisation in the panel. The discussion raised a number of cautionary points but few of the issues in favour.      I have been a smoker for the last eight years, and still have not found any bad side-effects of the drug. Instead of increasing taxes on cigarettes and alcohol, why not legalise and tax cannabis? Not too much though! Or I would imagine many people would go back to getting it from their old dealers, if the prices shot up.      I have never tried cannabis, but I know many people who do. Sadly, when people buy any illegal drug they can do so only by putting money into the wallets of evil drug barons who resort to violence or even murder to further their aims. We cannot stop people smoking cannabis, so we should at least allow them to buy it from a safe legal source.      Cannabis should be legalised. I do not want to be labeled a criminal for smoking. However I would probably continue to purchase it on the black market if it were legalised because of the massive tax the government would no doubt put on it.      It is not, as a lot of people have said, astonishing that the Conservative party have aired this idea of decriminalisation. The Conservative Party, as anyone who has followed politics will know, has a libertarian tendency that at its most radical suggests the legalisation of all drugs. The Labour Party has never been associated with the liberalisation of anything.      I am pleased to see that the ever-present ""Gateway drug"" theory is getting a good hammering. The anti-cannabis lobby has repeated this rubbish over and over again, never realising that it is not proven and is a total fallacy. I know dozens of cannabis users (myself included) who have never taken hard drugs.      I can not really see the sense in not legalising cannabis. Anyone can obtain it, anywhere. It is used recreationally by millions of otherwise law abiding people who are all aware of its non-threatening, relaxing qualities. Every weekend I see people traumatized by the effects of a night using alcohol. The cannabis users I know dont appreciate aggression. Amsterdam is an eye opener, to see how a society has embraced change for the better. I truly believe the people of this country are more scared of 'change' than anything else. Give our country a chance to grow, ethically and financtuly. Let the UK be a guiding force for the future.      Present smokers are more far more likely to take to smoking cannabis than non smokers. Cannabis is much more expensive than tobacco. Cigarette addicts are already depriving their families of income that could be better spent, and now these same families might be faced with a bigger hit if cannabis were legalised. Those of you who espouse freedom of individual choice, please start thinking of the spouses and children of addicts!      How dare David Davis state so glibly on Breakfast with frost that Holland is a drug based society? Not only is Holland, in general a more law-abiding society than the UK but hard drug use has declined there over the last ten years not increased as Mr. Davis insisted. I do not take drugs myself but I follow events closely and Holland is a beacon to the rest of the world for common sense programmes.      Imagine all the good things cannabis tax revenue could be spent on. Imagine all the good things that the money wasted on policing cannabis users could be spent on. Imagine that cannabis users no longer have to come into contact with harder drugs. It is about time that we wake up and see that the United States policy of forcing the world to ban this drug has been disastrous.      I believe that cannabis should be legalised, but restricted, much as smoking is now. That way it would free up so much in the way of police resources (as well as the extra tax revenue for more police) so as to be able to fight truly dangerous drugs and the evil people that supply them. Think of the knock-on effect on drug related crime if the police could target heroin or crack properly, without the distraction of prosecuting someone with a couple of joints in their pocket. Maybe London's streets may start to feel safe again!      Imagine the British image in the near future - a bunch of socialist, chain smoking, ecstasy dropping, pot head, lager louts rioting over some football match result. A fine healthy ""socially progressive"" reality for your future.      I have been smoking cannabis for 20 years. The only problem that I have had with it is when I was busted with three grammes of hash and lost a good job because of having my name splashed in the local paper. If those in power really cared about our health, then they would have banned tobacco and alcohol products years ago.      The drug war is a colossal and corruptive failure that punishes the lower class unjustly. I believe alcohol and marijuana are parallel substances as well, except for the fact that alcohol is more of a plague on America what with all the drunk drivers who end up killing people and because of the violence that alcohol encourages. Industrial hemp needs to legalized more than anything as it is a viable resource that will save our forests.      After just leaving Amsterdam from a weekend tour I have changed my mind on the whole legalisation talk. I believe that ""special outlets"" similar to Amsterdam's coffee houses should be allowed, for the main reason that alcohol is not allowed in those places. Now think how many crimes are alcohol-related, and how many are cannabis-related! I think people are much more likely to go to these coffee houses than a bar. Therefore surely a reduction in crime may be the result.      Legalise it to get it out of the hands of criminals, but ban it from improper use, just like alcohol or tobacco. Oh, and then we should be able to grow that useful plant hemp again.      In more than 30 years of voting, I have never voted Tory. But if they adopt the policy of legalisation of cannabis, they may just get my vote. (Gulp...)      ALL drugs should be legalised. It is down to the individual's choice whether they want to destroy or kill themselves, not the choice of the government behaving like a nanny state, or campaigners and do-gooders constantly drumming down our throats how we should live and behave. Our society needs to take a long good luck in the mirror. We must stop dictating to people and getting wound up over peoples' actions and opinions.      It's good to see a range of opinions on this talkboard, because just as a hypocritical prohibitionist attitude to cannabis and other currently illegal drugs helps nobody, neither does the common attitude amongst young people that smoking cannabis does you good, and has positive effects on society. Like any drug, we use it, then rationalise our vices by exaggerating the positive side, and tend to forget that the mental effects of smoking cannabis (especially for people who have experienced forms of depression and the like) can be extremely traumatic. Like all forms of drug consumption, it is an inevitable but harmful practice in our society, and the law should take this into account by some form of decriminalisation, whilst using legalisation to exploit the potential benefits of its use for conditions such as Alzheimer's.      I find it funny that some of the people that say it should be banned are the same people that smoke and drink, both are more harmfully to our bodies and society. Cigs are more addictive than heroin IMO, and booze is responsible for so much crime. And as the weed being a gateway drug, I would like someone to show me someone that didn't try booze or a cig first, THE REAL GATEWAY DRUGS!      A comment on the theory that cannabis is a ""Gateway Drug"". It quite simply is not. Yes, it is true that every heroin addict, every cocaine user etc. has taken cannabis... But then, every meths drinker has had a pint of lager. One does not cause the other! Legalise cannabis now! It's a prohibition. It is hypocritical of the government to say No to legalising cannabis, but to allow the advertising of tobacco, a far more deadly drug.      I believe that drug use is escapism. Maybe if the government improved the situation that the country is in and paid a bit more attention to what the country is doing rather that what the opposition is doing, there would be little use for drugs. If cannabis is to be legalised it should only be allowed in private. Public use should be banned, same as it should be for smoking of all descriptions. I find it offensive and if you want to ravage your own lungs, please don't take mine down with you.      If the above quoted tax revenues are accurate, that combined with the money saved with police time, and decrease in criminal activity (because its no longer against the law) would certainly help the country. The health risks are not really any much more greater than smoking, and the THC in cannabis is NOT physically addictive; nowhere nearly as addictive as tobacco. In response to the unknown long-term effects of cannabis, as they are unknown, it is foolish to base a law on this - it would be easier to study long-term effects if legalised. I also believe it is also the individuals choice to take or leave the risk of smoking it; I find the nanny state becoming a little sickening, and more than a little irrational.      I don't drink alcohol or smoke tobacco, but I do enjoy smoking cannabis. I believe it causes less harm than either alcohol (no violence) or tobacco (no addiction and less inhaled smoke per day). I also believe in freedom of individual action, along with responsibility for self-inflicted harm. Yes, legalise it.      I want to see cannabis legalised, but not commercialised. The last thing on earth I want to see is the tobacco companies getting in on the act and promoting use of dope, although maybe Ken Clarke would disagree. I would like to see the law changed so that you can legally grow your own plants at home. I also agree that its simply crazy not to use cannabis as a crop, because it has so many uses.      It appears that the UK is ahead of the curve on drug decriminalisation. Kudos and keep up the good work! The political climate in the States is, as in George W's words: ""Incarceration is Rehabilitation."" Ah ok George, snort another line.      YES. Because a government entity should not control peoples' choices... And how can someone have the ego to ban a natural plant? Do they believe they have the power of a god to control something like that? It's even safe for the human body!      Never, never, never!      Hats off to Mr. Lilley for using some rationale and logic in pointing out the absurdities and silliness of this ""War on Drugs"" garb. The message being conveyed by governments around the globe is pure psycho-babble. They can justify the use of tobacco and alcohol when the two combined kill over 500,000 people a year in the U.S. alone? If somebody would please present factual, documented evidence of the number of people killed as a result of MJ a year. I would love to see. No one has been able to provide this information so far. Seriously, a lot of people are getting really tired of it! A lot of tax money is being spent and little results are being produced. This is completely and totally unacceptable.      I can't see this move working in the UK. It works in Holland apparently, but that is a completely different culture. The points about cutting out the underworld are very valid but people will still be able to get other drugs should they want to.      The problem with the legalisation of cannabis lies in the lack of an effective test for driving whilst drugged and the legal implications (in terms of financial liability) for any government legalising somthing that later turns out to be more carcinogenic than tobacco.      I think it is really daft that people who like to ""indulge"" in using cannabis to relax and stimulate their mind should be classed as criminals - there's such a stigma attached to that but it is okay to drink every night and that surely damages your body more anyway? I also however think alternative ways of taking it should be investigated. So many of the negative comment mentioned here and the medical issues are because people smoke it primarily. What about a new line in alco-pops? From what I've heard the effect Redbull and vodka have on you is almost illegal so, why not? And a lot of people agree that it is much nicer to be in a group of stoned people rather than drunk people, much more calm and relaxed and less aggro.      Cannabis is the biggest cash crop in this country, smoked by millions of people from all walks of life. Those who complain that legalisation or decriminalisation would lead to the use of harder drugs should consider how effective an attack on hard drug pushers we could create with the taxes we could gain from legalisation of a drug that is less dangerous and more prosocial than alcohol.      Should drugs be legalised? Of course they should. The profits at present are enormous. Terrorist organisations use the profits for arms purchases. Drug Barons use the profits to intimidate those who threaten their income. The taxpayer funds the costs of customs and police operations. Then pays for the users and sellers to go to jail. The high cost of drugs are born by the community, but the gains all go elsewhere. If economics can be used as an argument to close hospitals, schools and throw people out of work it can surly be used to legalise drugs.      It's quite amazing to think that a Conservative minister would talk more sense on this issue than Labour. Now that it is obvious to all that New Labour = Old Conservative, perhaps New Tory will become a truly radical political force? Unlikely perhaps, but I certainly shan't be voting Labour again...      Legalisation of MJ should be done to start a legalisation process all over the world.      The overwhelming support here for legalising cannabis confirms my long-held suspicions about the kind of people who write to Talking Point.      End the hypocrisy  End the lies  Just legalise...  Lead on Britian.      I believe that the education given to most people about what cannabis is, its uses and position as a so-called ""drug"" is greatly misleading. Firstly cannabis is not a drug, it cannot overdose and it is not addictive. The effective ""high"" cannot be a reason for criminalisation, since alcohol and all the arising ""legal herbal highs"" are present in legal, mass abundance. I know many people that use cannabis and none have ever used any hard drugs and are actually fully against cocaine and heroin. Cannabis is not a gateway drug.      Hemp has tremendous potential as a source of industrial, medical, nutritional and social benefit. The only reason I can possibly conceive for it not being taken full advantage of is that the ""old money"" corporations see how much money they could lose, and lobby strongly against it. Or am I just paranoid?      Cannabis is NOT just a mild and pleasant drug for some of us; it is a potent toxin which severely impairs our cerebral functioning. Taken repeatedly by such people it can lead to irreversible damage and even psychosis. Please don't forget this.      You may disagree with what I do, but when I smoke cannabis in the privacy of my home, I am not hurting or stealing from anyone, so therefore, in the nicest of ways, mind your own business.      Have our puritanical politicians learned nothing from the Prohibition period?      Look into the initial reasons behind cannabis prohibition in the US, and you find not an interest in public health, but a racist smear campaign by William Randolph Hearst to protect his wood pulp interests from cheaper, more competitive hemp products. Hemp was cultivated, used, and smoked for thousands of years with few ill effects, its reputation destroyed by a powerful US newspaper baron hell-bent on getting his way. The potential benefits of industrial hemp to the environment, paper and textile industries, and of smokable hemp to chronic pain sufferers and victims of many painful diseases, greatly outweigh any ill effects on society, many of which are the result of prohibition, not the drug itself.      Yes cannabis should be legalised, otherwise alcohol and tobacco should be outlawed. But prohibition leads to terrible problems, as we already know. I used to be a long-term dope smoker and heroin addict. The only reason I started taking heroin was because it was supplied by the same illegal dealers whom I used to be obliged to visit to buy my dope. Otherwise it would never have crossed my mind to embark on 18 years of pumping poisons into my veins. Those people who repeat ""parrot style"" that smoking dope leads, automatically, to hard drugs clearly haven't sat down and given the subject any real thought or taken the time to study the infrastructure of the illegal drug culture.      No it should not be legalised because it IS addictive, and living with someone who sometimes ""needs"" 50 pounds worth of the stuff a week is depressing and expensive. Not to mention increased health risks and less safe driving. More people on cannabis would cost the health service an absolute fortune. For god's sake DON'T DO IT.      It is difficult to argue that drug laws have been in any way effective over the last 30 years. It seems that the law has completely failed to control what is generally perceived to be a problem. Therefore in order to move forward, new ideas must be examined. Whilst we are all too aware of tragedies that have occurred as a result of drug use, it is rare that the media represents those people who use recreational drugs in a sensible manner and have an enjoyable experience with minimal risk. These people form the majority of drug users.      Decriminalising cannabis would have more positive effects than negative. It could reduce the level of violence in our society. People would be a lot less likely to get into fights on a Saturday night as they would be ""chilled out"". I am a cannabis smoker and I am pushed into contact with criminals due to its prohibition. I am not a criminal in any other aspect I just like to smoke dope. I am a decent responsible person, just like thousands of other pot smokers.      The ""weed"" did wonders for the likes of Peter Tosh and Bob Marley. May be it can do wonders to other people also. So, legalise it!      Why pretend that cannabis is illegal for any other reason than economics? Cannabis makes big money. The alcohol and nicotine ""cartels"" already sell us the legal drugs, which cause more harm than cannabis in terms of health, violence and days off sick. The only hold up on legalisation is surely allowing for the proper marketing of cannabis by the over ground drug barons, rather than the ""underground"". Any government worth its salt would be already making deals with the big boys, it makes economic sense to do so, so we must assume some of the these big ""legal"" dealers are already embarking in the back room deals which will ultimately lead to the supply shifting from ""under"" to ""over ground"". In the meantime, about 80%+ of us have to remain criminals whilst the fat cats get ready to cream off the profits.      A Tory politician bringing this into debate is quite astounding - and impressive. The automatic ""No debate"" response is a reflection of the lack of open politics this country suffers from and why so many people did not vote in the election. As to some of the entries here, with things such as cannabis is worse than alcohol effects, shows that like many of the people administering the prohibition, the people making entries have no knowledge of the subject or experience of users. I do not smoke dope at present but appreciate its better effects than drink in terms of violence and character change.      I agree that cannabis should be decriminalised. By doing this, police time is freed up for more important things. This does not mean that cannabis is a safe drug, however. From my own experience, long-term cannabis smokers tend to lose the drive to achieve, suffer from cognition problems and will probably be a considerable burden on society when they reach old age. Visit Christiania in Denmark to see the long-term effects of daily cannabis use: It's not pretty. But, it's a question of moderation, isn't it? What gets me is the government's disingenuity about the issue... I can't imagine the current pilot project in the Met police area going ahead without Whitehall's blessing. Furthermore, Radio 4 is increasingly carrying content which is cannabis-friendly. I think public opinion is being prepared for decriminalisation within this parliament. After all, it's hard to riot when you're stoned, unless you have a full supply of chocolate bars.      As usual, the pro-cannabis lobby always think of their selfish needs. The countries that produce the crop, are probably the poorest in the world. ""Liberation Armies"" or mafia gangs control the taxation and production. These countries already owe billions to the World Bank, because so much land is turned over to the production of drugs, and food production gets left behind. Every time you take a drag on your spliff, have a thought for the producers, who get none of the profit, but get all the misery. Decriminalising drugs would simply encourage farmers and others in third world countries to give in to the drug barons, and cultivate the plants. Making the production like a cash crop, will not solve their problems either.      Cannabis consumption DOES lead to hard drug use. I chose to use cannabis from my own free will about 10 years ago. Since that time I have dabbled in other drugs like amphetamines, Ecstasy, etc, etc. Why did I do that? Simple, they were being sold by the same people who sold me cannabis. Break the link and bingo, lower hard drug use. Now ordinarily I don't agree with Tory policies but...      Up until November 2000 I was on 10/18 df118's + 8/12 paracetemol and anti-depressants for severe pain and discomfort(DAILY). I am now using cannabis (weed) and no longer use any tablets. I have no side effects and live as normal a life as possible. The reason some people move on to harder drugs is they have to go to the illegal dealer where more often than not other drugs are on offer. It makes sense to me to take the hard drugs out of the equation. You need somewhere to purchase cannabis totally free from temptation and peer pressure.      Think of countries like Saudi Arabia, where people would be horrified to consider allowing off-licences to be built to sell alcohol to over 18s, but what is out attitude in the UK towards alcohol? Some countries may be horrified at the thought of their populations becoming alcoholic, like the UK, but we live quiet happily with it and society accepts it here, so why does the government worry about us becoming a ""mildly druggie nation"" if cannabis was legalised? If anyone really wants to use cannabis, they can get it now quite easily, so why not simply let the individual person be credited with the intelligence to choose for themselves and let the state benefit from the taxation benefits, rather than the drug dealers?      Yes. People use it. And have always used it. Why does it still have to be severely punished all around the world?      Britain is proud of its reputation of tolerance. 30 years ago, homosexuality was illegal, and the same arguments were used to keep it illegal - since homosexuality is illegal then all homosexuals are by definition criminals. The same applies to cannabis - while it is illegal then users are forced to associate themselves with criminals. The real reason that it will not be legalised in this country is that the brewers pay the politicians vast sums to keep it illegal, because they realise that if cannabis were legal then people would prefer it to alcohol.      In 1983 I was arrested by two plain-clothes policemen in the street in Brixton and charged with possession of 1.04 grams of cannabis. I was fined 30 pounds when I appeared at the magistrates court. Since I consider the law against cannabis ""petty, archaic and misguided"", I refused to pay the fine. I was given a week in Pentonville Prison as a reward for my protest. That happened in the Nanny State of Britain 20 years ago, and yet that ""archaic"" law I objected to still applies. If the Conservatives had put the legalization of cannabis on their list of promises during the last election, Tony Blair would have had a serious challenge to his leadership. As it is, ""Cool Britannia"" is just a sham.      If only the Tories had tried the tolerant stance pre-election I'd have voted for them. Politicians have enough to do trying to run the country - they should leave running my life to me. I enjoy pot, I avoid tobacco - my choice based on facts rather than hype. It should be legal for all adults and sold in coffee-shop-type outlets like in Holland. Maybe there will be a few more mellow people around at first but this is a Good Thing. I mean, there's nothing actually wrong with giggling, talking about God and asking your friends to ""write this down, it's soooo deep!"" If we had a real debate over this with real facts, cannabis would be seen as the marvellous plant it is. And yes, I ""am"" a musician.      I strongly believe that cannabis should be legalised. At the moment for cannabis users the biggest risk is the possibility of getting a criminal record, not a health risk! But apart from that I think that legalisation would also lead to a change in attitude to the other benefits of cannabis- it is easy to grow and has many uses- as a replaceable source of fuel for the future when our natural fossil fuels run out, fabric- apparently to use hemp instead of cotton most fabric manufacturers would have to make small changes to the machinery, also detergents and plastic products. It is a shame that such a raw material has been virtually ignored due to its druggy connotations, and propaganda generated by the oil producers.      I have smoked cannabis since 1976 and since then I have met people from ALL walks of life around at the dealers house. I'd bet some of the high profile people who are opposed to cannabis would faint if they knew who some of them are! Believe me or not the FACT is that they span the entire social and employment spectrum. The most pleasing thing I've noticed over the years is that when we're all sat around the table enjoying a smoke we all seem to have an equality and an ability to laugh with each other. To this date I have never seen a fight between any of these so-called criminals and I do wish I could say the same for people I have seen drinking alcohol together. LEGALISE CANNABIS NOW YOU HYPOCRITICAL PEOPLE!      Cannabis is dangerous, it does cause medical problems, cancer, hallucinations - therefore the position has not changed, the prime minister's official spokesman said on Friday. Well I'm afraid beer causes liver damage, stupidity and violent behaviour. And for cigarettes... well read the side of the pack, so why does the government not want cannabis legalised??? As for the argument for cannabis leading to hard drugs, I say this: The first time most people smoke cannabis is at a party after consuming alcohol. Makes you think that alcohol is truly the stepping stone to other ""drugs"", but it's O.K. because alcohol is a socially acceptable drug like cigarettes.      Of course it should. The whole concept of prohibition of drugs needs to be reassessed. It doesn't work, it never can work and there is no reason to believe it is desirable. Those who argue against this simply do not understand how prevalent drug use is. For those born today, drug use as a means of recreation will be absolutely the acceptable norm - regardless of upbringing, class, morality etc. The sooner we adapt our attitudes to this, the better able society will be to integrate drug use in a sensible, safe, productive and practical way.      The argument that cannabis should not be legalised because it leads to harder drugs is fallacious. The reason cannabis leads to harder drugs is because it is not legalised and so many users assume that other illegal drugs are also innocuous. Make cannabis legal and you are creating a creating a much clearer distinction.      Whatever problems are caused by unregulated access to drugs pale into insignificance when compared with the problems caused by banning them. The people with most to gain from anti-drug laws are the organised criminals and those with most to lose are the innocent victims of drug-addicts forced into crime to feed their habit. Human societies have always used drugs for ""recreational"" and ritualistic purposes and this will not be stopped by legislation. Let's abandon all anti-drug legislation now and give people the right to take responsibility for their own actions.      I do not think that drugs should be legalised, but if you are in possession of them you should not be classed a criminal or sent to prison. For addiction with the harder type drugs you could be offered rehabilitation, because I am sure that people like to take drugs but not be addicted to them. I don't accept that mind and behaviour altering substances should be seen as acceptable in our society today - whilst the adverse physical affects may be limited, the mental effects of drug use over a prolonged period are definitely bad for individuals and societies. How can we achieve a solution, giving free will to individuals without ruining our social fabric for future generations? I don't know - decriminalise yes, legalise no.      If it were useful as a medicine, I would say yes. But just a doctor should decide in which case cannabis should be taken. But for public use, I definitely say NO! It is more than disgusting when someone is smoking a joint next to you. And by the way, the smoke is disturbing for non-smoking people. A pint hasn't that effect. To legalise cannabis and open it for the public, so that everyone could buy it, means a step backward in development. Cannabis smoking people are always comparing it with drinking alcohol. But there's a big difference between smoking cannabis and drinking alcohol. People who smoke cannabis are just doing it to get stoned. But drinking a pint is just for getting rid of thirst.      Yes, I think it's high time it should be legalised. In fact I predict it probably will be legal in a few years' time anyway, or at least available from licensed hash bars in places like Soho or Brixton. Incidentally, I'm surprised that the percentage of 16-29 year olds quoted is that low. If you've been to university, you've almost certainly come into contact with it, and most people will probably recall seeing it at parties when they were still at school. There are downsides to using ""the weed"" just like there are with excessive boozing, but in all honesty I can't see any overriding reasons for booze to be legal and cannabis to be illegal. Hard drugs, though, that's a different matter.      Cigarettes now hold public health warnings, people are already unbelievably suing tobacco companies - why? Smokers take up hospital beds, they waste our GPs' time and they don't mind inflicting smoke on other people then disposing of fag ends recklessly. Do we really need to go through it all again with another self-induced drug? Leave the drugs to the medical profession.      I don't want to see cannabis legalised at all. I've seen people whose personalities have been altered after smoking it and the effects are worse than alcohol. Smoke this, get behind the wheel of a car and drive under its effects and the consequences are barely worth thinking about, especially if a young child or other drivers are victims.      I agree with Phil, UK. I am not a conservative but if the Tories were the only party standing on a legalise policy I would vote for them.      If cannabis was legalised would the ""packet"" come with a government health warning?      This is a really difficult subject. On the one hand, cannabis has proved to be useful in treating pain for MS sufferers, for example. On the other hand, there are always going to be stupid people who misuse the drug, and in the wrong hands it can lead to more serious drug abuse. But then also if it was legalised, maybe people would have a more sensible attitude towards it!      I agree, let's stop wasting police time and legalise and tax the use of cannabis. Personally I wouldn't use it as long-term use has been linked to memory loss, paranoia and certain studies have found it to be more carcinogenic than tobacco.      Why not legalise the stuff? A startling percentage of the voters of this country smoke it - should we not at least have the democratic right to put the issue to referendum? I will continue using it regardless of legal status but I would feel happier if it was legalised. "
HOC HOC-JW -0.19 " Why all the talk about William Hague? It was the Government that precipitated this row for political gain. They engineered a compact, signed it and then played the race card at every opportunity to discredit the opposition.      Political correctness has become laughably ridiculous with ""race"" becoming the bandwagon for every minority to jump on. It is so easy to claim an incident was racially motivated. The majority of politicians are frightened to voice the concerns of their constituents and merely repeat the ""politically acceptable phrases"". Mr Townend was right in what he said, and in a democratic country he should be able to express his point of view without fear of retribution. Or are we sliding towards a dictatorship, in which those who do not tow the party line are punished? I am deeply concerned at the way in which so many people from all around the world are illegally entering Britain in the knowledge that they can then claim asylum. Our good nature is being abused and I fear that trouble lies ahead if nothing is done to control the situation firmly.      I always thought that the point of democracy was that you voted against people who expressed opinions you disliked. Censoring them from voicing their opinion in the first place smacks more of communism to me. To follow previous comments, I enjoy sushi, chicken tikka and chicken satay, but that doesn't stop me being concerned that people are being silenced in a nation that is supposedly proud of our ""right to free speech"".      Why are politicians afraid to discuss the race, asylum and immigration issue in a democracy? Is it a case of political correctness or are they scared of the truth, that forcing nations to be multi-racial, multi-ethnic and multi-lingual is not what the majority want? In small numbers people are happy, but above a critical limit, tolerance gives way to unhappiness, which is where we are at.      This MP was elected to serve his constituents. If those constituents disapprove of what he said, they can vote him out. To bar him from expressing his views is a move more suited to communism than democracy, although given the way this government works I can't say I'm surprised at the witch-hunt.      Rather than focus on what one or more individual politician(s) said or did not say, it is high time this country paid some attention to educating the masses and actually teaching people to behave in a civilised manner. This is not a racial/ethnic problem--there are many people from non-white ethnic backgrounds, who exhibit the same brutish and uneducated behaviour as the locals, because they have been exposed to the same culture.      People keep going on about ""whatever happened to free speech?"" Yes, as a member of the public he is entitled to say whatever he likes. Surely the point is that Townend is an MP who represents a community. He is a member of a supposedly mainstream party. He has a responsibility. There is simply no place for the kind of stuff he's coming out with. Hague should have got rid of him immediately. He only didn't because he knows that those are the views of the majority of what is left of the Tory party members. They have the final say in any leadership election.      The Tory party are not racist, they are saying what the rest of us believe. The government should realise that we are a proud country with a history, and people who live in this country should know of our history and abide by our laws. I am not xenophobic but believe that our holidays and traditions should be celebrated just as much as other cultures. St George's day should not offend other races, as that is our heritage. I also think the police are scared of arresting other cultures and being accused of racism. The race card is a big card to play and I think it is put forward too easily just to make a political point.      I agree with Mr Townend's comments. It's not xenophobic to recognise that the country is too full and we cannot cope. Charity begins at home. We should stop wasting taxpayers' money on other people. Immigration traffic should be zero, and that's not a black or white issue or which god you worship. We should erect a sign at Dover saying ""FULL"". In addition, if you are white, working, heterosexual and male in this god-forsaken country you have the least rights of all.      The comments seem to bang on a lot about freedom of speech, and freedom of expression. Of course Mr Townend is free to make whatever speech he likes, but William Hague is also free to throw him out. Which he should have done without a second thought.      With free speech comes responsibility which Townend did not exercise. There is a link between racial violence and these sort of comments from the political establishment. Hague missed a plum opportunity to show his ""liberal"" and ""inclusive"" credentials a few weeks before an election. His weak, slow reaction spoke volumes. The country is not as right wing as his party and he will suffer for that. As Robin Cook rightly implied, Britons are ""mongrels"" anyway. Guys like Townend are only on about separating white and black, however they dress it up.      I'm very centre ground and will defend anyone's right to free speech, however, William Hague really only has himself to blame for ructions in his party over race. By trying to win votes out of such a sensitive issue as asylum, you are immediately inviting those who are racist to jump on the bandwagon. It is a serious misjudgement, arguably as electorally stupid as Labour's policies of unilateralism, which, tends to demonstrate Hague's general lack of wisdom.      As a black person I feel that there are too many minorities who are quick to scream ""racist"" whenever their race is mentioned. Townend was right to say that the British race is becoming a mongrel race, it is, and if anyone says that he is wrong for saying that, then they are surely unaware of how things are changing. If you walk down any high street you will see many mixed race people, be it black with white or Asian with white and that cannot be denied. People need to stop screaming about small issues like someone speaking his mind and concentrate on the bigger issues such as homelessness and crime.      The politician meant what he said, and if his comments drive debate and discussion, then he is doing what politicians need to do more often.      At the end of the day it was Hague who censured Townend, who was only building on the foundations laid by Hague's own ""foreign land"" speech. I'm surprised that Portillo has not spoken out against this ""pledge of loyalty"" letter as he had done before when he talked about his refusal to sign the CRE letter. The Tory handling of this has been hypocritical and Hague's attempts to censure the unpopular views of his own party will not last the election campaign.      Political correctness run amok. Remember the excellent orator Enoch Powell and the stinging criticism he received from his political peers for his vision of the future? Same difference here - the man was expressing his opinions and no one has to agree with him. The value of dialogue is important and that which is unsaid is dangerous. So he used the word ""mongrel"" - sometimes used in a derogatory manner (according to the dictionary anyway), perhaps he should have used an alternative. He was talking about ethnic diversity. Here in the US we still have that vile organization, the KKK, who believe in white supremacy - they can march, they can speak, we can choose to listen or not, then form our own opinions. Mr Townend is not a racist and should not have had to apologise for his opinions. Hague is pushing the wrong buttons here and it's not the direction the Tories should be heading.      We will never solve racism with double standards. Politicians both left and right have 'played the race card' in an attempt to gain minority votes. Anybody who disagrees with this is branded racist! Although Hague was right to point out that the police were too scared to arrest blacks for fear of being branded racist, that was not a racist comment, it was the truth! Sometimes the truth is not what people want to hear! In an age of equality we should recognise that 'black pride' is equally as racist as white pride and all 'no-go areas' for white people should be abolished! Stop playing the race card. In the words of Martin Luther King, 'Judge an individual by his character, not by the colour of his skin'!      I have been following with interest the concerns of some that recent immigrants might be altering England's ""Anglo-Saxon"" culture. Certainly I have known people who are uncomfortable with social changes here in the US, and England should be expected to have them as well. But it hardly seems right to single out one particular group of interlopers as acceptable. If people from the Commonwealth countries are objected to, why not other interlopers? The Normans, for instance (certainly a brutish lot); the Norse (Danes, if you will); the Angles; the Saxons; the Celts; and perhaps even Homo Sapiens? The Romans are something of a special case, having officially withdrawn; but they doubtless left behind many descendants of their soldiers from Panonia, Syria, Italy and who knows where.      I clearly missed the racist part of the speech. A mongrel is a mixture, which is what it means to be English. Our culture is a mixture from around the world. Why was it offensive to state the truth? The real debate should be how to integrate the newcomers better into society and the rate people should be allowed into this country. The current issue seems to be Labour pre-election spin to prevent a proper discussion on the issue of immigration.      I moved to the USA 11 years ago, and am proud of my heritage. However I do not miss the economic oppression of the UK and being treated as a fool everywhere I go because I do not speak with a standard boarding school accent. I much prefer to live in a diverse multicultural environment, where eating sushi is as normal to me as tostadas, and so is the language. I find British people very racist in their attitudes towards other ethnicities when I am in the UK, and I now find that an embarrassment.      The uncomfortable fact is that these views are widespread not only in the Tory party but in large sections of society as a whole. I always read with interest about people complaining about a ""liberal elite"" - it's as if they are saying they would prefer a good old-fashioned ""illiberal elite"" like we used to have.      The debate is more than 'but what about freedom of speech?' I agree with freedom of speech as long as it doesn't infringe upon the freedom from intimidation and freedom from harassment. Now people may argue that Townend's comments are merely words, but Scotland Yard has recently published a report linking anti-asylum seeker and racist language used by politicians with direct links to increases in racist attacks. So which freedom is more important?      John Townend had a point to make, but the language used was quite reprehensible, and he gave the Conservative Party a bad image no matter what action William Hague took. His response has been compared with that taken by Edward Heath after Enoch Powell's ""rivers of blood"" speech, by, among others, Andrew Ley and Sir Edward himself. Let's get the facts of this right. Edward Heath sacked Enoch Powell from the Shadow Cabinet, but Powell remained a Tory MP for the last two years of that Parliament, fought the 1970 election as a Tory, and sat in Parliament taking the Conservative whip for another four years. So - principled Mr. Heath allowed Enoch Powell to remain as a Tory MP for six years after his speech;      Groove Armada play a song with the lyric ""If everybody looked the same - we'd tire of looking at each other."" I have studied the concept of culture shock and the adjustment process to a new culture. The conclusion I've come to is that, through the process of becoming ""Bi-cultural"" - that is assimilating one's self to another culture from one's own, there are only positive and beneficial effects to be gained - a wider world perspective, and a general openness to new ideas, to name a couple. John Townend would do well to open his mind and embrace other cultures, learning from them and using new-found qualities to his, and everybody else's, benefit. It's not a perfect world - but isn't that what we are all striving for?      It is good to talk! I like to think that I live in a country where people are free to express their views. Once I have any doubt about this, it will be time to emigrate - once again!      William Hague has failed once again to show true leadership. For once in his 4 years he had the opportunity to stand for principles and not jump on bandwagons - he failed to grasp that. Politicians are having this race debate without including the people it concerns. By not taking action, Mr Hague has allowed those with prejudiced and racist views to think it's okay. The Tories today are bigots living in the 19th century. We should be proud that asylum seekers wish to come to this country. Equality and tolerance are what Britishness is.      This isn't about whether or not Townend's comments are acceptable in general. Whilst I would argue that they are not, he is entitled to his opinion, and to express his views freely. The question is whether or not his views are acceptable within a mainstream political party. If the Conservative Party does not want to be regarded as a 'safe haven' for racists, then it needs to act more firmly against Townend and his ilk.      Racism is detestable - but we do not prevent it by pretending that there are not, and never will be, practical problems with a multi-racial, multi-cultural Britain. Labour's approach - gag the racists and hope for the best - is naive and attempts to solve one perceived problem (racism) whilst ignoring the broader and more serious problem of how you make a multi-racial Britain work, when there are meat-heads of all ethnic backgrounds causing trouble, and when the process of assimilating the cultural changes currently underway is far from smooth or easy.      This is a democratic world and everyone is entitled to their own views. I believe the UK is taking the race issue to the extreme and as a result suffering from it because they, especially this current Government are beginning to look stupid to the rest of the world. William Hague should put the matter behind him and focus and particularly publicise the key issues which will win him the next general election. There are plenty of blunders made by the Blair Government. Home in on these William!      After reading the previous views, on this matter - think everyone, Do we really want to live in a society where someone can be expelled from an organisation when the mob shouts loud enough, or in a society where if we disagree with what he says, we vote him out? For the record, I disagree strongly with what he said, But I want to live in a society where he has the right to say it.      I am Portuguese and my wife is English. We have a beautiful boy who was born here in the UK. It make me feel extremely angry to see politicians making xenophobic comments such as these.      I am fed up of hearing that John Townend and co are sorry. They meant what they said and the fact is views like this should not be mentioned, especially by such prominent figures as MP's. We pay their wages whether black, white or Asian.      I am of mixed Italian, German, English and French descent. My father-in-law is Russian. Do I feel threatened by the idiot Townend's remarks? Of course not. People need to be a little more emotionally robust.      William Hague has not expelled John Townend because he will stand down as an MP in a few weeks anyway. Give William Hague some credit - unlike Sir Edward, he isn't keeping his troublesome MP for six more years.      Mr Townend should take a holiday in Mauritius. It's a great example of a multi-cultural community, with all colours, races and religions living and working happily together. What is it with the British that we find it so difficult to accept other races? After all, we were quite happy to ""own"" most of them in the days of the British Empire!      To be racist in this country all you need to be is white and British. I'm tired of being told that it's OK to have an Asian community centre, but it's racist to have a British community centre. I'm sick of being told that 'Black Pride' is a good thing, but 'White Pride' is racist. I have a black partner who totally agrees with me on this.      I am half English and half Spanish, so I suppose that makes me a mongrel. I have ignored Townend's comments and would hope that others do the same. Please get back to the serious issue of running the country and stop making such silly comments.      This is a topic which needs rational, adult debate. Ignore it at your peril. Why does anyone think that in the UK we are immune to fears and views which are prevalent in most countries in the world. Bringing them into the open is the only way of preventing long-term problems.      Townend should have been expelled for his obscene comments, which have no place in 21st century Britain. Hague has just compounded his leadership weakness. However he made his position almost impossible by his own earlier comments about New Labour turning Britain into a foreign land. Whist this was aimed at EU matters the connection with asylum seekers was unfortunate. How can the Tories claim to be an inclusive party when its membership is 99.9% white? The facts just don't stack up.      This proves to me that people cannot talk about race without being racist.      Gary Eales is dead right, Townend's views are his own and he has a right to them. It seems that free speech in this country is only allowed if you are saying what the liberal elite agree with. If you don't like what someone says then don't vote for them, if you think his party isn't doing enough then don't vote for the party. This applies to any subject, it's known as democracy. Now can we get off the non-issue of imagined racism and debate something relevant.      Has Hague done enough about the Townend affair? Does the Conservative Party ever ""do enough"" to stamp on idiocy within its ranks? To ask the questions is to answer them. It's almost as if the Tories are either somehow inherently incapable of taking action to control their most embarrassing members, or else are just too proud and conceited an organisation ever to admit that they are wrong. We've seen it all before: the party failed to act decisively against MPs accused of sleaze before the last election, and look what happened then. Looked at from this perspective, it doesn't much matter what Hague does or doesn't do, or whether he remains their leader.      Freedom of speech may be a basic human right, however, it does not guarantee that there will be no consequences. Racism has no place in today's society, and racists should not be in positions of power or hold public office. Modern societies value the new ideas and talents that diversity brings and do not fear or reject it.      In the sixties the intelligentsia stormed the barricades (figuratively) to rid us of censorship. Now they have restored it, and included that appalling Orwellian concept ""hatecrime"" in order to achieve their own ideals. The cause of colour-blindness has been set back decades.      Konrad is, of course, absolutely right. There has been no road to Damascus conversion. Townend's expressed views are the ones he held and the ones he still holds. Nothing he, or William Hague has said even suggests a change of attitude. No doubt there are lots of nice Tories out there who are in no sense racist, but this one should most certainly have been instantly removed if Hague wants to retain any credibility at all.      Now that the comments have been made, he will always have them on his reputation. It is not enough simply to make an apology that costs nothing, but there will be serious consequences for Mr Townend in the future from those offended. There are no mongrel races. The only mongrels are people and that sort of racist generalisation should not be forgiven.      Whatever happened to freedom of speech is what I would like to know? And why are other political issues openly discussed, yet mention the issue of immigration and asylum and it is met with ridicule and great contempt?      John Townend's comments were not wisely chosen, I think he realises that now and he has apologised. William Hague has given him his final chance. Let it drop for Gods sake.      I'm afraid the Conservative Party just digs itself into a deeper hole with every view expressed. The reality is, most moderates lost in the last election, and the remaining MP's do NOT represent the views of most people. Mr Hague should have dealt hard and fast with the problem. He has not, and will suffer the consequences.      William Hague and many people seems to confuse the freedom of speech and being a member of a respectable Political Party. Mr. Townend has every right to speak his mind but the leader of the Conservative should not allow him to make racist remark while he is a member of the Conservative Party.      A decisive leader is a strong leader. Edward Heath, then the opposition leader, expelled Enoch Powell as soon as he made the speech of ""River of Blood,"" which helped him to win the election by showing he is a man of principle. By contrast, William Hague has swung one way to another making him look indecisive and without principle.      We always here the opposition leaders making comments like ""too little too late?"" This phase cannot be better applied than in this row.      Are those people howling for the silencing of John Townend equally vociferous in their condemnation of the openly racist thug, Robert Mugabe? If they are not, isn't this, in itself, a manifestation of racism? As for Townend, whatever one thinks of the man's views, he is far from unique in holding them. If the open discussion of immigration cannot any longer take place, then those who share his views will be polarised towards avowedly racist organisations. Surely, that cannot be for the good of society? There can be no taboo topics in a true democracy.      I'm sure black people throughout Britain will be relieved that in William Hague's Conservative party bigots won't be tolerated. Unless they apologise, obviously.      John Townend is going to retire anyway. Forcing him to renounce his views might be more severe punishment than expulsion. Mr Hague has done his job as a party leader...at least for this matter.      I think Mr Townends words were unfortunate, However, we are not allowed to have any debate about race or asylum seekers without fear of being called a racist. There are too many emotions and people prepared to take action to allow a considered debate to take place. This is a major issue for all the population and should be treated with proper debate. I don't think by ignoring the issue and signing a meaningless statement from our political leaders, will solve our issues. With our asylum policy this issue will continue to wreak havoc until suitably addressed.      A weak response from a weak leader. Does anyone really believe that John Townend has changed his views? Of course he hasn't.      I worry about free speech in this country, and the demand that all members of a political party must be on message or else. I want a society where John Townend can say what he said and the rest of us can explain why we thing he is very wrong, but I want our politicians to be people, not parrots.      William Hague talks tough on a lot of issues - now he should act tough to stamp out racism and bigotry. Until then, he's losing more and more respect every day.      The vast majority of the UK electorate will not have signed the CRE's document. Does this make us all racist as the press and the CRE's adverse reaction to a few MPs' non-signature would suggest? One would imagine that in the run-up to a general election there would be rather more important issues to debate.      I think William Hague has acted how everyone expected him to act - very weakly. I'm not a spin-doctor myself, but pre-election tactics of condemning racism in the ranks only if it occurs a second time are extremely lame! It's very worrying that in this day and age, top ministers are allowed a forum in which to publicly display their intolerance of multi-culturalism.      William Hague's failure to take decisive action and punish right-wing bigots within his party will tar the Tories with a racist brush for years to come. Modern British culture deplores open prejudice and I can but hope that Hague's policy of deliberately pandering to the lowest common denominator will sting him at the ballot box in the forthcoming election.      Whatever happened to freedom of speech? Surely that is a basic human right. Voltaire is attributed to have said ""I may not agree with what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it"". This country is increasingly attempting to stifle what is said and thought - some democracy.      He's done nowhere near enough. Although I've been slightly uncomfortable with the CRE's 'sign or else' attitude over the pledge, William Hague has just shown himself, yet again, to be a weak leader totally unsuited to be PM and totally at the mercy of the rather nasty hard right element of his party. When Townend praised Enoch Powell's 'Rivers of Blood' speech, Hague should have acted as Ted Heath did, decisively and unambiguously, by squashing Powell immediately. Forcing Townend to back down after two or three weeks of unflattering media coverage means nothing. If Lord Taylor has any sense he'll jump ship to Labour or the LibDems anyway.      This is too little too late. Hague should have acted as soon as Townsend spoke out on racist views. Far from strong leadership, this smacks of another example of Hague being an unfit party leader and, god forbid, Prime Minister.      It astonishes me that Mr Hague has gone out of his way to keep a man like Mr Townend in the Conservative party - he would have appeared a good deal more impressive if he had had the courage to expel him two weeks ago. As things stand Mr Townend is still a Tory MP and, despite the forced apology, he is someone many people still consider to hold racist views. One man has been allowed to make the Tories seem more extreme, isolated and unelectable than before.      Townend got elected on the Tory ideological and political platform and he should respect that. People didn't vote for him alone - they voted for a party. If he is so protective of his freedom of speech, he should resign his seat and then say whatever he wants. Also, Hague's response of just censuring this man is a non-measure, and on top of that asking the only black member to prove his loyalty borders on harassment.      How pathetic is this? Will anyone believe that signing a letter written by someone else makes Townend's opinions (and by association a minority in the Tory party) not racist? He may be sorry for causing offence but the damage has been done. By insulting our intelligences like this Hague is just causing more damage to his chances of election success.      William Hague has done nothing but further erode the ability of the British people to participate in free and open debate. Would somebody please tell me what living in a free society means? Does a (unelected) member of the House of Lords have the right to call an elected Member of Parliament a racist for stating his views? Since when did Lord Taylor have the right to dictate what YOU or I can say? I personally have a problem with the way the UK has absorbed so many immigrants. Am I a racist?      Of course this is not enough! The man has been told to sign a letter. If he did not hold the views, he would have not made the comments in the first place. I sincerely doubt a chat in William Hague's office has given rise to a Road to Damascus conversion in John Townend. Why is Hague so desperate to cling on to the chap?      Yes, asylum is a big issue which needs to be addressed and yes, freedom of speech must be practised at all times. But what is the threat that the British feel on losing their culture? 90% of foreigners were colonised by the British. By being colonised they lost the majority of their culture to the British one eg half of Africa speak English or French as their national language after losing their tribal languages and culture to the colonisers. Something to think about. Why feel threatened instead of guilty?      Once again political correctness has stood in the way of intelligent debate. William Hague has sat on the fence and failed to take positive action in either direction. I believe that John Townend's views reflect those of many average, rational, English citizens. He is clearly not racist but he does sense the urgent need to take steps to stop the continuing dilution of English culture by those elements of the non-indigenous population who have no desire to integrate. "
HOC HOC-KO -0.17 " Material that one might find degrading or destructive of human dignity is the price we pay for freedom. If you have the right to say what you believe, then others with whom you disagree have the right to do so too. Freedom is precious...and freedom of speech is requisite for ANY freedom to exist.      I believe that anyone who would kill an abortion doctor has little need of such a site to encourage them or help them find a doctor's house. They could easily follow a doctor home or look him up in a phone book.      Like Chantal in Canada, I visited the website and was horrified that this hate-mongering bigotry is offered in the name of Christianity. These people are no more Christian than the man-in-the-moon is. They strike me as being sad, vicious, little people whose intelligence must be seriously questioned. If listing the names and addresses of doctors, their spouses and children isn't a tacit incitement to violence by the morons in our society then I don't know what is.      The ""naming and shaming"" of sex-offenders was ultimately stopped because it served only one purpose: vigilantism. While these doctors cannot be compared to sex offenders, publishing names and addresses too would serve just one thing: making them targets. These websites are just an open invitation to violence and contradict everything that ""freedom of speech"" stands for.      Doctors providing abortions are not murderers, but ordinary people helping women in distress. Interesting that a large number of so-called pro-lifers appear to consider that the right to life stops at some point down the line, and are thus willing to see some people sent to the electric chair and to do nothing to prevent others from using firearms with deadly consequences. Christian compassion is a highly selective matter for them.      Lots of UK correspondents have said things like ""freedom of speech is a basic human right"". Not here it isn't - for example the Race Relations Act forbids incitement to racial hatred, I believe rightly. Would free speech supporters in the UK want to see this revoked? Personally, I find the idea of ""basic rights"" fundamentally laughable - society defines rights the same way it defines laws. The right to life applies to our citizens today but doesn't to somewhere else's tomorrow when we decide to wage war on them.      Let's get something straight about the whole free speech issue. Other than the fact that it's the single most important right we have, there's a practical side to it. If what someone is saying is correct, then there's no reason to censor it. If what they're saying is wrong, as doctors in this case would see it, then they have equal opportunity to argue back.      I suppose it is entirely consistent that a Constitution which upholds violence and killing by the State in various forms, including the death penalty, should see no harm in aiding and abetting those who wish to incite the same on abortion doctors. However, all this really goes to prove is that we only have unlimited ""free speech"" until enough people start listening; then the authorities intervene as they see fit. It's just a shame that some people are so morally bankrupt that they can hide behind a ""freedom"" they'd only be too willing to deny to their enemies.      I visited the website and was appalled. Seeing it with my own eyes... the names of doctors who have been murdered crossed out in grey... addresses of their homes, their children's schools... it was more than painful. It was eerie. There is a difference between free speech and incitement to violence.      Recently a Seattle newspaper printed the names and addresses of the biggest residential energy users in Seattle. One could worry that a radical environmentalist might harm one of these irresponsible ""energy hogs"" who are exploiting the worlds precious resources. Where do you draw the line if you start to censor?      Being pro-choice and standing fully for the right of woman to choose, I completely disagree with the ACLA (American Coalition of Life Activists) publishing of abortion doctors' names on their website. However, free speech requires that you permit those you disagree with to freely communicate their ideas. The ACLA never explicitly advocates violence against these doctors. However, even if it had, this still would be protected speech. The US Supreme Court held in the Claiborne Hardware case that political speech that carries threats of violence is protected, unless it's made directly to the targets themselves (not in a public forum). I don't agree with the ACLA, but living in a free society comes with a price. However, the road to more freedom is much less dangerous than the road to more censorship.      I wonder what the sponsors of the First Amendment would have to say about rulings such as this? I often suspect they would be horrified. As a Christian, I am often dismayed by the actions and words of others in the name of Christianity. A Christian is supposed to be a follower of Christ - can you imagine Him setting up such a website? To be pro-life is a good thing, but the end does not justify the means.      It is a shame that the rights enshrined in the First Amendment have so often today become a cloak for those unable to utilize this freedom without sowing discord or creating offence. The current actions by these Pro Life groups serve no other use but to provoke anti-abortion sentiment by invading the privacy of those medical professionals who are simply choosing to provide legal services to those citizens who wish to legally obtain them. A better use of free speech would be to convince us of the legitimacy of one's claim rather than to threaten those who oppose it.      Free speech is a wonderful and important right, but can be often abused. Our biggest problem in this country is that we have free speech but no right to privacy. And as for this list being like the phone book - the phone book does not give my licence plate numbers, for example - I can call up the phone company and get my number unlisted if I choose. These doctors can't call up the people running this site and ask to be taken off their list. Even telemarketers in this country have to take you off their list if you request it. These doctors should have a right to their own privacy. Perhaps if they requested the site to remove them, and if the site didn't, go after them with the telemarketer laws? I know I sure wouldn't sit still if it were my name up there. These doctors are breaking no laws. It saddens me when I hear about people harming each other over abortion - because violence does not solve violence. It only breeds more.      It's been several hundred years since the first amendment, but by and large, much of Europe seems to be lagging behind. It's laughable to an American civil libertarian to hear about France and Germany trying to ban websites for content that the government deems unacceptable. This website is not fundamentally different, unless (under American law) a connection can be made between the content and the murders.      It seems to me that it's not so much a matter of censorship versus free speech, but of free speech versus incitement to violence. The website should simply publish a list of doctors and hospitals where abortions can be obtained, and leave it at that. That way pro-lifers could publicly demonstrate their outrage by ""voting with their feet"" and boycotting those doctors and hospitals, and those who are pro-choice could find a handy reference list if they need one. Seems an admirable solution to me!      Free speech should always be acceptable - after all where are we without free speech? Abortion is perfectly acceptable. Many religious groups have no qualms about killing one another yet they are rarely publicly ""named and shamed"". Why should this fate befall doctors who after all are only carrying out their job - and not against the will of the patient?      Free speech is not without limits. For example it is unlawful to shout fire in a crowded theatre. To do so is to incite panic and shows a reckless disregard for public safety. I cannot see how the justices can fail to apply the same standard to a website that incites others to commit murder.      I wonder if unborn humans have freedom of speech? - or a right to choose?      Free speech is not unrestricted in the United States. I cannot for example mount a speaker on my car and at maximum volume broadcast my opinion. In other words, the harm the form of free speech causes is a consideration. If anti-abortionists want to make their opinions known, they can simply do so with arguments outlining why they hold those beliefs. Making people perform in certain ways through fear of violence is simply a way of saying, ""We cannot justify our beliefs therefore we have to get what we want through threats and violence"". Hardly the world you want a baby to live in.      Offend or please, free speech is free speech - the first rule of democracy for those who understand the true meaning of the word. It's something we don't really have in the UK. We need the first amendment in Britain and indeed Europe and the rest of the world. God bless the Internet and the Euro/American geniuses who created it.      It is noticeable that when any extremist group wants to force its ideas on the rest of the world, they always start shouting about free speech. These people are flouting the laws of most other countries and no American judge has the right to say what may or may not be allowed on the Internet. The Americans do not own it. When people's lives are deliberately put at risk, that isn't free speech, it is deliberate incitement.      David, Australia      Interesting to read people parading their religious views about babies' rights to life etc. Of course throughout history people with those same views and values have slaughtered huge numbers who didn't happen to agree with them including many of their own flocks! Reminds me of those fighting for animal rights and using violence and murder against those they choose to hate. What strange creatures we are!      How many Brits, who are now criticizing this example of free speech in America, criticized the publication of a list of ex paedophiles in a British newspaper recently? I sense another case of a now-common double standard, namely that free speech is sacrosanct as long as it supports the left wing agenda. Rich Vose, California, USA      Free speech? In America? Where? It is mostly in the imagination. The whole country is all about money and power without either you're just a stalactite!      I strongly believe in free speech but I also believe that in protection of privacy and the rights of these doctors to their privacy. If this was a website that listed addresses of paedophiles it would be shut down because it endangered their lives as should happen here. Such a list incites violence by the extremist elements in society. Web pages inciting violence against blacks, whites or Asians would not be tolerated and neither should this. In this case free speech has gone too far.      The Internet is one place where anyone can still voice their opinion without censorship lets keep it that way regardless of what the content is. Free speech is much more important than name calling. As we used to say in school ""Sticks and stones etc.""      The judges said: ""Political speech may not be punished just because it makes it more likely that someone will be harmed at some unknown time in the future,"" Does this mean that if I believe that what the CIA is doing is immoral it is okay to publish the names of CIA operatives working overseas?      As objectionable as these hate-mongers and bigots are, I'd rather they could be seen and heard so that we can all fully appreciate just how awful they really are. Besides, censorship of any kind is even more objectionable.      Abortion is wrong. Violence against those who provide abortion is wrong. Pro-lifers, myself included, have every right to try to convince ""pro-choicers"" that abortion is immoral, but we do not have the right to terrorise them into ""believing"" abortion is wrong. Listing abortion providers is one thing, but listing their home addresses is asking for trouble. Even if the law doesn't force the site administrators to remove or at least edit the list, they should do so on their own.      These websites' activities are perfectly legal, but if anti-abortion activists were truly concerned with saving lives, they wouldn't have published the doctors' names and addresses, thus making them targets for murderous fundamentalist fanatics.      As the US Supreme Court ruled in FCC v Pacifica 1978 ""The fact that society may find speech offensive is not a sufficient reason for suppressing it. Indeed, if it is the speaker's opinion that gives offence, that consequence is a reason for according it constitutional protection"" Pretty much sums it up for me      Wouldn't it be great if all the so-called ""Christian"" pro-lifers would put their energy into seeing that all women of child bearing age had access to free contraception instead of focusing on murdering physicians and others who help these women? No, that would be too much like hard work. It's so much easier to develop an attitude of repressive hatred instead.      Why should these doctors not want their names posted if they believe in what they are doing? Deep in their heart, they know they are murderers. Put them on the net and let them feel ashamed.      So we have to stand up for free speech no matter what form it takes? That is utterly ridiculous as we do not live in a world of clear rights and wrongs. To allow this website to publish doctors names, who are providing a service wanted by the majority of women, in order to scare them out of their practices is wrong. You cannot make allowances for free speech of those whose only purpose is terrorise people and incite some to kill. Threatening someone is unacceptable behaviour, no matter what form it takes.      I would like to agree with Peter of London except that the context of the supply of this information is nasty, abhorrent and vicious. Would we honestly want people habitually publishing factual and lurid details of our private life, or of the wrongdoings of our loved ones, in the name of free speech? What about freedom to be left in peace? Character assassination and abortion are simply two different kinds of murder. Two wrongs don't make a right. We should not be free to say just anything if there is a risk of harming another soul. The judge is irresponsible. Change the abortion laws by all means but legalised hatred is horrid.      It's one thing to call abortion doctors ""butchers."" Hateful and vicious as that is, it's protected speech. It's quite another thing to give people the resources to kill those doctors. In other words: In the United States, you  have a constitutional right to hurt peoples' feelings. But you should not have the right to use those same resources to endanger their lives. Even as we discuss this, the man suspected of killing Dr Slepian is in a French jail. He likely faces a prolonged extradition fight because France will not extradite him if he faces the death penalty. Much as I despise this man's crime, it illustrates the hypocrisy at the heart of America: This man killed a doctor who he believed killed babies because he believed killing is wrong, so we want to kill him to show others that killing is wrong. So I say: Kudos to the French Republic! Once again, Europe has its ducks in a row while we in the USA argue over basic principles of human rights we claim to have figured out 212 years ago.      Abortion doctors know they are taking a life. They don't want to be reminded of the awful act they are doing. If you see Pro-Life and Pro-Choice demonstrations they show the large Pro-Life group. The media never shows the Pro-Choice group. Why? Because this group is not a majority. They are using the courts to justify an immoral act.      Dictatorships are weak governments because they do not have the popular support of the majority of the people. Dictatorships usually restrict freedom of speech because freedom of speech threatens law and order. A dictatorship needs a large army and a strong secret police in order to avoid anarchy. Strong governments, on the other hand, allow freedom of speech because the majority of the people support them -- that is why they are strong governments. Strong governments do not fear freedom of speech. But should freedom of speech threaten the breakdown of law and order then that will be the end of freedom of speech and the beginning of dictatorship. Law and order comes first. Order is better than chaos. We talk of pro-life, so shouldn't we be honest and talk also of pro-death instead of pro-choice. The government and the majority of the people are pro-death so the government is strong and able to tolerate freedom of speech. Only a small minority are pro-life.      Just because society allows certain practices does not automatically mean that these practices are right. If that were the case, then there would be one set of unified laws throughout the world. Every person has to accept personal responsibility for their own actions. Anyone who examines their conscience will eventually come to the realisation that the taking of any human life (whether born or un-born) is wrong. However, those of us who feel so passionately about the preciousness of human life from its conception through to its natural death must realise that the way to influence society is not by confrontation and violence, but rather by dialogue and understanding. Abortion is not a premeditated and calculating act, rather it is the consequence of someone who finds themselves in a desperate situation for which they see no alternative. Surely a better way to eliminate abortion would be to provide real support, real alternatives and real understanding to those who find themselves in such desperate situations.      Never once does anyone address the rights of young voices stilled under the knife of the abortionist. Free speech? I believe many of you folks need to rethink your position.      Reality check for the English: You have no rights, you only have privileges. That's why English judges are free to suspend habeas corpus on the unbacked word of a policeman. And disallow you a jury of your peers to save court time. And prevent you from facing your accuser, if you're charged with rape. If you're found innocent, you can be tried again. And if you're tried twice, and still found innocent, as recently occurred in a libel suit, the judge can say ""Oops, there are no grounds for a mistrial, the jury just got it wrong. Here's the right verdict."" It's sad how the English can quote and debate and even deride provisions of US law that are frankly none of their concern, and then do nothing when their own liberty is quietly eroded.      I can tell from the postings why animal rights activists can firebomb cars and houses with impunity, but a pro-life organisation is held accountable for simply listing information that is a matter of public record. It's having the ""correct"" personal convictions that counts.      As a Christian and a pro-lifer myself I don't see the real issue here to be one of ""freedom of speech"". Rather, it is related to whether a group of extreme vigilantes should be allowed to incite violence against others.      I sincerely believe in the importance of free speech. I also believe that until a foetus is born, it is part of a woman's body and its fate is entirely up to her. If this is not the case, then all pregnant women are nothing but baby-making slaves for the state. The anti-abortion people should be able to say what they want, but if what they want is war, then we should give them that too.      The USA can add this piece of moral high ground lunacy hidden behind its Bill of Rights to some other political gems such as the withdrawal from Kyoto, and the democratic fiasco that was the Presidential election. The USA has become self centred concerned with power rather than people or the planet and can no longer champion itself as the leader of democratic rights. The failure to protect its doctors' rights marches with its failure to protect the environment, its people or this planet. Wake up America you are not the nation you once were!      Freedom of speech, women's right to choose ... what about a baby's right to live?      It seems that people are confusing free speech and privacy issues. Yes, the site has the right to call abortion doctors whatever they want, they have the right to publish the truth, the half truth and blatant lies. But the doctors should have the right not to have their names associated with the site. A citizen can forbid telemarketeers from publishing or passing on personal information, can choose not to list your phone number in the phone listing, and can forbid a doctor or lawyer from divulging personal information. Stars can forbid sites from publishing their likenesses. These doctors should be allowed to forbid their names, home addresses and any other personal information on this site.      I believe that the website is within its rights to publicise the actions of doctors who perform abortions. Many patients will not wish to be treated by such doctors. I do not see how this publication is notably worse than the frequent attempts by the British National Abortion Campaign to eliminate from practice those British doctors who refuse to participate in abortions.      Today various positive sounding names are used to hide the acts of humans on other humans. Pro choice is one of them. Why not call a spade a spade. Thou shalt not kill ... Abortion is killing of the defenceless, for the unborn child has no choice. It is murder, period! When a murder is committed and if the identity is known, it is advertised in paper as ""Wanted for Murder"" and so why not those who are involved in carrying out the killing of innocents. The fact that it is licensed by the State should not stop those who believe it to be evil from exercising their freedom of expression. The judgment was correct.      As President of a Catholic pro-life organization (Catholics for Life, Sacramento Diocese), I have to reiterate that, from the Christian perspective, reciprocal violence against abortion providers is strictly against Church teachings. The issue is that the babies are already assured a place in heaven. And since salvation of souls is the principle of greatest importance, violently ending the lives of abortion providers before they have their chance to seek salvation is strictly un-Christian.      I feel that this judgment is only going to put the doctors lives' at risk. These doctors are just doing their job. Some people may not agree with it but it is legal in places and I think on the subject of abortion everyone is entitled to their own opinion.      America is a land of contradictions. On the one hand there is the Freedom of Speech protected by the First Amendment, on the other hand there are the anti-abortionists who will kill anyone whose views are different to theirs. What happened to Freedom to Choose? Was not America founded by the Founding Fathers on the principle of Freedom of Choice: in religion, in politics, in free assembly, in many rights still lacking 250 years later in many so-called democratic countries, most of which are not pre-dominantly WASP - White Anglo-Saxon Protestant.      Censorship? Why is it that for all the very many unusual and interesting things you can see on TV, the one thing the broadcasting authorities won't let you see is a late abortion being performed? Why not, since it is perfectly legal?      Freedom of thought and speech is a privilege that must not be abused. Those who use that freedom for their own ends to incite fear and hatred deserved to be censored.      These doctors must feel very let down after this judgment. Their lives are now potentially in danger because they are performing legal and often very needed operations. I find it very worrying that the first amendment can be used as excuse to allow deranged individuals to endanger caring doctors through their offensive 'Baby Butchers' list.      Considering that the website in question ""crossed off"" the name of Dr. Barnett Slepian after he was allegedly murdered by James Kopp, what the court has done is to legalize the murder of those who support a woman's right to choose. But if I were to do a similar website calling for the public execution, after a fair trial, of everyone who opposed a woman's right to choose, would the court protect me? Given the inclinations of the Supreme Court and the Republican Party (as stated in the party's platform for over twenty years), they'd sooner sanction my murder than admit the appellate court's egregious error in this case.      As a Jew, grand-son of a holocaust martyr, I feel outraged that the Holocaust is compared to abortions by ""pro-life"" groups. As a ""pro-choice"", I am also outraged by the group comparison of nazi eugenism and the choice to abort.      Doctors who perform abortions should not be treated any differently as any other doctor. If they are not doing anything immoral or wrong, then why should we make special exceptions? We list paediatricians and brain surgeons on line...why not abortionists? I believe the controversy comes in because deep down in their consciences, they know that the taking of an unborn life totally goes against the Hypocratic Oath. Ask my 9-month unborn life (hiccupping at this very moment) whether it is a ""life"" or not, and I think you will find a resounding yes. Taking the life of an unborn child is wrong and doctors need to be held accountable for their actions. If it's just a ""job"" for them, then why are they feeling so guilty?      That's fine as long as pro-choice groups are equally allowed to openly criticise those who harass women who exercise their right to choose and have abortions. Maybe the pro-choice movement can then set up a web site and call pro-lifers fascist dictators?      Why should we be surprised. This state has been inciting people to hate and kill each other, thinly disguised as entertainment for decades. I must search back to find out why Yahoo's Nazi memorabilia site was shut down.      I am a fervent advocate for freedom of speech and the abolition of censorship. However, I feel in this case as much as the anti-abortion groups have the right to publish such details online, the doctors and clinics also have a right to take them to court for any problems arising from such publication. It's only fair.      One wonders if American judges would be equally willing to have their own names and home addresses published on the web by those who disagree with their judgements.      The internet is not the censorable forum that it was once hoped to be, perhaps the only way this site could have been closed is if the doctors had copyrighted their names. The logic of the Judge in this case has drastic reductive implications for other groups subject to puritan victimisation.      Take your choice: 1. Free speech 2. Censorship. Each has its merits and its pitfalls. No single thing can be all things to all men.   It's all part of the greater plan to herd us like cattle. The Government has everyone in the US fighting each other over abortion, guns and a lot of other abstract issues while they slowly take away our freedom. We need to wake up and respect the fact that we disagree with one another over a few issues and concentrate on preserving our freedom.      Quite frankly there shouldn't be any limits on free speech. If limits are enacted on such a fundamental human right, where does it end? Who decides what speech is in fact free of restrictions? The fact of the matter is Free Speech is the cornerstone of a democratic, free society and to limit any speech no matter how inflammatory is editing independent thought. If you don't agree with a position, that's your right, but it is also the right of the individual you disagree with to express beliefs and convictions independent of censorship.      The problem results from having ""freedom of speech"" but not ""freedom of privacy"". It is too easy to get personal detail on just about anybody (mostly, these details are used to harass the public with telemarketing).      With proper protection of privacy, such a discussion would become moot. Otherwise, it's hard to draw the line where ""freedom of speech"" tramples over an individual.      Freedom of speech is a basic right. However if people have used the information on the website to help in their crimes then they should be tried as accessories. Don't ban them, but make them responsible for their actions...      There is a difference between stating fact and stating opinion. A factual listing of abortion doctors is a useful list. A list of ""baby butchers"" surrounded by propaganda is not useful in that context. If abortion is legal the slander is aimed at the wrong set of people. But does this apply to all activities of a legal nature? I'm not sure. In this instance I do not see any good coming from the list as is.      Everyone has a right to express their opinion, however no one has a right to impose that opinion on other individuals.      I think a sensible view of this case is shown in the ideas of Libertarian J.S Mill. He said that people had a right to express themselves, as long as what they said or did, did not encroach on the rights of other people. This could apply to anything, therefore personal views on abortion are irrelevant. By posting names and addresses on the internet, it is likely that some of these people will be harmed directly because of the action of the people who published the names.      The opportunity for freedom of speech comes with it a heavy burden of responsibility. Our words have consequences and I see little evidence on any side that any considered awareness of the potential consequences of words prevails. Freedom of speech for it's own sake is a far cry from considered and responsible freedom of speech that would really benefit society.      Setting any limits on free speech is a dangerous path to follow, simply forcing Neo-nazis, extreme 'Pro-Lifers' etc underground. Its better to give these ideas an open platform, so that people who can actually think for themselves.     Even odious, hateful opinions should be allowed free expression. Suppressing them merely bottles the hatred and allows it to fester. Let's bring these opinions into the open so that they can be discussed and ridiculed properly.      I have to side with the Europeans on this. The US obsession with so-called ""freedom of speech"" has overstepped the bounds here. Freedom of speech should not come at the expense of personal privacy. I sincerely hope that the passage of internet privacy laws in the EU will force a change in the US to respect the privacy of the individual.      This is a perfect example of a flaw in America's obsessive freedom of speech ideology - where the freedom of one person results in the entrapment of another. Given that abortion is legal in much of the USA, surely the abortion doctors themselves have the right to freedom from potential repercussions too?      If you accept the right to free speech then conversely, you must also accept that someday someone will say something that you don't like ... You either accept free speech or you impose censorship, there is no ""middle way"".      I think this is taking Freedom of Speech too far. When you start affecting innocent people who just happen to be related to an abortionist it takes the whole idea of peaceful protest too far.      Certainly people have a right to free speech, but they must also face the consequences of their actions. If a crime is committed because of what they said, whether that be information they gave out or through inciting hatred then they are guilty of knowingly aiding the criminal and must suffer the punishment for aiding that crime.      I believe that abortion is wrong. I also believe that inciting violence against abortion doctors and clinics is wrong: whether the authors of this web site intended it or not. The right to free speech should always be tempered by the responsibility that goes with it.      The right of freedom of speech cannot be limited because this takes away from the fundamental meaning of freedom. However this freedom comes with responsibility and thus if any free speech brings about a breach of the law then action can be taken. If the list incites violence then it breaks the law but as a list it is harmless. It's the people who put that information to a harmful use that action should be taken about. Preventative action would lead to a nanny state where censorship is justified because it MAY prevent an event.      There is a clear difference between allowing free speech on a political point and endangering the lives of doctors and their families by publishing their addresses. This story is the perfect answer to one of your earlier debates on ""Why would anyone want to live in Britain"". No British magistrate would support such an invasion of privacy or such a blatant attempt to incite hatred and violence.      It seems incredible that a judge can say that listing a person's name, address, car licence plate and anything else under a site called the 'Nuremburg Files' is ok in the interests of free speech. We're talking about practising doctors, not the Holocaust. And we're talking about a woman's sovereignty over her own body. Allowing doctors to be put on a hit list is tantamount to ignoring their rights as citizens.      There is no such thing as free speech look at all the libel laws      Alas, free speech is free speech. You have to take the good and the bad, whether you like it or not. The question really is are we mature enough as a society to deal with it?      Funny that a website that loves life so much it protects embryos, celebrates the murders of doctors! This website is not about life, it's about power over another human being.      I believe the line between free speech and the outlawing of the statements that were made, has been drawn in a fair position. The State has been infiltrating individual rights for far too long. It is not right to punish for making factual information available to others. Some will say that allowing the names and addresses of abortion doctors to be publicised will promote violence. It is no different to the phone directory, albeit more information is given. This typifies the main reason that free speech is protected via the US Constitution - to prevent state intrusions into basic freedoms.      Free speech is a wonderful thing in the hands of sane, rational people with a respect for the lives of others, but this publication of personal details has to be a violation of basic human rights. It's just inviting the most extreme to exact what they would probably see as a just revenge on people that I would see as providing an essential humanitarian service. In my opinion they should be able to say what they like about these doctors in general - but keep the individuals out of it. These murders horrify me as a woman who stands by her right to chose and as a human being "
HOC HOC-KR -0.0899999999999999 " Every style of government comes to a natural end at some point. Democracy I assume is no exception. And judging by the comments on this page, all the Internet will do is allow people to voice their complaints more easily. What I wish is that someone would think up a method of government that gives politicians less power over us, since democracy as it stands is not democracy at all. All it gives us is the change to choose, every five years or so, which dictatorship we want.      The answer? There may not be one because there are now so many of us with conflicting interests, and the internet will only serve to bring this into sharper focus. Why else are the Tories offering tax cuts, a balanced budget and increased public spending? Because they're trying to be all things to all men, and it doesn't work!  You can lead a horse to water, but you can't make him drink. You can tell a geek of your web site, but you can't make him link. Transform Democracy? No way. As proof: in the USA, said to be the most internet wired nation in the world, two Presidential candidates in the 2000 election were widely reported to have by far the best, most progressive, high tech web sites, the candidates were John McCain and Bill Bradley. The two candidates who were soundly defeated in the primaries by their Internet inferiors, Al Gore and George W. Bush! The Internet is just another tool, one of many media tools.  The internet can leverage the effectiveness of the parties communications, but it can't re-ignite a spark on it's own because the current political apathy amongst the electorate seems to be born of a feeling that there's little point in taking an interest - all parties seem to be as corrupt, unanswerable and self serving as each other. Each one seems unable make a positive difference for individuals without either completely messing up some other aspect of their life, or without exploiting some sector which can't do anything about it.  One would (naively?) hope that some day members of parliaments in democratic countries world wide will represent only the electorate and not the political parties. Engaging the Internet in the political process could be one of the steps in such a democratic transformation. The question is, will the parties succeed to continue to monopolise the political representation? Will they succeed in preventing the information revolution from transforming itself into democratic revolution? We shall see.  Regardless of whether the web the can help democracy or not, the real truth of why people seem to turn away from politics, is that there is no clear divide between the political parties.  We will ultimately be pushed toward online voting, the counting of which will be impossible for the electorate to verify. Beware!  It seems to me that politicians are interested in votes and subsequently, power. Not people and issues. I believe that the internet could be useful for voting in issues. The local MP could then use those votes to know which way to cast his/her vote in parliament After all, they are there to serve and not to dictate.  Ultimately, we could take democracy to its final stage. Let the politicians craft the legislation, but allow the public to vote on it over the Internet. That would really be ""power to the people"".  Internet communication strips away the advantages provided by a loud voice, bullying manner, or charismatic personality. In this respect it provides a means of expression for those who would otherwise be ignored or shouted down.  We have to remember that Internet usage is still largely dominated by middle and upper class males. One could hardly argue that this dominance by a particular group is democratic. Indeed rather than saving democracy, the internet may actually be undermining it.  Ultimately, democracy consists of citizens putting ballots in boxes. If someone can't be bothered to walk down to the local school to do that once every five years, then it's unlikely that the web will motivate them. The web will really only help the politics anoraks who drone on about politics all the time. The web just gives them a bigger audience. The notion that the web was a major part of the last US election is mainly hype. Most people watched the candidates on TV, as they have always done.      It might very well ""save democracy,"" but that would only beg the questions: save it from what? save it for what? And ought it be saved in the first place?  Students of comparative government and politics should recognise the Internet as a candidate to deliver ""direct democracy"". A classic example of direct democracy is the ancient city/state of Athens (c. 400 BC). However, I can't see modern day citizens having enough interest in governance when there's the shopping to do and the bills to pay, etc. While the Internet certainly solves some communications problems, perhaps it is a little too early to attempt squeezing it in to the role of assisting democracy without some serious attention to consequential effects. Does anyone know any 2400 year old Athenians?  Making political processes available online will pave the way to real democracy. It will provide the people with a simple and direct mechanism for voicing their choices and opinions. Imagine being able to vote online, not just for major elections, but for all important issues that current population distribution does not allow for.  It's just a gimmick. Technology cannot change human nature which is central to the issues of voting, civic participation and duty in general. The internet will make it easier for those who wanted to vote in the first place, but does not change the minds of those who have already decided not to participate for whatever reason such as personal ideology or the loss of faith in the governmental institutions that he or she is asked to participate in.  I agree with Peter, the internet is only another communication tool. TV was, in many ways, supposed to do all the wonderful things that so many claim for the internet.  Political usage of the internet in broad terms should be welcomed, as it offers a more immediate alternative to ""lobbying"" by sending a simple email, or posting a question etc. It offers truly global accountability by which Russian Presidents can be interviewed by people in another time zone, or our own leaders can be held to account over an issue of the day (or indeed the hour). BUT, what happens to those for whom e-vailability is an issue - for example the tenants of social landlords who live in areas where network providers chose not to invest - because of poor credit scores, or years of neglect and decline? If our Government is to continue to be truly democratic, then we must not allow the digital divide to disenfranchise ANY section of the populace.  I feel Paul from MK is forgetting that democracy is the worst form of government, with the exception of everything else. While it would be nice if every vote were to be an informed, rational decision, to give a body of people the ability to refuse the vote to an individual would almost certainly result in abuse. Besides, I'm sure we've all had discussions where the other person, for all their knowledge, appears to be incapable of coming to a valid conclusion (i.e. they disagree with me). One person, one vote is the best solution anyone's come up with so far - the system of government is the place to put in safeguards for rational decisions.  Theoretically once universal access to the internet is secured it could become a useful tool. I would like voters to pass a basic exam on the subject in question to ensure an informed electorate.  It seems as though anything can be wrapped in a veil of magic by being done on the internet. It is merely another communication tool: the basic democratic processes and problems would remain. What politicians need to do is convince people that they actually care about helping them and the nation and are not, in fact, just interested in gaining power and advancing their careers.      MP's won't even use electronic voting in the House of Commons. What makes anybody think that they would use it in elections? And if you think that they are going to read e-mailed comments you really are living in cloud cuckoo land.      The internet should not be monopolised as a campaigning device for politicians but as a voting device for the electorate. There should be a far greater number of issues decided by referendum and internet voting is the ideal way to facilitate this. However, I do not think even this will increase voter participation in the long-run; the initial novelty of internet voting will soon wear off.      The Internet is a new medium for communication. We must welcome it rapidly and show the way in using this to carry out elections. An ""Internet"" vote should be available just like a postal vote. I for one did not vote last time round but would have done if it could be done so easily. I predict in 10 years time this will seem an amazing discussion. The Internet will be in every home and affecting all we do. Lets embrace it rapidly to improve turn out and also automate and speed up the voting process.      It is a constant illusion to think that technology can solve deep-seated social problems. In the 19th century people argued that the telegraph will mean and end to International conflict since leaders would be able to communicate in a fraction of a second. The development of democracy depends on the creation of democratic institutions. The Internet could be a useful adjunct to those institutions but the fundamental thing is the creations of the institutions themselves.      Some of these people who seem to be bashing democracy, it prompts you to wonder if they have ever lived under any other form of government, or better yet, if they know of a better proven system. The net is useful in carrying the light of freedom to the darkest corners of the globe.      I personally doubt that much will change for politics, whether British or American, whether the parties opt for use of internet or not. It is their attitudes and beliefs on certain issues that give them the attention from the population. The petty squabbling of politicians amongst themselves is hardly going to get them any admiration for the 'work' they're doing, least of all votes.      The internet will not revive democracy in this country. The trouble is the way our political masters (so called) behave. Blair has become a Puppet Master - his ministers are tongue-tied until he pulls the strings. But when we get a crisis like Foot and Mouth, he turns his back on it until its to late, then hasn't got the necessary management skills to get anything done quickly. Hague gives the impression he is lacking the same skills.      The only valid argument I have ever heard against the idea of voting via the internet is that lower-income earners may not have access. This argument is easily addressed. Governments provide voting stations now for everyone. I see no reason why the government cannot provide voting stations equipped with computers for those who do not have home access. The internet can indeed be the 'saviour of democracy', if properly used.      Oh now I see, democracy that has been working perfectly well for thousands of years can only be ""saved"" by the internet. This is getting pathetic, what can't the internet do! The internet is not the new life but a useful tool to help us enrich lives we already have. Not being connected to the net does not mean that your life will end, I wish people would stop hyping it up and get a life.      The internet may or may not increase voter participation, but if it does, we must remember that this may not necessarily be desirable. The only historical example of an entity that resembles direct democracy, though not universal enfranchisement, was Athens. The lesson that Athens, with its unique historical experience provides, is not that direct democracy is possible, but the consequences of such a system. The democracy of Athens resulted in the imperialistic pride, egoism, and public demagoguery that resulted in the Peloponnesian War. We must remember that that war was a democratic war, one popular and supported by the people in the beginning, and one that ended in Athen's defeat.      Any additional method of voting would surely be welcome - people would still be able to vote in the conventional way if they wished. Also, while it is true that the majority of the population are ignorant-tabloid-led souls, this is not a reason to deprive those who are interested the opportunity to share their thoughts with the online community. Oh, and for those people without the internet, try visiting you neglected and forgotten local libraries!      It is very unlikely that the 'net' can allow 'democracy' to totally function on its own. First, you have some news services that are nothing more than propaganda machines for unusually wealthy and powerful interests. They decide what is going to be reported as news rather than allowing the element of 'free speech' to reign.      Secondly, most elections are so controlled now, that who really is the candidate that the people want - is very likely not to be allowed to serve      Politicians are in reality actually redundant with the advent of the internet as this wonderful tool has the power to remove the middleman, i.e.: the politician.      This message is sent via ham radio using solar power!      Your comments during the programm K    More democracy is the last thing we need. The greatest challenge facing us is the destruction of our environment, a massive problem that cannot be over-stressed. Democracy is entirely inadequate to this problem. It revolves around short-term crowd-pleasing policies that produce rapid tangible results that help ensure incumbent politicians are re-elected. Much of the electorate is far more concerned with immediate returns than with long-term solution to this escalating global catastrophe. Democracy is good for something, but hopeless in the face of long-term global problem K    Before the internet can be used in a big way to promote democracy there has to be a method in place to process the information that will be available to the members of the government through the internet. This issue needs to be addressed whether the medium is internet or message boxes. Without this internet cannot go to far in promoting democracy.      In the developed countries, yes. But in the third world countries, I totally disagree. We all know the problems in third world countries, like in Africa. How do you expect an average African looking for how to get a meal, to think of checking the internet for democratic or political issues? Also, the internet accessibility is a big problem in these countries. How many people can afford the internet in Africa?      The problem with democracy is disenfranchisement. Even if everyone voted and even if there were enough political parties to afford everyone a choice with which they were happy, they would still have to contend with the lobbying power of business interests - interests which often run contrary to those of the electorate. Anyone who gets elected, gets into bed with business. What chance have we got, either way we are deluding ourselves if we think the system is working for the man or woman in the street.      Yes the internet is great but there is a long way to go before it can be used for domestic political purposes. Its main advantage is that it can provide a truly international forum for opinion.      As a former resident in Scotland, and being now resident within Western Australia the Internet offers the opportunity for the masses to have a valid viewpoint on the directions our politicians should be directed and also presently take. The standard of politicians as seen in Australia is of a lesser or narrower political wave length/vision or quite comprehending the directions of the 21st century.      The internet should be a freely accessible public repository for the information that governments traditionally withhold. e.g. environmental data, public sector inefficiency , corruption , human rights violations etc .      Universal access to internet is not possible without the necessary telecommunications infrastructure such as phone lines, hardware, knowledge and ability to make use of internet etc., Availability of phones in India is so limited that universal access to internet is a long way off.      The point of enabling democracy online would be to give citizens ownership of policy decisions both locally and nationally. Their involvement would cancel out the spin which is currently overshadowing the real government. The spin is produced by both the media and inside the government but if the public had access and some control it could cancel out a lot of the rhetoric and propaganda.      If real time graphs were available this would lead to more precise tactical voting. This would result in negative voting, and as such negative campaigning. There would be an even larger shift from policy to personality.      As long as BT retains its near monopoly on telecommunications in this country, Britain will lag behind the rest of the world in bringing the internet to its people. And as long as this is the case, internet voting will only increase the power of the upper classes and reduce the voice of the less fortunate.      The internet will, in my point of view, create a major democratisation of our society not because, but against the will of our politicians. There is a German political site www.dol2day.de (meaning ""democracy online today"") where your political point of view can be heard easier than in the media that are one-sided. the majority of money. This is the sense of democracy: The more decide, the better the decision.      I think Internet voting would make people keener to cast votes. If real time graphs were introduced so people could see which party was in the lead, they could decide whether their vote would make a difference. However, until the whole country is computer literate there is no point in having such a system that people may not be able to use. Look at the problems the Americans had with 'chads' - and that was punching a hole in a bit of paper!      Most of what I saw on the internet was either very anti-Clinton rhetoric or else Clintonites firing back with anti-Bush statements. Notice how children on a playground who get in such an argument drive others away in disgust? I think the internet assisted in lowering voter turnout here.      Democracy and the internet should not be just about voting online. It should be about getting the grassroots involved between elections. The net provides the first opportunity to give the masses a direct line to politicians. In that sense, it is the most important aid to democracy invented.      How can the web promote genuine democracy when so many people do not have access to it?      Your comments before we went ON AI K    The Internet is a very powerful medium to interact with its users and it changes the way we communicate with one another. It is still an elite medium for many of the world. But I don't think it can change our thinking /thought patterns. Political parties can interact with voters and make the Net a propaganda tool. In this information era those leaders who use the medium to persuade the voters can also become victims. All over the world the masses have lost faith in their leaders and, I think, in the days and years to come the percentage of those who cast their votes will plummet to a great extent. No electronic medium or cyber medium is powerful in changing it.      I say keep politicians off the internet as we already have enough desperate old men in our chat-rooms already!      We have the technology to be able to vote, individually, for or against any policy which any person could propose. All that is needed is an independent moderating committee who would decide which proposals were worthy of merit, and put them to the vote of all the people. An enabling legislature would draft, check, and verify all such laws before implementation. It would not have the right to create law in itself, but no law could be passed which would be contrary to common law. There would be no need for political parties.      Talking Point is proof of how much easier it is to get our views aired on the Internet but it can never be called ""democracy"" until everyone has access - and that will never happen. And as party political broadcasts are hardly the most popular programmes on TV, very few people would actively seek out political web sites to read their propaganda.      The Net could be the means of restoring democracy. It is a fallacy to suggest we still have it. People such as myself find it almost impossible to put our views to the general public. The media has its own various means of censorship. MPs seldom reply to my letters. I am lucky to get an acknowledgement. There is little to choose between the main parties. I suspect that because of this there will again be a poor turn-out at the next election. The Net gives us all a chance to have our say, not just the privileged few. Although the ""few"" will do their utmost under various pretexts to exclude Joe Public.      Within the current political system the internet could be best used to make all governmental reports and communications available for all to see. Let us have access to the numbers so we can make up our own minds on whether the politicians have the voters' interests at heart. Of course, ironically, this would change the nature of the political system. The problems societies face in how they govern themselves require far more revolutionary changes then plugging a few computers into the issues.      I would like to see all the major parties submit their costed election ""business plans"" on the web, with names and areas of responsibility, so the people can print out (in the public domain), what the Government said they would do, and see if they kept their election promises! The Government might even be more accountable then!!      More and more people are using the internet and politicians would be foolish not to take advantage of chat-rooms and so on, but democracy is alive and well. I don't think the 'net will help or hurt voter turnout. Low turnout in last year's election was because both candidates ran uninspiring campaigns.      Democracy has already failed. Workers get one vote per four years. Non-workers get 50 hours a week extra to get involved in protest groups, political parties, letter writing, focus groups and all the other engines of political life.      I don't think the internet is the right sort of tool to promote politics. It is just too slow compared to TV or Radio and I don't have the patience to wait for a download to complete.      You can not believe everything you read on the internet since any person can write and post anything regardless of whether it is true or not. There is too much information but how can you make sure you are getting the right stuff? There is a lot of misinformation and people must be aware of it.      The net has the potential to massively improve local government as the old system of visiting your councillor is dead to the majority of us. E-mail contact with well-publicised local government web pages could re-ignite the process of devolved local power. If I knew my councillor's email address today, I would be immediately lobbying for that pavement to be fixed and door-to-door recycling.      The web saving democracy? How many more contemporary problems are to be solved by the net? Economic, cultural, social, historical? Give me a break from this tech-hype. When I think of India (ahead of many nations in IT) and ""internet democracy"", it's laughable. Internet is not a panacea.      It will work for a while, because it will reduce people's frustrations, however over a longer period we will probably end up at square one, once individuals realise that nothing has  changed.      I think it is a bad thing as politicians are already manipulating media enough. Politicians have been banned from voting in the Today programme polls because they rig it. Certainly Millbank's New Labour spin doctors are on the ball with the internet. It was amazing how just as yesterday's 'Talking Point' was published concerning whether to postpone the election or not, several respondents issued robust pieces on how great the government was and that they should not be forced off early re-election by a cynical Conservative party! Looking again just now, the balance seems to have been redressed, but funny how the pro-Labour guys always seem to get in there first!      Using popular media is the best source for getting your political ideas across, and ""influencing"" the electorate. The internet is just one form of many for distributing these ideas.      At the moment, we are bombarded with attempts at Local Democracy from all angles. This is being ""pushed"" at as. On the Internet, we have to ""pull"" that information, which means going looking for it. So, if we don't respond to what we already have, are we really going to seek it out? I think not. To get people really involved, you have to make them cross...any ideas?      Using the Internet to vote on issues rather than parties would produce a real democracy. As things stand, if you want, say, both to lower taxation and to ban foxhunting, you would have to vote both Conservative and Labour. While democracy remains based on parties, the internet will serve only as another tool for self-seeking politicians to misinform the rest of us.      Internet voting can't solve the main problem of voter apathy. At present there is very little difference between the mainstream parties on most issues - and under the present system they are the only ones likely to be elected. For example which party is reflecting the widespread desire for a renationalisation of Railtrack? Offer me a real choice to vote for and I will vote.      It's no surprise that all the political parties now have policies based on the ratings of pressure groups and the greed of benefit claimants rather than looking after the working majority. This will only change when we start showing as much interest in the redistribution of leisure time we have in the redistribution of wealth. (Or possibly give an extra vote to income tax payers as partial recompense for their limited ability to get involved in the political process.).      I don't think the web will make much difference. What is needed is compulsory voting, with the last choice called ""None of the above"". If ""None of the above"" wins, the election is rerun with new candidates - i.e., none of the above.      The web is a great way for people to participate in debate and make their views known to governments. One major problem, however, is access, both in terms of infrastructure and censorship. More seriously, who says governments will listen? For that matter, how much real power do governments have, faced with global corporations and markets? Perhaps the best contribution the internet can make is to enable people to link up their struggles for human freedom. Finally, one person, one vote is not always best. Why should a cultural majority be able to impose its norms on minorities?      The Internet is immediate, multi-way mingled broadcasting. No other communications medium in history has provided that. It fully amazes me the possibilities of Internet communication. On the one hand critics say that ordinary people cannot govern themselves - personally, I don't believe it, and I don't believe there has ever been an experiment to test the hypothesis. My favourite example of democracy is not one of representative democracy, but of participative democracy, from ancient Athens. If it were possible for us to remove the elite-speak from politics and explore how to make it possible to involve people in decisions that affect them, and for people to make suggestions and policy decisions, I believe we would be taking an admirable step in ethical and sensible new millennium politics.      The widespread use of the Internet has profound implications for politics. It's major role is not so much in providing accessibility, as giving easy access to vast sources of information which can be used to question and refute the bland statements made in 'sound-bite' politics. Modern politicians are more concerned with presenting the right image and 'sound-bite' to the public than with informing the public. In fact, if the recent US election campaign is anything to go by, candidates even conspire to make sure real facts never get to the public. Other aspects that must be taken into account when addressing the issue of 'Internet Politics' is that many members of the house are unfamiliar with the Internet Message Board community and the form of debate that takes place. Something like 15% of members don't have email addresses and not a single member of parliament, as far as I know, has a Public PGP key available to ensure the security of emails. In time the Internet will revolutionise politics. However both the public and the politicians have a lot to learn before its full potential can be realised.      Students of comparative government and politics should recognise the Internet as a candidate to deliver 'direct democracy'. A classic example of direct democracy is the ancient city/state of Athens (c. 400 BC). However, I can't see modern day citizens having enough interest in governance when there's the shopping to do and the bills to pay, etc. While the internet certainly solves some communications problems, perhaps it is a little to early to attempt squeezing it in the role of assisting democracy without some serious attention to consequential effects. Does anyone know any 2400 year old Athenians?      The net is a fantastic way of holding MPs accountable. I had never seen my MPs entry in the register of members interests until I saw it posted on the web. We live in a democracy and the web helps people to make an informed vote.      Politicians have secretaries and answering machines to take calls they don't want to listen to, pre-printed replies for snail-mail they don't want to read and, probably, genetically engineered hearing to ignore people they don't want to hear. In computer terms, they are an output-only device with a limited I/O attachment that does not allow for any feedback. At least an email-bot should be cheaper on their pocket books.      The problem for online democracy is shifting the gold from the chaff; no politician is brave enough to say it, but most of the British electorate is far too ignorant and ill informed (due to poor education) to make informed decisions and contributions. Thus, before broad democracy (in the true sense of the word, power of the people) is really tenable, people must be better educated. At least now we have the technology to make such a national forum a possibility, but it is only the first step.      The Internet could be a marvellous medium for debating the issues of the day and reading the barometer of public opinion, and internet voting must be an obvious way to go. However, cynics might say with some justification that the Internet is just another communications medium to be ignored by governments. A recent example of this would be the 'Number 10' message board being closed because of so much adverse comment about IR35, amongst other things.      The internet has a part to play but this misses the big point. The reason voters are switching off in huge numbers is because we simply don't believe and don't trust politicians anymore. We think they are corrupt and have their own agendas which they never reveal before an election. Less than 20% of major social legislation passed by UK government is ever foreshadowed in any election manifesto by any party. Most of the 'hidden agenda' legislation is controversial and tends to strengthen state power over the citizen. Unless there is a root and branch reform of our system of government, the politicians will continue to destroy democracy - the very thing they falsely claim to be upholding.      The Internet is the latest, and most significant, in a stream of mass communications mechanisms. Look at this ""Talking Point"" forum. No other medium could ever have offered this level of interaction. However, the Internet is simply a means to an end, not the end itself. Anything that extends our ability to communicate our thoughts and ideas to those who govern us is to be praised. But the Internet's greatest ability is to show how futile imposed boundaries are. The world is becoming more homogeneous and this will increasingly make petty local (national) political issues seem unimportant and parochial.      In theory, the internet is the tool of liberty and empowerment for the average person. However just as we have seen the dot.com industry gradually become swallowed by monopolies, for politicians it will become yet another publicity battleground upon which they will have to fight rather than a means of political education.      Throwing technology at the problem of apathy will not work.      The internet offers an unprecedented opportunity for organising and information dissemination, but the real problems with modern democracy, especially in the US, lie in the political structure itself. Participation has largely been replaced by a passive acceptance of two-party dominance. The internet can be a tool of change, but it is not the only solution necessary.      The internet is used by a very unrepresentative group of people. On the one hand they are probably relatively well informed, and thinking. On the other they are also relatively wealthy and doing well out of the status quo. The people who really have problems are the ones whom the politicians ought to be listening to more. They are certainly not well represented on the internet.      The use of the internet can be a significant advantage for smaller parties, providing a low cost alternative to billboards and telephone banking to get their message out - and in this way is a boon to democracy. Problems remain in terms of the democratic nature of the state, how the parties choose their candidates etc. With internet penetration at around 20% in the UK there may be no bias issue, but I suspect that the online population is also the voting population, further entrenching patterns of apathy among the electorate.      New technology has played a role in democracy at least in the Philippines. SMS (short message text) via mobile phones has been so popular among the many NGO leaders that it was used to organise democratic campaigns to bring down the corrupt Estrada government in the so called non-violent People's Power II. Internet, as a ""new"" technology, has the same power, but it depends on how it is used by the public sector to ensure a democratic transformation in the UK.      It seem as thought most UK party web-sites are either so obsessed with spin and style they forget about content or they forget about the rest of the public and are hideously introspective. As such the sites reflect the personalities of the parties!      Online democracy often creates problems of representation. Some responses to online polls and forums can be co-ordinated by political parties to present a distorted picture. It is not a new phenomena as TV audiences for political programmes and radio polls have suffered from this kind of fixing for far longer. However being able to access such resources as the list of all official UK parties via the internet is valuable.      The internet is a fantastic tool, however many citizens do not have adequate access to it. The internet needs to be fast and inexpensive, and for all. It would help too if politicians didn't have such an ignorance to this new tool. Change, and change now! The sooner everyone has fast reliable access, the sooner great things can happen.      I think in theory it would be a great idea to have a forum where policies and can be explained and debated in a more direct manner between government and the online public without the filtering and manipulation of the mainstream media. However in practice this kind of forum would rapidly descend into chaos or be so heavily censored it would cease to be realistic expression of the views of participators.      Here is a radical thought - the internet could lead to the abolition of political parties, with interested citizens voting directly on all issues of importance. This would solve the current problem whereby a party is voted in and then its members follow their own pet policies, apparently without regard to the electorate's wishes, for the next five years. True democracy.      When will people realise that the internet isn't the answer to everything.      The reason I don't vote is not that its inconvenient to go to a polling station but that it makes no difference whichever party is in power. Hence making it even easier for me to vote via the Internet will not make be anymore inclined to vote.      The biggest concerns for me regarding online voting revolve around security. No matter what anyone says, computers are not the best means for secret voting. Why? Because your computer has a unique I.P. address which can be traced - which means someone can find out how you've voted. A ""virtual"" ballot box would also be less secure than the current system, because hackers are always one step ahead of computer security personnel (take it from me, I work in computer security!), making it a realistic possibility that an e-election could be severely compromised.      Regarding Paul MK's remarks ! Firstly there will never be universal net access and it will never be secure. Secondly, the suggestion that people should sit an exam before being allowed to vote is incredible. Perhaps he would like to see voters restricted to white, degree educated, middle Englanders.      Most democracies are in some kind of transition. Many people inside and outside politics agree that the old institutions and cultures no longer work. Interactive media like interactive television and Internet offer an opportunity to play ""a part"" in the modernisation of democracy.      Rather than transfer the current system to the internet, I think the following changes would engage the public more: 1. Make voting compulsory, and add a ""none of the above"" box to all ballot forms. This allows those who do not currently vote because they don't like politicians to be counted, and would inject a healthy dose of realism into politics. 2. Abolish the Lords and replace it with a chamber of the people, selected along the same lines as jury service. 3. Install PR in Westminster, so that those with minority views don't feel constantly excluded. 4. Allow postal and internet votes for those who can't come to polling stations, and keep those stations open for as long as it takes to reach a pre-determined proportion of the electorate, say 80%. (That might also decrease the frantic media interest - if an election takes a fortnight, fine - at least the people are having their say. If it means the pundits don't get to have theirs, maybe elections will be less of a turn-off.)      People are fed up with traditional governments - I know that I certainly am! Democracy to me is something I exercise every day when I use my credit-card, sign a cheque, decide which airline to fly with, which newspaper to read, or which TV channel to watch. These are the real choices that we make - and they are now far more important than the self-important posturing of politicians who only know how to ""spin"" things! True power is in people's wallets, and in their TV remote-controls, not in Westminster.      If politicians use the net simply as another medium to broadcast their propaganda then the net will do nothing to save democracy. If it is used to facilitate debate, and the results of those debates are not ignored then it could do much to enfranchise the populace, and hopefully usher in an era of more consensual decision making.      Its hard enough motivating most people to vote at general elections once every four years. An internet voting system where people voted on every issue would result in the tiny minority who have an interest in politics wielding far more power than they deserve. Government policy is already mainly determined by pressure groups, giving them more influence would damage democracy still further. As P O'Rourke said of politics ""The last one to fall asleep gets to spend all the money!""      It will do nothing but create a platform for the single issue moaners; leading to politics becoming increasingly shallow and short-termist. Bring back the thinking process, please.      The problem with democracy is widely seen as voter apathy, which is variously attributed to the ""it makes no difference"" and ""too much cynicism/spin amongst politicians"" syndromes. But voter apathy is inevitable within stable democracies because significant sectors of the population are generally unaffected by who is in power and politicians ""spin"" because they have to counteract the vested interests trying to either manipulate them or bring them down. The only reason Labour was elected with a landslide in 1997 was because the Conservatives - the home of the vested interest - had screwed things up so badly.      It has been suggested that regular users of the internet are already the mainstream voters who turn out in a democratic election. Those who abstain from the process are typically lower income families who won't have access to the internet and its communicative properties. However this is not to negate the influence of on line campaigning as more and more of the active electorate are confined to their offices for longer and less likely to catch those riveting party political broadcasts!      The Internet is more than just a communication tool. It is interactive, and is the first global discussion forum. Politicians need to ensure the Internet's freedom (of speech and money - BT). Otherwise it will go from being a democratic force to being another shopping mall.      At present there are very serious problems with computerised voting systems which have yet to be resolved, namely the fact that it is impossible to ensure both that the election is fair (and prevent people from voting multiple times) and that votes cannot be traced back to the people who made them. Until some progress is made in this respect it will be impossible to hold fair elections via the internet. However, the internet is still a very useful tool for campaigning and for political discussion in general.      Ah sweet democracy! Enlightened politicians reaching out to the electorate, and the masses responding - come on! Wake up! This is another cheap gimmick with more serious overtones, will a disgruntled voter who sends his MP an angry e-mail find himself under surveillance as a ""potential risk"" - let's keep the politicians off of our VDU's please.      This is just another gimmick. How exactly is it proposed that the computer-illiterate masses use this for anything other than having the latest party propaganda delivered right into their homes? To the uninitiated the concept of digital signatures is either too advanced to use or too easy for the unscrupulous to hack.      It's glorious wishful thinking on behalf of mainstream political politicians to think the internet will breathe life into post cold-war politics. To stimulate popular interest in politics you need big bold competing ideas and a positive vision for the future. Providing a slick web site to re-engage a disillusioned electorate without any of the aforementioned ingredients just shows how out of touch politicians are with what democracy is all about.      However helpful the internet may become as a tool in forwarding democracy, it is no substitute for solid democratic structures - such that we seem to be losing in the UK. Increasingly the Executive is becoming less and less accountable to Parliament, and increasingly laws are being made by so called ""secondary"" legislation, and directives - in reality, ministerial dictat. Unless these abuses are directly challenged and changed, all the on-line discussion in the world is so much hot air - or worse still, populism to be fashioned into what ever spin government and media want to put on it all.      I think that in principle, Internet voting and participation is a terrific idea, which has the potential to rescue the political process from the morass of popular indifference into which it has fallen. You only have to look at any Internet discussion group to see how lively and involved people can be when there is a forum which allows free exchanges of views.      If this liveliness and involvement could be harnessed, it could go a long way to ensure that people once more feel that their vote really does count. However, while I feel very strongly this is the way forward, I also feel that we must be cautious. First of all, there is the problem of disenfranchisement. Many people do not have access to the internet, and so could not take part in on-line discussion. I am reminded of the early use of telephone polling to predict the outcome of US elections, where the poll predicted an overwhelming victory by one side, only to be proved wrong on the day - the ownership of a telephone was itself a biasing effect on the poll, in the days before almost universal telephone use. At present, the same would apply to the Internet - it is not a universal resource.      The Internet will not stop the MPs from producing spin, it merely means that the spin will come directly from them rather than through the media. What is needed is some sort of requirement on politicians to explain themselves to the public, but I can't imagine this will ever happen. It will be interesting to see if the parties resort to spin at the long-awaited Euro referendum, I think the public will not stand for it because we are not really able to make an informed decision on Europe until we are given the information on both sides to make a choice. In other words politicians need to respect our intelligence instead of treating the electorate as stupid. "
JOC JOC-15B-11N 10.46 "When I read this article for the first time, I doubted the truthfulness of the article, and it was so surprising for me. I think ""joke"" candidates are bad for democracy because I can't feel their sincerity from their attitudes. Candidates can be national leaders whose role is to reflect public opinion in policy decisions. Certainly, what you wear is freedom and a form of self-expression. However it is natural for members of society to wear clothes appropriate to the occasion. In addition, they should watch their words and actions, especially the person who wants to be representative. As the above account suggests, I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives. However, in the class, a student said"" Democracy is free not only for us but also for candidates, so it doesn't matter"". This didn't exist in my opinion, so it was interesting for me to come into contact with a different thought. I feel the importance of studying all together in the class again.  I heard this news on TV at first. At that time, this story was reported as a joking matter. I did not take it seriously, but I became to think that we have to give this problem more carefully consideration after I read this article. We should not confuse democracy with joke candidates, such as Ukraine's Internet Party represented by the Sith Lord. It is certainly that democracy is fair and equal treatment of everyone in organization, and respects their right to take part in making decisions. However, we must not have the wrong idea of liberty. We should be discreet in liberty that is given in democracy, I think. At least, a candidate who is identified Star wars character should not be elected to the city council. Therefore, I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good for democracy. And then we have to make wholesome democracy.  I saw this news on TV at first. At that time I can't understand what happened because I only saw chewbacca arrested by police and I thought people was arrested for only disguising costume of chewbacca because Ukraine police is spoilt. But I knew the truth is different from my conjecture when I read this news. Truly A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning. Candidates should reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy. But ""Chewbacca"" 's action is contrary to democracy. He insults many Ukrainians who hopes true democracy. I want him punished severely and I hope such people never appear.  I agree with your opinion. Initially I only paid attention to the costume of the joke candidate because Chewbacca had a lot of visual impact for me. However you focused on his actions from beginning to end from the viewpoint of democracy which he should not break legislation, and it was so great. I also thought I want such people not to appear. I can't possibly leave politics which have a close connection with our lives.  I agree with your opinion that a candidate who is identified Star Wars character should not be elected to the city council. When I read your opinion, I deepened my understanding about democracy because I couldn't reach the discussion which made reference to liberty. It is difficult to debate liberty, but I think this candidate has the wrong idea of liberty clearly. Therefore I respected you for being able to reach such a thought!!! I think the accident in Ukraine have a big problem over our thought. First, they take part in political activities as the character of ""Star Wars"". They should enjoy with these at the party, shouldn't do in public space which decide the posture of government and nations. Second, the name recognition of these character is much bigger than any other participants, it cause a big effect to politics. It's a level that some people can let any person win the election. Actually, ""Palpatine"" have won the election. And also, in the accident of Chewbacca, It's funny that he reject a duty he must pay fine. To begin with, this accident prove that they are not suit to work in the political world. The Ukraine government should make an effort to protect their fairness and exclude this group. I hope these group don't appeared in our country.  At first, I can't understand this news clearly. I've never seen ""Star Wars"", so those names mentioned in the article were strange to me, except for Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another bigger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are dressed in character costumes and it is allowed. I think, in Japan, there is a tacit understanding that such a joke is not suitable for political situations. I've took it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which the article says. However, I don't think their style is wrong. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Recently, democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to ""joke"" candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a ""joke"" candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. ""Chewbacca"" in this article is a good example. In conclusion, freedom should be allowed in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances.  I was surprised at this news. I wonder why Chewbacca who is Star Wars character was arrested. It is not prohibit that Chewbacca is engaged in political activity. However, he has a problem in the attitude toward political activity. ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" When I read this sentence, I could hardly believe. Though he was fined $8 for breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, he made a lame excuse. Moreover, he did not take off his costume though he was in the court. Such a person should not do a political campaign. A faithful person should go into politics. Even if he is elected, he will not be able to perform the proper political activity. We got the opportunity to think about politics through this article. We should have more interest in them.  When I read this article first, I couldn't understand in detail, because I don't know StarWars character very much. But I know Chewbacca is a hairy creature in that picture, so I wonder why Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine. I think ""joke"" candidates such as a man dressed as Chewbacca are not good for democracy. Certainly, I think candidates can wear some clothes which they like, it's free for everyone. But they should wear proper clothes for occasion. In addition, the candidates have responsibility to campaign for the election, so ""joke"" candidates should work seriously. I want all ""joke"" candidates will be punished and I hope all candidates will campaign for the election seriously and such a ""joke"" man will never appeared.  At first, it was difficult for me to understand the whole story of this article because I have never watched the Star Wars and these names are unfamiliar to me. After I read this article, I felt that they should be sincere in voting the election. We should not act costume play like Halloween party at election. But, I have another idea that people would be interested in election because of their strange costume play. However, I disagree with such a costume play at election. Additionally, it may be free for all people to dress any style (I suppose it is not illegal to wear any costume), but people who dress such a costume should not cause trouble and commit law. I hope everyone should obey law and be sincere in voting the election.  I laughed when I read the news and arrested man said ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" I can't understanding why he completely became Chewbacca and said these excuse. Also I was surprised at Darth Vader announced his candidacy for the mayor in Odessa. Democracy is in close connection with liberalistic and so, they have the right to put himself forward as a candidate for mayor as a Darth Vader(if the law permit) but I think if they have common practice, they didn't think up these foolish action. In the Democracy, we elect the leader by the elections and candidate's talent is very important for the mass people so if the candidate is fool, it is very dangerous situation for administration. I think we have to educate more politics thing especially in Japan.  As I have never seen ""Star Wars"", this news was a little difficult for me. In this article, the story seems to be joking such as Chewbacca was arrested. . . , Darth Vader, etc. , but this situation is actually serious. Ukraine is a chaotic situation today. Last year, Russia took over the Crimean region which has belonged to Ukraine and the eastern parts of Ukraine have seen fighting between locals and Russian-supporting rebels. America and European Union did not cope with this situation properly. Russia is clearly dangerous, but no countries cannot impose heavy sanctions on Russia. In my opinion, the situation that Russia is a permanent member of the U. N. Security Council is ridiculous. If Japan becomes a permanent member of the Security Council, unless Russia lose their status, the situation will not change. Certainly, talking each other is important, but America and EU should give heavier sanctions on Russia.  When I looked at this photo for the first time , I was very surprised at the photo . And, I can not help thinking about what was happening in Russia. After reading this news, I could not understand all information of this news, because I do not know characters of Star Wars at all. So I thought about this news from the point of election. It is true that by using the well known character, the candidate who uses it may be enough famous and he may be elected. It is a merit. But, it is also true that people who choose the candidate may not see his pledge. They may vote him as if they vote Star Wars character. If people vote him only seeing Star Wars character, it has no meanings of election. From the point of election, it should be done fairly, I think using character is not good.  I don't know ""STAR WARS"". So, I cannot imagine the incident of this news, but there is what I want to tell you. I think that you must not hurt others for your hobby, and must not hurt public welfare for the hobby. Indeed, you may want to be immersed in a hobby. I have the same feeling. The time immersed in hobby is happiest, and a person is enriched. But even if there is such reason, you aren't supposed to hurt public welfare. When your hobby hurt public welfare, the conduct changes to a crime. you should not consider this fact easily. I think that it is after there is happiness of a person around, that a person can enjoy a hobby.  My father has liked ""Star Wars"" since before I was born, so after I read this article, I told this news to him. Then he laughed, and I felt that the movie was really loved by people around the world. The excuse of this criminal was very humor but too contrive, so I think that his own excuse led himself to arrest. Also, remaking national statue into a Star Wars' character and identifying with the movie character was probably people's longing for the new world, I think. Without traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals, this world might have already changed.  I saw this news at first, I don't understand and I think this is a Star Wars Parade. But, this is important . this case shouldn't be joke. I think these"" joke"" candidate shouldn't be elected, because I don't feel these Star Wars candidate think for democracy seriously. Of course, candidate is guaranteed of a set right for example wearing and speech. But we shouldn't have a mistaken idea of freedom. They are mistaken, and break a rule, so they are arrested. They have a possibility of disturbing a fair election. I don't want to come into existence these misunderstanding groups in Japan. And Japan should teach importance of fairness of democracy and election.  At first, I did not know what is Chewbacca, so I could not understand the topic and the picture of the article when I saw them. After I understood Chewbacca, I was confused even more. I think the tendency which people love the animation and movies such as Darth Vader is good. But according to this news, it advances in the bad direction. His excuse, ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" , is definitely no joking matter. We must not excuse by using the characters. Its act would become the insult about them. It is not true love. If we want to love them, we respect the character and should behave definitely.  I was very surprised when I first read this article because I cannot imagine someone doing the same thing in Japan. I have never watched Star Wars before, but I know the name ""Darth Bader"", and the fact that this character is a very famous villain, so I could not stop laughing at the man. However, as I read this article a couple of times, I thought that this incident might not be something to make fun off. This incident was taken place in the Election Day. The Election Day is a date to decide which person to entrust the country. Therefore, nobody should cause such an incident that might seem foolish. It is not clear how this incident would affect the result of the election, but it is very extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. To sum up, I was very surprised that there are people around the world who does things that I can't even think of, but it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is.  I didn't know about Chewbacca, and was very confused when I read the headline. Such joke candidates as Darth Vader cannot be democratic representative , I think. Nobody with common sense would agree that they can satisfy popular demand, or manage complicated political problems. Now we should think about what the democracy has to be, and how we can realize it. And we must say, at least, candidates from Star Wars is not the answer.  The existence of official candidates uniquely dressed could be permissible because they are a kind of performer especially when they appear in front of us. To stand out by any means and attract people's interests is necessary to some extent. But in a word, this case is bad. To use STARWARS character is apparently improper for such place. Reading with Japanese sense of moral, this article is very surprising and strange. But I also think such candidates may be one of the symbols the confused situation Ukrainian is facing now.  I was very surprised when I read this article. The reason is because Chewbacca was arrested. According to this article, he was arrested because he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. However, I think that his arrest is attracted worldwide attention and it has become a very effective political activity. I appreciate the importance of propaganda in politics deeply. ""Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter. "" So, I have to pay attention to what Chewbacca do the next in order to save the life of the Ukrainian people.  Thank you very much for your comment to my opinion. And I feel honored to be said that you respect me for being able to reach such a thought. However, I think that I have to understand about democracy and liberty more deeply. It is really difficult to debate on political issue like democracy or liberty, even if we talk in Japanese, I think. So, we should study not only English, but also social problems.  After I read your comment, I agree with your comment. As I also have never seen ""Star Wars"" and I knew nothing but Darth Vader, at first, I wondered who was Chewbacca. In addition, it was hard for me to understand the situation that party candidates were dressed in character costumes and Star wars characters were elected to the city council. I do not think that such a situation is allowed in Japan, either. If anything, Japanese people will not pay any attention to a joke candidate like the Internet Party. I also think that freedom should be allowed in democracy, and we have to discriminate between liberty and freedom. And parties such as Internet Party should take action, using moderation.  I was surprised at this news. I have not heard such a news in Japan, so when I first knew it, I could not understand what had happened. In my opinion, everyone who wants to participate in politics should obey the legislation, so his action is unforgivable. No one want to follow him even if he is elected. Perhaps some people become interested in him because of his costume, but it will not make true democracy. I think the man should have considered about his action more and more.  I agree with you. I had thought that his action was bad for the country because of violation of legislation, but it is true that this incident attracted worldwide attention. I also want to watch carefully what Chewbacca will do next for the Ukrainian people.  When I first read the headline, I was surprised and couldn't understand the meaning because ""Chewbacca"" isn't a human but a character of ""Star wars. "" At first, I read this story and thought it is a funny story because movie character was arrested and when he had to pay a small fine equivalent for $8 for the disturbance, he said he couldn't pay ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" However, after I read this article many times, I think this is a serious problem. I think he would like to appeal to public for something, so he dressed as Chewbacca and took action like this. This incident also reflect the social problem in the world. As for his action, I think it is not good because people wouldn't like to vote these character. It sounds like joke. The election should be fair and serious. After the election, someone who elected ought to have a responsibility and lead people. So I think 'joke' candidate is not good for democracy. I would like to focus on his future action.  I think your idea is right. His action sounds like joke even if he had rationale opinion. From these story, we can reconsider the social problem, so I would like to focus on this future story.  After I reread this article in today's class, I thought about whether ""joke"" candidates are good or bad for election. I had first thought that such a candidate was not serious about election. However, one of such candidates Vitali Klitschko, who identified as one of Star Wars characters, was elected mayor by majority. Now election all over the world has difficulty in attracting civil attention, in particular, young people's ones. That's why I think that the pleasant campaigning of election is effective in people who are not interested in election coming to it. Election should become more appealing for all people, I think.  I agree with your opinion. I think that the funny campaigning of election is very effective in attracting civil attention. Now, in particular, young people are not interested in election. That is very serious problem, so the form of the campaigning should be changed to solve it, I think. In addition, I also learned that propaganda was very important for candidates. For many Ukrainians, the incident is no joking matter, so I expect what he will act to save the life of the Ukrainian people next, too.  At the beginning, I could not understand what the title means. However, reading the content of the article, I was able to know it and had mixed feelings. This time, a man became Chewbacca which is the character on Election Day. This is very interesting, but not correct as to the election. The man should have thought his own behavior more, I think. This is because ordinary people do not follow such a stupid man. I suppose the election is strict, so I want candidates to do right conduct.  At first, I can't understand what the article said, because I don't know Star Wars. However, I think that joke candidates like him are not suitable for elections and we should consider the selection when we join it. We can vote next year, so we must judge whether the person I elect is suitable or not and have responsibility for the election. As do so, democracy is stranded up.  When I read this news story for the first time, I couldn't understand the meaning. And I confused. Because, I did not know that ""Chewbacca"" is real or a character. After I understood this meaning, I thought this story is very funny. Because, The Wookiee', the man dressed as Chewbacca, is very crazy. I winder why he did these crazy things. And I think it is funny that the artist turned the statue of Lenin into Darth Vader. I wonder why Internet Party which has candidates who dressed as movie character exist. And I thought it is very funny that ""the Wookiee"" told local reporters he could not pay as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" And I was surprised that the world heavyweight boxing champion Vitali Klitschko was re-elected mayor with 54 percent of the vote, defeating Aleksander Borovik. In Japan, some famous people and sport player became a member of the Diet. For example, Inoki who was a professional wrestler is one of a member of the Diet. In this news story, ""Borovik reported on Facebook. . . "" is written. I was surprised those people use SNS to insist their opinion.  Me too. I also could not understand the meaning, when I first read this headline. Because I was confused that ""Chewbacca"" is real or movie character. I think your opinion - he would like to appeal to public for something - is interesting. After I read your comment, I think so too. If this opinion is right, he is not nice. The election should be serious. Because the election is the thing that decide this county's future. If he wants to appeal his policy, he play fair without dressing movie character.  When I read this news, I was surprised and incomprehensible. I didn't know character of Star Wars so I can't understand Chewbacca. But I read carefully and I understood it. It's that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election.  When I read the news that a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine on Sunday after he broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day, I am very surprised. This is because I do not know there is the legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day. I have not watched the movie of ""Star Wars"" yet. I wanted to watch this movie to read this news. I am sure that Chewbacca is the very important character in the story. He may save the peace of space.  When I read this article, I was very surprised because I have never heard that politician dressed in costume of anime character like Chewbacca. I can't believe the politician behave like that. I think the politician is serious and it's way of thinking is hard. So I found his action a bit interesting. His action may break the stereotype for politics in Japan. But, in this time, the problem is that his action broke legislation that forbidden on campaigning on Election day. The idea was good, but we should conserve the law. And also, his excuse was terrible. ""My funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. ""Children can understand it is a lie. Even if we want to do the remarkable action, I think we should obey law as an adult. On the other hand, the image of politics should be improve. In Japan, it has been said that the decline of voting rate becomes the problem. The main reason is that young people aren't interested in politics. I think the unique way of campaign is good as long as it dose not break legislation.  I think that his attitude toward politics was bad. In addition, his stupid excuse was really unbelievable. He did a thing that he should not do as a politician, as an adult. Even if he want to campaign in unique way, he should've conserve the law. However, this evidence may attract young people who has been interested in politics. When I read this article, I imagine d if the situation happened. Young people in Japan may come to concern about politics, and the low voting rate may be improved.  I agree with your feeling. I could not also believe this article when I read it for the first time. In addition, I thought that the joke candidates would attract young people at first, but on second thoughts, candidates can become national leaders, so I think the citizens cannot rely on such a candidate. For attracting young people to elections, I think it is wrong to make a joke and get votes. After all, if the joking candidate will be elected, young people would lose interest right away, and other citizens would not go along with him or her easily.  I don't agree with your opinion that the candidates are fool and it is extremely clear that people shouldn't do something that can affect the results. Just like a party expresses itself for votes by holding up own campaign agenda and making a canvass of a neighborhood freely in democracy, I think a use of character costumes is also one of the way to do so. Although you say it was a good chance to recognize what a peaceful country Japan is, I don't think that existence of such candidates means Ukraine is not peaceful country. However, if the motivation for the joke style is not relevant to the politics, I can't support the party. They should have their own political intentions.  I think that this news is regrettable for three reasons. Firstly, I don't understand why they changed their name only for the election? I think that it is not necessary to change their name related to Star Wars for politics. Second, it is indicated that the confusion of Ukrainian politics. Nothing to say, there are many politic scandals in Japan, but I think that I have never heard that politicians really change their name into character's name. Badly, the name Chewbacca and Darth Vader are too known to all over the world, so this news became the topic. Finally, it is no symptoms to solve this political confusion in Ukraine. To sum up, I hope that this kind of scandals won't happen again.  I think a man being a candidate as Darth Vader has a good sense of humor, so the Chewbacca is. It can be possible when the election is in Russia, moreover, outside of Japan seen from the point of view of Japanese citizen. We see the generosity in them, but when it comes to politics, we have to ponder to whom we vote, since it directly relates to our lives. What improves our quality of life is the government but the same as who ruin it. To add, what is funny is that the fine is just $8, and he pursued his characteristics that he's from Star Wars, saying "" his bank has no branches on this planet"".  I was surprised with this news and I just cannot accept such a joking candidate. Even though it seems the candidate attracts attentions from a lot of people, I think they can be generous only because it is other people's affairs. If a candidate in my own city or country begins saying such things, I strongly reject. I do not want him to represent us. If he wins the election and becomes the president, I do not think any other organizations will trust him. I want more people to take this news seriously and report this carefully. When people think this matter more, there will be a lot of different opinions to discuss and in that way, more people will be interested in political matters.  When I read this article at first, I was very surprised. I think amusements mustn't come into the politics. If the representative of the Ukraine's Internet Party wearing Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine get himself out of the costume, will the citizen agree with and give support to him? Probably, he would be not able to receive attentions because the popularity of him will depend on the looks which are very famous characters' largely. Also, in Japan such a thing appear recently. For example, Higashikokubaru Hideo who was the governor of Miyazaki prefecture and Tani Ryoko who is a member of the Diet. I consider that they won an election thanks to their name recognitions, that is to say, if the citizens had not known about them at all and watch them for the first time in the election, they may be not elected to the political job. Therefore, the name recognition is very dangerous in the election. It deranges our right thinking. We must pay attention to not its looks but content of the policy. Not only such a thing, candidates should avoid dirty tactics. Nevertheless the resignation of the former president after Euromaidan revolution, close ties with Russia wasn't dissolved in the last election. This means the election didn't reflect popular willingness and there were frauds. I want politicians to be honest and to work hard to make their own countries better. The politics which contradict citizen's assertions don't mean anything. I wish the style of Ukrainian politics is improved without further delay. Politics must be conducted seriously because it decides the future of countries. Of course, the conductor of politics must be elected seriously, too. Thus, using own name value or dirty tactics are politically incorrect and we must take care of them.  This news story is related to an argument about running for the mayor under the false name. The advantage of this is that the citizens can feel close to the election. Due to a familiar name, they get interested in the election, and read a manifesto. This will be connected with a lively democracy. In other hand, such an action lacks sincerity. originally, politics should be sacredness because politics affects our way of life. Are you sure that such an action is permitted? I think that it should not be permitted. We vote for the person whom we want to trust, so a candidate must show who himself or herself is openly. Name is important when we evaluate them. Certainly, there are some statement who use false name in Japan (for example, Mr. Antonio Inoki). But they acted under the name, and are famous for the name, so their name remind of himself or herself. In this news story, we cannot recognize him in ""Chewbacca"", so he should not use the false name.  I think the reason why such as Chewbacca appeared in campaigning on election day, the symbol of people's anxiety. People of Ukrainian have big doubt to their politics. In the last paragraph, in this news, the local elections were written as an unreliable thing because of traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals. It seem difficult for me Ukrainian government to recreate new reliable politics. But they must introduce ""really reliable politics"" for people in Ukrainian. They are afraid of their politics. If the government does not try and success to introduce new politics, they cause a revolution again for their dissatisfaction of politics. The government should try to hold fair election and people choose appropriate and reliable man as a mayor who can have a power to change their politics.  I agree your opinion. As you say, the action of a man dresses as Chewbacca is contrary to democracy. It's important for nations that candidates reflect public opinion in policy decisions in order to protect democracy.  I was surprised that such a thing had been happened in reality. When I saw the picture first, I think why the character of Star Wars is there. It's interesting. But, I can't agree with them. It's politically exploit the popularity of Star Wars if it is not a joke. The most problem is that there are many people who had voted for them. However, recently, voter turnout has decreased. So, it might be good to collect the interest. For democracy, it is not allowed to be indifferent. Soon we become to be able to vote from the age of 18 in Japan. We should think the way to vote and politics.  I read this news. First I thought that the Ukrainian is very unique country. Recent days, Star Wars is very trendy movie. But I did not watch the Star Wars, so I did not understand all of this news. However, I know Sith and Darth Vader or etc. . . So I was easy to read. It is news handled as a comedy in the world, but I think that it is serious news. The Ukrainian resists the government. They did repulsion to the living government. But I think that their idea is very interesting. It becomes the news by all means. If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. However, we must not be arrested. As a result, would their action be right? I was not able to win in the election for mayor, may there not be a meaning? I think that it is enough just to have been able to show intention to object to the present government in the world.  The first point. I heard this news on TV at first, I cannot believe and was laugh. ""Wow there are a lot of people all over the world, but like this political party may be not bad . ""I thought at that time. But, if Japan has such a political party, what do I think? I think that I can't trust such a political party. Why? Because such a political party people do think about our nation?! I think that they think their own way. For example, their entertainment or amusement. Who can depend on our nation such a political party's candidate? I can't depend on them. The second point, He did not pay funds. It's only 8 dollars. He broke legislation that forbids campaign, but even so he refused to pay funds. Though imperfect , he is a nation 's representative , in good faith he should pay. But No! Faith! He broke legislation so he should pay! Nevertheless he did not have money because his bank does not exist on earth. I can't believe! When you read this article, you were surprised. When I read this article, I felt surprised and I laughed. I did not know star wars, so I did not know Chewbacca. I was surprised when there was a person dressed in the clothes that it was strange in the world. But, they would want to tell. In fact they attracted attention of the world. Everybody gives an example of the Japanese Government. In this way, they gave the opportunity when we thought about politics. I regret that he was caught by the police. But, I think that they had a big influence on the world.  Because I had never watched Star Wards before when I first read this article, I wasn't able to understand what was happening. But, I was interested in Star Wards and watched all series because the new movie was released last month. I thought it was very strange that Chewbacca was allegedly campaigning for Darth Vader and was thrown over a police car and handcuffed after knowing the characters of Star Wards. This news is related with democracy. Freedom of expression and speech is certainly the foundation of democracy. It is free that Ukraine's Internet Party runs for mayor on the topic of Star Wars. However, I think their actions are nothing but a publicity stunt aimed the election. Candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I want person who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics.  When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement.  I think we shouldn't think of this news optimistically. That's because I think an election doesn't need jokes and tricks. In the case of Ukraine, A joke which a candidate in Ukraine Internet Party is Darth Vader might have a harmful influence for voters in Odessa. Why we choose a candidate in election? To realize democracy, peace and an ideal society, we listen to their speech and inquire into their election promises closely and finally are convinced that he (or she) is the best man to realize them. I'm awfully sorry that a superficial judge such as electing the candidate for the interest having nothing to do with an election (it means ""Star Wars"" in this news) will affect the political situation and we shouldn't simply laugh it off. In related example, I can image that famous candidates such former athletes and entertainer tend to be elected in an Upper House election in Japan. Although all the famous candidates who are elected don't have politic ability, they are elected for their popularity and carriers. It cannot be said that this tendency of Japan is the same as this news of Ukraine unconditionally. But I want to choose a candidate by knowing their potential. And I think serious choice lead to better politics. Nowadays, Ukraine is one of the countries having political unrest. It is necessary to work hard to establish the political system of Ukraine as early as possible. So they should seriously think about Ukraine ahead of joking. We shouldn't feel that it was no concern of mine. Can we think of our country sincerely? We need to study this news.  My first impression of reading this article is funny. I like star wars and love Chewbacca. His cute voice and act makes me laughing. But, this is the first impression. After I read this article, I thought it is not simply and funny problem. The party candidates change into the funny costume. I cannot believe it. The candidates represent his region at the meeting and they should be good models of citizens. We Japanese have nothing to do with this problem in Ukraine. However, I think we need to think it seriously. Maybe this is a big problem for Ukrainian. After a man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested, he said, ""as my funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" I think this comment is so funny, but this means he slighted the official election and democracy. So, people in Ukraine should not permit him and dismiss from his job. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This act was contrary to their expectations. Now Ukraine has so many problems, but these people's act makes bad inside the country. I hope the government of Ukraine will manage the committee and the election strictly.  I agree with your opinion. In this news, I was interested in being relation to democracy. I have wondered what democracy is for many years. That's because I don't think democracy is equal to liberty. And when I read this news, I thought of my opinion again. A candidate dressed the costume ""Chewbacca"" was arrested by Ukraine police and the cause of the arrest was that he was campaigning for Darth Vader. We could find Ukraine police judged even if democracy get spread of in the country, it don't mean people can express anything in public situation. Like your opinion, I also think the police's judge was good. In election, candidates should behave suitably to express their true motive without jokes. I think we should reflect on democracy.  I also have never seen the series of ""Star Wars"". So I didn't understand the relation between Chewbacca and Darth Vader. So when I read the topic sentence at first, this news is funny too. But like your opinion, I think it shouldn't be news handled as a comedy. After we know this news, we have to reflect how we misunderstand about democracy. Anyway, I am interested in your opinion"" If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. . . . "" In my opinion, there was not the sympathy about the Ukrainian repulsion to the government. I think their styles of expression are illegal in term of a public election. But after I read your opinion, I reconsidered it a little. Certainly, if they were convinced of a defeat in normal method, I can understand they struggled to won for becoming a mayor in the style. We have to think of this news with taking into consideration of Ukrainian minds not only a law.  Your opinion is so funny. Why do you watch the Star Wars? I think this is a greatest movie of all movies of science fiction. At first, I felt this article is so interesting, too. But, it is not so simply. People who were related politics should be in earnest. I think people in Ukraine dislike that the candidates make fun of citizens. So, I think your opinion is right. This must not be permitted.  I think so, too. At first, I also could not understand the whole story of this article because I had never watch the movies. I didn't know Chewbacca and Star Wars characters very much, of course. It is certainly free that candidates is dressed in any clothes. The candidates of Ukraine's Internet Party would be conspicuous. But, I think they should wear proper costume and work a prompt action as representative of citizen. If they want to win the election, they should make an appeal to public sentiment for support in the proper way to express oneself. People who run for election should comply with the low, of course. I want candidates not to cause these trouble! This news was very strange for me. When I read this article for the first time, I could not realize the contents because I did not know about Star Wars so much. I thought what Chewbacca and Wookiee were. The reason why he did not pay a small fine was unique. He really kept the world view of Star Wars. But, Ukraine's Internet Party seems to fool around. I do not believe that those people were elected. Such a matter will not occur in Japan. If things go on like this, the confusion in Ukraine will continue. Ukrainian should elect proper politicians if they really want to solve national problem. And regional issues are very complicated to solve. Ukraine where is located between Europe and Russia is in a delicate position.  I totally agree with you. Candidates like them might make light of their conducts' impact on the democratic society. The democracy where such fools that thinks nothing of their people thrive can only decay, not properly function. I suggest Ukrainian government punish the criminal candidates severely.  I could not also believe it was an actual problem. As you said, the news related to Star Wars is very timely. Actually this news was spread on SNS. Maybe it became a good publicity for the latest work. But the man in Chewbacca should not do such a act. Moreover, he should properly pay the fine.  I agree with you. I think a candidate who is identified a character shouldn't be elected to the city council. Everybody have right to statement freely, so democracy in itself isn't incorrect to protect their right. However, everything isn't allowed to do. If they hope to realize their thought, they should win the confidence. I think people tend to trust a person who always looks neat and tidy, so the candidate should have put on not costume of a character but suit, polo shirt, and so on. When I read this article in the class, I wasn't able to understand the content well, because in Japan, this activity rarely happens. However, I should understand it deeply, because the globalization is making steady progress, so it is necessary for me to comprehension the international situation in order to live through the present day.  I sympathize with this article. The election is fair and is not surely the place that may joke. What I disguise myself as is outrageous. However, I think that it is a good thought to let interest in election of modern people unlike election leave that disguise as the character of the popular movie. advances in the present age, and the politician in the world adopts the opinion of the elderly person than the opinion of a youth carrying the coming future. This is because an elderly person sends big interest to election. It will let the interest of many people leave for the election to do the disguise of the character of a movie attracting support from a wide generation. The youth may go to the election more by doing it this way. Furthermore, the politician may raise the innovative thought that thought about future in the future to get the support of the youth by doing so it. This original strange thought can have possibilities to change the future of the country.  When I heard this news, I felt that this article was funny and interesting by only photograph of a strange animal. But I could not understand this article's contents at first, because I did not know what was the Chewbacca and star wars in detail. After that I was told by my group mate about star wars and what was the Chewbacca, I could understand this news' contents easily and I thought it is not simply and funny problem. And I was very surprised, because I have never seen such an accident in Japan, so someone may think he was very unique first, but I think that this accident is serious problem. We have to think about how we should do election and we should think how not to happen such a terrible accident any more. And candidates should mind their minimum manner in public and never forget be representative of citizen. They misunderstand the true meaning of democracy. I wish people who carrying out their responsibility as representative of citizen to go into politics.  I agree with your opinion. And I also could not understand the whole story of this article. When I was a child, I have watched only Star Wars episode 1, but I forgot the character and the story. I think that joke candidate should not be elected and punished seriously because candidates should wear proper clothes for occasion and have responsibility to campaign for the election.  I agree with your opinion. First, I have never seen ""Star Wars ""series. So I can not understand this news in detail. But those movies are very famous so I read this article, I want to watch ""Star Wars ""before. And I am interested in this news and movie. Second this country, Ukrainian is funny country. But such problem is serious . Not only funny but also serious . But I think that they enjoy doing such things, because he didn't pay a fine by the reason of stupid. If they want to win the election , he (or they ) should admits himself. Certainly, if the political party is comics or movies characters , I am interested in this political party. But if the political party does not what they should do, I may be losing the interest and think that do not playfully.  At first sight, I was very surprised at the article for its strangeness. (Few days ago, the Star Wars movie was released, and this news will attracts the world's attention again. ) And many other people might also be thought it unique and as a kind of joke. And the news of the statue which was transformed into the Darth Vader is also very surprising and strange. But these joking candidates are not so bad, because due to them, people around the world started to focus on the political matter of Ukraine. Though this situation might become temporary, this is true that these joking candidates led to the improvement of social awareness. Of course, they are not appropriate for public election. But everyone knows the ordinary fact and will not elect them for real. So they do not harm seriously to the election, I think. At least, only in the respect of social awareness, (and apart from the reality, ) they may not be simply suppressed.  I saw this news at first, I was surprised by picture . Also I could not understand that 'Chewbacca arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules' and what Chewbacca is because I did not see the Star Wars. But when I went on reading this news , gradually I understood this article. I think that this is very serious. We have to think about how we should do election .  This idea which is the disguising themselves as characters of the movie is unique and so interesting, because I think that this idea is able to give an impact to many people. I also got a strong impact when I saw their appearance on TV news, and I think that is good idea, because they can get attention easily. In addition, people might be feel strong affinities easily with them. However, Chewbacca should not make an excuse because of the setting of the movie if he breaks the law. I thought this behavior is a conduct that a candidate of the election should not engage in and he accepts defeat with a bad grace. In that case, he can give an only bad impression to people. This political party has to turn over a new leaf if it wants to improve the impression of the citizens.  At first, I can't get understand this news clearly. I haven't seen ""Star Wars"" ever, so those names mentioned in this article were odd to me, except Darth Vader. It may be one of the reasons, but there is another stronger reason. I couldn't believe the fact that party candidates are costumed in character costumes and it is allowed. In Japan, I think there is a tacit understanding that such jokes are not suitable for political situations. I have taken it for granted, so it was difficult for me to imagine the situation which this article mentions. However, I don't think their style is incorrect. Because it is people that are at the center of democracy, and it should be free how to express ourselves in a political situation. Democracy is marked by increasing number of young people who are not interested in politics and the light poll in Japan recently. Those people such as Ukraine's Internet Party candidates attract attention, so their style may become one of the solutions to that problems. However, even though there will be a heavy vote thanks to ""joke"" candidates, it may be novelty, interest or love for the character, not policy itself declared by the party that encouraged citizens to vote. I think it is meaningless and not good thing. Furthermore, if a ""joke"" candidate put his heart into the role extremely, it will lead to a disturbance of the public order. Star Wars' character is a good example. In conclusion, freedom of political activity should be permitted in democracy, but, at the same time, there should be restriction to some extent. In addition, parties such as Internet Party must think of the political policies earnestly and we have to turn our eyes to them not only their eccentric appearances.  I think that this man was the sarcasm to the Russia. First in the movie, Chewbacca was forced to work at the Galactic Empire. Later Han Solo saved Chewbacca and they cooperated to overthrow Galactic Empire. In Ukraine, historically, there were two parties. The party that supports Russia and the party that supports EU. These days, the problem of Crimea is the huge problem in the world. The problem of Crimea between Ukraine and Russia is difficult and hard to understand. So I quote the website of HAARETZ, ""Crimea was absorbed into the Russian empire along with most of ethnic Ukrainian territory by Catherine the Great in the 18th century. Russia's Black Sea naval base at Sevastopol was founded soon afterwards. More than half a million people were killed in the Crimean War of 1853-56 between Russia and the Ottoman Empire, which was backed by Britain and France. The conflict reshaped Europe and paved the way for World War One. In 1921, the peninsula, then populated mainly by Muslim Tatars, became part of the Soviet Union. The Tatars were deported in masse by Soviet leader Joseph Stalin at the end of World War Two for alleged collaboration with the Nazis. "" And why Crimea is the part of Russia? ""Crimea only became part of Ukraine when Soviet leader Nikita Khrushchev gave the peninsula to his native land in 1954. This hardly mattered until the Soviet Union broke up in 1991 and Crimea ended up in an independent Ukraine. Despite that, nearly 60 percent of its population of 2 million identify themselves as Russians. Since the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, there have been periodic political tussles between over its status between Moscow and Kiev. "" I think that this man wanted to raise a doubt about the problem between Russia and Ukraine.  I agree with your opinion. I think that the story of Star Wars is very very difficult. It was the time of the primary schoolchild that I saw Star Wars for the first time, but was not able to understand the contents of the story at all. The only memory to remember clearly is that a light saver is very cool. I was not able to understand even the face and the name of character and not know Chewbacca either. And I think that it is ban to mix every play for election, too. The holy activity which called the election should be carried out faithfully and anybody must not elect someone in for fun. The politician chosen by election represents the country. If one step is wrong, there is the risk to become the catastrophe that may shake the basis of the country. May I participate with a costume play as election including such risk? By a serious appearance, should I not participate in election with a faithful feeling. It may be surely a good thing to add a simple image to election so that many people participate in the election with the too faithful image. This is because the youth's keeping away from election is remarkable. In this time when the election participation rate decreases, the plan that is such a catchy may be the measure. It may be a good thought, but, I think that, in election, the faithfulness that is one of the important requirement must meet it.  I agree with your opinion. It was the time of the primary schoolchild that I saw Star Wars for the first time, but was not able to understand the contents of the story at all.

It may be a good thought, but, in election, the faithfulness that is one of the important requirements must meet it. A question remains whether the election that important requirements fell out is really reliable election. I think that In election, both a person with the right to vote and the person having eligibility for election should participate in election seriously.  This news is very humorous and interesting, I think. Star Wars is known all over the world, so Ukraine's Internet Party should have attracted attention of many people. To collect votes this is very effective. In Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics. Their name and character must be known to many people. These resemble closely very much, I think. These are effective to collect votes, you know. But I want to say this situation is not always good. Even if it was a famous person, he may not work well. The mistake is not permitted in the politics. So a person with the knowledge should do politics, I sure. It is interesting as far as I see it from the other place, but if a candidate like this news appears in Japan, I must doubt.  When I read the title of this article for the first time, I thought that what Chewbacca is because I am not familiar with ""Star Wars"". While I went on reading the part of beginning, I felt that is funny and even wanted a incident such this article to take place in Japan because absolutely a incident like this never happen in Japan. Until I finish reading the part of end, indeed I did not even think that there was a deep political background. Because I studied world history at time of the high school student, I knew that Ukraine became independent from the Soviet Union, but I surely did not still know that power of West Europe is opposed to power of the Russian-supporting rebels in Ukraine now. Because Ukraine is located between West Europe and Eastern Europe, the position of Ukraine is delicate politically and geographically. After all, I want Ukraine to become democratic in the same way as Japan, but at first it should be first priority to stabilize domestic politics. If it becomes so, Chewbacca will not fall into the dark side.  I agree with your opinion greatly. I think they are excited by themselves only, don't admire the characters. And then, That this is acted at politics is dishonest. It shouldn't be resolved as a practical jokes.  I knew only the title of Star Wars, but I did not know such detailed character of the name and the contents of the story. So, at first it was difficult for me to understand what this article said. But I began to understand While I promoted reading. I was really surprised that such a political party is not a joke. In Japan, To be outdone in Ukraine, This year, movie of STAR WARS: THE FORCE AWAKENS is published and fan of star wars has also risen. in Ukraine, the number of candidates belonging to the political party of ""Darth Vader Blocks"" is 48 people. Of which 44 people are referring to themselves as the Vader. It is true that Ukrainians love Star Wars obsessively. I thought Ukraine is humorous country. Although I think such a party will not come out in Japan, if it do that, this will not solve laughing matter. In addition, it was further surprised to hear that candidate dressed as villain of the ""Star Wars"" won 54% of the support rate and he was elected. He seems to become city council member in southwest Odessa of Ukraine. Elected politicians can play an important role to determine the management of the area. So, of course, such election result is not good. I think that the Ukrainians should think about own country seriously. However, why was such a result? This situation doesn't represent that Ukrainians are stupid but a sign of dissatisfaction with politics . It sounds like people have claimed that "" Whatever people are selected, the politics will not change"", ""the first place politicians are rotten. "" I hope that Ukrainian politics are better, and clever politicians are elected. At the same time, I also hope that the people who do the efficient politics come out, so that Japan does not fall into situations such as Ukraine.  This news was very unique, and it was a good chance for me to be interested in politics of Ukraine. However, in Ukraine that the political situation is unstable the incident occurred in other cities that the group of the secessionist who received the Russian support collided with Ukraine forces and the election canceled. Surely it looks like an interesting funny case. However, to be frank, I want all nations including dozen Vader to face the current political situation of Ukraine seriously and work hard to improve it. . .  I could not understand the article too. I have not seen 'Star Wars'. Since many character were appeared in this article, it was difficult for me to grasp the contents. In Japan, election campaign is controlled strictly. Therefore such a strange accident do not happen. The Ukrainian government should take action against candidates for a cleaner form of democracy. Owing to loose regulation, local elections are lacking in discipline. The Ukrainian government have to solve the problem promptly for Ukrainians.  At first, I like Star Wars very much. So, when I saw the headline, I thought that this news is interesting. And I thought it was only a joke, because such a political movement is impossible in Japan. I think that there are both good point and bad point for this political movement. At first, we can not understand what kind of policy the Ukraine's Internet Party is advocating, and what kind of politics they want to do. When we conform to the story of Star Wars, Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine are enemies of Jedi Knight and Rebel. In the story, Palpatine was one of the republican members of the Diet, but he have used a stratagem and planned it so that all power of the republic concentrated on himself. After all, he succeeded in overthrowing the republic and he introduced himself as 'Emperor'. Then Galactic Empire was born. The politics by the empire was domination of fear using menace of 'DEATH STAR' and 'STORM TROOPER' . If I were Ukrainian, I would not vote for Darth Vader and Emperor Palpatine as one of the Star Wars fan. But if the Ukraine's Internet Party that Darth Vader leads proposes a policy which is good for the nation, I may vote for them. In other words, what I want to say is that the most important thing in politic is contents. However, recently the people who don't pay attention to contents of the politics are increasing. The tendency is strongly seen in young people. Actually, my friends who are university students will not know what kind of policy each political party is advocating. I also understand it. But by having seen this news, I became interested the policy of the Internet Party and the history of the party. After I researched, I think I can not trust them, but it is really important for us to be interested in politics in this way. I think this movement is good at the point to let us pay more attention to politics. As we know, 2015 is the year when Star Wars episode 7 'THE FORCE AWAKENS' was shown. The boom of Star Wars was coming all over the world. Of course I also looked forward to the exhibition very much! I have watched the movie twice in theater! Episode 3 of previous work was shown in 2005. For ten years, Star Wars fans have been waiting. The Internet Party might do such a performance for the purpose of getting on this ""Star Wars wave"". In this way, we can visit it from outside, but Ukrainians are serious. Probably disappointment and dissatisfaction of the nations should reach the considerable level because of military pressure of the neighborhood of border from Russia and admission of Crimea in Russia. In such a case, if political party such as internet Party appears, I think a strange situation may be happened. If the person who is not interested in politics or who does not expect for politics vote for this party with the intention of the joke, it is bad democracy. (This is only a possibility to the last). When I think in this way, I could understand the danger of not knowing the politics. I will be 20 years old on the next birthday, and through this news, I realize that it is important to understand the manifesto and way of thinking of parties. By the way, the headline of this news is'Chewbacca' arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules. I like Chewie in the movie. Chewie is popular in his cute voice. As a copilot of the millennium falcon and as the fellow of Han Solo, he brought about the excellent scene. But I don't like this Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine. The reason he don't pay is that his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. I was disgusted with this remark. If this is not a political situation, it is a laughable joke. However, this is the election that is most important in democracy. They must collect votes based on rule and without injustice! The point that I was most surprised at in this news is that Lenin statue was transformed to the Darth Vader statue. It is unbelievable that such a permission was granted. And I thought Lenin turned to ""Dark Side"".  I am agree with you. And I like Star wars, too. This is a serious problem for Ukrainian. The country has a lot of problem. Many Ukrainians hope for a cleaner form of democracy. This Chewie who broke legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day and don't pay the fine should not be permitted. He must not have a qualification about election.  When I read this article, I was very astonished. Why did you think Chewbacca was arrested? But Chewbacca remained in this article, and I had no relation. It was bad that Chewbacca broke a law. I think even the character of Star Wars has to observe the law. But I think the idea that it's better to disguise itself as the famous character and be watched at election. A decline of the election rate is a problem now in Japan. I think it's also one of countermeasures I elect uniquely, and to raise the interest of the people.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at this news. Because I have never watched Star Wars. I did not know any character of name. So it is very difficult for me to understand. It is very interesting. But we have to consider this problem seriously.  Me too! I agree with you. I have never watched Star Wars, so I can hardly understand about this incident and believe this is real event when I read this article at first.  When I read this article for the first time, I was surprised that ""joke"" candidates like Chewie and Emperor Palpatine exist in official elections. In that time, I am angry with the candidates because it is ridiculous that someone runs for officials as a joke. However, I realize that not only ""non-joke "" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates compose of liberal societies. As you know, such ""joke"" candidates like Dr. Nakamatsu also exist in Japan. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. If we are based on their idea, not only ""non-joke "" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates are good and free. Meanwhile, in full-grown democratic societies, such ""joke"" candidates cannot be elected to officials because citizens understand that it is not well for them to elect ""joke"" candidates to officials. By the way, I have never seen ""Star Wars"" before. So, I have pain to read this article. The other day, the latest ""Star Wars"" series movie was released and the series movies are in the spotlight. Since ""Star Wars"" series movies are told a masterpiece by many movie fans, I would like to see ""Star Wars"" in my spring break! This news uses many metaphors and it make me interested in it. The arrest of Chewbacca is funny one, but in fact Ukraine has many problems. The local elections were marked by traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals and so on. Now Star Wars is boomed again , but we should look into real problems seriously.  Surely in Japan, Entertainers and athlete as so on are often concerned with politics!!! This case is similar to the candidacy of dozen Vader. However, it is the story that the people who have been elected only with popularity often damage the politics. Because it cannot happen, I think that the running people have to acquire knowledge about politics and manner well. . .  There is intervention of police for this incident, but there are many nuisances that we have not pick up as violations. Smoking is one of these problems, I think. I believe smoking in the prohibited area should be banned in public places. Recently, several countries have restricted the areas in which people may smoke. Scientist agree that smoking is dangerous. Smoking does not just harm the smoker; it also harms people nearby, who breathe in the smoke. Smokers choose to smoke, but people nearby do not choose to smoke passively. A more strict ban on smoking in public is needed to protect people from passive smoking. Indeed, there may be little relationship between this incident and smoking, however, I think we need to grasp this incident more widely on this occasion.  I disagree with your idea because I believe that not only ""non-joke"" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates compose of liberal societies. In the modern world, many countries' politics with universal suffrage are based on the idea of democracy and liberalism. When our politics are based on their idea, not only ""non-joke"" candidates but also ""joke"" candidates are good and free. However, I respect you. You always try to listen to others carefully and take in the idea which you don't have from others. I would like to imitate you and feel the pleasure of studying all together in the class.  First time I read this story, I didn't understand what this whole news was about. Because of the many nouns I have never seen like Chewbacca, Wookiee, Odessa, but after I looked up these words I soon understood it. At first, I thought ""A man dressed as Chewbacca was arrested in Ukraine because of breaking legislation that forbids campaigning on Election Day"" and the face that he was campaigning for ""Darth Vader"" was funny. And the fact that he told the local reporters ""he had no way to pay the fine because his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet"" made it even funnier. I am sure that the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world too, however IT IS NO JOKING MATTER FOR MANY UKRAINIANS. It is natural that they have to be serious about the politics, since they have a lot of problems to solve like Crimean region affairs. About the election, I think it should be kept clean with no dirty tactics so that Ukrainian government can introduce the ""new kind of politics"". Also in the article it says that there was a related news that a statue of Lenin was transformed by Ukrainian artists last week. And it is because of the law banning any public statues of its communist past. As I said I thought it was funny, but its not. I do not understand why they are trying to mix the politics with funny things. It should be separated and never should get mixed. I have totally the same opinion with Borovik. It is beyond my understanding and I am like what is wrong with people these days about those things.  Surely it was after a man dressed as 'Chewbacca' broke legislation that forbids campaign on Election Day that he arrested in Ukraine. This is a serious matter and a crime. We must obey the law of your own nation. He should be judged and may insult the people who live in Odessa. And his action may insult and disturb democratic politics and election. However, I was surprised in this news when I read this article for the first time. Saying in other words, I was confused and can't understand this news. Because the character of very very popular movie among people all over the world, Star Wars took part in the election, did a political campaign and made a political party. I feel liberty in Ukraine. I was amazed these humor. If the famous character of Japanese animation or movie do a political campaign in Japan, I think he/she or they is criticized by conservative people. For instance, I feel more humorous in a president's speech of USA than a prime minister's speech of Japan. I think it is wonderful thing to permit this humor. So I think difference of culture and tolerance of nation when I read this article.  I agree with you. I wonder if the voters really thought of what the candidate with a well-known character name will do after winning the election. It seems people just chose him because his name is famous and funny. There might be some people electing him with other reasons. However, it is just unclear. To make it fair, I think nobody should not use character names in elections.  I agree with you. When I read this article for the first time, I didn't still watch Star Wars. I can't understand the terms of Star Wars, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' and so on. I watched Star Wars recently. I can understand the terms now. So I think this article is lack of consideration for people who never watch Star Wars.  As you said, I think this news contained some metaphors, because it was so weird that it attracted people's attention from other countries, and it made people notice that the traditional dirty tactics had remained in Ukraine. Ukraine was before a part of Soviet Union that took socialism, but it locates next to Europe that takes democracy. As a result, the Ukrainian can be separated into two groups that have different opinion on politics. In my opinion, these situation makes Ukrainian politics complex.  I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good method to use for democracy. Public trust is the basis of politics, so election should be sacredness. This is an issue which affects politics. Certainly, sensible citizens would not vote such a candidate, but it will destroy the atmosphere. Especially, in a region where a election system still needs polishing, it must not be permitted. As a real event, in this news story, ""joke"" candidate was winning. In Japan, there are some celebrity politicians and they run for an election of the members of the House of Councilors to be a figurehead who attracts the support for their political party. Some of them live up to citizens' expectations, on the other hands, some of them give rise to problem behavior. It can be related to an unfair estimation of political party. Thus, I think that ""joke"" candidates are not good for democracy. In addition to this issue, there is another issue that Ukraine is still under the control of Russia. Even though a wave of demonstrations, the Euromaidan revolution, happened in 2014, Ukraine has never turned into a real democratic country. Then traditional dirty tactics such as voter-buying, spoiler candidates and backroom deals still have been used. If Ukraine seriously wants to get out of the control by Russia and become an independent country as a democratic one, Ukraine should begin to reflect its nations' opinions. Clearly, changing traditional methods of politics is not easy, so at least the government should listen to public opinions. Speaking of democracy, it is eminent for politicians to consider what welfare and needs people want the government to make meet. As a result, I believe that using ""joke"" candidates is inappropriate way to make a good flow of politics. Also, I think that Ukraine ought to see other countries in the world as many of them have become democratic since globalization has developed in the recent decades and that it is important to consider better way to be democratic by leaning what it should do or not do from the previous revolution.  I agree with your opinion and I did not know about Chewbacca because I have never watched Star Wars too. So I was very surprised and felt funny when I heard this news at first. But after understanding what was Chewbacca and so on, I thought this news was very seriously and interesting, because I have never seen such a news in Japan. You said that we have to consider this problem seriously, I think so too! And I want to spread to people who don't know about the Star Wars' any characters. And I want to exchange our opinions about this problem.  I agree with your opinion and I think so, too. When I read this article for the first time, I only paid attention to the look of Chewbacca because he had a lot of visual impact for me. However, it was not until I read it some times that I noticed about what he wants to declare firmly, and it was so great. And I think it is a good peg for people all over the world to know the reality of life for many Ukrainians.  You are right. I only focused on the joke candidates, but now I see it also important to think about the traditional dirty tactics already existed. We have to find what is happening there in reality.  I agree with your opinion that no one want to follow him even if he is elected. I think it will not make true democracy, too. A election system is very important for political.  I agree with you. Candidates who ran playfully will give a bad effect on democracy. Politics must be faced with a belief in themselves and their political parties. Therefore to run for election in half ridicule is a insult to other candidates. Correspondence of the Ukrainian government for such candidates is reasonable. I think that there is a chance that comedian who is not familiar with politics is not good. You should go extrusion with his policies and a commitment to bring it forward if to run for election. With person of name recognition and policy combined, it will be possible to spread widely the policy. It is also often cited as hereditary problems in Japanese politics. However, that the child is interested in the profession of his father as a matter of course. The eligibility is a right that everyone has. This is why it is not inequality. I also want to become a politician if there is a chance.  I have a different opinion. I agree with your opinion at the point that he should be arrested due to break legislation that forbids campaigning, but I don't think so much that such people never appear as you said. I am not fanatic fan of Star Wars myself, so I cannot understand his feeling, but his action is one of the political claims that he supported for Darth Vader. Recently, in Japan, young people are not interested in politics and don't participate in political election, which situation is one of the social problems. Compared with this situation, this event is wired indeed, but I don't think a severe problem.  That is an interesting opinion. Actually I also thought he did this occasion to get attention from all over the world. When I watched this news on TV, I was so interested in the political party which Chewbacca is belonging to, because it is so a unique idea. Add to this, TV show also picked up this political party in the Ukraine over the daily. His act after arresting was in an embarrassing way, but it was also impressive. I did not know anything about the Star Wars till I checked this topic on the Internet, so I studied the characters of the Star Wars and the situation in the Ukraine because I thought that is a good opportunity to know them. We cannot see those political activity in Japan. In this time, their performance is known as a bad action to the world, however, young people might get interests in politics if any Japanese political party tries to do some unique performance like that. I do not know their future, but I expect that they will make a contribution for the Ukraine if they do not break the rule any more.  I also laughed that arrested man said ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" It is very funny joke. I think it helps that the news was met with amusement online all over the world. It was a great effect. And I agree with your opinion about Democracy, too. The better education becomes, the more knowledge of politics a lot of young people acquire.  I know there are Darth Vader and his subordinates in Ukraine, but don't know that Chewbacca, one of Darth Vader's subordinates, was arrested. In addition, I don't know Star Wars very much. However, hearing the news, I think Star Wars is very famous movie all over the world and a lot of people like Star. By the way, there are a lot of election systems in the world. In Ukraine, people who want to stand as a candidate don't need to use real name. So, Darth Vader could come forward as a candidate by name of ""Darth Vader"". In Brazil, all candidates can decide their candidate name, too. Of course, Japan and a lot of countries don't allow candidates to decide their candidate name, but it has several merits for candidates to decide their candidate name. A first merit is that unique names are often born and that the election activates very much. If election activates very much, a lot of citizen will be interested in politics. Next merit is that candidates can have character by candidate name which candidates decide. If candidate name were ""Darth Vader"", the candidate will get very strong character. However, this system has big demerit. It is citizen can't know candidate's real maybe. This incident occurs for the demerit.  When I read this article for the first time I was very surprised. Some people in the class say that we have to take it into serious consideration and it is the matter of democracy. However it is just a joke. It is a funny news. And I am a big fun of Star Wars so this news is very interesting for me. I don't have many information and impression about Ukraine, but this news make me have the impression about the country that the country is full of sense of humor. Darth Vader is running for a mayor of a city? Chewbacca is campaigning for Darth Vader and he was arrested? What a amusing news it is! I was not able to read this article without laughing. These days this country has been reported to the dark side of it so many have negative image about this country. However these kind of funny news may make us who have negative image about the county change the way we think about the country.  I agree with your opinion. ""Joke""candidates must understand the unstable politics in Ukraine. But For foreign people this case might be the good occasion that they were interested in the recently politics in Ukraine.  I myself am not interested in Star Wars, so I cannot understand this incident. However, I saw lots of fans all over the world excited when a new movie of Star Wars series was released last month, I thought maybe this man was also one of the fanatical fans of Star Wars. Just by looking, adult man dressed as Chewbacca and campaigned for Darth Vader was so crazy and childish. But considering political background of Ukraine, this may be one of the way of protesting to the government and insisting his policy. In 2014 the Euromaidan revolution led to the resignation of President Viktor Yanukovych, many Ukrainians hoped for a cleaner form of democracy, and closer ties with Europe. Instead, since then the Crimean region has been taken over by Russia, and the eastern parts of the country have seen fighting between locals and Russian-supporting rebels. Therefore Ukraine's political affair has been not stable. In fact, the local elections were still marked by traditional dirty tactics. I imagine that he wanted to escape from reality whose government was smeared with dirty tactics and he mixed up real word and fiction Star Wars world.  I agree with you. Even if they were able to win a vote, there is not conclusive evidence whether or not they do politics properly. Actually, we cannot vote for a doubtful person in Japan, too. On the other hand, this news let us be interested in politics. This is a nice chance, I think. Because the other day, the government decided person 18 years old or older to allow the right to vote but most of youth are unconcerned about politics. So we should have more interest in them first.  I think this news show bad aspect of democracy like populism. Democracy is really revolutionary tool that has many bad points. To get over that, high-level education is needed.  I read this article, this incident has been treated like a joke, but never not those that may be received in that way, it was thought to be those which are considered more seriously. Also, because I was interested in Star Wars by reading this article, I was looking back the whole work.  I do not agree with you. Because I can't understand this article when I read it for the first time. I can't understand the Star Wars's words. For example, 'Chewbacca', 'the Wookiee', 'Darth Vader' and 'The Sith Lord' are. I think is is easy for this article to have to be understand.  muslim is enemy, the Idea to capture the word as enemy or Ally of dualism, makes the word simplify too much. in 2015, the word was shocked by Islamic state group. for instance, two of the victims were Japanese, intruding a journalist who often reported from war zones. and in the world, Paris was the target of the separate attacks at the star and the end of the year. radical jihadists claimed responsibility for both sets of attacks which together killed More than 140 people, and in America, 14 people was killed by a terror attack in California. now the word has been rattled by IS. French present Francois Hollande said, ""France is at the war"" and vows revenge against Islamic state for Paris attacks. and US president Barack Obama vowed December 6 that America would destroy the Islamic state group and hunt down its followers at home or abroad, in rare address from the oval office. This problem has also affected the issue of the world's immigrants. in France, French voters give far right party historic election wins. and US Republicans seek to refuse Syria refugees. It is a part of a mounting republican backlash against the Obama administration's plan to accept thousands more immigrants from the war-torn country. US Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump insisted Nov. 29 he was ""100 percent right "" when he said that he saw thousands of Muslims in Jersey City, New Jersey, cheering the 9/11 attacks on the world trade center. he also defended his provocative call to ban Muslims from the United States and in a then show race reshaped by national security concerns. Terrorism is a show involving the audience, I guess. To distinguish between the people in the wake of terrorism is like terrorists' ideal world. a thought ""we will not give in Inhumane terrorism"" which conflicts with terrorists and people never solve the problems. and it's not only talking about Syria. we should not exclude the minority like ""To Kill a Mockingbird"" I found it quite fun and interesting reading this news at the first time. First the picture inserted in the article was surprising. I did not recognize the creature which is getting caught in the picture so I was stunned at the first time. I thought a giant UMA was caught which is named, Chewbacca, and released to the public. Yet, by the time when I was half way down of the article I could only stop but to laugh. I did not really finish the article because it is not worth argued with someone about it. It was interesting to relate something very familiar like Star Wars and politics. It surely helps people to be more interested in politics which lead to the increase of participation of people in elections and political activities. I that case I am very positive about it. People do not always get interested in complicated things like politics so politicians have to come up with some unique idea to increase the participation rate of people. In this case is that especially for young people who have the right to vote which means that young people who are over 18 ( different situation exist in different countries). However, it does not mean that the level of politics will improve by just increase the number of participants to the elections or political activities. Or maybe the situation will get worth by increasing the number of uneducated participants. Uneducated political participants will be easily influenced by cheap media or propagandas. People who have not received any appropriate education about politics will give a negative impact to other people. What I thought when I read this news is that I would love to see more interesting and fun image on politics but politics is the most important task to think about in democratic countries.  I do not agree with your comment. Because, the man wear the costume of Chewbacca on purpose to make people interested.  What I felt was completely same as you. I could help but to laugh when I first saw this article. However, it can be a good spice for young people and give a positive influence on young people who do not participate in politics.  I really agree with you. I think Japanese is also more sensible than other countries. But I think only Ukrainian is not to blame for this situation. Their country has many problem. For example, Russia is always thinking and doing something to annex the part of the country. Ukrainian is also always scaring that when the time come, Russia come to annex their land with military power. This stress makes Ukrainian mentally unstable. In Addition, Ukraine was a socialist nation. So she couldn't do well economically and be given support from West Europe. It is cruel to say to behave like other developed European countries to the people under such situation.  I was surprised at this news as you, and I agree with you. Our reaction seems that Japan has a democracy.  I disagree your comment strongly. Because we have the liberty of politics, the man can be a candidate under the law.  I want to praise the brave man in Chewbacca. Although, the exception is pattern that Russia government participate in this action.  I agree with you. I was very surprised when I know this news. It will not take place in Japan. Star Wars is popular in Ukraine, so costume of Star Wars is suitable to attract attention. However I think that they should follow a law. The politician should give the nation security.  I have never watched Star Wars before so I can't understand what these characters are. However I was surprised that it was connected with politics. Some people commented that it should be free what people wear so the man should not be punished. I disagree with this opinion. Even it is democracy, there is common sense and the man has no common sense I think. That occasion was not a private party or a costume competition. I don't know if the man wanted to capture more people's attention, but his behavior was a shame to other politics. I learned that we should be able to tell the difference between right and wrong especially in the public occasion.  I really agree with this sentence. ""Although the news of the arrest was met with amusement online around the world, the reality of life for many Ukrainians is no joking matter"". Of course, the characters are famous all over the world. There are many funs in Japan. Now, we can see everything throughout the Internet, so the sensational news like this will spread quickly. I think it is not bad thing, however, there are no sympathy feelings. So I think that is a problem.  I think the police arrest by this incident is reasonable. In the influence election of the country in the future, I think that you use the character of the famous movie violates greatly to fairness of the election. It would become unnecessarily increase the people to vote without considering the policy.  The news difficult for me. The person wear full-body suit like Chewbacca. That is strange thing and the article talk a lot of things connecting with Star Wars. I confuse real thing on fiction. So, the news difficult for me.  This news is very interested for me. Therefore I research this troubles. The Star Wars character Chewbacca has been dragged before a court in Odessa, in perhaps the most surreal episode in local elections across Ukraine that have been both hotly contested and rife with dirty tricks. The man inside the costume was fined 170 hryvnia for the ""administrative offense"" of not being able to produce identification documents. A statement posted on the official Instagram account of the Ukrainian police read: ""Nothing unusual here, just Chewbacca detained for being without documents while driving Darth Vader to the elections in Odessa. The Sith Lord has already claimed this was illegal as Chewbacca is his pet and general servant and thus does not require documents. "" Police had earlier dragged ""Chewbacca"" from a polling station and put him in a van after accusing him of disrupting proceedings. The person in the costume said he had been there to support Darth Vader, who was attempting to vote. I was very surprised this topics. 'Chewbacca' arrested in Ukraine after breaking election rules View Post This news story made me surprised very much. This is the first time I heard that candidates wore costume of character. I thought that the man disguised as that character because he wanted to say he was clever like this character at first because I did not know about STAR WARS. So I searched about STAR WARS and the character Chewbacca on the Internet. Surprisingly, Chewbacca cannot speak and can understand only basic language. They are misunderstood by people as savage animals because of their appearances. I was not able to find out the advantages of disguising himself as Chewie. But I consider that he only wanted to gather people's attentions by the costume. I think disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. Some people might decide who to vote only because of their costume. Candidates should gather votes by their own manifesto. And people have to make decision who to vote by deeply considering about not only their surface but also their manifesto and thinking or behavior before the election.  I agree with your opinion. The person who costumed as Chewbacca did no prohibited action but his action brought bad effect to the election. Election is not event which candidates gather people's attention by their costume. Candidates should show people their manifesto and their earnest will to the politics. I agree with your idea that the statement ""as his funds are an intergalactic bank that has no branches on this planet. "" is too insincere. More faithful person is necessary to go into politics.  I agree with your idea. The news story like a joke but it isn't joke. Election is very important event so I think they should think much more and rethink their idea that vote the candidate.  In deed, your opinion that Chewie is not a clever character, but I think its costumed man chose the character because it was like mascot character and lovely. Also, Star Wars is one of the world widest movies, so he chose this character, I felt. I wish the future that young people are also attracted to elections comes.  I almost agree with you but I have only one point which I am not for. This costuming behavior is humor but not less reliable. Candidates should not make laugh in such ways. The point is remaking the statue of lenin to Darth Vader is sign of people's longing for new world. I do not think so. I think people who remade the statue did such action for only own satisfaction.  I agree with your opinion. I think candidates have to change their clothes which is appropriate to the occasion. The reason why is simple, we can not respect the person who wears a black tie in the wedding. The clothes have the way which represent the situation one person is included. If we are in the party of wedding, we have to wear white tie. In your comment, one student in your class said like that, nowadays, it is freedom what kind of clothes a person chooses to wear. However, it is definitely different from the custom , I think. Please don't misunderstand what I want to say. I would not like to tell you about the way of choosing your suit clothes but want you to know what is important. The person who have stable sensation gives people good impression. I think except the people who is perverse, almost all usual people tend to like the person who is kind or has common sense.  I agree with your opinion in the hope of democratization of Ukraine. When I knew this news for the first time, I have only the impression of an interesting story, but in fact, there was a deep political background. This case in itself becomes the mere funny story, but political and geographical problems of Ukraine are the complicated and serious circumstances that tormented Ukrainian people for many years. It is true that the act of this false Chewbacca did the annoying social act that disturbed the election activity, but it is also a fact that many people have a chance to pay attention to Ukrainian political problems like you and me. To become democratic, truly for Ukraine, the government, which can change politics is above all important. Therefore, I want there to push forward election smoothly for next time. In addition, I am glad if they play an active part in the pleasant scenes such as Star Wars new movie exhibitions, not the serious situation such as the election activity in the future.  I don't think so. It is unique! When I read this article I thought this is fiction for campaigning for election or movie. Because Star Wars has been popular in the world, and Star Wars sequel will be published next year. So I thought the movie production attempt a plan that election and movie advertisement go to the world. But it is nonfiction. I was so surprised. The man in the Chewbacca was arrested on suspicion of election law violations. He was shouting and rampaged. It is not allowed. His bad action becomes annoying to the Star Wars production company. But I think it is not bad to join to election even if somebody participates in the cosplay. Because it can be opportunity people who are not interest in their county election are actively participate in them. But this time is not good way for expression. Do not be never become a nuisance. This happen can be not imagined in Japan. May be Japanese is said to shy. But Japanese is not interest in own country elections. It is say numbers. Last election voter turnout is under 60%. It is not high, even compared with the global. If we want to say to Japanese government, we have to express in the election before movement Humorous people is in any countries and it is also true that there is humorous people who are pulling the society. However, humorous people must choose the time and place when they do humorous action. This news is a bad example. Ukraine has been paid attention to the Crimean peninsula problem in recent years by many countries. In addition, the Ukrainian people will also began to be interested in politics greatly. Territorial problem is very easy for root of problem to become deep. Especially, in this case, it even easier because Ukrainian opponent is power, Russia. In addition, Ukrainian civil war was severe, many civilians were sacrificed in this civil war. According to domestic politics becoming confused, anyone in Ukraine would want to decide the politics in their will. Maybe citizens also thought such a thing in unified local elections. However, this incident occurred. I can easily understand the anger of the high-minded citizens. When important things affecting their future, for example, the election, are run, if playful guys appear, they won't stand. When I looked the beginning of this incident is from the Internet, I still amazed. There is people thinking the stupid thing in any country. Certainly all humorous man isn't bad. People who have humor tends to be a good leader. I think Junichiro Koizumi is a good example. However, the humor at this time is not only just play. I want them to consider their future more. Aside from this topic, Chewbacca is the fellow that act together with the Han Solo of the light side. But I think why you are rooting for Darth Vader of the dark side.  when I read this article, what I thought first was like ""If some Japanese parties pretend to be some character and they do campaign I would definitely go to vote and voting rate must be up"" but in this case, I think they do too much. In another news article, I read that they change their ID for pretending to the character. For example, when Darth Vader went to the election place, he showed ID written ""Darth Ivanovich Vader"" and he was rejected. I also read seven of the Darth Vader's, Yoda and Chewbacca were nominated for parliament by the Internet Party, which champions technological advancement and demands an end to corruption. As I wrote on the top of this comments, it must be good way to attract people but it is difficult to find out how they are serious for politics. Also their face is hidden by their costume, so we cannot see their expression, which is not good for campaign. I love star wars like many people but it does not mean I can support their party. we should think politics and movie are separate.  I couldn't understand this news when I read this so I researched other articles about this news. I was very surprised that Chewbacca was arrested, but was surprised that dozen Vader went for the mayoral election more. Ukraine is a country full of the humor. Having been arrested this time Chewbacca (the man who played the part) of the political party member called Internet Party of Ukraine. On Sunday of the end of last week, an election for mayor is held in the town of Odessa, and it is about the polling place that a thing happened. When Chewbacca comes to the spot by car with storm true par, and a paper is found by a police officer; is a problem occurrence by having been license non-possession. I was arrested saying that I performed a vicious act to refuse a result, the legal question of the police officer and was assigned to fine approximately 900 yen equivalency.  I understand your opinion and I agree. I didn't know that Chewbacca is a character of STAR WARS as you didn't know. If this happen in Japan, Japanese people would think him strange. As you say, disguising oneself as a character of movies or comics has bad effect for election. People should think the meaning of vote for election and consider each candidates deeply before the election. Their manifesto and thinking or behavior will effect the election.  I agree with your opinion. Now, Ukraine is very politically unstable situation. Ukrainians are working seriously to politics. And to be disturb is very unpleasant for them. If you see such a person in Japan's election, ordinary human will get angry. Of course cosplay is not entirely bad. I think that it wants followed in the future as one of entertainment. However, I want them to observe the TPO. Have you ever seen people singing a song and dancing a dance in the polling stations of Japan? Such a person doesn't exist.  I was surprised at this article, too. I also think Chewbacca gathered attention, and people all over the world turned their eyes to Ukraine. Next time, I hope Chewbacca will attract people for good behavior.  I feel so too. When I read the article for the first time, I think that it is a nice joke and it is funny. However, It is true and happen in USA. I think the joke candidates cannot work for USA because they could not win the election themselves and they do these behavior like a joke. That tell us the candidate does not have ability for work. I think we should learn a lot of things because we should vote collect candidate not like a joke candidate.  I think that the election is very important and holy event for the nation. When I was read this article, I felt uncomfortable. I think that the election should guarantee freedom. But a man who dressed as Chewbacca perverted the meaning of freedom. It was a natural consequence that he was arrested. "
JOC JOC-15B-12N 0.8 "Every point criticizing the current capitalism referred in the article deeply impressed me. In reality, in Japan, the poor are now getting poorer, and the rich are now getting richer, say, we all know Japan is in a serious 'depression', which generally makes income gap wider. Though we can see slight inflation nowadays, the situation is still far from good. And, what is more, when it comes to discussing Japanese future generation, we can hardly be optimistic, considering the fact that Japan has a great national debt. Putting the environmental problem aside, we have to think about Japanese economy first. We cannot manage any environmental problem without money.  After I read this article, there are two points that I thought. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market. In such a strained situation, almost all innovators or energy buyers can't afford to switch a new energy source just for the climate problem. Secondly, I thought about Japan. I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. So the poor can be the rich, depending on how much effort you make. However, I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, because the population of Japan is expected to be smaller and we have the problem with immigration. Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. We should be faced with such an issue.  I agree the statement from survey that the poorer get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. I think today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds. Mostly, people with an advanced academic backgrounds get good jobs, so people study hard. However, there are the places where you can receive good education if you pay much money, for example, private colleges, cram schools and so on. Therefore the rich can put their wealth to get good education, and the poor can't. Of course, if you don't have much money to use for education, you have another way to get good jobs. This is only one of many examples. However there is a fact that children who were born in poor family have to work for their family and give up to continue to study. The government must deal with this matter we should not let pass.  When I was a junior high and high school student, I learned about the limit of fossil fuels in this world. I had expected that governments all over the world would solve this problem someday in my heart, but this time, I knew that there were not alternatives to fossil fuels after all. That's why I rethink that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. In addition, I imaged that China only pollute the air with CO2. However that was wrong, and China use resources effectively such as solar energy. Also, Germany and the UK act to reduce greenhouse emissions, so I thought the Japanese should know the fact and start work for reducing CO2 as a member of society on the earth.  I agree with your opinion that everyone around the world should act to reduce CO2 emissions. If the deterioration of the environment goes on, it influences the lives of next generations, in other words, our descendants. I can't stand the situation that my children or grandchild suffer from environmental issues. Therefore we should discuss a lack of awareness on the part of the persons concerned about environmental issues. I think everyone can do something for reducing CO2 emissions with a conscious effort.  I don't agree with Bill Gates's point of view. Indeed, as he says, the private sector may be reluctant to produce effective energy alternatives and doesn't contribute to that. However, I don't think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. Of course, the more CO2 a country emits, the more seriously responsible the country is. The way of thinking is natural. Rich countries have to make an effort to reduce that. Yet, the definition of rich countries is not clear. For example, are rising nations included in them? Although they are not called as rich countries, there will be room for reduction in their CO2 emissions. The climate problem has a big impact on the whole world. So I think all countries, not only rich countries, should cooperative to solve the problem. Then, I think the strongest argument against capitalism is that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. It is difficult to receive an enough education and get a job for the poor. Moreover, income redistribution is necessary, but at the same time, economic growth is important for a country. I think the disparity between the rich and the poor will go on widening in the world.  According to Bill Gates and latest statistics, it is said to be not prevent our earth from global warming under the situation today. In the system of capitalism, the role of companies is to integrate each company's force to pursue their own benefits. Therefore, they don't regard improvement for environment as important thing without the judgment. They only think their self-defense. Certainly, this theory is justice, but even China which was installed capitalism as a fragment of social system is changing their energy system to natural energy. It is too late for the advanced nation like the U. S to change their own thought. They should think ""dismiss the today's benefit, think the future's it"". I hope the change will achieve in the system of capitalism.  In my opinion, all country should share information about pollution. I didn't know that China has surged ahead of the United States of America and European countries in green investment in spite of being polluting country in terms if fossil fuels. China also puts emphasize in solar energy and the decrease of CO2 emissions. The country's action for global warming has worked well. In addition to China, Germany and the United Kingdom has made great success in decreasing greenhouse emissions. I think all country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and imitate action what those countries has been doing. I agree with the idea of Bill Gates that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, so the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. If such countries decide to work for solving the problem, the entire world will change and get better.  I agree with you. After reading the article, I was surprised to know that China has been using resources effectively and other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan is relatively rich country, so the country should begin doing action for the decrease of CO2 emissions as a member of the world community. I hope the condition of the earth to get better as soon as possible.  These days, the gap between the rich and the poor has become one of the most serious problems in the world. Even in Japan, Economic inequality certainly exists. For example, more and more people lose their jobs because of the depression and they have no choice to be on social security for living. Also, it is said that the pension system in Japan seems to collapse in the near future because of aging society. It will be big damage for elderly people. Furthermore, a lot of people who rent student loans when they were university students cannot earn enough money to pay back them. It is because Japanese employment situation is terrible even for those who graduated from four-year universities properly. Moreover, the consumption tax is going to be raised to ten percent from current eight percent. It can be a hard blow to people who are not so rich. In my opinion, Capitalism is an economic system which can make the gap between the rich and the poor larger. As Bill Gates states, the private sector is always thinking their profits, not poor people or the environment in this planet, I think. Also, what is remarkable is that when people in many countries asked if they think the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last, people in Western such as Great Britain, United States of America, and Germany tend to disagree. However, to my surprised, more than half of the people in Asian countries such as India and Thailand answered they agree with this statement. What made them answer so? I guess that almost all the countries in Asia are developing countries. Hence they are able to have a hope toward next generation. Yet, European counties and America are developed countries and probably people living there spend comparatively comfortable lives. However, generally speaking, the world in those days is not good times in good times on a whole. In Japan, after the collapse of overheated stock and real estate markets, the recession has been continued for more than twenty years. Things has become worse and worse. Therefore people in developed countries cannot have a hope to the future. Also there is one more serious problem which must be solved under the corporation of all the human in this world. It is the environmental problem. Since the industry revolution has happened, it goes without saying that the development of the industry can hurt the environment. Because of the dirty air from factories, the cities has been polluted. I must admit that it is essential to make efforts for the development of industry in order to make us richer, but it must not be bad for environment. Too much pollution can kill this planet. As a conclusion, I think it is important to making a lot of products because we can earn money by doing so. But it should be the way where both of poor people and the environment in the Earth aren't be damaged. That's all of my opinion.  I agree with your opinion. I think that in Japan, the rich can become richer and the poor doesn't even have an opportunity to get rich. Similarly, it is difficult that people who have no opportunity to have a good education get rich now. That's why I also think that such a negative circulation would be repeated many times at this rate. Therefore Japanese government should revise its education system. For example, in Finland, there is no gap, so every child can take the same education. The reason is that the Finnish pay high tax on its education. Moreover, children who have a difficulty in studying can receive cares with special education programs. In addition, teachers there don't have to work for a long time compared with Japan, so the teachers can spare their time for preparing to give good lessons. In conclusion, I think that Japanese government should spend its money not on having achievement tests but on students and teachers.  This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. The summary that this article wants to tell is, in short, capitalism as an economic system is bad in a sense. According to this article, capitalism brings the poor which lives in developing countries more poverty. I disagree with this opinion. In my opinion, capitalism brings the poor more fortune. For example, Japanese corporations founded factories in China because they could employ Chinese people in low wages. However, the more Chinese people work in Japanese factories, the richer they become. Eventually, Japanese corporations would pay high wages for Chinese people and leave China. Next, they would found new factories in another developing countries. But another developing countries also will become rich. In this sense, capitalism is not eternal. This article and my opinion have this point in common.  I also think ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"". Because, people who have many money can live comfortably, but people who don't have money cannot live comfortably. Because, people who don't have money cannot make their children go to school. In Japan, many children cannot go to a kindergarten. This is big social problem. The government should solve this problem. And I agree with Bill Gates opinion. I think the rich countries - China, America, and Europe and so on - should solve CO2 emissions. Of course Japan too. But this is very difficult problem. Because it costs very much to decrease CO2. And it will take so much time. According to a news on the Internet, Bill Gates plans to make a nuclear reactor. When I read this article, I thought he contradict himself. He said that the countries should decrease CO2, but he is about to make a things which makes the environment dirty and world dangerous. I cannot believe and understand him. Japanese people knew a danger of a nuclear reactor from Tohoku earthquake. We do not want to have a nightmare.  This article is very difficult for me. When I first read this article, I was surprised to know that China emits CO2 so much and surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. At first, I didn't know Bill Gates. I learned he is an American businessman and found the Microsoft. I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I praised his charity action because he contributes his own money for energy. I agree with his idea that substantial carbon tax is essential for innovators or energy buyers to change energy source. However, economic system is very complexity, so we should think carefully. In the capitalism society, the poor get poor and the rich get richer. I think capitalism is not so good because this system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society, it is very difficult to retrieve his or her former position and return to the community. I think we ought to reconsider about the future energy carefully and suggest the innovatory economic plan in order to succeed in the future. In addition, this problem is an international problem, so people all over the world should consider it carefully and work on together.  I agree with your idea. The gap between rich people and poor people is not good in Japan. We should reconsider the system of capitalism carefully. In addition, energy problem is serious in the world. This is a worldwide problem, so the rich country lead the world, and not only the rich countries but also the poor country discuss and work on together. International cooperation is also important.  I think that Bill's idea is creative and I agree with his thought. Especially, I was impressed by the opinion that rich countries like the US, China and Europe have to solve the climate problem. Climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan. For these countries, economic development is priority over climate problem. On the contrary, this means climate problem will be solved if these countries make an effort saving CO2. Now, capitalism re-think these problem.  I agree with idea that rich country like China, Europe, America has to solved the environmental problem. But it is not only rich countries problem. Of course, some climate problem is caused by these countries including Japan. However only rich countries efforts are short-handed. All of the world should make an effort to decrease CO2. I was surprised to know that he spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. People should make an effort to wrestle environmental problem not to say Bill Gates. And the problem that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer is there in Japan too. For example, there are people who haven't problem for entering college and who have problem for entering college in class because there are poverty and wealth in these parents. Possibly compared with world poverty and wealth, Japanese poverty and wealth is not particularly serious problem. But in fact, a middle-class family became gradually a lower-class family in Japan. Japanese government should take steps to deal with poverty and wealth problem and environmental problem.  I have heard Bill Gates but I didn't know him. I agree his idea that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. In Japan, a sign of the CO2 reduction was put up by the Kyoto Protocol, but we haven't achieved the aim yet. Thermal power generation is still a main generation method. generation using a natural energy is difficult from cost and the problem of the place. However, the improvement of system which a great capitalist like Bill Gates can invest in generation is important one of the solution to this problem.  I agree with your opinion. In Japan, it is true that the poor get poorer, and poor families are always in the negative chain, I feel. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who lives in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows, and so on.  China is a country which is developing now, but therefore China has many problems about environment such as Co2, air pollution, pm2. 5. I really agree with Gates's argument. I think the man who has power like him should say his opinion because it will change the individual mind in the world for CO2 problems effectively. In addition to my opinion, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, also have a power that the change the individual mind in the world. His opinion is enough effective, I think.  I disagree with the opinion that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. It is fact that the poor get poor. However it is not impossible for the poor to be rich. There is the way how the poor become rich. For example it is a certified public accountant. You can take a certified public accountant examination anytime. In other words you can take the examination even if you do not graduate from a high school and a university. Generally, if you are rich, you can receive a good education. Regardless of educational background, Anyone can challenge it. To be rich, the poor have to study harder than the rich. If you make efforts and have strong will, you can fulfill your dream. Even if you are poor, there is not dreams that you can not fulfill. The rich tend to waste their money. Since they have much money, they can take a good education. and enter the first-class university. I think that it is important to invest property in their own dreams. It makes no sense if they can not manage money well. In this way, the thought that ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" is wrong. I hope that the poor will spend rich life. In capitalism economy, society should be formed to protect the weak.  I understand the climate change is a big problem in the world now. My image of Bill Gates is very smart. He says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change because the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. I agree with his opinion. To produce effective energy will need a lot of costs. Now, CO2 emission became a serious problem in the world, also in Japan. Few years ago, the Japan government announced the target figure about CO2 emission but in real, we could not limit the emission. This is difficult to solve. I think also the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. The rich countries such as China and the US and Europe should think about climate change deeply.  I agree with Bill Gates' perception about capitalism and money in the future. Certainly, as we can see, capitalism and countries that introduced capitalism have succeeded to rule the most of the world. They, or to say ""we""?, have exploited the poorer and ignored their condemnation. In the middle-east, The innocent citizens are bombed and killed by many rich countries just because of their selfish will that they need oil power and right to keep their QOL average. They also cause damage and make earth cry so that abnormal climate changes and phenomenon happen recently. We should seriously consider about saving energy and source that scarcely exist on earth. Some associations and NGOs are making efforts but the top of the world doesn't correctly serve its main function. The world is always in someone's hand and under minority's envy. There is a notion so called minimalist, and I strongly believe that we must give a shot on it. We also should invent new technology that saves energy for green environment.  I agree with Bill Gate's opinion. The climate problem must be solved by the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. They have to take the lead in reducing carbon emissions. And since I had an strong image of China as the polluting country, I was very surprised to know China had surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment. And I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. For example, it costs much money to give children a good education. An well educated person could get a better paying job. Moreover when we start a business, we are required a capital. Sadly the rich have more chances to make money than the poor. I can accept the fact that most developed countries were also less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement ""the next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". But I think there is more room for prospering in developing countries.  I agree with your opinion that China has many problems. Pm2. 5 flows from China to Japan. I think we face a crisis of climate change. So I agree with Gate's ideas. Private sectors are very important for climate.  I understand what Bill Gates was trying to say, but the world is under the system of capitalism for now and we have to seek ways to improve. Nothing will be solved if you criticize. However, it is true that developed countries are not doing enough and I think it is because people do not feel a sense of crisis. In fact, we are not having troubles or difficulties to lead our lives. I agree with the voices of surveys in the article. I also felt that countries with large populations should take the initiative to solve the environmental problem. Now, as discussed in the article, developed countries not only act in a corrupted manner but also help developing countries to become like them. For example, they introduce how to exploit a vast area in developed countries. We should find a way to coexist with nature.  I agree with your idea. Even in Japan, there are still gaps between the rich and the poor, and there are some problems of social security. If we lose our job, it is difficult to back to the previous job. In addition, there are many problems of elderly people such as pension, medical services, nursing services, and also problems of young people such as child-rearing support. For example, the problems of a waiting children on the list, early-education and so on. Moreover, these days, the Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said the Consumption Tax will be raised to 10% in April 2017. Consumption Tax is related to our dairy life, so we cannot be avoided and passed by sidestepped confusion. However, I think the increase of consumption tax is necessary. There are some reasons. First, until now, consumption tax has been covered half of the social security expenses, so if the consumption tax will be increased, the raising income of tax increased will be used for the stabilization of social security. That is to say, the tax increase will make our life better. The second reason is that the raising income of tax increased will make tax revenue become stable, so this will be connected to the Japanese economic growth. Comparing with other country, Japanese consumption tax is not so high. For example, Sweden, Denmark, Norway's consumption tax is 25% and this is the highest rates in the world. In addition, The Korea and China's consumption tax is higher than Japan. From these reasons, I think Japan should raise consumption tax. As this article shows, there are some environment problems such as dirty air and industrial pollution in the world. I also think not only the rich country but also the poor country ought to consider these problems and think the best way for the earth in the future.  I was impressed with your opinion. It is true that we need to prepare money before thinking about what we can do with environmental issues. However, I do not have any ideas to help poor people getting poorer. The system gets so complex and even charity activities are not reliable. People has no or a little interest to each other and you might not notice if your neighbor dies alone. I think we need to fix not only the system but also the way people feel. I think reaching to a world where people can compassionate towards others is the closest way to solve any of worldwide issue.  I think that we must not use fossil fuels. Because, fossil fuels is limit. And if we generate electricity by electricity with fossil fuel, then it exhausts carbon dioxide in large quantities. So, we should use green energy. Green energy has various kinds: solar energy and wind power or etc. . . But it costs much money to diffuse it. The future biggest problem will be a problem of the money. Therefore, Bill Gates contributed much money is very awesome thinking. I do not contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money. I will spend all money for oneself. However, he gave away all his money to charity. What is he going to do by the charity? I expect that he helps for making new energy. As well as it, he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide. Increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem. Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. We must stop the rise in temperature immediately. To that end, I hope that people thinking about society than oneself increase more. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment.  I think that the idea which the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies is right too. That's because I knew that there are children who cannot study enough due to poor in Japan through the TV program. Their family have to use their money for the livelihood, so they cannot use for the education. And, the children probably should work to live instead of studying for examination to enter universities. So, they cannot study enough and get a job with enough money. That is the vicious circle. We should break the circle. Otherwise, the gap between rich and poor become more and more spread. I would like Japanese government to make the useful plan to eliminate the disparities.  I agree with your opinion. I also learned about the limit of fossil fuels, when I was a junior high and high school student. And the problem about CO2 emission is so serious. If the counties which emit much green gas emissions should not reduce it, the global warming will progress more and more. China and other countries should use resources effectively such as solar energy. And we Japanese also should reduce the CO2 emissions and make efforts to solve the environment problems.  I agree with your opinion in the point that all countries should cooperative to solve the problem about CO2 emissions. When I saw the date about CO2 emissions, the US and China occupy 50% rate of all emissions in the world. However, China is not a developed country, so it is difficult to regulation. Even so, China should make an effort to reduce the CO2 emissions to solve this problem. We have to conceive the way how people of various positions agree with the issue. For that, I'd like to focus on the movement of each country.  I agree with your opinion. I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy too. In the spring semester, we learned the news about the Picasso's picture. In that, we thought the how the rich should use their money. There are many ways, however, his act is one of the respectful ways. I think, the idea the poor get poor and the rich get richer in the capitalism society is right. So, the rich should have a broad vision, and conceive the poor and the whole society.  I agree with Bill Gates. It is because that the global environment is serious now. How to deal with environmental pollution is a serious matter. You wrote that I had a strong image of China as the polluting country. I thought that too. China's image is very bad. There is very much quantity of China's exhaust gas. If thought of China does not change, the environmental problem is not solved. You think that the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist system. It is true. But, I think that it is good. Because, the person does not grow up in the society that everybody is equal. If a person changed the social origin into does not appear, the earth will decline. In other words you should make a genius even if there is the difference. Because Nietzsche of a famous philosopher says, I think this to be right.  I agree with Bill Gates' opinion about capitalism in the future. Now, unusual climate change and global warming and so on are a big problem all over the world. In the past, the US , the UK,Japan and others put national economic growth before the global environment. These countries did not completely take a global view of the environment. In the result, abnormal climate changes are more serious year by year. So, I think the order of priority of this issue is high. Also, when I read this article, I was quite expected that China has surged ahead of the U. S. and Europe in green investment despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. And, I also think the poor get poorer and rich get richer in capitalist economy. This problem may be a natural consequence in capitalism. But, if the government do not stop the vicious downward spiral caused by the gap widening society, the gap between the rich and the poor will widens more and more. I think the education gap is especially very serious matter. Japanese government should cope with these problems to preserve capitalism and global environment.  I agree with you. The system of capitalism that the poor get poorer and rich get richer may be natural result. But, the Japanese government should seek the improvement of the social security system to stop to widen the gap between the richer and poorer. And, the energy problem is serious all over the world. Not only rich countries but poor countries should cooperate in dealing with this issue in the future.  I agree with your opinion. Recently in Japan, it is true that the poor gets poor and poor families are always in the negative chain. This serious situation in Japan is far from good, so everyone who live in Japan should think about this problem so deeply, and involve the Japanese government in this issue. I think Japanese people are one of the kindest and the most merciful people in the world, so they can think the problem as if it was his or her own one. Also, I felt that I should have also think about this problem deeply, and wanted to discuss it with my family, my friends, my future fellows.  The environment problem is very serious in 21 century. Global warming is becoming more and more serious and the air consistence of CO2 is increasing from a long time ago, so we have to stop global warming. To stop global warming, I think it is important to develop clean energy because most of CO2 emissions comes from fossil fuel. We burn it and get gasoline, fuel oil, and also. Also we create energy from thermal power generation using fossil oil it is also discharge CO2. To use clean energy, it means we can stop to discharge these many CO2. This the most important I think. A weak point of clean energy is difficult to control volume of generate of electric but recently storage battery's technology is very progressed so we can solve this problem in near future I think. The cooperation between nations is also important. Last month COP21 was held in Paris and all over the countries made effective agreement about decreasing discharge of CO2 emissions. The point of this agreement, not only advanced countries but also developing countries have duty for decreasing CO2 emissions. From now, how decrease it from developing countries is very important for stop to global warming, also advanced countries support need for developing countries. We have to make efforts to stop global warming.  I agree with the new survey: the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. In Japan, children in upper income family can go to cram schools, then they can enter high level schools through to university. Finally, they can get jobs in major company such as banks, trading firms and insurance companies. However, children in lower income family are hard to get such opportunities. Thus, this gap is brought by bap in education. Richer people should offer financial aid for lower income families to narrow the gap in education.  I disagree with your opinion. Surely, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get better wages than before. However, I think that they cannot become the real ""rich"". Because although employee's wage get better, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Additionally, during those period the rich would get richer. Thus, poor employee cannot catch up with the rich people.  I agree with you. Income sometimes depends on whether we gave an enough education. Ironically, whether we can give an enough education depends on our parents' income. So, income disparity influences next generation. It needs money to give a enough education in order to be rich.  I agree with your idea. It is true that Capitalism has large merits, for example everyone has chances to get money and be richer and people who make effort have high possibility to reward . But I think that this theory has not practiced. In fact, many employers use employees for a long time without break. Employers hire people low money, or do not pay their wages at the appropriate day. I often read these news in news paper . Originally, capitalism is a theory that every one has chances to get richer but in this economy there is no equality that everyone has chances . People who has educated well tend to get money and be richer. So I think we should take another look at this theory.  I agree with the fact that capitalism, especially its competition makes benefits, improve our life. However, in the matter of environment, capitalism does not go well. If each country progress, the environment becomes worse. All countries and peoples want to get better life. So, we should think the meaning of ""progress "" and ""development "" again. We should not want materialistic development. We should hope the progress of QOL, peace of mind and environment. Change the direct of target in this capitalistic world.  As you pointed out, ""powerful"" people like Bill Gates should express their thoughts about environmental problems. They will have a greater impact on many people around the world than ordinary people like us will do. Campaigns like such should be held more to solve environmental problems.  I was surprised at two points when I read this article at first. First, I was surprised at the fact about capitalism. Bill Gates says that private sectors or individual can't solve energy problems, so big rich companies like his should deal with the problems. To be frank, I was a bid sad to be said such a thing. I believed that the criminal person who makes danger climate change was everybody in the world, so everybody was responsible to solve the problem and had to cooperate. Certainly, it may cost much money to reduce CO2 emissions and find new energy source and we can't create such a great deal of money. However, no matter what anyone says, I want to join to the approach and play a part as a member of the world. Second, I got a scare to China's green investment. I had known the fact that the deal of China CO2 emission is the most in the world, but I not known about China's act. Japanese including me often say that China pollutes our Asia and world irresponsibility because we don't know China's solar project well. I think Japanese should reflect on their past conduct and follow China's investment as the developed country.  Hi! I found some point that I agree and not agree. "" I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" - I agree with this opinion too. As an issue that we are familiar with, many super market introduce ""ECO point"". In this system, you can get some point when you use ECO bag. This system have something in common with a substantial carbon tax. I think this is good for incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" Now we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism, I think. Capitalism is an economy system that is made up of making a large quantity of cheap goods in developing countries and selling in developed countries. However, as wages are being raised in developing countries these days, the advantage of price is lost, and then products will not be able to compete on the world market. "" - I agree with your thinking about capitalism, but I cannot agree with"" the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism"". As wages are being raised in developing countries these days, developed countries can find new larger market abroad. For example, Japanese companies of communications business aim at expansion for South America to establish a communications infrastructure in developing country. Thus, capitalism enters a new phase, and is growing now. "" I don't think that the poor are getting poor in Japan, because in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. "" - I cannot agree with it. I think that Japan is still a society where educational record counts for a lot. Certainly, we can receive a scholarship, but there is a large difference between the people who is rich and enters a top-flight company and who is poor and is blue color worker for a life time. "" I can't be optimistic about the next generation's future in Japan, Especially population problem is serious, because the production-age population has been aging, and the young population has been decreasing. "" - I agree with your opinion so much. I think that young people including us must think about this problem seriously. We should make positive efforts to participate in politics. Bill Gates says that capitalism cannot save us from climate change View Post I agree with your idea. The time when we concentrate on materialistic progress has ended. Now we have enough food and live in our homes safely and welfare is set minutely, so we should think about the quality of rights and equality. It is said that our country is peace and order , but we have a lot of problems about order, for example , aging society has progressed rapidly and institutions that the old come in are in short . As a result, the young who works at these institutions resorts to violence. Can we say the world which the young wounded the old peaceful? The answer is No. I think that this situation should change into both of generations cooperate with to solve problems that this world stands . This thinking also applies to the problem of environment. The developed countries for example USA , Australia, and Japan and so on has developed enough and has high technology. So if they decide not to use coals or heat power plant , we can make electricity by using another ways. On the other hand, developing countries for example India , South America , and so on do not have enough technology and money . If they decide not to use plants or machines that emit carbon dioxide, they will not make enough electricity to move factory. As I have stated above, developing countries are different from developed countries in money and technology. So we should pay attention to these differences thinking about environmental problems I strongly disagree with your opinion. How can you say the more Chinese Japanese companies hire in their factories in China, the richer they become?Is the increase in the number of labor working there directly make their wage raised?I don't think so. Even if they get higher wage thanks to invested capital, we cannot overestimate the effect to be so great that China would drive Japanese factories out. The relationship between China and Japan describes as labor and capital will never change in that way. The chances are that Chinese corporations make good use of advanced technology imported from Japan to China, and benefit more efficiently. But I don't think the effect like you pointed out in your comment would happen. So I don't think the capitalism today will function in the way you mentioned.  This article is too difficult for me to understand. But after I read this article, I have two thoughts of my own. First, I agree with Bill Gates's opinion. I think that we have reached the limit of growth in capitalism. That system is an economy system. Capitalism is the economic policy that established an important point in that people can make money by anyone by power of money and the resource freewheelingly without being disturbed in violence and social position. In other words, it is that capitalist and a person from company own a means of production and are the economic system which they let a worker work for their profit pursuit and produce. But these days, wages are tend to raising in developing countries. Then products will not be able to compete on the market all over the world. So, I think that almost innovators and energy buyers can't afford to turn a energy source that is using now to a new one because of climate change. Secondly, I think that the economic disparity opens and also think that ""the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"". These days, Japan is gap-widening  society. In addition, the difference is spreading and immobilizing. A parent is a person of upper class, their child tends to be a adult of upper class, and a parent is a person of down class, their child tends to be a adult of down class. If a parent is wealthy class, it is possible to employ a tutor and let their child go to the private supplementary school. And the child masters good results at school and advances to the first-class university and finds a job in the first-class company and earns money, and become wealthy class. If a parent is the poor, it is impossible to let their child go to school, especially a private school. Of course they cannot absolutely let their child go to the private supplementary school and employ a tutor. Then the child will fall into an education shortage, and will not be able to find a job in the good company, and become the poor. The true problems of the gap-widening  society are immobilization of the income gap and immobilization of the hierarchies of a high income earner and the low-income person. The society that can support to the person who wants to find a job is an ideal. It is thought that there is room for the examination as for the system that the person who can make an effort can acquire higher qualifications in a shorter term. I think the society which supports the person who has motivation and makes an effort, even if the number of age is how many, even if trouble visits is ideal. But now, Japan is gap-widening  society. So, I think that the government should cooperate with the company and the local, and support the person who does the best. For example, in elementary school and junior high school, small class should be realized. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. In that way, regardless of a domestic income level, opportunity that receive high quality education will be expanded. For the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared.  I agree with your opinion. As you say, the the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics and the economic disparity opens. If parents have a lot of money, they can let their child go to the private supplementary school and let he or she go to the private school. Conversely, if parents are poor, they cannot let their child receive education enough. I think that we must cut off this negative chain of disparity. There are two points that I consider it as the method that I solve this problem. First, regardless of a domestic income level, for expanding opportunity that any children receive high quality education the small class should be realized in elementary school and junior high school. If small class will increase, children can learn deeply. The tuition of a public high school and the public university should be slashed. If the tuition will be cheap, poor children will be easy to get an education. Secondly, for the member of society, vocational training should be expanded by unemployment insurance and an unemployment policy. And the program of the comeback to normal life should be arranged. I wish the problem will be solved and the gap between the rich and the poor will be disappeared.  I am agreeable for this article. Capitalism supports modern society, and it is certain that I contributed to development. In addition, I may not deny that a developed country and a big company sweep over the world using technology and economic power. Depending on capitalism, it is modern times, the present age in this way that I progressed. However, it is modern times, the present age that I get rid of an underdeveloped country and a worker while it progresses like that. Besides, I sacrificed it to existing various things on the earth. Nature, human relations, everything including the fuel is lost. As for the damage to give naturally so that it is touched by an article, awful. Agreements such as the carbon footprint business are concluded, and discharge is limited, and a sign of the improvement appears. However, human relations show adverse effects of the capitalism. The connection of a person and the person was abundant and valued the connection before. The human being exists as an individual, and the connection is thin now. It may be said that this is the worst event that capitalism brought. There may be us at a good opportunity to review capitalism.  I disagree with your opinion. Certainly, in Japan, a social security system like welfare is prepared. But we can not supplement by it, so the poor get poorer and the rich get richer.  I agree with you. I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics too. Your statement that today's society attaches important to academic backgrounds aroused sympathy from me. In my opinion, the family finances influence children's academic background directly. If parents have much money, they could put their money into children's future by getting children taking private lessons and acquiring culture. As a result, children have much education. The following is illustrate what I think. Almost students of university of Keio have high adjusted deviation score. Everyone can't enter university of Keio. Students made efforts to enter it. I think the thing that supported them most is their parents. Of course, their parents cheered up them and made delicious dish for them. However, it was sure that the family finances contributed to their high adjusted deviation score most. Therefore, students maybe grew up in rich family. On the contrary, it isn't easy for children who grew up in poor family to enjoy high-quality education because they couldn't have the chance that they could learn something except school, for example cram school and swimming school. If you were born in rich family, it is easy for you to enjoy high-quality education. However, if you were born in poor family, it isn't easy for you to receive it. This circle is comfortable for rich people, but for poor people, it is just vicious circle. Unless the government stems this circle, rich people may get richer and poor people get poorer. I think the most important point in case of pursuing policies against this circle is whether poor people enjoy the blessings of them. It is no use that only rich people really feel the blessings of them. Actually, it takes a lot of times to get to benefaction to poor people, but if the government think about the future of the people and country seriously, I think it is valuable to invest a lot of times and money. I hope every child could enjoy high-quality education and my country become more affluent.  The argument of Bill Gates is very interesting for me, because I am taking the natural science class in which I discuss the environmental and energy-technological matter with my classmates. In my opinion, the capitalism regarding environment comes to a turning point. In days go by, economy consisted of mass production and mass consumption, and companies needed to contribute to the prevention of the destruction of environment as they can possible in their production. In other words, the main point was thoroughly the production activity and the protection of green was secondary. But, now we have no choice but realize the limitation of capitalism, as Bill Gates and the public surveys pointed out. We must turn the direction toward the combination of economy and environment. We must think about them at the same time, as ""greenery production"". For example, there suggested ""emission right"" in the recent national business. The country which failed to achieve certain mark must pay money to ""buy"" the emission right from the one which succeeded. This system is exactly capitalistic, and environmental trade. In addition, I think it is possible for consumers to make companies contribute to the protection of environment well, such as volunteering and making less CO2 emissions. If they start to buy the eco-products as priority, thanks to the principle of market, the companies might also start to focus on them competitively. So we can improve the present situation made by capitalism, using the capitalism itself. Of course this is very difficult plan to achieve because the present economy system relying on fossil soil cannot change quickly. But I think we must to do so in the long run in order to do with the limited natural resources in the future.  I think that modern capitalism reached to meet its demise. First of all, modern capitalism was formed in the 19th century's Industrial revolution period. But we can say that modern capitalism is not a perfect system. We can say it by looking at Russian Revolution in 1917. Modern capitalism is a system capitalists who have the tools of produce hire laborers to produce products. But profits by producing is monopolized by capitalists. So, the gulf between laborers and capitalists get deeper and deeper. And progress of globalization, the scale of market expanded to the whole world over. Therefore, present modern capitalism system can't catch up with the change of economy in recent years. Now that things have come to this pass, the gap between rich and poor. So, we should think alternative economical system that can be everyone equal.  I have a different idea. Some developing countries such as India or China are occupying high rates of the entire CO2 emission of the whole world. So they are also responsible for the improvement to some extent. And, I think what is important for the future energy is ""energy mix"", using both natural resources and thermal, nuclear ones. Every energy has each good points or bad points. So we must use them effectively.  I like Bill Gate's word in this sentence very much. It is ""The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else. "" In recent years, global warming has become a world problem. And global warming is interlinked with climate change because global warming changes the patterns of the weather world-wide. Climate change can cause serious problems for wild animals. Furthermore, it has a significant impact on food production. Concern for these climate change problems has been growing in recent years on a global scale. Therefore, the issue of global warming is important on a global scale and must be addressed over the long-term. So, it is crucial to support measures taken by rich countries to cope with climate change. Have people in rich countries ever thought about global warming? Climate change is a global problem and they live in a global environment. This is because tackling climate change and living of people must be compatible. Therefore, I felt that every single person must reconsider global warming. For example, if people wear cooler clothes in their offices during the summer, they can turn down their air-conditioners and, as a result, help to reduce global warming. So, It is very important that deepening the understanding of the general public concerning the current situation of global warming and the importance of global warming countermeasures.  I agree with your opinion. I think climate problem must be solved by developed countries, the countries discharging a large amount of carbon dioxide. However, the developed countries do not want to cooperate with the developing countries very much. In addition to this, there are the problems created in the international community by the differences between developed countries and developing countries. Both of them are worldwide important matters. Moreover, measures against poverty problems and widening income inequality are insufficient. So, a global crisis requires a global solution. I am sure the developing world and the developed world can solve climate change problem and economic disparity by helping each other. And it is very important thing for people of developed countries to think what they can do in order to help people of developing countries.  I understood your theory. However, I do not know if I agree with you. I think, the really poor can not have the will that they want to study in order to enter the university. The poor you assume are who enter the university by using the scholarship. But, there are children who must work to live. Of course, they have their dream and they might want to learn. As a practical matter, however, there are families can not live by their own income. As you said, the opinion that the poor can be rich is also the fact. However, that need their strong will and lack. For example, they need monetary aid and understanding of the surrounding. Compared to it, the rich can be rich easier. Both of the poor and the rich have opportunities, but it is never equal. So, I think, the opinion that ""The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" is right on the whole.  I'm opposed to your opinion. Of course, I think it is important that the person who has power like Bill Gates say his or her opinion. However, I wonder it's just enough. I think it is important that more people advocate. About China's environment problems, I agree with your opinion. The environment problems that China is facing are serious and varied, and are large in scale. With the economic growth, resources and energy consumption has rapidly increased to create environmental problems. So, each of Chinese people must strive to solve the country's environmental problems. And it seems to be important for Japan to utilize its technological capabilities, its experience in dealing with energy and environmental problems, and so forth to contribute to resolving the issues that China is facing.  I disagree with your opinion. There is some truth in what you say. However capitalism is not eternal but circular. Once upon a time China was called 'the world's factory'. Corporations founded factories to seek cheap labor. China developed temporally, but when companies left China for other countries to seek cheaper labor, China began to decline gradually. When Chinese workforce became cheaper, corporations founded factories again. In this way the capitalism circulates around the world.  I think this article is so difficult. Before I read it, I wonder the title of it. Why the capitalism cannot save us from climate change? I do not know the meaning. But, I sympathized this sentence. ""The poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. "" I think this means the bad side of capitalist economies. The capitalism has two kinds of people. These are capital and labor. A capital is the leader of his company and it is under the command of him. So, of curse capitals are the rich and labors are the poor. This happens the difference of people and society. The presidents of their companies hope they will become bigger and advance into foreign market. I think this causes climate change. Most of big companies may influence the environment of the earth. By the way, I was surprised at the fact of surging ahead of China's green investment. My impression of China is many population and terrible air pollution. In contrast to my thoughts, China is going ahead with the construction of power stations of solar. To stop greenhouse gas emission, I think the best mean is the change of the source of fuels. For example, there are solar power generation system, hydraulic power generation geothermal power generation and so on. Solar power generation is the most efficient generation and so low cost. I like it and many families in the world try to install it on their houses' roof. This helps cutting off their cost of electricity and stopping global warming. I think more countries and families should introduce it.  I agree with your opinion. I think all countries should share information about pollution too. For example, I have had a image which China is country wasting energy. However, in reality, China has been using resources effectively. If I don't read this article, I will not know the truth forever. In addition, I was surprised that other country such as Germany and the United Kingdom has been working for reducing CO2 emissions. Japan also should emulate these countries. I hope that many countries have the consciousness which make it eco-friendly and we can live not to harm the earth. Although the environment problem is very serious in 21 century, this situation was created by people. So, it is necessary for us to take responsibility. The policy of the country is important , but each person's consciousness is more important. Let's cooperate together so that a global environment improves! Bill Gates is right, and I think that the capitalism destroys environment. The company which is driven by production in the capitalism demands a profit. The company produces a large quantity of products to get a profit and originates the latest product in sequence again and distributes it. Speed to release a new product in the world increases year by year in the present age and the energies consumed to suffer from production continue increasing. In this situation it is obvious that energy of the earth dries up. Should I remember Japanese traditional mind ""saving""and ""mottainai"" now? And the construction of the system of the really sustainable economy that is not capitalism and not communism will be necessary.  I disagree with your opinion. Although, investment gives opportunity for employment and employee get higher wages than past. However, I think that they cannot become the genuine ""rich"". Because even though employee's wage get higher, they would not get extremely high wages or get a chance to take office as president. Moreover, during those period the rich would get wealthier. In addition, poor employee cannot catch up with the wealthy people. By looking at these point, the gap between rich and poor expands more and more.  The world cooperates these days to reduce greenhouse gas to stop the progress of the global warming. Two methods called cap and trade and the baseline credit were adopted in the Kyoto Protocol. This method was concrete and effective left splendid results in Germany and Japan. After Copenhagen meeting of COP15 and Mexican meeting of COP16, developing countries and developed countries set the target of the greenhouse gas reduction and were on agreement afterwards. The world finally became one and became able to solve the issue of global warming that swung between many developed countries which were going to control the emission of the greenhouse gas and developing countries to give priority to economic development. I think that there are many people who insist that global warming is progressing and we must stop it in spite of there being such actions of world nations. They only worry people. We should not sound an alarm bell of the global warming and first of all should check world actions to global warming and think about solutions. Sadly in spite of such a world action, the quantity of carbon dioxide emission continues increasing. The private sectors surely causes the global warming as Bill Gates said. It is difficult to make them reduce the quantity of the CO2 emission of the private sector while interest exists. I think that the government should intervenes in a private sector and make numeric data visible, then concrete ways to reduce emissions of the CO2 of the private sector can be found. I think that to grope for concrete solutions than to criticize the current capitalist system is very constructive. ""A majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies"" this article said. It is surely certain that some people have vast property in capitalist society. However, do the Japanese citizens have the impression that more and more people suffering from life because of poverty? I don't have and maybe most of people don't have because social welfare system is established well. Switzerland of the first place on well-being ranking is the same. I think that it becomes a key to get rid of a gap between the poor and the rich to establish social welfare systems well.  The problem written by this article is one of the most important problems now at all over the world. The problem argued very intensely in COP21. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one. When establishing a reduction target, a developing nation would consider a supply source of the new energy for growth. I think it can develop into the environment financially well when doing that.  The climate change assumes gradually a serious aspect. There is a lot of argument about this problem, and many of countries are coming to grips with it. However, it is taking a great deal of times to improve. Even if some countries make an effort to solve the climate change, it does not mean if other countries do not cooperate to solve together. Nevertheless, I know developing countries need energy sources to be developed their own economy, but we will lose both principal and interest if people will not be able to live on earth by the climate change because of the destruction of an environment. Many countries are inflicting damage to the environment for a profit and expansion of countries. However, the more people inflict damage the environment, the more life of the earth are shortening. Bill Gates said that especially China, the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, but Japan also has to work together to save the earth and our living as one of the developed countries. In addition, it announced that Bill Gates spend two billion dollars of his own wealth on green energy, and he insisted that an individual investors is the very helpful people to solve the problem. It is not a duty, but I hope any investors to fellow him, and I thought it is great that he leads actively from the front to settle of a problem.  I agree with the idea that capitalist, like Bill Gates, try to make environment better positively. There are many problems like not only global warming but also the shortage of resources. For thousands of years, the population of the world increased gradually. Then, in the middle nineteenth century, the world's population started to rise rapidly. In the 100 years between 1830 and 1930, the population of the world grew from 1 billion to 2 billion people. By 1960, just thirty years later, the world's population had hit 3 billion. Fifteen years later, the population reached 4 billion. Then, a mere eleven years later, there are 5 billion people on earth. In 1999, we passed the 6 billion mark. Today, the world's population grows by 76 million people every year. By the year 2050, researchers predict that the population of the world will be 9.1 billion. Does the earth have the natural resources to support this many people? Unfortunately, the answer tooth's question depends on information we do not have. For example, we do not know how people will choose to live in the future. We do not know what their standard of living will be. We also do not know what new technologies will be available in future. We do know that the Earth's natural resources are limited. Fresh water, for example, is crucial for health and food production. However, more than 97% of the water on Earth is salt water, which is poisonous to both people and crops. Only 3% of the water on Earth is fresh water, and three quarters of that fresh water is frozen at the North and South Poles. Today, the demand for fresh is greater than the supply in roughly eighty countries around the world. By 2025, scientists predict that forty eight countries will have chronic shortages of water. At present, desalinization, or the removal of salt from salt water, is not a solution to the shortage of fresh water. Intakes a lot of energy to remove the salt from ocean water, and that makes the desalinization process very expensive. The amount of land we can use to produce food is also limited. Today, roughly 11% of the land on Earth can be used for crops, while another 20% is available for raising animals. Each year, however, more this land is lost as cities grow and roads stretch across the land. In addition, over cultivation has already damaged an amount of farmland equal to the size of the United States and Canada combined. It is impossible to increase the amount of farmland, but only a little. Some farmland can be more productive if people start using different farming methods, but this will not increase worldwide production very much. Clean air is another important natural resource. However, it too is Threatened by the growing population. The average person today puts about 1.1 metric tons of carbon into the atmosphere each year. Most of it comes from burning fossil fuels, gasoline, coal, oil, wood, and natural gas. Scientist say that the amount of carbon dioxide (CO2) in the air is already 18% higher than it was in 1960. What effect would 3 billion more people have on the air we breathe? While we have many different sources of energy, there is a limited supply of many of them. Today, most of the world's energy comes from three non-renewable resources, petroleum, natural gas, and coal. Three quarters of this energy is used by developed countries. As the standard of living goes up in other countries, so will the demand for the energy. Some scientists predict that if everyone in the world lived like an American, our fossil fuel supply would last for just fifteen more years. Clearly, the number of people that the Earth can support in the future will depend on many things. The Earth may be able to support 9 billion people, but what will their standard of living be? And what effect will all these people have on the environment? In this situation, each people should do his best to protect our environment and Capitalist's action can be key to achieve this purpose especially, I think.  I think that capitalism cannot save us from climate change. I think of this theme these days and we have to think about this problem. I think that capitalism is too much in one sense. First, in capitalism, to provide anything and to use anything last forever and the term 'Mottainai' was disregarded as nonsense. And capitalism was not sustainable and company must earn money and the result was decided by the money one earned. All the value was judged according to money. This pattern of capitalism always lead to the destruction of nature. To get wood and the place for cultivating land, people cut the forest and the evolution of modern world was connected with the destruction of nature. Capitalism break the traditional value and disregard this as cheap. Mass consumption is regarded as the value. Commodity was thrown away if it don't work well. People who live in modern world don't repair and don't have the thought to use anything over and over again. This is connected to the destruction of nature. Because this cause the mass consumption. The more People uses the money, the company can get more money and this is the characteristic of capitalism. I think that nature and capitalism cannot coexist. . So let's look at the meaning of capitalism. ' an economic system in which investment in and ownership of the means of production, distribution, and exchange of wealth is made and maintained chiefly by private individuals or corporations, especially as contrasted to cooperatively or state-owned means' It just illustrates the system. But we have to think abut the capitalism. Does capitalism made people happier? Are there no people who cry by the problem of money? So now is the time to use Mottainai to pass on beautiful earth to next generation and create a beautiful world.  At first, I can't understand this article well. This article was a little difficult for me to understand. I'll write about some points picked up from this article. First, I'm going to talk about the statement of Bill Gates. I found that I agree with him, and also disagree with him. The point that I agree is that a substantial carbon tax may encourage innovators or energy buyers to start working for carbon dioxide emission reduction. He said, "" Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" This may be right. For sure, a carbon dioxide emission is still big. So imposing a new tax on CO2 emission can be an effective way to decrease it. On the other hand, the point I disagree is that the problem of CO2 emission should be solved in the rich countries. Of course, developed countries are responsible for the climate problems. That is the fact we cannot doubt. But, only developed countries can't solve the problems. They should be tackled all over the world. The example is measures to illegal destruction of forests in the Amazon. In this way, there are problems which can't be solved in only rich countries. Second, I'm going to talk about the capitalism. This article said the capitalism is criticized by two sources, Bill Gates and a new survey showing that the public have doubts about capitalism as well. The former did from the viewpoint of environmental protection and the latter did from the viewpoint of economy in the world. I described the former in previous paragraph. So I think about the latter. In this capitalistic economy, in fact, the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. This phenomenon is to be generated by all means in the capitalistic world. But the poor isn't necessarily continuing to be poor. The poor have a chance to be rich. To do so, the poor will have to be educated more. The rich have to support the system the poor get proper education. Then, I think the compliant about the capitalism will decrease. This article mentioned two attack for capitalism. It is very difficult to consider what the capitalism should be. Is the capitalism good for us, or bad for us? I think the capitalism is good, but should be improved. From this article, the compliant was appeared, so we should tackle to make capitalism better.  I believe that developed countries' government had better try to shift economic fabric of society without fossil fuels little by little. However, I think we must try to shift non-carbon  life in order to not solve global warming but keep the level of our life for a long time. The leaders of developed countries these days realize that global warming is big problem. On the other hand, the leaders have not made sufficient solutions for stopping global warming. However, is global warming really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like ""Cheer up!"" or ""Go for it"" does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. Therefore, although global warming is regarded as just evil thing by many people in modern society, I strongly believe that global warming have both aspects of good and bad. By the way, fossil fuels will dry up soon. So, we must try to shift little by little non-carbon  life without fossil fuels. It is essential for us to use energy. If fossil fuels dried up, we could not keep the level of our life. In that time, in order to keep the level of our life, we must progress the technology of green energy. In conclusion, global warming has both aspects of good and bad. Also, we must progress the technology of green energy in order to keep the level of our life for a long time.  I disagree with you in that you think that if developed countries start to tackle the problem of CO2 emission, the climate problems will be solved. Of course, developed countries should try to solve them, like decreasing CO2 emission. But that only doesn't makes it possible to solve them. The climate problems are the world's problems. So they should be tackled all over the world. For example, the illegal deforestation has happened in the Amazon too often. Only developed countries can't cope with such a thing.  I somewhat agree with Bill Gates. Now the richer the countries are, the more they consume energy sources. Capitalism itself is good thing. Many countries include Japan introduce capitalism. On the other hand , it can make earth environment go worse. Discharging Carbon Dioxide is typical example. In China , so many cars are used for transportation. It promote environmental problems. To stop climate change, rich countries must reduce CO2 emissions and willing to introduce green energy.  I strongly agree with you. Man in power like Bill Gates has influence on society. Their opinions can move many people in right directions to make green environment. Sometimes This kind of influence is bigger than one nation opinion.  I don't agree with your idea. Precisely, is global warming including CO2 emission really big problem? If it is warm everywhere, the areas of eternal summer get larger and larger. Southern countries' fruits can grow in northern countries. Although some islands which have the very low height sink the sea, human beings can live in the place where cannot live due to the heavy cold. Even if all human beings can live as same as until now, warm climate makes us comfortable. In one southern country, the kind of words like ""Cheer up!"" or ""Go for it"" does not exist because fruits fall down from trees naturally if someone just lies on hammock. I hope to live like this and many people envy it. I strongly believe that global warming has both aspects of good and bad.  I was surprised that Bill Gates spends $2 billion of his own wealth on green energy and asked his fellow billionaires to help make the fossil-free by 2050 with similar philanthropy. I agree with your idea that this social system make a big gap between rich people and poor people because if someone lose his or her job in the capitalism society. In this society, poor person is poor more and more, and the rich person becomes richer and richer. However, I think it is good for the world that some capitalists like Bill Gates spend money for the human. It is reason that the money gathers to a rich person because a rich person turns the economy. Therefore I am agreeable in private sectors.  Global Climate Change is not a climatic concern, but an economic issue. By creating conditions that diminish profit in developed countries, business capital will migrate to areas of the world that international consensus determines to be in need of economic development. Although the notion of anthropomorphic climate change has been widely dismissed by serious, non-politically funded entities, the push to limit the ability to produce a product in developed countries will continue and expand under the guise of international law. Those who actually believe in the nonsensical idea espoused by Bill Gates are part of the United States. They also are willing and unwilling participants in Global Economic Change, which is the actual agenda of this political and economic movement.  I am of the opinion that we should create energy by nuclear fusion reactor of the next generation. I am sure that with this technology we can also solve the problem of climate change that Bill Gates worried. Fusion reactor is a type of nuclear reactors under development, those utilizing a nuclear fusion reaction. Practical use in the second half of the 21st century is one of the emerging technologies that are expected. As the fuel of nuclear fusion, use the deuterium and tritium is the isotope of flammable hydrogen by lightly. When fusing the nuclei of deuterium and tritium, you can helium and neutrons. In this case, than the sum of the weight of the previous reaction deuterium and tritium, lighter is more of the total weight of helium and neutrons were able after the reaction, this lightly became minute of energy is being released. In response, enormous energy is generated from a small amount of fuel, for example, 1 grams of deuterium - You can obtain the corresponding energy to petroleum from tritium fuel equivalent to that of one of the tank truck (about 8 tons). Fusion reactor technology I think some people are worried that not dangerous. But fusion reactor is safe. In the reactor, which is currently operating, it makes use of the nuclear fission reaction. In nuclear fission, and power generation energy heavy atomic nuclei such as uranium and plutonium occurs when you divide the light nuclei to absorb the neutrons is taken out in a nuclear reactor. In addition to this so that safety is ensured, there are two further advantages. Deuterium which is a raw material of nuclear fusion in one eye There are many in the sea. Therefore it is not worried about the resource is depleted. It is still good for the environment. In the process of power generation, it does not produce carbon dioxide that causes global warming. High-level radioactive waste is not generated.  I agree with your opinion. When I was a school girl, I lived in Nagoya. And just that time, COP10 was held in Nagoya, we participate in the gathering. So I experienced such thing, after that , I am interested in environmental problems. So I am very worried about environmental problems, and now global warming is surely moving up to worst direction. We , all over the world not only unit of nation but also unit of the nation and especially the nation who live in industrially developed nation , should make an effort to reduce CO2. Therefore famous people like Bill Gates maintain such thing will affect our life and change our future.  This article is difficult for me because the story is too long and too boring. But after I read this news article , I noticed that I was interested in this news article. In this news , there are sentence that ""Bill Gates, has said that the private sector is too selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels"" and "" Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Since World War II, US-government R&D has defined the state of the art in almost every area. The private sector is in general inept. The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions, and when they do, hopefully they'll make it cheap enough for everyone else. "" I agree with his idea. There many problems like not only global warming but also shortage of resource. We should solve this problem, I think.  I think what Bill Gates says is basically true. I think that private sector is kind of selfish and inefficient to produce effective energy alternatives to fossil fuels. And I think he is great because he is not a kind of person who only says his opinion but he is a person with great action. I know he is a great person, because I have seen him done a lot of charity and donations with Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. His company known as Microsoft has donated a lot of money when the Tohoku Earthquake occurred. He has been considering about poor people and those who lives under poverty. In his quotes he mentions that the climate change has to be solved in the rich countries, and after that it should be cheap enough for everyone else to use. I think he is saying totally right thing. Basically developed countries have the money to invest and advanced technology. So they should benefit other countries by doing what they can, because that is what makes everyone's life happy. It is surprising to know that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, though it is the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. Because in my opinion China was the last country to do green investment. I know how much they need to start using green energy, since I have a friends from Shanghai in Keio university and she told me once that you cannot really live in Beijing because of the air pollution. There is one more hit for capitalism as an economy in this article. It is the survey concluding the poor get poorer and the rich get richer. Even if it is true, I think it is something you cannot change, because it happens all the time. Smart people get smarter, and as with the same, rich people get richer in this world. But I feel a need to solve this problem in some way.  Bill is right in some aspects. I mean, capitalism has limit because it is consist of competition. Competition is really useful tools to generate something new but it is not good at eliminate something, shave something. However, I think, capitalism is changing gently from short-term capitalism to long-term capitalism. If companies want to get money in long term, they have to think about making profit eco-friendly. It is kind of advanced capitalism. The change is caused to existence of ""company"" and global financial system. Now, there are many companies that have long history more than 100 years. And numerous money are finding place to fund in long-term. I mean, company tends to live longer than people and owner of company is get to think about sustainable growth. For example, consumable companies need growth global population. At least, they want steady market that doesn't shrink. So what should they do? I think they have to develop developed countries and make them grow. I mean, they have to make new market. This process is not like capitalism because it is amazingly long-term but some great companies do this. Google is one of these companies. They research the way of connecting people in poor countries to the Internet. Of course, it doesn't make profit in 5 to 10 or more years. Google want to do that because they want to expand the areas of their market, users. Sustainable growth in hundreds years request eco-friendly business because it needs management resources in the future. Briefly, I can understand what Bill thinks but it's not true. He is in IT industry and it's really short-term business, so he doesn't have great view of so long-term business.  It is difficult problem to solve. Because there is a gap between a developed country and developing country about environmental problem. The former will not increase rapidly, but the latter will increase possibly. So if the former propose new rule that restricts CO2 emission, the latter discourage the former from passing it. Because the latter wants to grow if even environment of nation or all over the world is destroyed. The latter think the former did the same thing in the past, so the latter think to have right developing own country. However, in the capitalism, the rich people become rich. The poor people become poor theoretically. Because the rich people's children can take the education of high quality and have powerful connection. The other hand, the poor people have to take the education of low quality and don't have powerful connection. This is a social problem among people. Needles to say, this problem can apply to nations. To put it in a different way, the rich countries keep to the rich countries. The poor countries end up being the poor countries in the capitalism. Therefore if a conflict between the former and the latter continues, I think it is difficult to solve. And we can't break the present circumstances in the world. We can't solve the environment problem and the problem of the gap the rich and the poor. So I agree with Bill Gates. I think capitalism cannot save us from climate change. After I read this article, more and more strong I think it.  I think ""the poor get poorer and the rich get richer"" is right. Because now in Japan, basically people who have a lot of money can receive good education. It becomes slightly easy to get a stable job in the future if received good education. Even if under the capitalism, all people should receive the good education equally. The government should solve this problem. I think equal capitalist society is such a system. And I'm agree with Bill Gates' opinion ""Without a substantial carbon tax, there's no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. "" and ""The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. China and the US and Europe have to solve CO2 emissions"" The current development country exhausted a large quantity of CO2 with the industrialization in the past. I think that we should take responsibility for solving this problem as soon as possible! If we put it off, we can not solve this problem forever.  I also knew that Japanese social media reports only one side of Chinese environmental problem. Unless Japanese read this news, we will misunderstand China is the country which continue to pollute a huge amount of CO2 emissions. In this time, I recognize the industrialized countries such as China, German, and US started to make an effort to decrease CO2 so we can expect that the countries all over the world will solve this environmental problem in the future. And I hope Japan is the top country that contributes to lower CO2 emissions in the world.  When I read this news at first, I was surprised at knowing China have been making an effort to decrease CO2 emissions. That is because I image the industrialized countries, especially China, have no interest in lower CO2 emissions. In Japanese mass media, China tends to be reported to remain the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels. So I think Bill Gate's idea is great. While the only poor countries which produce less CO2 emissions tackling the CO2 problem hardly, unless the rich countries which utilize the huge amount of CO2 take some actions to solve the problem, The effort of the former countries result in nonsense. So like his idea the climate problem such as CO2 emissions should be solved in both poor and rich countries.  I was surprised when I read this news at first time. I believe that capitalism is great system. However there are a lot of people with various opinion in the world. Many developed countries which are almost capitalism. In particular, Japan is a rich country. And we would be satisfied to become rich. However Sometimes the rich countries have to trouble to other countries. Its representative is a global warming. Developed countries were allowed to develop the industry in order to become rich, so carbon dioxide emissions from developed countries. Developed countries are also use natural energy, but it is a fact that developed countries emission of carbon dioxide. Moreover I was surprised at the price of 2 trillion. Huge amount of money, I think that person should be considered well how to use. Furthermore I was surprised that China is focusing on the development of natural energy. And I think that European countries because they reduced emissions of carbon dioxide. I feel that there are many people who think about environmental problems in the world.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very impressed. In Japan, there is a serious problem. It is great gap about income. If a family does not have money, the child who was raised will be poor. In the future, Japan will be aging society. Our generation who is eighteen to twenty years old have to support this aging society. Indeed, we have no choice to avoid aging society. But we have to consider and think solution. First, we have to have money to help the old. So the government have to raise the income. This solution is hard for the small and medium-sized enterprise. But to think the future society, this solution must be conducted I think. Second, I think the government must take some activity. For example, to support to help the countryside people. In the urban city, there are many good infrastructures and a home for the old. On the other hand, in the rural society, there are few home for the old. Indeed, in the rural society people support each other. But If the old died in his house, possibly no body can notice this situation. So the Japanese government have to support this point.  I'm with your opinion that people should feel that the crisis is coming. We feel as if terrorism and the attacks were the foreign affairs and they would never come to Japan. However, we can't foresee the future and it is always unsure. We have to be careful and look at what is going on around the world like what the attacks in Paris mean to us and to the world order. The developing countries need initiative and support of developed countries like The United States and Japan. We have to be their role models, which means that the government should act correctly. It also means that the citizens must consider whom we vote. When we provide developing countries with new technology, history, nature and culture of that area should necessarily be taken into account.  More developed countries were less optimistic when it came to agreeing with the statement The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last. """" I was really interested in this part of the article. It seems that developed countries is giving up capitalism. But when we see the India, most of them are believing ""The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". What makes this difference? First of all, there is the gap of power of economy . Developed countries are very wealthy and they may be able to buy anything they want. Though this is exaggeration, they're are at least fulfilled materially to some extent . If a man contents with his life, he never want to work, or even think. The Developed countries ""giving up"" is just like this. They are content with what they are. I think this is good. Only Developed countries can such feeling. But like India, developing countries are ""developing"". They always think how they can win developed countries, how defeat developed countries, how put developed countries under them, how wonderful it would be if they could achieve such beautiful world. To give up capitalism is 'good'. But if developed countries give up capitalism, who call them ""Developed Countries""? So, criticize capitalism is good. But they must not give up capitalism, I think. If they give up capitalism, next may be the era of India and China or other countries. That's my thought.  At first I thought that we must change to use other powers. Because, fossil fuels have the limit and if we make power by electricity with fossil fuel, then it makes much more carbon dioxide emissions, I think. So, I think that we should use green energy. Green energy has great variety. For example water power and solar power and wind power and so on. But it costs much money to use them. In the future, a problem of the money may be the biggest burden and most important topic. So, Bill Gates contributed much money is very wonderful action, I think. I may be able not to contribute like Bill Gates even if I had a lot of money and I will spend all money for me or my family. But, he gave away all his money to charity. What a man who give one's all money away for charity! I think that he must be generous man and I respect him after hearing this news. I wish that he helps for making new energy. And I wish that he will help with the reduction of carbon dioxide emissions too. Now, increase in carbon dioxide on the earth is a serious problem . Temperature climbs into the earth year by year. I think we must stop the rise in temperature immediately. Even if we were not able to contribute the money, I separate it and I get into a hydrogen car and should think about environment. And I want to spread a opinion to think more seriously about decreasing carbon dioxide all over the world. If we don't think it individual, its problem will attack our descendant. And its problem will become much more bigger than now, I think. This situation is very dangerous and difficult to improve, so we should think and spread and act! At first, I will reduce to use air-conditioning to decrease carbon dioxide emissions. And I will try not to waste to take a shower and watch TV and so on.  I agree with your opinion. To share information is the most important when do communication. In the past, to share information or knowledge needed very complicated process to be done. Because all process was the work of human. All human are living thing, and all of them have some problems. More people relate the conveying of information, more troubles may happen. But we are now living the era of IT. We can access many kinds of information immediately. This is also helping the communication of countries. To share information have become much easier than the past. If people themselves make a little more effort, world may become better place for us much easier than before, I think.  Surely, I don't think it is impossible that the poor becomes rich. But I don't agree with you. Now I think the means is also very difficult. To go to good school, It is difficult to pass an examination without going to the private supplementary school and it cost much money to go to the private supplementary school. So for all the poor, it is not easy. There is the scholarship, but there are few numbers in Japan and it cannot be surely said that all poor people have a chance. First I wish what these expand.  I also think all people in the world should share the information about pollution. The countries which emit a lot of CO2 should have a sense of shame that ""Does our country exhaust carbon dioxide so much?"" All country, including Japan should consider more about climate change and compete each other.  Bill Gate's action is very grateful and nobody act as Bill Gate. His opinion makes sure. However, it is not real. I have thought him realist even. He started Microsoft and created Windows OS. He has a great head for business. Using it, he became the top of millionaires. So, I thought that his idea was real very much. I believe that fossil fuels are essential in modern society. If fossil fuels are exhausted, our society will collapse. Renewable energies not being supplied much can't support our society. Finally, fossil fuels are only generator supporting our life for the present. About the distant future, we will have the solution of energy problem. It is nuclear fusion. Now it is technologically difficult to use nuclear fusion, but we mostly generate energy by nuclear fusion in future. Bill Gate should invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion. However, I don't say renewable energy is no useful. I say renewable energy don't become main energy source in our society and we should develop nuclear fusion more primarily than renewable energy. If I were Bill Gate, I will invest not renewable energy but nuclear fusion.  I agree with your opinion deeply. It is usual that there are many poor families. But the government did not take proper manifest. And we have to think this problem deeply.  I agree with your opinion. Nowadays, Japan is very dangerous. Rich men's children become rich for good. Poor men's children become rich for good. In ancient there are a lot of middle in Japan. However, it begins to collapse. If current working generation retires, Japan won't have working men and don't move economical differentials. Old people have a lot of money and don't use the money. Young people have a little money. The worst situation is that a gap-widening society completes and young men don't have wishes, go out Japan to foreign countries. Japan can't return even Japan and there are no rich men in Japan. So, I think that Japan should know limit of current capitalism and consider correcting current capitalism After I read this article I thought some opinions. First, I agree with Bill Gates. I also think that without a substantial carbon tax, there is no incentive for innovators or energy buyers to switch. Now we are reaching the linnet of limit of cycle of growth in capitalism and we are noticing about that. Capitalism is the system that developing countries are making a large quantity of cheap goods and selling them to developed countries. But now the wage of developed countries is rising so the system is difficult to keep. Other opinion is that in this system rich people are getting more rich and poor people are getting more poor. Finally, population problem is serious. This is because the production age population has been aging and the young population has been decreasing. We should be think about it more seriously.  I agree with your opinion. You have some good points. You know well about the negative points of the capitalism. and what I would like to say is all included in your opinion.  CO2 problem is no longer one of the most serious global problems now. As the industry has developed, the amount of CO2 emission which is emitted by using fossil fuels has increased. It has effect not only on the climate change but also people's health. The meeting about this issue has been held several times and each country set the goal of the amount of CO2 emission, but most countries cannot accomplish it. Therefore, this Bill Gate's action can be a big chance to consider the environment, because he is the world's richest man, so his actions and opinions are influential and attract people's attention. It could make people notice that it is time to set about this problem seriously. I was surprised at speech, 'There's no fortune to be made', but he is a billionaire, that is the reason that he can take this decisive measures spending 2 billion dollars of his own wealth on green energy. I agree with Bill Gate's speech at the point that we should make effort for declining the amount of CO2 emission and developed countries take a leadership. In fact, China nowadays has invested in green emission and China's solar energy rose 67 per cent between 2013 and 2014, and as a result, the country's CO2 emissions decreased 1 per cent in 2014. However, I don't think that capitalism make CO2 increased. Indeed, most polluting countries in terms of fossil fuels take capitalism, but I think it is not because of capitalism but because of a corrupt manner of the big companies.  I somewhat agree with Bill Gates. Bill Gates said that richer countries are got richer and these countries won't stop using CO2 and so on. We should make treaty that order these countries follow it. We should also search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on.  The Nobel prize for peace has long history of nominating and granting awards to individuals who does not fit the criteria and Alfred Nobel's idea of peace. The secretive committee has nominated Stalin and even Hitler in the past. Recent winner, Barack Obama won the prize after being nominated for less than two weeks in office has also called a controversy. Barrack Obama is also responsible for the recent bombing in Afghanistan, in other words does not fit the model of peace that Alfred Nobel wishes which is disarmament and against militarism. In my opinion Nobel prize for peace should not be a model for peace efforts and people should not take Nobel prize for peace seriously. The prize itself has always been subject for controversies and the committee is very secretive. And most importantly Alfred Nobel, the man behind Nobel prize himself is the founder of dynamites which is violently used in wars. In my opinion the concept of the Nobel peace prize itself is a joke and probably was made to clean Alfred Nobel's image as an armament manufacturer. The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that publics have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all.  Bill Gates says that Capitalism cannot save us from climate change. This only an opinion, yet super influential statement for the world. This is because that this quote is from one of the most if not the most influential single person in the world Bill Gates. Actually, before Bill Gates officially states that Capitalism will endanger human beings in terms of the climate change issue, climate change has been the one of the most controversial issues around the world. The appearance of climate change issue has changed the whole world in many different ways. For example, climate change has changed the behavior of developed country which will affect the world's economy. Countries have gotten together for an agreement to reduce the CO2 emissions. This agreement, Kyoto agreement, is lead by developed countries such as Japan, USA, Germany, Great Britain and so on. Those developed countries have set some goals according to the surface are and population. In the end, what happened is that environmentally friendly productions have become the most wanted and boom throughout the world in terms of manufacturing production. Environmentally efficient and friendly products have become the biggest trend for decades which changed the world's economy. Japan actually have taken the advantage of this trend by creating and spreading Japanese technology which are energy efficient. My point is that capitalism is all about making money by business. People have to be remaining in the position of freedom that is an idea of capitalism plus democracy. Bill Gates has pointed out that ideal of capitalism will never improve the situation of world's environment because the environment is not included inside the capitalism ideal when it was created and introduced to the world. I completely agree with Bill Gates but I don't think there is any way to stop the issue of climate change unless the world will face the real hazard of the environmental problem which will endanger majority of human beings.  I agree with your comment too. In the society of capitalism, poor people can not get the big chance. So, we should think about this problem deeply.  I do agree with your point that thinks about economy in the first hand. Capitalism is created for making money. People wanted freedom so capitalism has emerged so people have take the responsibility of creating it.  I think so too. In real, poor -person can not get the big chance. Japanese government should do some solving.  I think that it is a problem to be hard to cancel the difference between a rich person and the poor person. In the economic richness, the economic conditions of the child are similar to the economic conditions of the parent necessarily. If a parent lives a poor life, the child is easy to live a poor life, too. On the contrary, the child will live a rich life if a parent lives a rich life. It cannot be necessarily said that it becomes like this, but the probability becoming like this is high. I think that there are various factors for this fact. At first, one of the factors is education. The child can learn various things for 14 years from the elementary school to the university in Japan if a parent is rich. However, the child can receive education only until compulsory education if a parent is poor. The difference is seven years. The child who does not graduate from a university often gets work of the low-wage manual labor. However, they take work to use the head for because it is considered that a child receiving education well is a smart person. There will be surely the splendid person that I continue studying even if poor and do a company by oneself, and it is to the president. However, the example is extremely rare. Then, another factor includes an occupation. There are the story like the point and the common point, but the quantity of the salary is different in a poor person and a rich person every occupation. When people get a job unless I become an entertainer and an athlete, the interview official of the company often judges a person from scholastic ability. An able person and the incompetent person are distinguished with scholastic ability. The law may not necessarily match, but the custom in the world is so. Therefore the people who are not rich cannot learn it enough. And they get a low-wage occupation by the result that they cannot learn. Therefore they get only a low salary. After all it is necessary to expand education system to correct this difference. We must fix education system so that a difference of the educational background is not born of a rich person and a poor person. There is surely the occupation that everybody wants to do each. For the occupation that I want to do, as for a salary decreasing, there is no help for it. Without a salary, this is because he is substantial at a point realizing a dream. However, for economic conditions, I cannot allow to narrow width of the occupation choice unfairly. I think that it is necessary to widen education system and width of the occupation choice to correct the difference of economic conditions.  I agree with Bill Gate's opinion. In capitalism, we have to make enormous efforts to stop climate change. Bill gave some example to solve this problem, I paid attention to the opinion related the rich and private sectors. Now it is a fact that they exhaust a lot of carbon dioxide. And most of them are in developed countries. So I also think developed countries should reduce CO2 emission positively. Without this, it is unreasonable to tell developing country to reduce CO2 emission. I also think carbon tax is nice idea. The rich in capitalism has very large power. So to get more money, there may be the person who does not mind climate change. And the poor may be unable to help with stopping climate change. So the system of carbon tax will become the key to stop climate change.  The world's richest man, Bill Gates has said that capitalistic private sector is not effective and too selfish to produce effective energy alternative to fossil fuels. He explained the need of substantial carbon tax and that rich countries like USA, China and the EU has to be the role player to solve CO2 emission and make it cheaper for other countries. Recently Green investment is getting more attention and CO2 emission is also inclining. Meanwhile a new survey has showed that publics have doubts about capitalistic system and most of the correspondent agrees that most of them are done in a corrupt manner. In my opinion, capitalism is a great system for a country to gain wealth and spinning economic wheels but capitalism is not the system to enrich the public as it is not the aim of the system. The richer gets richer and the poorer gets poorer is of course unethical and immoral in my opinion. A change is of course needed in global society that is facing a climate change. Alternative energy has to be cheap in order to spread well and be easily used but capitalistic company would not research and use a large amount of its wealth for philanthropic purposes as its main goal is to make profit for its stakeholders. Though capitalism is the system that helped Bill Gates to gain most of his wealth, his philanthropic efforts is not bad at all.  I agree with your opinion. I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one.  I agree with your opinion. We should search alternative green energy to replace CO2 and so on, and use alternative green energy.  I strongly agree with you. Though capitalistic private sectors prioritize stakeholder's benefit, it has made a very large contribution to the society. With economic benefit in mind, private sectors have developed technologies and products which has helped humankind to progress even more. In order to gain economic benefit, companies research and creates products which more superior than competitors and this competition benefits the society and consumers. But there will always be winning and losing in competitions. That's why the richer who holds more fortune has more chances to develops better products, thus stays winning in the competition. In my opinion capitalism may not be perfect but it has a lots of benefits. The energy sector is a very promising sector economically. The idea that capitalism cannot save us from climate change is logically weird. First in order to make benefit a company has to produce better quality, more economic, and easy to use products. With capitalistic way of thinking the idea of cheap, reliable and clean energy can soon be reality as energy companies will always try to make profits with its product.  Even the manager of the Internet and the technology company, including Mark Zuckerberg of the Facebook CEO is interested in clean energy technology as well as Bill Gates. I searched green energy technology because I was interested in it. It is the energy that does not exhaust the toxic substances such as carbon dioxide or the nitrogen oxide even if it bring about electricity and heat or that is extremely less discharge. For example, the light of the sun, water power, the velocity of the wind, terrestrial heat, natural gas correspond and so on. It is said that it also points to an energy-saving technique at first, followed by electricity generating system techniques such as the renewable energy, the accumulation of electrical technology last. It is necessary for a rich person like him to take the lead in helping economically to let a level stop warming in the technology of these progress. In addition, I think that the government of a developed country is required not only to make the technical development but also to make the system to impose a tax on an energy company and a user, and to change consciousness of the world. The good news is that not only China which is going to plan changing of the energetic constitution, but also Japan and each advanced country pay attention to the most clean technical supporting the clean energy which controls carbon dioxide emissions recently. If green energy attracts more attention as an investment, I think that research and development of its advanced earlier. Bill Gates announced the establishment of Breakthrough Energy Coalition, which invests as new clean energy technology on November 30, 2015. In Japan, there is the subsidy payment, so the spread of the renewable energy, including photovoltaic power advanced, but it has been delayed under the influence of the lower purchase price recently. On the other hand, in the United States, the high-tech company works on the new energy that includes the light of the sun positively. I think that deterioration and worsening global warming is responsible for self-centered developed country and capitalism. I think that they should make an effort for a solution more in a front.  Before COP21 took place in 2015, most of developed countries had to reduce CO2 emissions and some developing countries tried to reduce them too. However, at COP21, it is decided that all countries have to cut carbon emissions. Also it is determined that developed counties will financially help developing countries. I think it was a great decision that all countries, including China, at least need to make an effort to reduce CO2 emissions. Nobody can ignore the biggest problem, global warming since it is getting worth because of human being. I don't think global warming is going to be better soon but I think at least it will not get worth.  I agree with you. I also think that China did many bad thing for earth, this was wrong. I noticed that my opinion is always too effected by the social media. In Japan, the media pick up the many news that the image of China worse. Probably, there are many reason for example, the political thing, the economy thing and the historical thing. We don't understand each other yet so the relationship between China and Japan is not so good. So I think that we should know that the social media's way of inform for us perhaps does not have the fair view point. In addition to this problem, I felt in Germany that the action for the environment have already started in many country. Last month, I went to Germany. In that country, there are so many solar power generations and wind power generations. I was really surprised the number. So, in Japan, I want the government to do more about the environment quickly.  In addition to my opinion, Mr. Shinzo Abe, the prime minister of Japan, also have a power that the change the individual mind in the world. His opinion is enough effective, I think.  I am in favor of that say Bill Gates. Rich countries will first take the initiative to when it is necessary to solve the environmental problem I think. Other countries doing so also will imitate the country. More specifically, I think it should be much higher the price of coal, which is one of the causes of more global warming.  I think Bill Gates's idea that rich countries consider the solutions to the environmental problems is good. I agree with Bill Gates. I also think rich countries should be the first to consider this problems. I hope that this problems are solved completely.  Japanese economical problem is serious nowadays. Japanese government's opinion is Japan is gradually raising in terms of economics. But the export industry does not increase though the yen become weak. Japanese depression has continued since about 2014. I think Japan can not recovery this serious economical situation easily. The Abe Government treats the rich over the poor, so that I can not be optimistic about Japanese future. Japan should also consider about environmental problem, global warming. Each countries tries to soften global warming by decreasing CO2 emission. I searched about China's CO2 emission problem. Although many people think China is the largest CO2 emitting country, actually China CO2 emission per person is less than that of America and European country on official data. I wonder it is ""real"" situation. I found that China burns up 17% more coal than official announce. This is intentional error of Chinese government. According to this fact, I understand why there are some problems like air pollution and low CO2 emit rate per person in China. This dishonest acts can not be turned a blind eye to. I think all countries in the world should think deeply about CO2 emission and global warming problem. Japan also have serious CO2 emission problem. CO2 emission have raised 50 ton in 10 years from 1999 to 2009.1250 ton became 1300 ton in 2009. This is large increasing. TOYOTA has plan to cut CO2 emission. TOYOTA's new vehicle can reduce 22% of CO2 emission by 2020, Tokyo Olympic year. And TOYOTA has new Mexico plant in which hydrogen power and wind power are in use for 40% of CO2 emission. I hope these reducing action bring good result for environmental problem.  I also have the idea that a majority of respondents from seven countries said, so I think the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economics. This economic system is the lack of the equality and the society of competing. I think the equality is important to solve the problem. But socialist economics have demerits. I have no idea and the knowledge about the economy, but all the people including me have to learn the economy and try to solve the problem.  I agree with your opinion. I think that we are reaching the limit of cycle of growth in capitalism too. Now companies are growing by profit supremacy. Companies strive to lower the cost of goods. And Subcontractors strive too for that. So there is no room for alternative energy enters in the market! I think it is good thing the richest man in the world, like Bill Gates to use money to invest new green energy. Because we should change our resource. If we continue to use fossil fuel, CO2 continue to be increased and the resource is gone. To avoid that situation, we have to make new energy. To do so, we need a lot of funds. Thanks to Bill Gates act, American people will be able to notice the importance of changing resources. In Japan, we almost depend on nuclear energy. It is sure that nuclear energy emit CO2 less than fossil fuel. But using that power is really dangerous. Some people in Japan protest to use nuclear energy. But now, we have no energy resource which can be substitute for nuclear energy. To develop more new energy, like a green energy is the most important thing. It is sure that to develop new energy we need much more money. But this will be advantageous in the long run. According to this article, a majority of respondents from seven countries said that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies. I agree with this statement. Because in Japan, children who are born in rich family can go to crime school and enough education to go to the United State or private school. After that they can get the high salary good job because they have good school career. It will continue to their children as well. But the poor cannot have enough money to be educated. After that, they take a low salary job. In my opinion, that is a majority pattern in Japan. I do not well other country's which are in capitalism. But those country may be so. I want to believe that ""The next generation will probably be richer, safer and healthier than the last"". But it will be difficult to be so as now. I can only to believe my country will try to make the country which can give hope to next generation.  When I saw the headline of this article, I was really interested because Bill Gate is one of the people whom I respect. I read an article about him before, which said ""Bill Gate said ""what the difference between first class and economy class in the plane. whichever arrive to the destination at the same time"" so he normally don't use first class. "" when I read it, I was so impressed and knew Bill Gate is wonderful person. Even when I read this article I felt respect towards him again. Environmental problem is getting more and more serious. it is true that the poor get poorer and the rich get richer in capitalist economies and private sector should reconsider about their attitudes towards to the environments. But I really do not agree the idea like we should give punishment to the country which break the rules of environment. Some countries and people blame China so much but what makes China polluted country? I think definitely it is because of us. If China dismiss their factory, how can people create productives and how can we get goods? so many things are ""made in China"" and thanks to this, we can get productives in cheap price. before blaming China, we should reconsider about how ""we"" can solve this problem. It is not a problem of only big countries. All country should corporate because we live on the same planets.  Today, some environmental problems has become a very big problem. And global warming has become the most important problem to be solved among them. Meanwhile, Paris agreement was adopted last year and approach to the world of environmental problems began to proceed to a new step by it. Paris agreement is a framework with a legal binding force since the Kyoto Protocol was adopted in 1997. Then, what kind of goals does Japan has set ? The goal is ""reducing CO2 26 percent from 2013 to 2030"". The main method is two. The first one is using renewable energy. Renewable energy is ""the energy acknowledged to be able to permanently used as an energy source"" and solar and wind power are two of the examples. If they use renewable energy, they use no more natural resources and a new environmental problem won't happen. However, there are also weak points. Solar power and wind power generation is likely to be affected by the weather and geothermal power generation is likely also to be affected by condition of earth. In addition, equipment costs are high and there aren't many environments that you can set up a power plant. The second is nuclear power generation. This is a method to evaporate water to use the energy generated by the fission of uranium and generating power by rotating a turbine with steam. It doesn't emit CO2 at all. It is the best advantage. It is also possible to reuse the fuel. It is friendly for the environment. However, this also has a weak points, too. As you know, eye to the public of nuclear power plants became severely since Fukushima nuclear power plant is misconduct at the east Japan great earthquake. Therefore, it is difficult supporters to nuclear power plant ally public opinion and safety issues always haunt the administration. It is great the flow of world is heading for the direction to reduce CO2. In particular, it is more great more celebrities such as Bill Gates has called. There is progressing rapidly technological revolution in the world, but the consideration of environmental problems is essential in that case. It was warm winter in Japan last winter and the average temperature is rising year by year. You should work to reduce CO2 emissions while all countries are collected because the Paris agreement was adopted recently.  I agree with your opinion which all country should share information about pollution and the rich countries such as US and Europe should think the solution for that more carefully. I also didn't know about the problem of China about pollution, even Japan as well. I feel embarrassed. I feel I should know and understand more seriously about our energy and pollution problem. Japan should imitate good countries which success to decrease greenhouse emission, like German and the United Kingdom.  After reading this article, I feel that the humans breaks their own living place by themselves. I understand that the system of capitalism is necessary for our nowadays lives, but it is not good for the environment of our living places and the sources which are necessary for our loves. Nothing to say, the amount of oil is decreasing year by year. The oil is necessary for us, but it has the limit. In the future, the oil will be nothing by using by us. The present system of capitalism helps the reducing the natural sources which is important for our lives. The companies don't think they will use substantial sources instead of oil or any other natural sources. I understand what they do. In case, they try to develop their skills and to find new sources, it is hard for them. The research will cost the companies too much. Simply, selling higher and collecting reliable sources is good for nowadays capitalism. I think only big company which has the thinking about the sources can make progress our source and environment problem. I know that Bill Gates afford to pay much money , because he is one of the richest man in the world. I recommend that big companies receive the much money to make substantial sources by rich people and they try to do research. I think it is good way to get new sources which we need for our lives. However it is difficult because I think it is seldom rich people pay money to these production like Bill Gates. I hope that the present style of our living will not change and people will be able to live in comfort.  Your idea is understandable. As you said, in Japan the gap of rich people and poor people is getting expanding. I read one monograph. It is written in Japanese. Its title is ""the gap expanding in Japan and the USA society"". This paper shows that Japan is the second disparate country in the world. And the situation of the actual Japan and the USA's disparate society. The income between regular employees and part-timers is so different in Japan. The income of part-timers is too cheap to live by oneself. I wonder why the income is so different in Japan? Other countries do not have this kind of date like Japan. I understand the income of regular worker must be higher that part-timers, but the gap is too big. I think it is strange. I hope that the status of part-time worker gets higher and at least little a bit more income should pay to them in Japan.  Big factor that capitalism brought is mass consumption society. Instead of producing a large quantity of fortunes, the production method that spread out to extend profit called for mass consumption. In other words, it produced many goods using a large quantity of resources and It consumed a thing in large quantities and came to discard a thing in large quantities. Of course it is bad in environment because It exploit the earth in resources when someone produce things. Because people in capitalism use the electricity in large quantities, more CO2 is drained from the thermal power station. When they consume it in large quantities and take out garbage, it adversely affects environment in various form. A lot of chemical substances are included in most of the particularly recent garbage. Because a chemical substance is the thing which there was not on the earth formerly, it is not incorporated in a natural cycle. Therefore it leads to the ground, the sea, atmospheric pollution because it is not returned as energy naturally. It is to achieve an aim ""to minimize work force, and to produce the maximum"" as for the thing which aimed of the socialism. Even if how is the means on achieving this aim, it is good. The environmental disruption does not matter. it needs a large quantity of electricity if it mechanizes all work. Then people in socialism operate a big thermal power station of the quantity of generation intensively most. On the socialism, this is not special. Thought to do anything for a purpose causes the environmental disruption. This is a point leading to the environmental disruption of the socialism. Thus, where cannot say unconditionally in a point of view called the environment because capitalism and neither of the socialism have nothing to do with the environmental disruption whether it is worse. I think that it is that an each person uses a thought about environment to be important.  I agree with your opinion. Japan will focus on education in job hunting, but this criterion has been delayed in the world. Men of ability is get a good job. It must be the case. Therefore you need assistance to families are facing poverty problems. But now the Japanese government is facing a variety of problems. Of course this problem also important, but it must be run to decide the budget in conjunction with other problems. Therefore, it is the status that can not be resolved immediately.  I agree with you . The developed country should reconsider an environmental problem.  I agree with you. As you said, all countries should share information about pollution. In addition, I also think that the climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries, as Bill Gates thought. I hope this problem is solved early.  I agree with your opinion. In Japan, the poor gets poorer. The government should save these people.  When l read this article, I was surprised that China has surged ahead of the US and Europe in green investment, despite remaining the world's most polluting country in terms of fossil fuels in recent years. Until now, I had an impression that China does not think about the green energy, because they discharge a large amount of CO2. I agree with Bill Gates's opinion that The climate problem has to be solved in the rich countries. This issue can't be solved, if all the country don't join forces with each other. "
JOC JOC-15B-14N 1.81 "It is great so much that a woman has named Time's Person of the year. She has the strong leadership on everything from th the problem of Syria refugees to the Greek debt crisis. Even if there is criticism for her policy, welcoming all refugees from the Middle East is humanitarian. Germany has taken the lead in accepting people fleeing from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq and so on to Europe. Thought she selected the hard way, she is still sticking to her policy and rehousing to name a limit to the number of people which the country can take yin. In addition to this, she tackled the problem between Ukraine and Russia. She had stuck to efforts to keep the leaders of both countries talking to implement a peace accord. It was surprising that her speeches are usually monotonous and she often looks weird in front of the camera. Before reading this article, I thought that politicians sticking to their stance like her were very good at making a speech. Japan needs politicians who will be able to make diplomatic efforts to solve the worldwide issues.  This article is with the photograph of people applauding the leadership of Merkel, but there are many opponents. However, I think that Merkel is great because there are few woman Presidents all over the world. She is like the symbol of a strong woman. It is important that not only having one's intention being strong but also hearing the other opinions of other countries and be in harmony. When will it be that the prime minister of the woman is born in Japan? It is necessary to take in some good points of German and Merkel.  I think that Angela Merkel is a courageous politician. She belongs to CDU, which is a conservative party in Germany. Although her policy is almost conservative, trying to accept many refugees from Middle East is bold. It is meaningful for the conservative politicians to adopt a liberal policy. Not only the left but also moderate conservative will support her decision. However, there are a lot of problems about the Syrian refugees. Refugees can disturb the peace and deprive the German people of employment. We have to take notice of the danger of refugees. On the other hand, Donald Trump is, I think, a funny person. But he improper for the President of USA. Although his comments are influential, it is unrealistic. Therefore he is unworthy of supporting.  Do you think that Shinzo Abe is a politician who will be able to make diplomatic efforts to solve the worldwide issues? I think yes. Although he is called ""extreme right-wing"", Shinzo Abe is actually a realist. For example, Statement by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, security-related bills, and the agreement between Japan and Korea on comfort women. I think these are realistic. It is meaningful for Shinzo Abe who is called ""extreme right-wing"" to adopt realistic policy. I believe that Shinzo Abe will continues to promote pacifism.  When I read this article for the first time, I agreed with her plans. Of course, there are some problem and people against her like Trump. Now, we concern most is an act of terrorism. In Paris, the big terrorism was happened, we were very shocked by the news. To welcome all refugee could connect to allow for terrorists to enter the countries easily. Doing so, people in these countries will be exposed to danger. However, it is most important to think refugees' thought, I think. Most of them are victims and the number of them will be increased more and more because of a civil war and an aerial bombardment. The things that we have to do first are to think them and to help them.  I want to praise Angela Merkel. Her humanitarian policy would become the support of the heart of many refugees. However, many refugees were stranded on the Austria border, which was closed, because German Prime Minister Merkel accepts refugees without any restriction and spoke out that I protect it carefully irresponsibly. The stray bullet of the warning shot of the border Police hit one of the Afghanistan refugees in a town of southeastern Bulgaria on October 15, and he died. About this problem, both the border Police and an illegal immigrant are irresponsible. The German manner beckoned many emigrants to come and caused this accident. Large-scale demonstrations are caused many times in the country, and the criticisms occur successively from the neighboring countries. Her action in itself was humanitarian, but the result that her action caused was chaotic. The Islamic nation became the topic, and the accidents happened recently in Paris and Los Angeles. The German is being exposed to terrorism threat. Originally Germany is the country with many emigrants, and Germany cannot integrate emigrants into itself as can be seen from a crime rate and a leaving school halfway rate. Because Germany cannot deal with even the emigrant of the own country, a large quantity of refugees cannot be accepted. There is not only the uneasiness of terrorism but also the financial pressure. The local government is exposed to financial burdens. The refugees who were not able to secure houses are forced to inconvenient life, and there are the refugees becoming ill, local doctor is forced to unpaid labor to save them. Germany and the German border neighborhood are in confusion in this way. Merkel gives up having idealism to solve such a problem and must grope for solutions practically. I only think that her humanitarian way of thinking is very important.  It seems that Angela Merkel, the German Chancellor, is humane and popular among German. She said that she accept all refugees from Syria. It is highly risky and many people were against it, so she gave up doing it. Her humanitarian stance is highly evaluated. I think representative of nation should be like her. A person who is willing to work for peace is good to make great nation. Merkel's kindness and toughness are worthy and I hope it embodied someday.  I agree with your opinion. Thinking of people who are in danger of terrorism is very important thing. It is true that accepting people from Syria and other middle Eastern countries is risky thing, we should know that most of them are victims and only a few are terrorist. Saving these people is not easy thing , but understanding that kind of situation is necessary. Trying to help those people is the first step to make world peace.  I agree with you. There should be more woman presidents in the world. It is the era when we talk about the need of equal between men and women. So she can be the symbol of the strong woman. Since the Germany is the country with strong power, it will change the stereotypes a lot. I also hope to see a woman president in Japan. Woman have the different way to think so there is the possibility to change the situation radically.  Refugees flock on 10, 000 scales every day in Germany, and it is said that around 1, 500, 000 people seem to do refugees application in the year now. Merkel judged that Germany can accept around 50, 000-60, 000 refugees, but, actually, the number of the refugees that is different in two columns flock. Because the Syrian refugees are to be accepted as basics, all the flocking refugees camouflage refugees from Syria and Germany has great time to make the judgment that he or she is Iraq refugee or Afghan refugee or Syria refugee. And the most serious problem is to largely lack the urgently medical environment for an old man and the sick person and the arrangement of a house and the food, and the arrangement of the school for the child in a local government of the acceptance. The local government begins to scream in refugees measures. The German government is to use a great deal of expenses to cope the refugees but the expenses continue growing in the future and the Germany finance will be tight. There were many people in favor of accepting refugees at first in Germany, but now people objecting to accepting refugees begin to gradually increase because they get fed up with the too much number of the refugees. And, as a result, the approval rating of Merkel has begun to decrease while being inversely proportional with increase of the number of refugees. It may be said that this policy by Merkel ended in failure.  It is wonderful decision, I think of this Prime Minister Merkel's decision. Other European countries are refusing a victim from Syria. A refugee from Syria has caused terrorism in France. Various problems may form by accepting a victim from Syria, but I think a homeless and in trouble person should be helped. Refugees from Syria don't say that everyone causes terrorism, so I think I want all refugees to be rescued.  I really respect her because even if the position of president of Germany is quite dangerous, she continues to fight for everything. Germany is the most advanced countries in terms of energy technology and development. She also accepted to accommodate many refugees and even decided to give them a job. Japan should take it into consideration to pretend it.  I agree with your opinion. Her action and thought are respectable, she must be a symbol of women. Now, we live in the society that man and woman are worked equal, so in the future, it will happen that the prime minister of the woman is born in Japan. She is a symbol of the woman, it is necessary to build the society that woman could live more free I think Angela Merkel is a great politician in Germany. She made Germany stronger than before and Germany became leader of EU. Moreover, she decided to welcome many refugees from Syria. I think that she serves Germany and world. I wish there were leader such as her in Japan.  I think the decision of her was not so easy, but difficult, she have decided it. This is really great thing and meaning. In 2013, Merkel won one of the most decisive victories in German history, achieving the best result for the CDU/CSU since reunification and coming within five seats of the first absolute majority in the Bundestag since 1957. She is really good politician.  I agree with you. Generally speaking, many people especially in Japan, they want to belong to majority. But she is different. Her position are clearly minority, but she decided with a strong thinking and helped many refugees. As you say, I also respect her.  When I read this article for the first time, I was interested in that the two has an opposing position each other has nominated first and second place by TIME person of the year. Add more information, who was chosen by readers is Bernie Sanders, making reference to immigration issues. His opinion is the profound legalization of illegal immigrants in the United States. This shows us last year's world situation. Japan is also debating between acceptance and refuse. I admire her courageous decision. That could help to make the world better. However, I think Japan have to be collected and to wait now. We should watch carefully countries allow to immigrate, including Germany.  Whether it is correct Merkel is doing is I don't know. But I assess her attitude. She act with their beliefs. So she can carry out to accept all the refugees. I think she is alike the former British prime minister Margaret Thatcher. Now what I fear is the pace of the world doesn't match. As in the above Trump's statement, some people to oppose to her policies are in the world and his statement is also one of the opinions. Refugee problem is what the collected world must solve. The government of the world should hold more meetings that they can exchange their opinions. "
JOC JOC-15B-15N -4.38 "Frankly speaking, this news is very difficult for me to understand clearly because relations among all parties concerned is too complicated. For the time being, it is almost impossible for us to know a truth of the incident of shutting down a Russian fighter jet. Additionally, it is more important to fight against ISIS than to know a truth of the incident. So, I strongly believe that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, according to the news, Turkey is buying millions of dollars of oil in the black market from ISIS. Considering these conditions, it seems difficult to have closer ties between two counties.  It exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year. For an import of gas country from Russia, Turkey is a customer of the second place next to Germany. On the other hand, Turkey exported food of 1 billion dollars (approximately 120 billion yen) to Russia in first nine months of 2015. The main item is a tomato and citrus fruits, and these occupy half or more of the import. The Mayor of Kuno Berri center thinks that Russia may not limit the import of vegetables before a holiday of the New Year. On the other hand, it is said that I seem to tighten hygiene management. A main import item from other Turkey includes cloth and textiles. Most of retailers of Russian clothing and the footwear place an order in a factory of Turkey. Cloth imported according to the data of Russian Federation Office for National Statistics for first nine months of 2015 from Turkey to Russia and the textiles 514 million dollars (approximately 61, 680 million yen), the footwear 48 million dollars (approximately 5, 760 million yen). When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. However, I think that the action, Turkish government will pass new legislation to ban Kurdish activity and weaken the HDP and other opposition parties, will not get better, because this action will not connect democratization. One-party dictatorship will be spread weakening the HDP, and the opinion of the people will be ignored. In these difficult affairs, it is important for the country to listen to the voice of the people. Also, the relation between Turkey and Russia will be needed to improve. The incident that the soldier, who protects the country, was killed must not be happened, but in these affairs, the conflict like this can be increased. These countries' purpose is same, to solve the problem about ISIS, therefore I wish these countries would cooperate well.  This news is very difficult for me. When I read this article for the first time, I couldn't understand. First there is a Turkish folk problem. Only 1 race lived in Japan, so I couldn't understand a folk problem so much. There is a problem of ISIS with the 2nd. ISIS came to do terrorism at Europe as well as the Middle East. I fear ISIS. I'm hoping the moment is also early and for this world to become peaceful.  Russia and Turkey developed the war of ten several times for many centuries. However, I continued the friendly relationship that was not seen so far for these past 20 years. Even if the shooting down of the Russian military plane with the Turkish military plane of 24th does not lead to the military collision of the two countries, what two countries relations are cooling rapidly is apparent to anyone. They fanned the nationalist-like mood of the nation for many years to get support of the general public in autocratic leaders with the President of Putin Russia, the Erdogan President of Turkey. Both of them shelved the difference in the foreign policy until now and were bent to plan two countries affiliated expansion. Although they are opposed by Syria, Cyprus, a problem of Ukraine, the trade relations of the two countries present an active state. But, by military plane shooting down in Russia, the separation of politics and the economy became impossible. They let feelings get excited with the two countries, and Russia moves in retaliation early. Manager dormitory tray Nin of the Carnegie international peace foundation Moscow center explains, ""the relations that Russia and Turkey got after Cold War end will be cut off for the duration, and the two countries relations came back to hostility, doubt, the relations of the competition""; ""relations between the top are what was spoiled, and it is a relation of ""sultan"" and ""czar"" that is extremely important. Erdogan, both of them of Putin have already spoken each other, They are not with expectation of a partner. In addition, a factor to deepen this crack does not have it, or the difference in thought about the situation of Syria and ISIL is regarded as uneasiness, too. I knew such a Russia and the historic opposition of Turkey by having learned world history, but was surprised that such an opposition lasted to the present. In addition, it might be hard to understand the problem that such a religion affected too much from the country such as religion-coloured thin Japan, but it was the problem that was important for the person concerned and thought that it was what it was hard to solve.  I exercise economic sanctions to Turkey The exports from Russia to Turkey are cereals and gas mainly, and the limit to this part is not planned for the moment. The gas monopolistic enterprise ""gas prom"" of Russia exported gas of 27, 300 million cubic meters to Turkey last year. For an import of gas country from Russia, Turkey is a customer of the second place next to Germany. On the other hand, Turkey exported food of 1 billion dollars (approximately 120 billion yen) to Russia in first nine months of 2015. The main item is a tomato and citrus fruits, and these occupy half or more of the import. The Mayor of Kuno Berri center thinks that Russia may not limit the import of vegetables before a holiday of the New Year. On the other hand, it is said that I seem to tighten hygiene management. A main import item from other Turkey includes cloth and textiles. Most of retailers of Russian clothing and the footwear place an order in a factory of Turkey. Cloth imported according to the data of Russian Federation Office for National Statistics for first nine months of 2015 from Turkey to Russia and the textiles 514 million dollars (approximately 61, 680 million yen), the footwear 48 million dollars (approximately 5, 760 million yen). When sanctions are exercised in this field, the Turkish article for sale may flow into Russia via Belarus After I read this article, I thought two things about it. First, I think Turk should be more collaborative with Kurds. Kurds are desiring to have their own country for many years. The fault information by AKP made their dream become not true. So it is a must that HDP should win next time. In order to do that, HDP and other opposition parties should get together and defeat AKP to stop the new registration. Second, most of the problem in the Middle East is involved in Islamic state. So I think it is best to form an alliance with countries in the Middle East. If the existence of Islamic state disappeared, most of the problem would be solved.  Conflicts between Turkey and Russia made me surprise. Turkey and Russia battled many times in the past days. I thought it may be the return of the Crimean War. I would like to keep a close watch on this news.  I agree with your opinion. When I read this article for the first time, it is difficult for me to understand clearly because there are many factor in the Middle East, this problem is not a easy problem. Also, I think that Russian and Turkey should have closer ties to fight against their common enemy, ISIS. However, at the same time, we should think people in ISIS, I think. Why they keep to do terrorism? Why the terrorism has been happened? Standing the side of each other, this problem of terrorism will be close to solved.  It is very difficult problem for me. Turkey and Russia are insisting each different insistence. The other tell a lie but we can't tell the different. Now, International society have to make corporation to attack ISIS so I want to talk frank between two countries. I want to make peacemaking two countries.  I disagree with you. In ancient, Turkey and Russia didn't get on well with each other. There are a lot of conflicts between them. This incident is one of conflicts. So, I am not worried about the incident. However, my interesting only point is that US helps or doesn't help Turkey. "
JOC JOC-15B-17N 0.86 "I was surprised at seeing the pictures of thousands of shoes to represent their opposition to fossil fuels in other article for the first time. And after reading this article, I have two ideas. First, I agree that Paris police regulated protest demonstration. It is sure that freedom of expression is really important, but it is more important for the citizens in Paris that Paris government prevent recurrence of the terrorism, I think. Secondly, I think it was great that each country, including the G77 group of developing countries such as China and India, came to an agreement with attempt to limit the rise in global temperatures to less than 2C. We have been forced to make difficult decision about global warming in recent years. And we have to apply the brakes to a rise in temperature. For that reason, we need the agreement of developing countries. Therefore, this agreement might change our future world, I think.  I have already known this news. The global environment is the worst now. The main cause is a carbon dioxide emission. COP21's main debate is that it does not emit carbon dioxide which contributes to global warming. The country exhausting carbon dioxide most is China. But, it is difficult for China to reduce a carbon footprint for the middle of the economic growth. However, it was decided that I reduced China. Large reduction of carbon dioxide is demanded from Japan with it. We should reduce carbon dioxide at the whole world in cooperation with the country, too.  I had thought that it would be difficult to reach an agreement about attempt to put a limit on rising global temperatures at the climate change summit in Paris. Because developed countries and developing countries have diametrically opposite opinions about carbon dioxide emissions reduction. It is about difference of the weight of responsibility. So, I was surprised to hear the news. It is a splendid achievement that all 196 countries and regions agreed with the proposal to cut carbon emissions. I think the adoption of the decision entitled Paris Agreement means exactly a historical moment. Both right for a country to develop and necessity to protect our planet are balanced in the pact. It is promising enough and I believe we seized a chance to change the world. I was relieved to hear the deal didn't fail overcoming a problem due to a mistranslation. Only a word makes a great difference. How difficult and important translations are!I hope the aim promised in the document is achieved thanks to each country's effort like Sweden.  I felt very good thing for the time being that all countries including developed and developing have a consent about a settlement plan for global warming. However, it is the fact that there are the various compromise due to take in the islands nations which offended this agreement. As a result, this agreement have no legal punishment like Kyoto protocol, a half of punishment were leaving to each countries. I think they shouldn't compromise this point, the punishment is only is cold eye by another countries. Also, according to this article, the argument was about to failure owing to interpret mistake when they argued. This accident is nice to use ""It's a great pity"". Global warming is composed as soon as possible. This is a problem we must think. However, fewer people made a concrete plan to compose and act. So, this congress was necessary to keep pace with posture of each countries, but it's outrageous to make a mistake. Of course, we should think to compose the global warming, and also we should think more to make an effort not to make a mistakes.  I would like to welcome that all countries agreed to cut carbon emissions for the first time. I hope that this pact will become a start to solve the climate change. However, it seems difficult to adopt the decision entitled Paris Agreement in countries which agreed with it by mistranslation in the draft text from a ""should"" to a shall"". I hope that all counties which agreed with it should adopt this decision in order to solve climate change.  I knew that he latest UN conference on climate change held in Paris, where terrible terrorism just had occurred. But I did not know that people donated thousands of shoes to represent their opposition to fossil fuels. I was supposed to see the pictures in which a large number of shoes are put on the street in other articles. I think it is right that police banned the large demonstration. The problem of CO2 emissions are different to solve. However each country must make an effort in order to reduce CO2, they also must consider their economic development. Each country is caught in a dilemma, choosing between economic growth and environmental protection. Especially, developing countries insist that developed countries should take the lead in reducing carbon emissions. I hope that Swedish example will prosper, but it will probably take quite some time for this plan to reach fruition. What is important to reduce carbon emissions is each of us think about environment and make an effort to protect the environment.  I sympathize your opinion. Countries are not a monolith on this issue. There is disarray among countries over the amount of emissions of carbon dioxide. We have to take action before it is too late.  I think that if contents of Paris Agreement were realized, the environment would be changed, the agreement is the first step to solve the environmental problem. It is important that all country agree with the agreement. Before this conference, there are some collisions. In 1997, the US did not take part in the conference and in 2009, some countries did not do too. Because to take part in this conference means to disturb the development of economy, so in this conference, all countries agreed with the agreement will be connected to solve the environmental problem. But, there are some problems too. The mistranslation, from a ""should"" to a ""shall"", may connect to fail this agreement. If not should but shall, there are no forces, many developed and developing countries might break the agreement. Therefore, it is needed to have the power of law with the agreement, I think.  I think it is very historical agreement about COP21 held in Paris. The advanced country and developing country could make same target and imposed duty both side. I think that made agreement to impose make good influence to stop global warming. Until now, developing country said responsible of global warming and if stopping global warming, only advanced country should impose duty and they don't have to do so. However, recently global warming, especially CO2 emission is very serious. We have to make action immediately with effective way and make cooperation all over the wold is important because today, it is impossible to stop global warming only few countries. Made specific target was also good. Aiming control increase temperature less than 2 centigrade from the age of industrial revolution is suitable target I think because it is difficult, but not impossible to carry out. We have to make effort to stop global warming.  I read the article, I surprised because it would be difficult to reach an agreement about attempt to put a limit on rising global temperatures at the climate change summit in Paris. I thought developing countries and developed country have diametrically contrary opinions about carbon dioxide emissions reduction. I hope that this pact will be a start to solve the climate change. The problem of CO2 emissions are difficult to solve. However each country must make an effort in order to reduce CO2, they also must consider their economic development. I hope all countries agreed with the agreement will be connected to solve the environmental problem. Of course Japan should decrease CO2. So we should cooperate decreasing CO2. We should reduce carbon dioxide at the whole world in cooperation with the country. We have to make effort to decrease CO2. I think our effort can stop change climate.  This topic is very interesting because when I was a high school student, I studied it deeply. Global warming is big problem in today's society. In Japan, people didn't care about environment seriously in the past. They put special emphasis on development. However, this thought caused pollution. Some people were taken illness. This experience make the Japanese government pursue the policy about environment. Maybe almost developed countries experienced these happenings like Japan, so they understand the importance of policy against global warming. However, developing countries have different view of points. In developing countries, the most important thing is development. There are a lot of things that they should do in order to become affluent, for example, making education substantial, constructing factories and making the market active. Therefore, developing countries don't put special emphasis on environment. Developed countries and developing countries have different idea each other, so it isn't easy to corporate in order to confront global warming. People in developing countries may think global warming is caused by developed countries, so they don't feel the need of their cutting greenhouse gasses. However, developed countries think that it is very necessary to gain developing countries' understanding. In my opinion, global warming is the chance for people in the whole world to become united. It is true that they have many different point, but unless they overcome differences by understanding and accepting each other, maybe they can't stop global warming. They should deepen their understanding of foreign countries at first. Of course, chemical studies is also important to solve global warming. Deepening their understanding and making progress with chemical studies is key to standing up to global warming and coming peace in the whole world.  I think a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas. Because the amount of the greenhouse gas which occurs in case of financial development is a huge one. When establishing a reduction target, a developing nation would consider a supply source of the new energy for growth. I think it can develop into the environment financially well when doing that. I think it's strange to reduce only at an advanced again. It's because a developing nation is also discharging a lot of greenhouse gasses. I think it's important to cooperate by all countries and be reducing a greenhouse gas.  CO2 emission is one of the most serious environmental problems. Reducing it is necessary to stop climate change, but now the treaties like COP and Kyoto Protocol don't work well. To achieve green environment, we must make absolute treaty and observe it. Economic powers like China and The. U. S. are the keys to improve environment. , yet these countries won't keep treaty. Continuing persuasion is important to reduce CO2.  Environmental protection particularly global warming should be seriously considered by every person and country. China and The United States are the countries that emit co2 the most, but they don't really cope with it. Since industrial revolution in 19th century, co2 emissions and global warming is progressing little and little. There is a theory that global warming is a lie of someone and gracious epoch is coming right now. We are not experts so that we can't distinguish what is the true story. Anyway, there are many abnormal phenomenon recently. Warm winter causes lack of snow at the ski resort. hurricanes become bigger and harm much more areas and people. If it continues in the future, we will face shortage of aliment. Space exploration has been advancing and some people think about migrate to the Mars. But we should firstly think about saving our mother planet. On this point, it is remarkable that almost all nations have participated into COP21 last month. Having the same goal and clarify it is very significant.  The contents of the agreed Paris agreement were in the latter half, and they proposed the direction that zeroed the greenhouse gas discharge by human activities substantially at the whole world for ""(it mentions that they greatly contribute to risk reduction to hold down to 1.5 degrees) which within it, controlled a rise in world average temperature 2 degrees"" advocated as whole target for this century. Therefore all countries made a discharge reduction target and were required to submit it and it imposed duty that the country for the achievement took measures and was done. It is proposed that all countries gradually shift to an aim for the whole country while considering the conditions of a country of each country about the form of the aim in that. And It included the structure which improved an insufficient action by ""the aim review every five years"" under the present conditions. In addition, It was affected, and it was included in the country which needed support by a thing and a climate change (warming) that contributed a fund to the developing country voluntarily (to other developing countries) was new, setting it up to a loss and the countries which suffered damage to support it while a developed country led it. For substantial discharge zero, the direction that continues strengthening climate change (warming) measures of the whole world continuously in future would be shown definitely if I see it generally, and it may be said that it is epoch-making international agreement. I think there is big significance in having shown the posture that 196 countries which gathered for this meeting above all unite and work on. The damage by the climate change spreads all over the world steadily. Furthermore A drought, abnormal weather, a rise in sea surface water level, the expansion of the infectious disease, irreparable damage including the extinction of the straight seed are felt uneasy about. It is an island country and countries to hold a lot of poors called the late departure developing country that receive the damage at the very beginning, but Japan is no exception at all, too. As for this agreement, it will be people and a creature suffering from the damage of such a climate change in the first valuable step to protect nature. However, it is far so that it is said that 26% reduction targets which Japan advocates are enough now in that. At first it proposes a cooperating posture, and, by Shima, Ise Summit of May, 2016, it is important to the measures that arrange domestic measures steadily, and are international to raise an aim in an opportunity of the aim presentation that there is once again in 2020.  The Paris agreement adopted under the command of Fabius is unique in the meaning called the environmental protection in the meaning called climate change measures. I state the upper limit of the rise in temperature of this planet clearly for a long term and exhibit the realization method. The fund enabling the correspondence of the developing country is contributed, and there is contriving it of promote a more eager action, is strong, reviewing it. This becomes the key to achieve a purpose to hold a temperature rise in check considerably than twice low. This agreement shows a new method whether the world develops into above all without putting a burden on the earth to a cuttlefish. A viewpoint how realizes a sustainability in the long term is the core of this agreement. If it can be realized, it becomes the decision to change the world to.  I think so. There are some compromise such as regarding China though this agreement is chosen by all countries. It is the fact that China is great exhausting country. As a result, this agreement will be nothing but ostensible. At first, we should think to reduce carbon dioxide by ourselves.  I don't agree with your opinion that a developing nation as well as an advanced should also do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas, because it is not equal that only developed countries grow economic. I think that most of CO2 was came into existence by developed countries like the US, Japan and China. So, these countries have responsibility that they should solve the environmental problem. Also, I think that a gap between developed countries and developing countries is spread more and more. Therefore, an advanced should do an effort of reduction in greenhouse gas.  No country wants to take responsibility. that's clear and I agree with you.  I think that it is very dangerous to hold COP21 in Paris. They should stop hold COP21 in Paris.  Recently, it is a major problem years global warming. All countries should take steps measures for stopping global warming. Both developed countries and developing countries are think about solution of global. I think a good solution to decide a number of specific carbon dioxide reduction.  I was interested to COP21 from the front where this article is read and was checking it beforehand. Therefore the time when this article was read, very, interest, it was attracted. COP21 adopted an international structure of a global warming measure after 2020 ""Paris agreement"" formally. The contents of the Paris agreement on which you agreed are put up as the whole target, ""An average temperature rise of the world is suppressed at less than twice. "", it was pointed, and the direction where the greenhouse effect gas amount of emission by human activity is being made a zero substantially was proposed in the second half in this century in the whole world. The Kyoto Protocol has decided a greenhouse effect gas reduction target of an advanced country by negotiations. But, the amount of emission in a certain developing country started to occupy that majority of the world, and dissociation with the original purpose of a treaty stood out in relief. This meeting was held to settle such problem. This is the destination where a meeting was held roughly. For the respective countries to decide a target at this meeting, Japan, like, a target was put up. I think Japanese technology is indispensable to achieve the goal decided at this meeting. To need high technology and have such technology because to achieve a goal, Japan is because it's possible. Therefore I should think should many Japanese should go to have an interest to this meeting and achieve a goal.  I agree with you. As for environmental problems, I think that the most important and indispensable thing is international cooperation.  I agree with you. We have to make effort to reduce carbon dioxide to save our living places.  Demonstration is one way to move the decision of the government. But protesters should not be mob. France is a country adopting democracy. But range allowed to do is determined. I want a part of the people to observe the moderation. It is that very good the Paris agreement has been adopted. This will change measures to environmental issues. However, I think they must provide legally binding firmly because of such agreements. This agreement may make some countries exploit and make the escape route if there is a halfway definition. All countries must check other countries carefully. "
JOC JOC-13A-05N 10.41 "It was shocking for me to hear that more and more people are complaining about the noise of children, as Japanese society ages. However, it was interesting to know the reason why compliments are increasing: aging society makes people less accustomed to hearing and tolerating the noise of children. This should be taken seriously in Japan today, because declining birth rates could be worsened by the problem. If many people keep the stance, young women will not have a choice but to give up child-bearing. Then, the number of taxpayers who have to pay for social security will decrease, while the number of elderly people is increasing rapidly. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi mentioned in the passage. We really have to push child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda to make people think more and more children are needed for future Japan. I would also like them to notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises.  Japan has a problem now. It is aging Japan. These days the number of children is decreasing and the number of older people is increasing. The number of labors in Japan will be decreasing in the future if this situation is continuing. It is high time we started to take steps against this problem. However, ""aging Japan complains over the noise of children"". In other words, ""As Japan's population declines, intolerance of children and the noise they make is increasing in a society getting less accustomed to hearing them"". This is a serious problem. We should have a wider mind. If we cannot do that, Japan will not continue to stay superpower in the world. Why? Because old people play by money, but they cannot make money. Young people can make money and support old people. So, now young people is needed. Consequently, we must be tolerant of the noise of children.  I got angry about the complainers. Children are noisy by nature, and they learn many things by playing and romping. I think declining birthrate seem to make less interest in children. I realized why the declining birthrate is becoming a big issue. Japanese people pay too much attention to their businesses and less attention to their kindnesses. And the national character caused the results. Should we demand reparation for child's growth? Should we require fines when we are disturbed our silence? If people have a little wider mind, the troubles will decrease and Japanese birthrate may increase.  To tell the truth, I was often uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and because of that they should be noisy. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. I think the number of children who are noisy because they try to get their own way is increasing recently. That's why I was upset about those noisy children. However, after read this news story, I thought there was some truth in what it said. I agreed with Maeda, who said fewer children makes people less accustomed to hearing the noise they naturally make. I also agreed with Hosaka, who said, ""Of course we need to be considerate towards people living in the neighborhood, but it is impossible to make places where children play in total silence. "" So, it's may be important that we come in contact with children and give more chance or place for them to play actively.  I agree that children are not a social nuisance. Children betray their straight feelings, that's why they are vigor and noisy. But we adult no longer have that candidness. If children became keeping quiet like a doll, the world would lose energy. I think the noise which youngsters make have a power to make people cheerful. In additional, the housings nearby school or day care center must be reduced the price. So people living in the neighborhood should tolerate some noise.  I also think that it is true that it is impossible to ask children to sit still all day long so they do not make noise. I do not like children because they always make noise. But I understand it is what cannot be helped. So, parents should discipline a child so as to children will not be put to shame in the future. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of children depend on the disciplining of children by parents.  It is natural that children make some noise when playing outside. Those who complain about the noise children make definitely used to make noise and sometimes used to bother their neighbors when they were children. In addition, I think people should realize that not just parents but all the people in a whole society are responsible for education of children. When I was an elementary school student, I played outside with my friends living nearby my house every day. Their parents and elderly neighbors always greeted playing children and made us greet them back. Moreover, sometimes they told us to be careful of cars and bicycles, not to damage walls and flower beds, and not to make too much noise. Through these kinds of communication with neighbors, my friends and I learned manners in a society. I really appreciate my neighbors who brought me up in a different way from my parents' or school's ones. Recently, it has come to be difficult to help young parents and bring up children by a whole society. However, people have to understand how hard taking care of children is, and afford to worry about young parents and children. I hope that people keep a warm eye on them and communicate with them more frequently so that the number of complaints will decrease.  I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood when , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan.  This might sound ""incorrect"" but I am rather a person who complains about the noise of children. Those noises are simply annoying especially in crowded places. Moreover, I dislike a sort of common sense that everybody should like children and be kind to them. If I say that I don't like kids, many people will think that I'm a cold-hearted person. It is obvious that the declining birth rate problem is serious, tho. To solve the problem, a fundamental reform for the overpopulation in the metropolitan cities, such as Tokyo, is needed. The government cannot force its citizens to be tolerate of the noise children make, but it can lead them by reducing the stress of their life in overcrowded cities.  I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish.

Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan.  I also feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children is natural things, so I can allow it and it is unbelievable that a lot of people complain about the noise of children. Therefore, I want many people who complain about it to remind of their childhood and kindness of neighborhood.  I think the government, day care centers and the neighbors should make every effort to overcome this issue. The government should inform more neighbors and other people of the risks that low birthrate and aging society brings such as problems of pensions or decline of the laboring population. And the day care centers should take measures to avoid the conflict. For example, they should more often take children to remote parks where children can play without caring others. And the neighbors should find some hobbies they can enjoy outside the houses where they do not feel unpleasant. The noise causes mainly in the daytime, so the neighbors should go out actively.  I think that the noise children make should be allowed. It is unfair of people to take children to task for their noise, because most people make noise when they are children. In fact, it is natural that children make noise, so it is impossible to ask children not to make noise. In my opinion, the noise is important for children. When children play with their friends, they are sure to make noise. In other words, the noise is their means of communication that they can express their feelings. Therefore the noise is indispensable for growing up. Of course, their parents need to pay attention to their noise, but it is quite wrong for their neighborhoods to sue them. We don't think the method of decreasing the noise, but we ourselves have to be more tolerant of their noise. If Japan is more broad-minded toward children and their parents, its birthrate will be increasing.  I think the noise of children is natural things. We should be tolerant for the noise of children because everyone made noise when they were children. In the first place, a man who is not able to allow this noise must cause trouble for someone in no small way. To allow each other is important.  It's true that people feel it noisy if children play outside. And it often happens to me when I study at home and It is disturbing, but I think we have to bear their noise because it's natural and everyone used to be like this. On the other hand, people have to care their children not to disturb neighborhood at night and in early morning. According to this article, there are many complaints about children's noise now. I think it is problem about not only low birthrate but also weak neighborhood's bond. In old days, people can be tolerant to the noise maybe because they know about each other. children are more noisy but much purer than usual people. And If people spend a few minutes with children and know their purity, they can put up with their noise.  I was shocked by having got to know this fact. ""We were once told not to take the children for a walk"" because they make too much noise"", said Ms. Maeda. I thought that it was amusing. Naturally it is things that a child frolics. And it is because it is wrong to consider that it is noise. However, although Japan has various problems therefore, it is such a situation. I think that there is probably the necessity that a child understands that it is not social trouble.  Come to think of it, in my childhood, my parents told me ""go outside rather than stay home"". I used to had a lot of time near my house. The neighborhood maybe felt so noisy, but My neighborhood have never got angry with me For the children, playing with their friends are essential for their mental or physical growth. Certainly, they sometimes don't notice their wrongdoing. At that time, people should point out to them. I'm sure such a tolerance of children is necessary in our society.  Recently the number of people who cannot tolerate something has been increasing. I'm from Wakayama, where is not so dense with people. Therefore the number of people who complain about the noise that children make is small. When I was an elementary schoolchild, I played in the school ground, but residents near the school didn't complain. I think this problem is not only because a declining birthrate but also a population density.  I'm sad to know such a complaints get increasing in Japan. As far as the idea is majority in our society, we cannot stop Japan's bad progress for more aged country and we can never re-improve the birthrate. Of course, some complaints are unreasonable and others are reasonable, so I am not going to deny all their criticism about the noise children often make. Still, I insist people should permit children to play outside merrily at least during the daytime because it is the most important activity for children to grow up soundly. Maybe different from many parents' opinion, it is not the most significant education to force their child to study hard from early age. This is because a toddler learns surprisingly numerous things voluntarily. Therefore we had better not restrict children's spontaneity.  When I read this article, I never believe there are people who accuse about noise at the court. It is natural that children make a noise. When people who hate a noise are childhood, did they not make the noise at all? Such a thing is impossible. When I was young, I made noise at a house, a kindergarten, a road, a shop, a train too. I think that children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly I thinks that there is no help for it that a child is noisy. It is recognition to raise a child in Great Society not to be enough in present Japan. We should be gentle for the noise of the child more. However, I can understand the feeling of a person thinking that child is noisy. It is that a parent warns a child with moderate condition to be important. It is wrong to complain for a parent making an effort.  When I read this article, I was shocked to know there are complains about the noise of children. But thinking carefully, I have also complains over it and do not like children because they are so noisy. Calmly thinking, I realized I should change my idea. Children go through so many and various things outside. In that way, they develop their senses and grow up robustly. The complain will put pressure on people having children . However, Japan has the lowest rate of children in the world. According to this article, Japan will be aging and will get less used to hearing children. I am afraid of the future of my country. Children make the future of the country. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kuniko Inoguchi. I thought people should think about the complain over once more and understand that children are not a social nuisance. By pushing child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda, we need to decline the number of the people who think the complain are acceptable and to form a society filled with hope.  When I read this article, I felt that modern society has lost tolerance, so I felt disappointed. Everyone was a child and everyone has experience that plays outside and speaks in a loud voice. In spite of this, as they become adults, so they lose their memories of childhood. That there are many adults are uncomfortable with the noise of children is real. I think society like this accelerate more and more aging society with fewer children. Because young people loses the feeling that wants to give birth to and bring up children. Therefore if we can remember our childhood just a little bit, the noise of children may not become a social problem like this. To continue Japanese society we should have tolerance and it is necessary to make the environment people easy to bring up children.  First, I'm surprised at the expression of ""noise"". I have never thought the sound children make outside noisy, so I have never call it noise. And it is unbelievable that people complain over it just because they aren't used to it. In my opinion, children are precious for all Japanese people, facing aging society, so we should be more tolerant toward their voice and sound.  Reading this article, I felt that Japanese people have become to lose their tempers easily not only for the noise of children. For example, on the jam packed train, some people get angry for others' hand touching his body with strong. Moreover, other people get angry even for bumping others on the street. As for the noise of children, they get more angry than usual. As the article says, one of the reasons for these situations is the law birthrate. It seems to me that this problem is one of the most important problems that Japan has to solve as early as possible. The law birthrate means the small labor force in the future. As a result, Japan will get less revenue than now, and be obliged to reduce the scale of market. To solve this problem, we should promote the nation's welfare, especially child welfare. Concretely, we should increase the number of nursery schools and admit the childcare leave. Furthermore, to allow children to play to their hearts' contents, each of us should overlook the noise of children.  Compared with other noises, it is easy to make a complaint to the noise of children. I think it is necessary to generate the atmosphere that we should cherish the children foe an investment for the future . So, I want the justice to rule in favor of children.  When I read this article, I was surprised by the intolerance of the complainer. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, my and my friend's voice were noisy, but I hadn't be scolded for the noisy. Furthermore, we were praised that 'You are cheerful. Children should be so. ' These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience.  I think those opinions in the article are kind of extreme arguments. I don't think low birthrate and feeling of young people that they don't want to have a child are caused by only this noise problem. Although the number of waiting children for day care centers became zero in Yokohama these days, it is not enough yet in Japan. The number of childcare workers and public facilities like parks are also not enough. The social system that women can feel easy to work hasn't be established yet. Therefore, I think it's not Just about intolerances and just saying children are not social nuisance won't solve the condition. Tough I understand that people who can't tolerate noises and sue are not ordinary and normal, and that it is natural for children to make din, of course. To tell the truth, I can also agree with their feelings, I can't help to be irritated if I always have to hear the din. I think where the day care center is opened is clue to solve the problem. In my living city, elementary school and kindergarten are next-door and house are away from there. I know, in sprawling city it is difficult to do. . . . To sum up, it is so complicated that I can't say high-sounding ideas like we should tolerate for the future! not bit but din or noise In Japan , the number of children is decreasing yearly. That is why people tend not to bear the noise of children. But, it is wrong that being intolerance about the noise of children. Because all the people used to be children and make a noise. In spite of this fact , complaining over the noise of children is somewhat strange. To solve this problem , the way to co-exist between children and the others should be thought.  I can understand children's feeling to play outside and make some noise because I used to be like them and do like them. Every adults was a child and they shouted more than children who live now. I cannot understand why they complain children. As Japan's population declines, we should be kind to children and their parents. If more people don't want to have their kids, Japan would become weaker.  I think that noisy children is better than quiet children. Of course, romp is not good. Children can become noisy because they are healthy and obedient. If too pay attention to others when childhood, will save a stress. Anyway, parents have to pay attention to neighbors for good relations of neighbors. It should be happening never that children are accused.  I think why the noise of children attracts somebody's attentions now. I want to question how was the old days! I think nothing can be done about it. Children are such creatures as making a noise. It is a process in which all people has passed. We should endure it more. Because children set a limit to play outside. I think the government should make the society more livable for children. And then population that children aged between 0 and 14 years old will increase.  It is common that the children are noisy. I think most children cannot sit still for a long time. It is also common that many people dislike noise of children. I like children and I cannot understand people who dislike children, but they are not ill-natured. I hope that all people come to understand children.  The place I'm living has many children, so we can hear voice of children playing and baby's crying voice. Those sound let me be warm feeling and make my smile. Neighbor's baby is so cute and kids are so funny, so I like this place. When I was elementary school student, I was a member of the club of baseball, so I played baseball every weekend and I played in the park with my friends. We run in the park, throw the ball, ride on a swing and climb a tree. There are my cherished memory. I learned ""what is friendship"" by playing with my friends. But now, many park ban ball playing, and we have few place to play baseball or football. Where can children play? A decade ago, children can play on the road, and they had a conversation with neighbors. At the time, people helped each other, and town was peace. By contrast, we don't greet with neighbors. I think it is not just a problem between children and neighborhood, it is serious issue of society as a whole. Old man in Japan increase future, many aged person need assistance, so we have to help to each other in the neighborhood. And I want to ask the person who complaining to children's voice sounds, when you will be old, who help you? It is a young man isn't it? They are kids now, so we have to make a environment that is easy to child rearing.  I think that everyone knows and understands that children make noise. But this noise is like the evidence that they live and it is no use complaining. So I am very surprised at the content of this article. The people who are complaining about this forget to be brought freely with making noise and be watched by adults who didn't feel angry or stress. They should recall their childhood and tolerate.  I was surprised when I read this article. I do understand why people complain about the noise of kids but I think they should be a little bit more tolerant. Kids make noise by nature and they learn a lot of things by playing outside cheerfully. I think most of the people have the same experiences. I agree with the statement ""As society has fewer and fewer children, people get less used to hearing them. It's a vicious circle. "" I think the society is making the situation worse. If there will be less children, there will be less taxpayers in the future. We need to take this problem seriously to make our future better.  I think that low birthrate and longevity are a problem which must be solved. However, they are not easy problems. It is necessary to fight against this problem not only by the party concerned but by a society as a whole. Japan is not in the environment which child-rearing tends to carry out. I am anxious about the future of Japan as at now. I think that low birthrate and longevity are the subject assigned to us.  I was very surprised that declining birth rate causes such a problem. I like children. However, I can understand people's complaints that children are too noisy because they have high-pitched voices and talk loudly. But most people can satisfy about it because children cannot help making noise. I think that this problem is caused by people being narrow-minded in recent years.  I like a child. Children are noisy. However, I think that such a portion also has loveliness. They must also have had the same time. The residents of the area should have attachment to nearby children. Then, the children should help you in the future.  It is unbelievable that people in Japan complain of noise children make. It is true that that noise make people uncomfortable. But people in the world absolutely experience childhood. At that time, we all did trouble. In spite of this, complaining about children is wrong. We should see them with warm eyes.  When I read this article, I was surprised and I think that there is no help for it that children are noisy. We should be gentle for the noise of the children more. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, our voice were noisy, but I had not be scolded for the noisy. These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience.  After I read this article, I understood the reasons of decreasing birthrate are not simple. The reasons which I had known are only women's advances into society and a tendency to marry later, but this article taught me a society getting less accustomed to hearing intolerance of children. But it is natural that the voices of children are noisy and I can admit them because children are so cute. So I think the recent people become not to think children are cute. But it is difficult to make others think children are cute. I think the solution of this problem is making a lot of chances to play with children when we are young for example junior high school student goes to a kindergarten or a nursery school as a class. Actually I went to the near nursery school as a class, of course children are so noisy , but moreover children are cute. I think what we make such a chance makes people like and want children.  I think it is natural that children always cry out, because their job is to play and to be scalded. They don't know something, so if people scold, they can know something. In Japan, people are aging. people perhaps think ""what is bad?"" But it is very bad! For example if old people increase, who make buildings?, who rescue?, who save a town? So, people should make baby for Japan.  I think it is natural thing that children are noisy and restless, but I agree about the feeling of people who complains over the noise of children. When I studying restaurant or cafe, I am irritated at children who are running around the shop. Birth rate in Japan is decreasing year by year, so we get less used to hearing children noise. Then, we are unused to children's noise and feel annoying to that. So that the basis of the problem is Japanese declining birth rate. We need to think more seriously about that problem and find the way to solve that problem.  I think we should involved in making a good environment in which people are tolerant to the noise of children. I have two reasons for this. First, what we can do to cope with the problem which article says is to change the way of peoples' thinking, because it is impossible to ask children not to make any noise . Children are immature and being silent is really hard for them, so when when we tackle this problem , it is not children but adult that should change. Second, we should prevent trouble that intolerance of noise of children results in vicious circle. In Japan the birthrate are getting lower, so we have to take action for this by making people tolerant to the noise. Because of these two reasons, I think people should change their mind and try to make the environment which is good for education.  I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem. I sometimes feel that children's voice is noisy. However , We have to accept it. By accepting it, children will grow up freely. It is unavoidable to stop decreasing population so we have to increase the number of children. In order to do so, we should make the environment where children play freely.  I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem.  It is natural that children and old people in a same society. And you cannot reject children. Cannot reject the natural phenomenon that children make noise. Now Japan is facing super aging society. We must coexistence with all age people. And it is fact that we should make environment that aging people comfortably living to.  I think the noise of children is natural and we have to tolerate it. Then, we should not take it as a noise but as a part of live. We all made noise when we were children. But now, people who don't be accustomed to hearing it complain about the noise. Although they also didn't play completely silence. Government should inform people of the problem of declining birthrate more. If people understand the importance of children, they will make efforts to protect them and make atmosphere which they grow up healthy.  I think it's big issue when I read the article. There are two points. First, birth rate. Recently, Japanese birthrate has been decreasing and the number of children is more uncommon than before. so, the noise of children can be more irritate people. Second, education problem A large number of mother have to do all things about their children by social system. So, in many cases fathers should work on day time and only mother should look after their children. I think we should solve these problem. For example, we make many space for children and mother etc. .  I was shocked very much that the percentage of children aged between 0 and 14 years old in Japan is the lowest in the world and less than half the global average of 26.8%. It is a very serious problem. Of course, I understand people who complain about noises, but children's noise is unavoidable. I expect all the people in Japan grasp the seriousness of the declining birthrate in Japan and accept children's noises.  I agree that the situation in Japan prevents the birthrate from rising. Of course, I feel irritated when hearing too noisy yelling of children at night, but in the daylight the noises of children seem quite natural ones. People should be more tolerant indeed. But what should be improved is not only the tolerance of the people. Compared to other countries, such as the U. S, the child care systems seem not very good. We all should become more tolerant, and change the social systems as well.  I agree with ID13019. I lived near a nursery school, and that school had a sports day. Having a sports day is good, but every year, the sports day was the same weekend when I had tests. The sound from speaker and noise children made irritated me. However, when I was a child, the sound that my school made in a sports day irritated people near the school. I think ID13019's suggestion is effective.  I disagree with ID13018 because she only referred to the parents' responsibility. Of course, discipline is necessary. However, only disciplining prevent children from growing. Instead of accusing parents and children, we should be tolerant.  I disagree with your opinion because he thinks that there is nothing we can do about making noise by children . I think that if parents discipline children, children understand it is not good to make noise in public.  I agree with ID13042's opinion. I also think children are vigor and noisy, and they aren't social nuisance. Unless they act as they want, our lives lose power to live. So adults should have wider heart to tolerate them. And to make the world nearer to children's lives, the idea that the housings nearby should or day care center must be reduced the price sounds nice to me.  I would agree with ID13061's opinion. What Maeda and Hosaka said in the text makes sense. Though it is true that we should be tolerant of the noise that children make, they ARE still noisy and sometimes annoy us.  I agree with ID13052. Everyone makes noise when they are children. So, I also think it is unfair to take children to task for their noise. Today, their many people who always look after their own interests. Complains of those people will accelerate the decline of the number of children and birthrate. So, I think the noise children make should be allowed and people should have a broad mind too.  I think it's natural for kid to run around and make noises. Are children these days really getting more noisier and have bad manners than before?I don't think so. The reason why many people came to think them annoying is that the environment has changed. In this technological century, people became lonely and come to live by themselves. Communities are shrinking smaller and smaller and many of them are collapsing. What we have to do is not to shut those kids' mouth but to improve the education environment and make a child friendly society. Tolerate and considerate society will benefit not only the kids and parents but also the whole members of the society, I think.  I agree to your opinion. The environment is what we have to think of. It is obvious that children can't think more than adults. We should think more and be tolerate for children and for ourselves in this aging society. Considerate mind and action against children will make the society more comfortable and last long term.  I agree with your idea that we should accept the noise of the children and make good environment for them. Surely, in Japan the number of children are decreasing now. So we should stand their noise and bring up them by surrounding people. We should have tolerance heart.  I agree with his idea. We all know everyone used to be children and make some noises. So people should be more tolerant with the noise of children. And I think it is very good idea that we need to think about the way to co-exist between children and the others.  I agree with you. Everyone was taken care of in society at the time of the child. Although this, one think child is annoying after growth to adult. I think this is very selfish. And children will shoulder the future destiny of our country. I think that we should become tolerant.  I always played TV game at home, I was very quiet, because I was very hard to play it! My mother also say ""Play at the park!"" I say ""YES"" But I go to my friend house, because I can eat a lot of cake! I agree with you. Children should make a noise, that is natural. The only thing we need to teach to children is ""You should be filled with curiosity many thing around you. "" instead of ""Do not make a noise everywhere!"" I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi. We have to set forward child-bearing issues. The social agenda is that to make people think that curious  children are needed for our future. I would like parents and adults to @@notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises. Children should have curiosity everything, make a noise, and be blown away a lot of things.  I agree with her. Most of people have the same experiences when they were children, so they should be lenient with them. Children will become leaders in the future.  I agree with ID13010's opinion. It is natural that children make noise. We should not get angry at it, because children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly I agree with ID13035's opinion. I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news.  I'm agree with your opinion that people should watch children warmly, because it is impossible for children to make no noise. So we should understand children and tolerate their noise.  I disagree with her. I know that it is natural for children to make noise. However, sometimes the noise make the neighbor irritated. Children do not know that their noise cause problems, so their parents ought to talk them not to make too much noise.  I was shocked by this article first. Children shouldn't be noisy? BUt after reflection, I noticed Japan's society is changing little by little. This society is aging little by little. Like old days play by lots of children should be cared not to disturb the lives of elderly people.  Once people complains over the child noise, parents may wither. If Japanese birth rate declines thanks to this, it's too late. Surely people are tend to be under stress, but it cannot be a reason to complain about noisy children. As long as the connection with local community disappears, we must care about what we do or say.  I can understand the claim that children are noisy. Sometimes I feel so when I stay at home. But we must tolerate such feeling. Children consists of foundation of a country. We have to educate them freely.  I would like to complain to these complainers. For sure, parents should always keep their eyes on their children and be considerate toward other people. However, it is very natural for children to make noise and all of us used to do it in our own childhood. With the widespread use of compute, children have less chance to play outside today. Playing loudly is absolutely needed for children to grow up soundly. Considering today's aging society and Japan's future, adults should be a little more tolerant toward noisy children.  I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news. When I was a child, around people tolerant toward me and once in a while I was scold. So I was raised by not only my parents but also people around me. I hope people around children get tolerant toward children and children should be raised local people.  I think Japanese have to have patience with noise that children make. Because making noise is good and important thing for children. So it is necessary for children to make noise. So Adult have to put up with noise that children make.  I agree with your idea. I also think children are vigor and noisy, but they aren't social nuisance. And your idea which adults should have wider heart to tolerate childrens is totally same as me!! I was so shocked to know more and more people are complaining about the noise of children because it is natural that they make some noise when playing outside. The saddest thing is that some Japanese aren't afford to permit the noise of the child.  I agree with your opinion. We should accept and patient the children's noises. Everyone was child, so we (adults) should watch stare children.  I feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children , so I can allow it and I want everyone to forgive these noises.  The situation surrounding the birth rate is harsh indeed. Society seems less accustomed to children. But the faults lie in the parents as well. Many of them seem to take it for granted to be treated specially, and children and parents with no common sense are increasing. Both society and parents have to compromise each other, otherwise this problem has no solution.  I think so serious the situation. Our social member decrease so our burden is more. The problem is so hard. We should solve the problem"
JOC JOC-13A-06N 10.41 "When I read this article, I was surprised to know the fact that the measures taken in Abenomics is not always good for people. The influence of cheap yen is one good example. Therefore I want current government to act carefully when doing economical measures. Also I want it to think carefully about the change of the current constitution. Anyway, through this news, I felt that I people should see things from various perspectives. From now on, before I do actions, I want to reconsider about them carefully.  I cannot understand this article at all because I do not know ""Abenomics"" at all. What only things I know ""Abenomics"" are ""a financial policy"" and ""monetary policy"" and ""a growth strategy"". No clear picture about it comes to mind. But judging from the news, I think that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before.  Shamefully, I hardly know ""Abenomics"", so I investigate that system and effect on the Internet. In my opinion, ""Abenomics"" will probably fail. The key point of the Abenomics is The Trans-Pacific Partnership ""TPP"", which is one of the most ambitious free trade agreements ever attempted. It is a proposed free trade deal currently being negotiated between 11 countries. These are Australia, Brunei Darussalam, Canada, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, United States, Singapore and Vietnam. It is expected to boost investment flows between the countries and further boost their economic growth. But, the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country.  I think 'Abenomics' is good plan. Of course the price of every things is rising. However, in the long run, salaries of people will be raising by companies. People should wait for good results from long term point of view. It is because people wanted good results so early by now. Japanese people should have patience. In addition, only aiming for sensation, the mass media should not stir up worries of people.  I have thought that 'Abenomics' is very wonderful policy, because I have not known about 'Abenomics' well. So I learned many things of it from this article and realized that 'Abenomics' is not always beneficial for the citizens, it also has disadvantages at the same time. In future, there will be a lot of controversy which 'abenomics' is success, or not. However, I believe that it is the right policy for us, so I'd like to support it and hope the Japanese society will recover.  Before I read this article, I got a negative impression because there's no guarantee that inflation would lead the economy to recovery. There also might be a possibility of stagflation as Shukan Post (June 14) said. Now, through this article, I'm still wondering if the policy is precarious because Shukan Post points out another problem with ""Abenomics. "" It says that Japanese exporters' slightly rosier situation has failed to spread to other sectors because they haven't had a more favorable exchange rate. Of course, it is important to make drastic reforms to change the society, so it desn't mean I criticize all this policy, but there may be a necessity to think more about the problems.  I was shocked to read this news. Before I read this article, I believed abenomics are good for Japan because it can help us to recover from deflation. But after reading this article, I was shocked to hear that abenomics can lead to stagflation. If this article is true, abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all. I think we should discuss the abenomics and find solution for these problems.  It's really difficult to study economics, and I don't know about it very much, it's so complicating. Therefore, I can't judge whether Abenomics is good for economy in Japan or not, but it seems a problem to rise not salaries but prices, which must hit us all. However, nobody knows what will happen in the future because of Abenomics, and I think it better thing to change something in any situation. It's natural to have both good and bad side in changing something, so It needs some bravery, and many people tend to want not to take a risk. Thus, in my opinion instituting Abenomics is better than conducting nothing. It has a chance to make our economy revival because nothing will happen unless we do something.  I sometimes watch news of ""Abenomics. "" In that news, some people say "" Business is improving"", but other people say "" I don't think business is improving. "" I don't know ""Abenomics"" well, but the rise in prices of everything is big problem for me. I started living apart from my family from this April, and I came to care the prices. I try to buy cheaper daily necessities, so a price rise bothers me. I hope the consumption tax won't rise.  I did not understand all about ""Abenomics"". But, I think it may be a mere facade that the media makes. The stock price and yen's worth true rose, but they were only temporary. Now, many problems happen. So, we must understand a fault of ""Abenomics"" and we need to think how to develop the economy in Japan.  I found it so difficult to understand what this article said. I don't agree with ""Abenomics"". This policy looks like the biggest gamble of Japan, in my opinion. This policy is carried out by Shinzo Abe in order to climb out of its deflation. The important part of this policy is Trans-Pacific Partnership ""TPP"". As he announced that Japan virtually took part in TPP, all goods became a target of negotiation. In short, it depends on negotiation whether TPP will power its economy or not. In fact, this policy is leading Japan in good direction so far, but there is no guarantee that things will go as planned. If this policy turns out to be a failure, this policy will cause stagflation which is called the worst economy. So we should think about this policy carefully.  I think ""Abenomics"" to be effective. When ""Abenomics"" fails, economy is confused, but the economy declines when we do not take action. Japan becomes surely like Greece if we do nothing. Unlike conventional three years, I thank for having taken action. Strong stimulation is necessary for the present economy of Japan.  The writer of this article casts doubt on ""Abenomics"". However, I do not think Abenomics have negative affects on our daily life. Since rising commodity prices means wage increase, and furthermore, low yen is good for export. As you know, we have little resources in Japan so we have to get foreign currency by exporting. All Abe doing things make Japanese economy pick up, I'm sure.  I am not familiar with economy. But when I hear the news, I think there is a gap between the government of Japan and the Japanese people. In other words, wealth people and people who make money on the stock market can really feel the effect of ""Abenomics"" , however, average people can't only feel it, but also their lives are being more and more hard. In the past, Japan went through the collapse of the bubble economy. So I think that the consumption will decrease rather than rise contrary to the rise in prices for fear of the second collapse of Japanese economy . Certainly we should evaluate the action present government have done and practicing their policy, but I think the government should formulate a policy directly connected with the life of average people.  Abenomics is too much a narrow-minded policy, I think. It's true that if you ease money, the money circulate more faster and the economy gets active. But that's only a theory. Abenomics relies too much on theory. It doesn't focus on the sight of individuals, from average to poor people. Thus, I think this policy won't last long.  I have a doubt for ""Abenomics"". Because it is groundless, and the rise in prices has not been accompanied with the rise in wage . Actually, there are a few people who answered that he or she receive a higher salary than he or she used to and economy is good now in a man-in-the-street interview . However, I think it is sure that many people are looking for the economy to make a recovery. So, I desire that good economy cycle is born and other countries whom economy influence Japanese economy become good, too.  Before reading this article, I knew the word ""Abenomics. "" The bold financial policy is thought as important. It is because there is a view of becoming an explosive of buoying up the economy if thorough money market relaxation is advanced. I think that this policy does not continue for a long time. Conversely, if there is a danger of causing the stagflation which is in the worst situation, I regard.  When I read this article, I was very surprised because the price of many things were increased. I didn't notice it. However, I don't think that ""Abenomics"" is just a bubble. There are some reasons. First, salaries is rising. For example, spring labor offensive in this year was succeeded. A lot of companies rise salaries. Second, consumption is increasing. Many consumers buy expensive things for mid-year gifts in this year. Finally, Japanese weekly magazines are mostly rubbish. Shukan Post is not exception, either. They only write gossip and lies. So I cannot trust this article because of quotation from Shukan Post.  I thought ""Abenomics"" to be good until I read this article. However, I know an particular person may profit by it and can't have a good feeling. If a salary does not go up and the consumption tax rises, a citizen will be angry with him and his policy. The government should consider our future economy again.  Abenomics goes well in theory but for the average citizen, it can be hardship. In my opinion, it's not a good policy that is dependent of only a theory. The good one is the plan that fully takes account of us, the average citizen. I think this policy will fall down before long.  Next April , the consumption tax will rise to 8% from 5%. Only this situation , our lives will somewhat be hard. And the effect of ""Abenomics"" is concerned. But I do not think ""Abenomics"" affects worse our lives. Because we should evaluate it for a more longer time. And I think policy about economy , politics and so on can not be evaluated over a short span exactly.  On 5.23, we had the stock market crash. Weather this happening is the fault of Abenomics is indistinct, but it surely damaged to the market. Today, the stock price is not stable. Then, why did this stock market crash happen? One of the optimistic ideas is that it was just an adjustment term. Until then, the stock prices sharply jumped, so investors sold their stocks to adjust the market. However, as a negative idea, the stock market crash meant the limit of Abenomics. Abenomics only aroused our customer interests, and it was not the structural reform. Therefore, it was bubble, and the stock market crash was the bursting of bubble and inevitable. To judge which idea is right, we should pay much attention to the economy.  I think people should wait to complain about 'Abenomics' at the moment. That is because we haven't really got to see how 'Abenomics' will impact on Japanese society yet. It is true that the rises in prices of everything has been forcing hardships to people in every social rank. However, it is also true that an economic boom should be caused by inflation too. So it is possible that an economy continues to improve by sustaining 'Abenomics' and people can easily buy expensive things. We should wait to see how the Japanese society will change from now on, and then criticize it.  I think ""Abenomics"" may be good to our society in the future. Now, the prices of everything from utilities to toilet paper, food to furniture, has already begun and will accelerate. The prices of everything is rising but not salaries. But the salary will rise, too. Then, ""Abenomics"" will be a good policy to us.  I can't judge 'Abenomics' produces a revival or a bubble because I am not an expert of economy but a general person. Recently news frequently reports that business has been recovering, but I feel these kinds of news don't have a clear basis or proof. Of course, it is the fact that the Japanese nation uses more money to anything. On the other side, it is also the fact that salaries hasn't risen at all. Therefore we feel distressed by higher prices rather than enjoy good time of business. In addition, I claim that the low yen is not always admirable. This is because Japan cannot work out without importing many sorts of stuffs. So, it is the most important for Japan to keep the best balance of the yen value.  I think that ""Abenomics"" is a makeshift. If the government help the economic, the Japanese economy can't recover. Because power of the Japanese economy is weak. The Japanese government should have different aim. It is no meaning that only economic development. We need that think about ourself happiness.  Abenomics made some motion of Japan's economy. Yen moved to cheap and stock price rose up. The time of the first, media reports recovery in the economy, and revival of bonus in large companies. Everybody of course me too, thought Japan's future is bright. But eventually, media started to tell us about inflation of prices, oil, gas, flour and bread. They reported that salary is not rising in almost companies. by the way, I want to buy Macbook, but it gone up about 10, 000 yen by weak yen. I couldn't comply, I realized rising price. But I don't curse Mr. Abe, I think he does good job. Politicians until now doesn't move to rebuild Japan's economy. On the other hand Mr. Abe put into practice. I think even if something doesn't good work, it's important whether to challenge, not just say.  When I read this article, I thought that the Japanese should know and be more interested in the information of the politics and the economy. Because most of the Japanese know the word of ""Abenomics"" but don't understand the meaning of this word. I can not have the actual feeling of this effects so I want this policy to success and lead the Japanese future bright.  I don't know what is the best way for Japan. ""Abenomics"" is the best way ? Maybe yes, but maybe not. The price of every things rises, this situation is not so much matter for rich person, but a lot of general person should upset. . This is rapid and drastic changes of economic structures. I hope this policy affects us better. We should continue to think about this problem carefully.  When I read this article, I was very shock. I was not too interested in ""Abenomics"" so far, but I believed that there is no demerit in the policy. However, a demerit written by an article occurred by""Abenomics"". I didn't know these facts at all. I reflected on not having been interested in politics so far. After all, it is bad not to know own country's detail. I want to study hard about this problem I thought Abenomics is good policy for us, but actually I can't judge whether this policy is good. Abenomics has many sides. The price is rising, but Japanese economy is getting better. People should judge this policy carefully. However, it is clear that no action can produce no good results.  Abenomics is very good opinion. Because, as a result, an economic recover. But I don't know anything. This policy is very difficult, so I can't understand. Japan will be better than any other country, and people will get a lot of wages. I want to be good by I graduate from KEIO! I think that ""Abenomics"" is a good plan. ""Abenomics"" revived the economy of Japan which had hung low. I think that economy will get confused if ""Abenomics"" breaks. In order that a country may make ""Abenomics"" successful, I want it to be consistent. I am opposed to a rise of a consumption tax. I think that people's consumption will decrease.  I think Abenomics is a bubble, as Shukan Post viewed. Of course it helps Japanese economy recover, but it is not sure that the effect will last for several years. This policy's purpose is to increase the amount of money on the market. However putting too much money at the same time may confuse the situation. Also Mr. Abe carries out deregulation and issues government bonds to activate the market, but it means that the amount of debt which we, young generation, have to pay off is increasing and our burden gets heavier and heavier. I understand that recovering from recession is very important, but the policy should be more sustainable.  I also regard a Abenomics as uneasy. Business has been improving recently. However, I think that it resembles the bubble economy. But, we only have believing the Prime Minister's thing. It is hoped, as it is, business of Japan continues improving. After business improves, it is expected that the wonderful life will wait.  It is fact that rising prices of goods hit our family budgets. From the this point, we will feel being poor. But , from the view of social security, if, by the whole of the society being better, government can do a better policy, we may be get real chance of being well. Government naturally have duty of persuade people. But we also have duty of believe our leader.  I was really shocked about this news. This is because, I thought Abenomics has just good influence for Japanese economic. But after I read this news I realized it has not good affect like a weak yen. We already get some bad influence. Also the news which I saw in this morning said, people who recommend Abenomics are less than people who are not recommend. It means many Japanese people are afraid of Japanese new economic style and not really recommend. So that we need to know both of good and bad effect of Abenomics.  I often watch the word ""Abenomics"" in newspaper and news program , but I couldn't explain the meaning of this word or get straight to the point. Economics is difficult to be predicted. If the Japanese economy is on track for recovery, it will not be able to guarantee to keep a good condition after several years, too. Therefore, I think ""Abenomics"" is not said to be effective easily. Also this article makes reference to the word of stagflation. The meaning of this word is prices have gone up in spite of salaries of people can't be raised or the number of unemployed people rises in depression. If ""Abenomics""will lead to stagflation, we will not get out ""Lost a score of years"". So that we have awareness of the issues of Japanese economy and check the movement in the government, may cause economic stability. I think we are only attracted to the charms of the word of ""Abenomics"" and believe to recover Japanese economy is danger.  After I read this article, I notice the influence of "" Abenomics"" which I have not been interested. A strong yen rate may have good influence for exporting, but it will theater our daily. In fact price for example Mcdonald's raises prices not only hamburger because I guess most of material of hamburger are imported from foreign countries. It is very small influence for rich people, but one for the middle class like us are so serious. The price increase makes our life needy and our demand is decrease. As a result it makes a recession. Of course I know the higher price are good for business conditions in theory. In fact exporting are better than ever and company's profits are increase. But salary are not increase, so ""Abenomics"" make a difference between rich people and poor people broader. I think ""Abenomics"" are not bad for economy. but it will not success without increasing salary.  Actually, i'm not understand about Abenomics well and economy well. But I think that a economic policy is have to reduce to every citizen, not a part of people. Now it maybe in the early stage of revival. We cannot hurry, and should to observe the circumstances.  Rising price is necessary for economic recovery. Actually, this phenomenon can be seen now and it was a part of""Abenomics"" from a beginning. However, this policy has many risks. It needs the corporation of the nation. Without persuasive explanation, people can't understand policy correctly and government can't carry out the plan. If the prices continue rising and salaries don't be raised, people won't buy things. The government should encourage people to buy for economic recovery.  I was surprised when I read this article because I thought Abenomics had very good effects to Japanese economics. But, it was not correct. Judging from this news, sudden weak yen or some economic action don't go far below the surface. I think if we improve our economics , we have to change fundamental system Before I read this article, I got a positive impression because it can help our lives better. I heard that economy was restored in news recently. However, according to this news, I thought this economic recovery to have possibilities to be only a temporary thing. After Next April the consumption tax is due to rise to 8% from 5%, I am afraid whether economy in Japan does not go to the bad direction.  Even though the economy tend to good direction, I can't call it succeed unless we feel ourselves wealthy. Off course, the increasing prices and taxes may revitalize the economy. But if our income doesn't increase, we only suffer from the rising. So I think president Abe should take action to better income for workers before raising prices . However, I feel he want to regain the wealth of bubble generation. As for me and the generation which doesn't know the bubble, it is so interesting revolution. So I don't want him to give up.  I don't agree with naoeID13018's opinion that business activity has gradually gotten better than at least before. According to the newspaper, the key point of ""Abenomics"" is TPP. It seems to raise investment flows between the countries and further improve their economic growth, indeed, but the products made in Japan are expensive in the world. No matter how larger the market becomes, high-priced goods remain hard sells. Eventually, the profit of the TPP will revert to the other country.  To be honest, I hardly knew about ""Abenomics"" before I read this article. I had thought it brings us a lot of good influences. But now I know it doesn't give us only good effects. And I understood why the prices of many things has gone up recently. Rising the price such as ""A McDonald's 100-yen Mac is now 120 yen"" is not a big deal for rich people, but for people who are not rich this would be a big effects. I know it is very difficult to control the economics and give good effects to everyone but I hope this situation will get better.  I don't agree with your opinion. Because I think people's salary will rise that can't say. And economics is difficult to be predicted. If ""Abenomics""will continue by Prime Minister Abe after several years, it will not say that can guarantee to keep a good condition. So I hope ""Abenomics"" will have a good effect on Japanese economy, but ""Abenomics"" is not said to be effective yet.  If the consumption tax rise from 5% to 8%, I will be damaged. For example, if we buy something at average 100 yen shop, I have to pay 108 yen. If we buy ""Umaibo"", we have to pay 11 yen. Its sales will be down! I don't agree with your idea. You said 'abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all' , but now some change is happening in the industrial world. Some big companies raised salary and gave bonus. This is clearly good for Japanese economy.  I think 'Abenomics' is very good plan. The price of everythings is rising, but salaries of people will be raising by companies. People should wait for good results from long term point of view. Because people wanted good results so early by now. Japanese people should have patience. In addition, only aiming for sensation, the mass media should not stir up worries of people. And we should pay much attention to the economy.  I agree with ID13006's take. I think only investors and big trading company have made profits and ordinary people cannot find any benefits of Abenomics. If Mr. Abe's ""groundless"" policies met with failure, it would take much time to recover Japanese economy.  I think that rising in prices of everything is necessary for Japan. But I don't want Abe to rise in prices of everything . Because the tax that I pay now is only consumption. So rising consumption is big problem for me.  I can't agree with your opinion. It is fact that Abenomics make tax rise. But this will make good affection to our life. For example, employment rate will rise by spread money. So we have to stand high taxes.  I agree with your comment. I think so that ""Abenomics"" are not bad for economy, but it's stopgap measure. If the ground of Japanese economy strong, we can say ""Abenomics"" succeed in recovering Japanese economy.  I agree with your opinion. I think the government cannot completely save economy now ""Abenomics"". It is not only"" Abenomics"", and a different policy is necessary for Japan. we should think about""what is the most important"".  There are many opinions about the Abenomics. Some say it endangers Japan's agriculture, others say like the articles. But the deflation that has been for 20 years itself is clearly bad situation. The Abenomics actually changes the situation. If it gives us bad effects, then we think about it. As Japanese government has taken no actions (as a result, the deflation continued), we shouldn't oppose the new actions without effective solution.  I agree with Abenomics. Of course prices are staying high but in the future, salaries will be raised and consumer will be more active. People should expect for this profit.  Before I read this article, I thought that Abenomics is very marvelous policy and includes no risk. But it becames to be wrong. Actually it may contains some risk, but I hope it will success and Japanese economy will revive.  I thought ABENOMICS is only a good policy. But this article said ABENOMICS have dangerous sides. People tend to support a sort term success. We should see a long term about ABENOMICS.  I almost agree with your opinion. Japanese prime minister Abe is getting Japanese economy recovered , but, on the other hand, he encourages public works. The Government shouldn't provide a cover for public works by the Abenomics.  I think the rapid changes in these days is scaring. In fact, I haven't got any jobs and paid my own living so far, and it is hard for me to realize the actual changes in economy directly, but compared to history, and considering the economical situation of past few years, the change seems too rapid. We cannot conclude whether the economic policy is right only from predictions, but if this is bubble economy, I'm pretty scared of the time for me to get a job.  I agree with you. Abenomics depends on the theory, so it discords with the real economy. Moreover, the blessing that Abenomics gives us is only for the rich. For example, investors get big money from high stock prices, while the poor does not have enough money to invest, so they cannot share the blessing. To make Japanese economy more stable and extensive, Abenomics has to make allowance for not only the rich, but the poor.  Abenomics has the risk, but it will be effective economic policy for the time being. Growth strategy after this is really important.  I disagree you. Abenomics has the risk, but it will be effective economic policy for the time being.  I disagree with your idea. This is because I don't think Abenomics' is not good plan. This is because price of every things are rising is harmful for poor people. I think one of the important recent problem of Japanese government is poor people cannot rise to the normal. So that Abenomics' is not good plan for Japan.  Abenomics has positive points and negative points. Policies of economy often have risks. But it is better to carry out policies than not to carry out anything. Sooner or later the result of Abenomics will be clear.  Abenomics is a Abe's political strategy. It's a plan to recover Japanese finance. Actually, almost of Japanese citizens expect it. Now, Not only a big company but also a lot of small businesses support Japanese economy. So I think ""Abenomics"" should have a good effect to them. Unless do it, ""Abenomics"" won't success I think Abenomics improve economic. But the products made in Japan are expensive overseas. And I have heard the prices are raised by yen rate changing. I also think Abenomics is not always good for people. Big company receives benefit but ordinary people don't receive it yet. Actually, I can't feel any benefit in my daily life. I hope Abenomics lasts long stably and happily for all, not only the rich but also the poor.  In order to make Japan better, economic policies are essential. Of course a weak yen is not the only good thing, but any economic policy has ambiguity. Abenomics has 3 course of action. To make economic policy successful is probably difficult, but I expect Mr. Abe will do well in the long term. Japan's Prime Minister always change soon, but political success need long time. Therefore, I want Mr. Abe to do carefully over a long time.  I disagree with your idea. You said 'abenomics is not good for Japanese economics at all' , but now some change is happening in the industrial world. Some big companies raised salary and gave bonus. This is clearly good for Japanese economy.  I cannot understand at all because I do not know well about abenomics but I think abenomics is a good plan because the price of everythings is rising, I will study more about abenomics from now.  I still think the Abenomics will have good impact on our lives in the long run. The rising of the price of everyday stuff sounds bad first but in the long run, it means high wages and more consumption. So Japanese economy will recover I'm sure.  I think Abenomics has produced a economic bubble. The definition of economic bubble is ""trade in high volumes at prices that are considerably at variance with intrinsic values. ""This applies to the economic in these days. But the media reports the positive dimension alone, and we can say we are deceived by them and the government. Thus it is difficult for us to grasp the real situation only from the information provided, and we have to learn to acquire what is called media literacy. "
JOC JOC-14B-12N 10.37 "As for this news about South Korean ferry, I know very well because we learned about this in spring semester in this class. Therefore, I was interested in this news when I found the headline. While reading this article, I was becoming angry to remember the detail of the news and how bad the captain's action was. I think the worst of his behavior was he himself could be alive although he didn't try to pay attention to his passengers and save their lives. If I were the protesters' position, I would want him to compensate his fault by death penalty. According this article, I knew the fact that the crew member steering the ship at the time of the accident was relatively new to the job and did not have the skills and experience required. This is very terrible situation and I think this kind of thing was caused by the government. There should be more and more strict rules because this would affect the people's lives, the most precious thing. In the trial in Gwangju, the captain said he was not in a normal state of mind when the incident occurred, however, I think this statement was not appropriate considering his responsibility. I also think the owner of the company and billionaire business Yoo Byung-Eun didn't have the responsibility toward the action, and he shouldn't have disappeared and died. To avoid this kind of thing happening again, all people whose jobs could have influence on lives should reconsider about how to behave.  Your opinion is very good and I in part agree with it. I think this accident was caused not only by the captain and the government, but also by other crews in the ship and the company executives. The terrible situation is due to both the government's loose regulation and the company's corrupt management system (that is the executive's fault). Prosecutors should not blame only on him. Those involved in the accident are all responsible for it. In addition to reconsidering how to behave responsibly at an individual scale, I want all the companies in the world to check whether their safe systems is valid or not.  I think the prosecution is too severe. What problem the death penalty solves? Does the prosecution pander to the lowest public opinion? The Korean judiciary should aim for discovery of the truth. Role of the judiciary is not to give the judgment which the nation hopes. If this goes on, South Korean hurt confidence in the justice system. I wish the judgment is given following the law.  When I heard this news, I thought it is very difficult problem. If I were one of families who lost their sons or daughters, I would be more angry. Thus I can understand people are angry like that. However, it is difficult to judge this accident. Of course the captain had fault but the ship had defective, too. Thus I thought this court in November has long time to judge.  This article is related to spring class, and I am interested in clue's responsibilities. This terrible accident is brought about by them. I think that although the captain of the ship did not have adequate action to passengers, the ship company which entrust the man who cannot do that as the captain may also be blamed on. As many people wish clues take a lot of punishment in the court, in the future not to repeat cruel accident proper judgements will be desired.  When I read this article, I grew impatient that the truth of this incident is not clear. I think that a captain of this ferry has hidden the truth yet. If my family has been involved in this incident, I would have gotten angry with the crew. However, this incident has not been clear yet. Therefore, it is very difficult to judge this incident. The trial cannot sentenced the defendant without positive evidence. I think that employees of transportation must not forget to have a responsibility of lives of passengers. I hope that a incident like this do not occur anymore.  I think it is necessary to ask for South Korean ferry captain, Lee Joon-Seok, to be sentenced to death. This is because he had escaped the ship without any efforts to rescue passengers and claimed the lives of a lot of young people. Moreover it will make incidents like this not occurred that prosecutors seek death penalty for him.  We read about this news in spring class. So I remember about this problem. I think the captain of ferry, Lee Joon-Seok, is lacking in a sense of responsibility. He should rescue the passengers before he leave the ferry, but he didn't. In addition, he tell a lie. It is very guilty. So, I think it is appropriate sentence.  As soon as I knew , I came outrage for Lee. Many lives are lost by his survive. I think he should guarantee passengers safety. So he should be sentenced death penalty.  I think the captain must be received a death sentence too. The captain was not at the helm of the vessel when it capsized, and jumped into a rescue boat before passengers. As a result, about 300 people were killed in the accident. therefore, he killed a lot people. So, I agree with prosecutor.  I do not think so. This news is simple. Ship accident was all captain's fault. I did not understand why he abandoned many passengers. The care of the passengers is a really important task for captain. He should not be permitted, I think.  The captain of the ship shouldn't be executed. But the he should make maximum compensation. His crime is very big. But the responsibility against which he couldn't take a measure at all at an accident isn't only his. For example the interest of the government which should make a system and the people who should audit. . . Everything lacked is a problem. The length of the ship should be the linchpin to improve future's marine accident as a person who experienced of a cruel and regrettable event. That's the compensation he should take.  The captain did shocking deed. His deed result to kill and pain many people and their family. I think It deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty. He did not do anything that must be done in this situation. There is no room for commiserating.  I think you are right. A captain of a ship have a responsibility to make sure the passengers' safety and security. But he betrayed them. The only man who can control the ship was the captain. So e evasion of his responsibility. Therefore it is natural that many Koreans think he deserves death penalty.  It is very difficult problem whether sentence should be heavy or light. In this case, ferry's captain didn't help passengers, but he escape from ferry first. I think it is very guilty action, because captain should help passengers first. If he had helped people, there would haven't much the dead. So, I think this sentence is appropriate.  Prosecutors seek death penalty for South Korean ferry captain. I think South Korean ferry captain should be death penalty. His crime which killed many people is very serious. His deed was not excused. And the owner of the company Yoo Byung-Eun disappeared after the disaster and was later found dead. His deed was also excused.  I agree with you. I think he deserves murder so the captain must be received a death penalty too. there is no room for him to run away.  I think Captain Lee made a serious mistake because more than 300 passengers were died in this tragedy. However, we should think carefully about death sentence. All the importance of the life is equal, among the captain and passengers. It is most important that the captain renounce his former sins and never cause such a disastrous accident.  I agree that the only man who can control the ship was the captain. However, he got rid of a passenger, and the action lead passengers to death. The feeling of bereaved will be unbearable other than the death penalty.  I think so, too. The captain should atone for his sin to work. Death sentence won't make anything. "
JOC JOC-15A-07N 10.09 "I felt very sad when I first heard about this news. Prime Minister is the top of Japan so at least he should be respected by people in Japan. However, the reality is so cruel that he got jeered by important anniversary day in Okinawa. I do not agree with the idea of changing Pacific Stance and constitution. Therefore, Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand.  It's difficult problem to solve whether for US troops to stay in Okinawa or to move away from Okinawa. Indeed it's heavy burden for Okinawa and people in Okinawa ask US troops to move away, but Okinawa is important place strategically. Especially, advance of China prove a great menace of Japan. Therefore we should discuss this problem.  I think government should be more careful about the American bases in Okinawa. People in Okinawa must have suffered from the existence of American troops. When I went to Okinawa, I thought the sound of Osprey was noisy. It noises all day. Such an experience may increase the people's opposition to government. Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa.  I think this is a difficult problem, but I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. When I went there last year, I was surprised that there were so large US bases, so I wonder the noises of bases would affect local people's life. However, some local people make their living by working at shop for solders. So this is very complicated problem, but I think government should try to reduce it.  Nowadays, the discussion on Article 9 of the Constitution is incandescent in Japan. The Prime Minister Shinzo Abe visited Okinawa to deliver a speech in this serious time. According to the current poll, only 29% of respondents support the Abe's security bills, while 53% oppose. Okinawa is a region where the only ground battle has been carried out in Japan. Therefore, people living in Okinawa have higher interest in this speech. NHK apparently did not report that the Prime Minister Abe was openly heckled by people in there. The difference of the foreign media and Japanese media was so impressive for me. I think the Japanese media should tell true things directly.  I felt very sad too when I read this news because Prime Minister is elected by the Japanese, and he tries to realize our hopes. So I think we should not jeer him. If people have some complaint, they have to appeal in another way. I agree with your idea that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa.  I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for he aid.  I agree with you because many Okinawa's people claim that the Japanese government should move American bases away from Okinawa. I think Okinawa's people don't receive a return by American bases. If the Japanese government continues to set American bases in Okinawa, Okinawa's people have the right to ask for return for aid.  It is good your example to understand the Okinawa's present. I have heard the news that people suffered from a serious illness because of noise. In the past, Okinawa's people sued the country for their damage from the sound of airport in 'Futenma'. It is difficult problem, but the Japanese government should solve it immediately.  I think this problem is very important for Japan. It has been just 70 years since the Second World War came to an end, but we should remember this war forever. When I was a junior high school student, I went to Okinawa on a school excursion. The main purpose of this excursion was not to commune with nature but to work the importance of peace. I was very surprised to realize the truth about this war. People in Okinawa told us to keep conveying how cruel it was, so we have a duty to think about it. I think it is natural that people tend to become emotional to listen Abe's speak. It is the evidence that people think about the peace in Japan seriously. To be indifferent is irresponsible. We must keep discussing the peace.  There are so many US bases in Okinawa. It's big problem, but they are really important for Japanese security. Umm. I think, biggest problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government as a Okinawa outlays. The amount of that money is amazingly 2.7 billion dollars(33 billion yen)in each year. Okinawa economics depend on this money. It's not good for Okinawa in long term, I mean Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong.  I think that Japanese people should think about a military base. This spring vacation, I visited Okinawa. Then I looked American base near the American village. I looked an airplane took off from the base. The airplane was very fast, so I think that it is very dangerous. Around the american base was very noisy. Therefore I think that the base gives harm to neighboring inhabitants. There are various opinions about the armed forces. However many people think that we have nothing to do with this problem. All in all, I strongly believe that all Japanese people should think about American bases in Okinawa.  I am opposed Prime Minister Sinzo Abe reinterpreting the pacifist constitution. However I agree to revise the constitution. It is necessary for two points of view, I think. First, if we leave the Constitution of Japan as it is, Article 9 of the Constitution is incompatible with right to collective self-defense. We should revise the Article 9 of the Constitution, and specify the existence and the part of the Self-Defense Force. If we reinterpret the pacifist constitution, it only makes vagueness about the Self-Defense Force. Second, to revise the constitution is not equal to plunging into war, and we have to be able to defend our country against the enemy. A speech full of high-sounding ideas leads to decline the strength of a nation.  I think not waging is most important thing for Japan. If war will happen by reinterpreting the pacifist constitution, I opposed the government of Prime Minister Sinzo Abe. The war hurt many people not only Japanese troops but also American troops. We have to avoid this situation as far as possible.  Indeed, US air bases bring great harm to Okinawa and eliminating them may be the best way to remove that pain. However, they are key to Japanese defense capacity. In addition, it needs a enormous costs if we build a new substitute base, so removing the bases from Okinawa is very difficult, I think.  I think this is a difficult problem. If I ware people in Okinawa, I were angry with Abe like people in article. However, there are no place where the American bases are replaced. We should think a new solution to solve this problem.  I thought that it is difficult problem when I heard this news. And I thought that people who live in Okinawa should not do only jeering Shinzo Abe, because this action doesn't make better solution. Japanese government should think better solution about this problem and think as people who live in Okinawa . For example, to move the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan.  As this article says, it is a very uncommon occurrence for a Japanese Prime Minister to be openly heckled by general public. I think it proves that the Okinawans' complaint reaches its peak. I think Abe should care about them more. I can't agree with recent Abe's strong stance on changing Japan's security arrangements. If he keeps it, I think the approval rate will continue to fall.  I think, the reaction is reasonable for people in Okinawa. Okinawa has the terrible history. Many people still suffer from it. Besides, there are many US military base and these are threatening their way of life. So, it is natural that they got angry to Abe's insensitive attitude. Japanese government should concern Okinawan more.  Okinawa has a lot of US military bases. It's very serious and difficult problem. When I went to the Futenma base of Okinawa last year, I found that the residential area is very near the base. It is natural that people in Okinawa have dissatisfaction in the base and Abe's policy. Government should do their best.  Today, Okinawa has a lot of bases. It's natural that Okinawans should be angry for this. However, we shouldn't jeer in the reception marked the 70th anniversary of the battle of Okinawa. It is being a glorious. No matter how angry, they shouldn't bring their thinking in it.  Your are right in point of capturing feelings of Okinawans, but Japanese government has already concerned about Okinawans in a way that giving money. It's just money but 300 billion yen for each year. I think it so large support for them.  It is a serious problem that we must think about. I take a neutral position. I understand their worry about Abe's policy, while they are not allowed to jeer at Prime minister Shinzo Abe. Unless the two sides understand mutual thought, they will not make concessions.  Okinawa has the history that Okinawa was occupied by the US military. It is result of Japan's ability lack of defense Okinawa in WW2. After the war, US military thought Okinawa is the best place to display the power of USA in east Asia, so they have kept place their base though Okinawa was returned to Japan in 1972. Now, Okinawa is the forefront of Japan defense so there is no choice to remove all of the base but I think Japan and USA have to relieve Okinawa's burden. If we won't do so, Okinawa people's anger will be harsher.  It is very rude to jeer the Prime Minister at the formal ceremony. In Japan freedom of speech is secured in the Constitution of Japan, even the statement that ""Two newspaper in Okinawa should be dissolved. "" by one private writer Hyakuta Naoki. But the jeer at the ceremony is blameworthy. It is illogical. No one is allowed to interrupt the ceremony. By the way, we should know that all people in Okinawa disagree with the relocation of a US military base to Henoko. Rather, people in Henoko agree with that relocation. To cope with the threat of China, presence of US military is necessary.  Reducing American bases significantly would be impossible, but it should reduce at least from current situation. To impose the burden on Okinawa is not good. Terrorism cannot be prevented only there is a base. National defense should be reconsidered by a national.  Under the present circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. In the Hatoyama administration of the Democratic Party, he said that ""to outside the prefecture at least. "" I assumed that his remark made US military base problem complicated. The government lost the trust of people in Okinawa. However, I think not only people in Okinawa but the Japanese should consider Japan's future seriously in the 70th anniversary of the end of the war.  It is very important and difficult issue. We should think it and we must not wage the war again. The Japan of today, people argue security-related legislation heatedly. I want the politicians to argue this issue carefully.  I agree with you. They should avoid such action at the grave ceremony even though they have bad feeling for PM Abe. I think that there are many different ways that they claim their opinions.  I think it is not too much saying that the jeering at Abe in inevitable. Now his political policy is not agreed by many people. The lowest rate of the support for his cabinet shows this fact. Of course, battle of Okinawa ceremony is so important and should not be interrupted. But, the residents of Okinawa are the people who know it best. The locals who heckled Abe must also have known that. Maybe, they cannot help hitting dissatisfaction to Abe. They wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice.  I think jeering Prime Minister Shinzo Abe in the ceremony is not good. I guess a complaint of people in Okinawa about noise of American army. And also, I take it granted for they get angry. However, such an action shouldn't be done in the formal ceremony. This news were reported all over the world. Japanese people would be thought as people without common sense.  The problem of moving US bases in Okinawa is difficult, because everyone don't allow move where they live in. I understand the people in Okinawa angry with Japanese government. That Mr. Abe appeared ignored the beer is good but the government should discuss them about this problem. And all Japanese people should know history of Okinawa and think about the US bases in future.  Your opinion is very interesting. In Japan, it is rare that people jeer at prime minister rudely at formal ceremony, as the news story said. But, in this case, the local's jeering at Abe is the natural reaction to the policy of present cabinet. And they have a purpose to show their anger to him by daring to heckle rudely him in the ceremony. In formal ceremony, Abe cannot ignore their voices. In addition, I think a little differently to you regarding the presence of US military. Strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. So we must discuss it carefully.  The problem that American bases should be moved to main land is very difficult to solve because Okinawa is imposed on too big burden but Okinawa is very important in view of military geography. Therefore Japanese government must convince the people of Okinawa that American bases are necessary to protect Japan.  I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. If reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution is allowed, Japan would face a crisis of war. Though I have not experienced war, I understand how dreadful war is. Therefore, I never want to experience the war. We have to consider about this issue and try to find out the proper way to avoid the war.  I agree with you. Not waging war is not only important for Japanese people but also people of other countries. We should find out the way of not allowing reinterpretation of the pacifist constitution.  Surely, it is hard job to remove the US bases from Okinawa. However, I strongly believe that we should put away the heavy burden of Okinawa by removing or reducing the bases.  I can understand Okinawan posture. They suffer many harms from US troops. But I still think Japan need US bases. If we eject them, Japan will be aim by neighbor Asian country, for example, Korea and China. We can get security and relief therefore we are protected by them. Only Japanese Self-Defense Forces can't protect there. So I agree with Abe's policy.  I disagree with Abe's quest to end Japan's strictly defensive posture recently because there are possibility that we will be involved in the dangerous situation. Even if he says that we won't be involved in the war, the situation of the future can't be known to anyone. Once the war brakes out, the cruelty of the war stays with people in that generation for long time. In addition, we should keep in mind that people in Okinawa have long been asked to carry a big burden for our security.  I agree with your idea that Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government and it's not good for there in long term, but I think making new original industry by using given money is important now.  I disagree with the policy of Abe administration. Okinawa has serious and difficult problems about a lot of US military bases. Under this circumstance, it is difficult to improve the relationship between Okinawa and the Japanese government. The people who live in Okinawa wanted to show their anger and disagreement with Abe's policy in public. So, Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough.  I think so , too. Japanese government is forced to take consideration both of people in Okinawa and American government. In this situation, making decision must be difficult. However, if they put off taking measures, the problem won't be solved.  I agree with you. We don't know about WWII enough. Besides, understanding of history is different by each countries, that have caused many problems. So, we should learn and discuss our nation's history more deeply and mustn't forget the terrible affair.  I think so too. If nobody complain to Abe, our democracy break down. We shouldn't forget the main constituent of the politics is Japanese citizen. Not politician. ""Abe cannot ignore them"" in your opinion is very important.  I understand how Okinawans feel, but at the same time I think it is not only Prime Minister Abe's fault. He is doing his best trying to reduce their burden as much as possible as he said in his speech. I hope Okinawans will stop jeering or complaining and instead, we, including Okinawans and others like me should focus on finding out solutions. I would like to think about why the American bases are still in Japan while nobody wants it in his neighborhood. And if we still need bases. where can be used? This problem is so difficult. I think so, too. I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But, you know, this does not make things better. I think your opinion is not bad. but, where is the big island where people don't live. Every governor don't want to undertake American bases.  Your experience in spring vacation is so nice. The laud sound of a military plane is understood by only people in Okinawa. so, your opinion is so persuasive. We Japanese should think this problem. Where is the best place of the base of America? Everyone doesn't know.  Okinawa's bases are so many. I thought this is natural, but this is troublesome thing for the people in Okinawa. I think your opinion is correct. But, I think jeering isn't bad. I can understand what you think. I think Abe's attempt is bad, so raising an objection is natural.  I agree with your opinion. The relationship between Okinawa and the government won't be better. But, I think the relation between Okinawa and America is so strong. This isn't weak. So, what I want to say is replacing the bases of America can't be done. You said, ""Abe should take this jeering seriously as the local's voice and should look for a breakthrough. "" This is the very main opinion. Whether jeering is good or bad is not a problem.  Your opinions are correct, but my opinion is difficult to yours. I think revising the article 9 of Japanese constitution is needed. Now Japanese Self Defense Forces can't move freely by the constitution. I think this is so bad. revising constitution doesn't equals facing a crisis war.  I think so too. Many people of Okinawa want to remove the bases, but people in other prefectures also refuse them. However, we cannot easily remove them because the US bases are important to national defense. We should consider this issue by the entire nation.  I think jeering is the act which is allowed. But, I think this does not make things better. Many people say, ""Replacing the bases of America is needed. But, I want to say ""where is such a place?"" Every governor don't want to undertake such a military base. Also, I think revising article 9 is needed. I think the country which don't have military and the country which can't have military is different. We Japanese must have responsibility of international society. For example, Japanese Self Defense Forces(JSDF)can move if the transportation is absolutely safe. This is so bad. So, we should revise the constitution.  I think, people complain of not only noise but also more things. This problem isn't so simple.  When I read the news, I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly. Of course, I know that people in Okinawa had caught pain and sorrow in WW2. But reproaching to Abe is not produce any good result. And government should be more considerate of people in Okinawa, particularly US military base. People in Okinawa and government should more compromise.  I'm very surprised at hearing the news. It's generally said that Japanese people don't express our mind clearly, especially in politics. however, in this news, Okinawans express their mind strongly. I think it's great because democracy is protected by positive participations of civilians. But then this means like jeering others is unsuitable. I suggest that civilians participate politics positively and peacefully.  I felt sad too when I heard about this news. But when it comes to change the constitution, I think people pay attention too much article 9. I think plunged into war is against and agree that Abe should think about how people feel, not how Americans feel or demand, but people should be flexible.  I think Abe should try to decrease the burden of Okinawa too. US military base should move to abroad near by Japan. placing the military base is mistaken utilitarianism for people in Okinawa.  I worry about Okinawa people may think Japanese government is making light of their prefecture. Okinawa people have pride as Okinawan and Japanese. We have to consider the complex feeling of them.  I want to understand the Okinawans' feelings, but I think those behavior were so rude to the Prime Minister. If they wanted to insist their opinions, they had to have a sense of occasion. Japanese people must not forget the history of the Battle of Okinawa. However, when we talk about it or try to solve problems relative to the Battle of Okinawa, we have to deal calmly with it.  I agree your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong. Okinawa should not rely on US military base forever I agree with a part of your opinion, but I do not think that the Prime Minister was elected by the Japanese. If all or most of the Japanese people hoped that Mr. Abe becomes a Prime Minister, so many people do not jeer him. His policy is been criticizing by many Japanese from long ago. That is a serious problem. I think it is also a problem that many young people are not interested in the Japanese politics. Therefore, the Prime Minister and the Japanese citizen have to make a better policy for the future in Japan.  The Battle of Okinawa is the big matter which Okinawa people can't forget. That evidences have existed in Okinawa. I think that the most biggest negative legacy is USA camps. these camps are danger of Okinawa and support for Okinawa economy. If Okinawa need USA camps is issue that Okinawa should decide, but I want that Okinawa people live happily and safety. Finally, I think all of Japanese should not forget the Battle of Okinawa and that war.  I am against an opinion of Abe. I worry about Okinawan, so I empathize Kakazu. He said "" It was innocent civilians who suffered"". I think that is right. In the first place, I dislike Abe's think in recent. I don't want to go war, so we must not do war. Now, we think this issue.  I was surprised to read this article. I have been thinking that Japanese people don't express their feelings strongly in public. I think that means they can't stand it any more. we should reconsider this matter seriously.  I think so. Jeering produce nothing. There are possibility to occur emotional confront between jeering people and jeered people. They should discuss that issue calmly.  I think US 's Okinawa bases should be moved. Of course, historically, Okinawa was not belong to Japan and Japan conquered Okinawa at war. In the same way, US conquered Okinawa at WWII. Therefore the problem of US bases is partly inevitable. However people in Okinawa is suffered from the problems which US bases cause. The government should consider the people in Okinawa at the best.  I think your opinion is true! This news is very difficult problem. I dislike Abe's opinion. He doesn't make new better solution. His opinion jeer Okinawan. I understand Kakazu's objects.  I heard this news, I think that it is difficult problem. I think We decrease burden of Okinawan. Replacing the bases of America is needed. This sentence is very good!! Your opinion is very interesting and true! I talk about this problem with you.  I can understand that people in Okinawa criticize the policy by Prime Minister Abe. This is because the people living in Okinawa have had a very unbearable experience since World War II was finished. But we cannot answer where we should let a US base in Okinawa move. Even if the government moves the base to other areas of Japan, this isn't the truth solution since the local people living there start to criticize the government. I think that I cannot but have people living in Okinawa endured this problem until Japanese Government succeeds in negotiations with the US Government.  I feel it difficult to move US military facilities from Okinawa at the moment. Indeed they must be moved from Okinawa, but it can't be solved between only the Japanese government and Okinawa Prefecture. Maintaining the good relationship with America is aiso important. And the Japanese government has not found new places to move them yet. In any case, I think, Abe should restore Okinawans' trust and attempt to repair the relationship with Okinawa Prefecture.  I think that criticism for government should be done in appropriate way. Even if the insistence is right, they should not say in formal ceremony, because it is annoyance for many people who want to celebrate the 70th anniversary of the end of the battle of Okinawa.  When I read this article first, I that the Okinawans are imposed on a big burden. At the same time I thought that this problem was a difficult problem to be concerned with both diplomatic problem with the United States and problems of the domestic administration called the correspondence to the objection of citizens of Okinawa and inhabitants of other base laying proposed sites.  I also think it is very difficult issue.  Your opinion is definitely sure. But I think people in Okinawa make a profit too. When I tripped to Okinawa, I was taught by local people that many people work at the store near American bases, and if they were reduced, their jobs were reduced too.  I think so, . Nothing is settled only by jeering and thinks that the situation does not advance at all. I think that the people in Okinawa should take a little more political method.  Your opinion is definitely sure. But think the right of collective self-defense should be permitted because it is permitted in public international law. Quite a lot of countries have the right now, but almost of them do not go to war. I think Japan will not go to war either as soon as it is permitted.  I am against war. I am from Hiroshima. So, I learned about terror of war when I was an elementary student. Not only people in Hiroshima but also people in Okinawa Learned it. Therefore, people in Okinawa don't want there to be another war. If Abe pushes ahead with plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution by all means, he must explain the safety of it to the Japanese people.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. Indeed people in Okinawa are very angry about government action. But they have to be more serene.  I agree with you. I really looked the US base in Okinawa, I think that it heavy burden for people who live in Okinawa.  I think so. This is difficult problem, so we should consider new solutions to solve this problem.  Thank you. I can't say that the best place because I don't know about this problem. I think that other people don't think about this problem, too. Therefore Japanese government should make opportunities to think.  I agree with you. This is very difficult problem. However we should think about this problem. I really looked US base in Okinawa and I feel that it was very dangerous. I think that Japanese people should go to Okinawa and look US bases really.  It is ceremony to give a silent prayer to a person killed in battle of Okinawa. They shouldn't have taken a subject of the timely politics and discussed about it, much less jeer. I think that the citizens of Okinawa should have shown memorial will to a person killed in the war. The problem of the base transference establishes the place elsewhere and should be argued.  I agree with your opinion. I think they should have acted after having considered how their actions are considered according to others. They might be better if they were calmer.  It is true that Okinawa has burden and must be relieved. However, jeering is not smart. They should talk more carefully.  I partly agree with you. But Mr. Abe don't think about only Americans. He must think about Japanese too.  I agree with you. Keeping peace is very important. And we must discuss how peace is kept and we should do.  I think so. Japanese government must consider both of people in Okinawa and the USA. This problem is not only about people in Okinawa but also for all Japanese people.  I agree with you. The problem is Okinawa got and will get too much money from Japanese government. And I don't how much money they are given. I know just now! thank you! Your experience is so persuasive! If my house were near the base, I might feel fear. We must think about the current Okinawa people's feeling,  I think that it's a very difficult problems, too. I oppose Abe's policy. Why does he do such a. thing! And American military affairs should not only the problem of Okinawa.  I think this problem is very difficult. To solve this problem, it is necessary to agree by most of Japanese. We have to think what to do for this problem.  I think Okinawan's replay is very good. Because they can speak freely to politician. This country is liberal. l I think Abe's policy is selfish. Abe must think okinawan people and environment.  I think Japanese people who do not criticize people in public got angry and, jeered meant misery of people in Okinawa.  I felt it was so difficult to solve the problem of the U. S. army in Okinawa after all. The problem has been discussed for a long time, but still now, Japanese people and the government push the problem onto only Okinawa. Therefore, we have to know about the present situation there and insist our opinions strongly. For example, with SNS, we can criticize and argue with people all over the world about the problem. Many criticisms can move Japanese government and also American one, I hope.  Shinzo Abe is in a very difficult position now. Japanese usually don't do the jeering like this so Okinawans have a great frustration, I think. This problem is treated as a problem of Okinawa and our government but this is a problem of all of Japanese people. This recognition is important.  I agree with you. Most Japanese tend to think it is a problem of Okinawa, but they should think it is a problem of whole Japan.  I agree with you. I were also angry with Prime Minister Abe's idea, if I lived in Okinawa. However, if we think of nothing but our own interests, we can't decide how to do from now on. So this is a really difficult problem.  I partially agree with you. Strictly speaking, jeering about political issue is not suitable at the solemn memorial service. So people might have to mind their languages. However I can understand their feelings. They may be too dissatisfied about the American military bases in Okinawa to behave in a disciplined manner. Even if the way was wrong, their strong feelings must have reached Abe. I think it was valuable thing.  I also think they appealed their argument in an improper way, and they should have taken other one, if they really want their opinion appreciated and supported by the general public. They should take into account the fact that every opinion is evaluated with images they make when they represent it. Anyway, we Japanese did elected Mr. Abe indirectly, and we have responsibility to continue criticizing what he does. And I think he manages relatively well in many fields so far except for the present constitutional question, considering the fact that no politician could make all the current Japanese political problems solved completely.  This problem is so difficult for America and Japan. The best way I think is American's Army leave Okinawa to remove Okinawa's dissatisfaction. However it is hard to realize this idea because of America's pressure. I think any prime minister maybe can't find perfect answer.  I agree with you. We have to know the president, Okinawa's and Japan's situation for the future.  I think Shinzo Abe should think more deeply about the problem of Okinawa and America. To reduce a big burden for people of Okinawa, he and us have to think about the solution. I think to solve the problem completely is very difficult, but we should do in the position of people of Okinawa. So we do, Okinawan people's frustration and anger will be reduced a little bit about the problem.  These days, more and more Japanese people especially young people lost interest toward politics. According to this article, prime minister Abe isn't respected. I guess we should be interested in politics and our prime minister's action, then will find new ideas how to deal with this matter.  This problem is very difficult but all Japanese people have to think about this as a Japanese people. I think the problem happened from the history state will not solve completely. Many people have various thinkings about. Abe should think more carefully about this problem. Now, the relation between America and Japan is good and they should help each other for the future. Also, we should think about Okinawa people mainly. Their pain may have continued long time.  I think so, too. In rivalry with each other, the discussion with cursing and jeering cannot produce good conclusions. I want them to perform a calm and careful discussion.  I think this problem is difficult. But I think Japanese government should more think seriously about US military facilities in Okinawa. I think that Abe should think about how people feel. it is difficult to solve this problem, but Abe should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa.  It is difficult to solve the problem. But Prime minister Shinzo Abe didn't enough explain. the point is so bad and he should more effort to be understanding the problem .  I think that it is complicated problem. As you know, we don't want to be included in a war, but Japan has to solve another problem, American military base in Okinawa. Mr. Abe said that we should reduce the difficulty of American base by changing our constitution. I suppose that it is the last way we decide. It is risky to change the constitution. To sum up, we had better not change the constitution. Saved by The USA is the best way.  I agree with you. Certainly, we have not to blame heavy burden on only Okinawa but there is very important place for Japan's defense strategically. In the future, China's act of aggression will more harsher than now I think. We can't defense our nation only self-defense forces so we have to cooperation with US military and they need to place the base in Okinawa. We must discuss about this problem carefully.  I also think that this problem is difficult. I think we should take away heavy burden of Okinawa, but US troops are necessary for Japan. If we move this into Honshu, the people in the land will disapprove. We should think about this problem carefully.  I think the problem about US troops in Okinawa is very difficult issue. Primeminister Abe's determination is not in accordance with Okinawa residents' views, so it was natural that Abe was jeered by people in public. they have rights to insist their opinions to him. But the top man in Japan should not be like this situation people have big discontent of dissatisfaction. Japanese people have to think more about the Okinawa problem I agree with your opinion. Japanese young people should have more interests toward Japanese politics and have more knowledge and opinion to politics. Young people can active to insist their opinion with more liveness than older people. Young people's activity can change Japanese politics.  I partially agree with you. I sympathize with people in Okinawa. However, they should not shout ""Go home!"" in such a formal ceremony. I think the discussion with jeering get serious the relationship between Okinawa and the government.  I felt sad when I read this article, because I think there are some another ways to convey thoughts. We Japanese should not jeer him. I think that problem is so difficult, so Japan should consult carefully.  I agree with you. This problem is so difficult, so Abe should think more deeply and carefully about it too. And we must be interested in that problem and think deeply too.  Your opinion interested for me. As you say, in this news, Japanese people who usually can't express their mind express their feeling clearly for Abe. I think it is not a little the number of Japanese people who have a strong mind or thinking for a political problem.  I agree with your opinion. In Okinawa, there are a lot of people who are suffered from US troops. But it is obviously, Okinawa is very important place strategically. So we have to think about this problem more seriously. As long as we can, we have to think this in terms of people of Okinawa I agree with your opinion. People in Okinawa have suffered from American troops. But Japanese people who do not understand the feeling and the suffering. I have not been there. I cannot feel their burden. Your story about the people of Okinawa is real voice. I think their burden is much bigger than we expect. So we are same the Japanese, we also think about solution to reduce their burden.  I agree with your opinion. It is so useful a way to express my opinion by using SNS such as LINE and Twitter since people all over the world utilize it. But if you comment on the web, you should be careful not to criticize the Japanese government for the USA military base in Okinawa recklessly. I can understand a little that Japanese government has made an effort to remove Okinawa's burden by continuing to negotiate with the USA. It is certain that the negotiation between Japan and USA hasn't improved for about 6NA years and people in Okinawa are frustrated for a long time. But I think that we should expect the Abe Administration make more effort to solve the problem. What we can do to support the Japanese government is not only criticize Abe's policy but also believe. However, we need to watch whether the Japanese prime minister pursues proper diplomatic policies.  I agree. I thought people in Okinawa should be calm down to Prime Minister Abe and should not jeer unduly.  I think they have to be more serene. they shouldn't jeer unduly.  I gave way to my anger to Abe's attitude to Okinawans when I finished reading this article. Japanese government should make a consultations on the matter of American military bases. Japanese government sticks to their beliefs. That isn't good attitude to another government. I think what is important is not how make Americans satisfied but Japanese satisfied.  I understand your opinion and I don't want to experience the war, too.  I disagree with your opinion for some reasons. It is true that some people say that strong connection with America may be taken as hostility by China. However, China is going into the South China Sea and conflicting with the Philippines. And I think that China is unworthy of discussing. In fact, The Chinese Communist Party is infringing on rights of people in Tibet and Uighur. Therefore China is untrustworthy.  I agree with you. Japan mustn't break the relation to America by any means. But Japanese government mustn't ignore Okinawan opinion because Japanese government adopt parliamentary system of government. I think Japanese opinion isn't definite, so American government doubt Japanese attitude. My opinion is Japan shouldn't lose bases from Japan.  I think we shouldn't happen war and know about WWII, too. But this problem isn't easy to solve. If neighbor countries attack Japan, we only fight to defend Japan. All the country don't have principle of peace. So Japan must deploy army.  I agree with you. I think we must keep to remember WWII, too. And we should study the war in detail and tell future generations. About the problem of US based in Okinawa, we must think it steady rather than other people's affairs.  Certainly, we have freedom of speech in Japan, but jeering at the Prime Minister at the official ceremony should be forbidden. We have rights to elect our representative. If we think Abe is not right, we can remove him for the Prime Minister. If our freedom of speech were not guaranteed such as China, we could jeer at, strike, and kick the Prime Minister.  Certainly, using SNS and discussing the issue with people worldwide is very important and worthy of promoting. However, at the same time, we must improve our media literacy. On Twitter we can often see people who are deceived by information. We have to know that some powerful people can benefit if we are deceived by information on the Internet.  To begin with, people in Okinawa (who have Japanese nationality) are Japanese. You distinguish Japanese people from people in Okinawa. It is very wrong. Japanese people and people in Okinawa have the same rights as Japanese nationality. We Japanese should cooperate together to cope with the changing situation in East Asia.  I agree that it is a difficult issue to be discussed when considering of both Japanese people and relationship with the United States. I think it is natural for Japanese people to pay a lot of attention for the Article 9 because nobody want our country to be involved in a war. However, I understand it is not right to make Okinawa taking all the burdens. People should think from wider perspectives.  I agree with your opinion. You gave a good example. I think Noise problem is important point, too. There is the fact that people which live in Okinawa can't live comfortably because of noise by American based. So, Japanese government should solve it.  Our generations are being forgotten the memory of World War II . We must not forget it. We have a duty which tells future generations because it will teach important of peace to us.  When our position changes, our feelings and opinions will also change. As Japanese nationality, I support the construction of a new US base. Today the world is changing. China is threatening the neighbor's countries such as Japan. Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.  You were so splendid to go to Futenma base. As the residential area is near the base, the danger of accidents is left. To remove the danger, the construction of a new US base to Henoko should be advanced.  I think that the Japanese should give an opposite opinion to the Government aloud. And to express an opposite will into the world helps to change the present conditions. But I also think that jeering in the ceremony is not good.  No one wants to allow the US bases in the place where they live. So the problem of moving US bases is difficult. People of Okinawa may feel that they have no friend in Japan. We should make maximum efforts to reduce a burden of Okinawa as a same Japanese.  However I had known the fact that there are a lot of American bases in Okinawa, I was surprised at what no less than 0.7 of those are. I think Japanese government force Okinawa to bear burdens which is too heavy. Of course, I know that there is no room to set bases in other prefectures, too, though I believe the government must improve this state.  I agree with your opinion. Since China develops recently, it is no use insisting that it is necessary to allow US troops to stay in Okinawa.  I agree with your opinion. I have not been to go to Okinawa, so I have not know how Okinawa's dairy life. Reading your comment, I would like to think this problem again.  What you say is the right thing, but there are no other place which is willing to accept the burden in Japan. I also think that forcing a disadvantage is not a good thing and sharing it is good thing, but no one wants to have it. This is very difficult problem.  I agree with your opinion very strong. Indeed the noise of the plain is very loud. And The plain flies around the city, there are many schools, companies, people, this situation is very dangerous. But American troops are very important for Japanese international situation.  I generally agree with your idea. However, my opinion includes a different point. In representative democracy, The Prime Minister isn't elected directly by the Japanese nation. The election of The Prime Minister don't always reflect the voice of the nation at that time exactly. Therefore, I believe it is necessary that people insist on our minds in politics strongly like Okinawans.  I think this problem is difficult too. people in Okinawa want the American bases to leave Okinawa but people in other prefecture will not welcome them.  The problem of US military base in Okinawa has been one of the most serious problem in Japan for a long time after World War 2. People in Okinawa have been suffered from noise that makes during training and some members of military committed a crime before. It may be true that US military base is needed to continue friendly diplomacy with United states, but Prime Minister Shinzo Abe need to not only pay attention to international relationship but also listen to Japanese people's voices.  I agree with your opinion that changing constitution is very risky, but is it best way that we are saved by America? The cost of US military base occupies much of the budget of Japan and people in Okinawa have suffered from noise. Like these, there are many problems related US military, so I don't think saved by America is best way. We have to considerate and search another way of saving our Japan.  the battle in Okinawa was the one of the most cruel battles in WWII. I watched lots of documentaries on TV about this battle and many innocent citizens are murdered. We shouldn't put the American military base in Okinawa since they are some traumas or to say we put them as victim instead of the mainland. Thus it is not abnormal that people in Okinawa protest against Mr, Abe.  We should show the world that we are not monkeys who only consult someone, but we also can't deny that we are being consulted by someone to be built many basements in Okinawa.  i'm in favor of your idea. I think the USA basses are important for Japanese differences too. because Japan can not attack for constitution. so we need country which protect us. But of course Okinawa people's lives is first of thinking.  I agree with you. this is a difficult problem. We should think a new solution to solve this problem. I am of the opinion that we should change bases place. However, here are no place where the American bases is replaced.  When I read this article I thought the USA bases have to be remove from Okinawa. But when I thought deeply , I felt the bases are important for Japanese defenses and OkinawaS economy. Because Japan can't attack to other country, so we need country which protect us. And the USA's soldier help for Okinawa economy.  I agree with you. I saw current rate of Abe. That is less than 50%. I am of the opinion that he should change the stance to the Okinawa's people.  I agree with you. Your idea of moving the base to the island where people don't live in very much in Japan is very good. This can solve a lot of problems we suffer.  I think this problem is very important for us. Japan have no army, so the link is necessary between Japan and US But I cannot agree with Abe's idea. Japan lost WW2. And this cause Japan to walk to peace.  I think Mr. Abe try to compromise with Okinawa citizens. this is because when citizen are angry with their master, the master also can't do politics , well. So it is necessary for Mr. Abe to change his thoughts.  I partly agree with you. We should remove the bases in order to keep Okinawa safe. I hear that the percentage of dependent rate which Okinawa economy occupy is about 0.1. I think this is very small. We need not have American bases.  I see your point. But I am of the opinion that the master can do local politics. He should more think about the feeling of people of Okinawa and the merit of country.  I also have never seen the series of ""Star Wars"". So I didn't understand the relation between Chewbacca and Darth Vader. So when I read the topic sentence at first, this news is funny too. But like your opinion, I think it shouldn't be news handled as a comedy. After we know this news, we have to reflect how we misunderstand about democracy. Anyway, I am interested in your opinion"" If I attract attention, I will do a method similar to them. . . . "" In my opinion, there was not the sympathy about the Ukrainian repulsion to the government. I think their styles of expression are illegal in term of a public election. But after I read your opinion, I reconsidered it a little. Certainly, if they were convinced of a defeat in normal method, I can understand they struggled to won for becoming a mayor in the style. We have to think of this news with taking into consideration of Ukrainian minds not only a law.  I think that Japanese people are liberal. We can shout out the prime minister to his face . This is very good . But I want the government to carry on what they said.  I completely oppose plans to reinterpret the pacifist constitution. Although unfortunately, I have to accept the size of the US presence on Okinawa for to save the current pacifist constitution. We have found that the base won't be moved off the island now. It is not realistic to materially reduce the US presence.  I partly agree with you. Abe's policy looks radical. But it is also the fact that the current of this world is changing rapidly. The most important thing is we citizen learn what is happening now I think.  I think Abe's project ignores one's opinion who lives in okinawa. That kind of war should never be happened.  I agree with your opinion. when he govern a country, it is necessary to persuade people carefully.  I partly agree with your opinion. Though it is true that Abe's policy is selfish, the basic problem solves nothing only by other proposed sites being given if a base is moved from Okinawa .  If the American presence leave Okinawa, Japanese Self Defense Force will be stationed in Okinawa. Since Okinawa is located very strategic place. It is only changing from American presence to JSDF for people in Okinawa.  I strongly oppose Mr. Abe's policy. He does not think of Japanese people. The government should think Okinawa's people. They're very suffered from the American 's army. And we should appeal that American's army base is to violate our constitution.  I agree with you. This problem is very difficult. I think Abe and okinawa's people need more discussion. Because, now, both of them saying selfish claim.  I think so, too. Japan has constitution article 9. It is our constitution 's core. We should maintain this article.  I think Mr. Abe manages not so bad in the problem of Okinawa, considering no politician could solve it with no Okinawans and Americans that is supposed to protect Japan discontent. And I also think these Okinawans should hake taken different way from jeering to represent their opinion.  I think so too. It is very difficult problem. People who live in Okinawa want to remove the US bases. So Japanese government should think about this problem carefully and try to get understanding from people in Okinawa.  I agree with your idea that Okinawa has to grow their economy themselves and make it strong. Japan has to be independent.  I agree with you. Japan should not do war I'm very sad to hear this news. Prime MInister is the leader of this country and he should be doing what everyone wants to do. But THe reality is so different, he got jeered in important anniversary day in Okinawa. I don't think we should ve changing the Pacific Stance and constitution. He should be doing what we all can be happy.  This is very difficult problem, I think. Actually, the opinions of all people do not become one, so we have to search the best way that all people become satisfied. It is not easy, but without it, Japan can not become better.  By using this meeting , we need to discuss the problem about US military camp.  I THINK THIS PROBLEMS TO difficult TO SOLVE. WE COULD NOT SOLVE THIS COMPLETELY SOON. SO WE SHOULD HAVE MUCH TIME.  Surely, your opinion is right. However, in order to protect our nation, it doesn't needed leave the bases on Okinawa. The claim by Okinawans is about bases in Okinawa, not in Japan. It's natural that Mr. Abe is jeered about this problem.  I think so, too. I think people in Okinawa are forced to take an important role for the friendship with America. When I went there, I had not heard the sound of Osprey, so I was surprised at your episode. I hope that Abe will try to decrease the sufferings of Okinawa's people, too.  I partly agree with your idea. Historically there are what the country conquered and what was conquered and what was conquered has burden like Okinawa bases. However, Japanese government sacrifice only Okinawa instead of mainland. we should tackle this problem together seriously.  Japanese government should work on the problem of US military bases in order to reduce them gradually, for I think that US military bases remind people of fear in wartime. Also loud sounds and large land for bases confuse people in Okinawa. It is difficult thing, but government should get on well about this problem for good relationship between Japan and USA  I was surprised and sad when I read this article. I can't believe the prime minister who is the top of this country was heckled in public.  I agree with you. I think also that American military bases are reminders of fear in wartime.  I think so, too. This problem should be discussed more carefully.  Your opinion has a main problem in real. As you say, Japanese government has not found new places to move US military facilities. I also think the good relationship with America is very very important. We have to help each other in the future, but this problem is big.  It seems that Prime Minister Abe will be heckled in terms of his way of government. He tries to do what his grand father could not. It has passed many years since his grandfather's age.  I didn't surprised at his news, but I was very sad. Prime Minister Abe is too active for this Okinawa problem. His achievements and speech reminds me of the right wing. I hope that he don't be more aggressive.  I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe is blind to our own opinion and hope. But, American's army are important for Japan, so we cannot be too aggressive or too submissive.  I think so, too. We Japanese had better learn from failures we made in the past. I don't want to be included dangerous wars.  I think so. Prime minister should hear what people are saying. I think that it is bad ideas to be included to the war.  I tend to agree with your statement . I was very sad when I heard this issue.  I agree with your opinion. In Okinawan, there are a lot of people who are suffered from US troops. But it is obviously, Okinawa is very important place strategically. So we have to think about this problem more seriously. As long as we can, we have to think this in terms of people of Okinawa.  I have read the article which the crime rate of Okinawa had raised since US bases appeared. Not all crime are caused by Americans. But I think they should be in the island to protect Japan. I am interested in the interest to the moral of a U. S. army.  I agree with your opinion. It is important for Japan to allow the army to stay in Okinawa.  I think Shinzo Abe should more think Japan. Okinawa problem is very serious. But, I was surprised that people in Okinawa jeered Abe.  I think so, too. I hope to take the American bases away from Okinawa as early as possible.  I agree with your opinion. I think that Prime Minister Abe should more think and try to negotiate to Us I disagree with your opinion, I do not think that the Prime Minister Abe thinks only Americans feel or demand. I think that he makes the best decision in consideration of the situation and future in Japan. Therefore, he should host more meetings about American bases in Okinawa and I want him to reconcile with a citizen of Okinawa. "
JOC JOC-15A-10N 10.3 "I do not think it is a good thing to regulate something by the Country! One of the things that surprised me in this article is that two-fifths of Americans oppose the same-sex marriage. In my opinion same-sex marriage should be allowed because we should have right to live and love freely as it is mentioned in the article by Egyptian TV presenter Muna Iraqi I never knew that those ideas of rainbow facebook profile pictures are from gay-marriage, but I was about to change my profile picture. I think there are lots of people like me who do not understand the meaning of rainbow. If you really support it, it is right to show or express your feeling in your profile. However, if you know nothing and change the picture, it is just a fashion or trend. I think this posture will make more people angry. I felt gay marriage is always a controversial topic.  I agree to same-sex marriage because it is the right for everyone to love someone. I have friends who love same sex, and they were very happy to hear the news which the American Supreme Court made gay marriage officially legal in all 5NA states. I think there are not differences between same-sex marriage and heterosexual marriage from the viewpoint of essence which people love someone. So I hope same-sex marriage will be on the way to realization in the world I didn't know that the rainbow is seen as the symbol of the LGBT movement until I read this news article, and I have never seen rainbow facebook profile pictures although I use facebook. Whether we recognize same-sex marriage is controversial and difficult decision. However, I think we should allow homosexuality, because all people have liberty.  I use Facebook. The profile image of the friend became the rainbow color, and I wondered what it would mean. I did not think that it was the part of the LGBT campaign. I think such a campaign is a good act to spread the interest of people about LGBT following an Austrian signal. However, there is the person who does not know the meaning like me even if uses Facebook. I think that it is necessary to devise the advertising so that a meaning reaches the people. In addition, it cannot be understood why the countries such as Russia object to homosexuality. In the first place a human being is not a simple animal that an object to turn love to is limited to the opposite sex. I think that the person of against the homosexuality country should understand such a thing.  I was surprised at the number of homosexuality opponents, too. As for the homosexuality opponent, they should not do homosexuality, and I think that there is not the qualification to disturb the love of the homosexual.  It was very surprising for me that so many Russians opposed same-sex  marriage! And I never thought there would be two-fifths of Americans opposing same-sex  marriage. Personally, same-sex  marriage should be allowed legally. It doesn't cause inconvenience to other people. Nevertheless, those who called LGBT get a raw deal. Even if there is a religious reason, people should be more tolerant to them. I think every person has a right living with someone that he or she likes. I hope same-sex  marriage is allowed in Japan, too.  This movement is very efficient because People all over the world are using SNS now. I think this is same as competent as gay and straight traffic lights in Austria. In fact, a lot of my friends of Facebook became the profile image of rainbow. When I saw this profile image and knew a part of the LGBT movement, I was really interested in this campaign. So, I was surprised that many people in Russia who are opposed to homosexuality.  I agree with you. I'd like to appreciate our circumstance that we can easily know about the LGBT movement by using SNS. However, I can understand why some Russian people opposed to homosexuality. But, I wish we could understand homosexuality I am one of the Facebook users, so I know about the rainbow flag well. Friends of mine also add the effect on their profile picture. In my opinion, what is surprising is the huge powers of SNS. It is so infectious that the news about this movement spread all over the world rapidly. In addition, circulation of information could be the discussion forums, as the supporter of LGBT-movement in America and opponent in Russia and Middle East. We must pay attention to the infection of SNS in order to prevent these discussion going uncorrected.  I also think same-sex marriage should be allowed legally in Japan. But, when we come to think of strong opponent in some people in the world, it must not be introduced until we discuss enough, and develop legislation. And it is not necessary to introduce this system in all countries, if there is a special and rational reason, such as opponent by many religious people. Considering each countries' situation is important.  Thank you for your reply. It was a shock to know that some Russian are against same-sex marriage, too. This movement is giving Japanese people an opportunity to think about homosexuality! Recently I was very surprised because friends' profile pictures of Facebook changed rainbow color. However I couldn't understand why everyone change the profile pictures, so I research on the internet. As a result it is symbol of LGBT movement. I expect that a lot of people research the meaning of rainbow color like me. Therefore I feel that this is not only good for show the meaning of the blessings but also people of the world to know about LGBT like ice bucket challenge. I hope that a lot of people should know LGBT and I have to get the knowledge of LGBT.  I think so too. People in the world have to make equal societies together. If we do so, we must try to understand people who are LGBT. Also, we do not have the right to oppose their marriage if we stay clear of them. I think most of the two-fifths of Americans in the topic are not interested in the gender problems, so people have to try to know problems that people who are LGBT have.  I did not know that the symbol of the LGBT movement is rainbow color. It is interesting and a unique idea. I think it is a good incentive for the LGBT people. However, if many LGBT people add a rainbow effect to their profile pictures on the Facebook, those people may are blamed by anti-LGBT people in public. Therefore, if people reveal their name on the Internet, they should consider that, and we also should consider the gender problems of them.  It's an inevitable problem to permit gay marriage. It's natural that many people are negative to it in terms of their cultures. I think that we should start to think about the meaning of marriage again.  I agree with you. Facebook is a very convenient SNS, so we use it without thinking seriously. We should regard it as a tool of express our opinion.  When I read this article , I knew there were different ideas about same sex marriage. I think this trend ; the American Supreme Court made gay marriage officially legal in all 50 states ; is good to many people. But there are no people who think this trend is not good. This problem is difficult and we should more effort to spread idea of same sex marriage.  I think so, too. Same-sex marriage should be allowed freer than what it is.  I think there are various way of thought about same sax marriage. But I think it is wrong to have bad image on the ideal of homosexuality without thinking carefully. I hope all of human have proper rights to live happily even if they are homosexuality or not. "
ACA ACA-CRS-003 -1.68 "THE EXPERIENCE OF FAMILIES Fools and heretics Parents' views of professionals Chris Goodey In this chapter Chris Goodey reflects on the diagnosis, assessment and categorisation procedures employed by ‘professionals’: doctors, psychologists, teachers and administrators. He argues that such procedures and the decisions about a child's acceptability within mainstream education which may follow from them, are underpinned by competing philosophies about a child's acceptability as a human being. It is this philosophy, he argues, rather than a body of technical knowledge, which drives the behaviour of professionals in their interactions with parents. He supports these contentions with the words of parents of children with trisomy 21 whose reactions to, and following, the birth of their children belie the simplified professional stereotypes which he sets beside them. He concludes by suggesting that membership of the group that accepts children with disabilities as full members of the human tribe, is open to all. A HUMAN FAILING What is it to be human? The segregation of school pupils who have disabilities or learning difficulties poses this question immediately. Professionals segregate according to expert criteria, but ‘what is it to be human?’ sounds like a philosophical question — in which case it is also a political one — rather than something for experts to decide. We as a group, defining ourselves as human, decide whom to include and whom to exclude as members of this group. We do it when we decide what it is acceptable for people to be able or unable to do. We do it when we decide that someone is unable to attend a school we have already described as ‘comprehensive’. We do it when we decide that the sibling rule — that a child can attend the same school as a brother or sister — does not apply (the assumption here must surely be that siblings can belong to different species). Alongside the ideal common sense of the saying, ‘Nothing human is alien to me’, we operate the opposite principle too: nothing alien is human to me. In our own society we leave it to certain specialised people to decide, in practice, who is alien to the species and where the alien should be put. Expert classifications of disability and difficulty, and the apparatus of assessment that goes with them, appear to be scientifically objective. But in fact this  appearance is only the distorted mirror-image of the reality I have described. We have already chosen , more or less deliberately, whom we want to belong and whom not. We then invent criteria to back up the choice, delegating our responsibility to professional specialists. The appearance of scientific objectivity is painted on afterwards. It gives credibility to the particular choice we as a self-defining ‘human’ group have made, and reinforces the validity of that choice by obscuring the fact that we make it voluntarily, rather than have it imposed on us by scientific laws which are unquestionable and necessary. If it is all just a matter of philosophy, then anyone can voice an opinion on it, and there may be differing views of what ‘humanity’ consists of behind it all. Philosophies clash and compete. As far as those who experience difficulties in learning or have disabilities are concerned there are ‘excluders’ and ‘includers’. The excluders, since theirs is the prevailing view in our educational and other institutions, want to keep convincing the world at large that their choice as to who belongs is the only possible one. This necessitates them saying something about the rival philosophy of the includers in addition to conveying the appearance of expertise. History has shown that the favourite way of dealing with any fundamental philosophy opposed to your own is to abuse its advocates as being fools and heretics — that is, to exclude the people along with their philosophy. The Catholic Church and the Soviet state under Stalin, for example, found ways of doing this to people who advocated different theological positions from the established one. In our case, the excluders want to keep out both kinds of fool: people with learning difficulties themselves and their fool advocates, those people who represent the rival philosophy and advocate their inclusion. Natural experts? The includers are not always merely disinterested advocates of a philosophy, but people who have become so through experience, through the sheer amount of time they spend with members of the excluded social group. ‘parents’ are the best example, though not the only possible one. I put the word in inverted commas to highlight a mystique about parenthood. There is no reason why having some coincidental sperm-and-egg relationship with a child should entitle someone for that reason to be seen as a ‘natural expert’, as distinct from a very clever, highly qualified one. But if criteria for inclusion and exclusion are not technical and professional but based on a philosophy about what human beings are, then parental expertise cannot be different in kind from that of professional (unnatural?) experts. As one of the parents in the interviews described later says, ‘When they say, you're the experts, parents are experts, what they really mean is — you get on with that little bit over there, and we'll get on with the really important stuff over here .’ Conversely, of course, not all parents of children with disabilities see their children as members of the human species. Most parents, though, have a world-view which as you may expect does include ‘their’ children as fully paid-up members of the species. This observation  has occasionally even found its way into the specialist literature, but it is easy to miss its full significance. For parents, this world-view may not be ‘philosophical’ in the sense of something that is calculated, worked out and argued, though it can be and often is. It is a way of life. Deny or threaten it, and you deny and threaten someone's existence. They will strive to validate it, and even prescribe it for you and everyone else: not just ‘this is how we live’, but ‘this is how one ought to live’. In the prevailing exclusionist literature, which is controlled by the professionally intelligent, the attitude that what professionals define as ‘intelligence’ does not matter, and that their child's humanity does, may be seen as a symptom of pathology as severe as (and similar to) a child's intellectual disabilities. It is a lack, a disqualification, an inability to face the reality of their child's disability. Because it is pathological it must not be allowed to appear in public in its own form. To borrow from the classic language of the history of slavery, parents in this sense are ‘physically alive but socially dead’: we do not see them. They contain endlessly frustrated plantation slaves who are rebellious at assessments and in encounters with professionals, but whose views only reach daylight in fragmented and unvalidated form; and they contain house slaves who agree with everything that goes on and use ‘massa's’ language and concepts, but who believe something else all the time and are waiting for the day. In short, they are a colonised people. But in common with other colonised people such as the Algerians under French rule described by Frantz Fanon or the Black Americans by Stokely Carmichael in the 1960s, they believe that they and their children should themselves be the civilising force to overcome the ‘civilisation’, the predominant philosophy and way of life, that has colonised them. The stakes are high: it is not just a question of particular social groups (‘What is it to be Black?’, ‘What is it to be a woman?’), but of the very qualifications for inclusion in the human species. They believe they have a different and better answer to the question, ‘What is it to be human?’ WORDS OF EXPERIENCE: A RESEARCH PROJECT My opening observations are not random reflections, but arise directly from a piece of research. Between 1987 and 1989 I conducted in-depth interviews with nearly forty parents of children with trisomy 21 (so-called Down's Syndrome) who were between the ages of 2 and 7. I had several interviews with each parent individually, speaking to nearly 90 per cent of the total population group in a borough with a wide class distribution and a large ethnic minority population (see Goodey 1991). Before I began the formal research I had been aware from the few parents of children with trisomy 21 I knew that there was more disquiet about their negotiations with professionals and the treatment of their children than had made its way into the academic and professional literature on parents and families. Second, I also knew that this disquiet existed alongside other more conventional attitudes which perfectly fitted the portrayal of parents usually found in that literature. After beginning to interview people in depth, I realised that, to explain this juxtaposition of apparently contradictory values within  individuals, I needed to go beyond the conceptual framework set by clinicians and sociologists alike. A shared language between parents and professionals did not necessarily mean shared attitudes. It may be that when we express our opinions, we only have available to us ready-made sets of ideas, ‘discourses’, other people's words which we choose from, string together in different ways and think (mistakenly) to be our own; these include ‘expert’ ideas and the colloquial, common-sense versions of them absorbed by ordinary people in one way or another. But we have something else too which is genuinely our own, even though we don't choose it, and that is experience. It became clear from talking to parents that I had to see how what they said actually hooked up with their experience, the fine detail of it, and not to assume that I knew exactly what kind of lived experience lay behind a familiar form of words. Parents as truth tellers Even in order to get this far, I had to believe that what I was being told by people about their experiences and feelings was the truth, or essentially the truth. I may have been wrong proportionately as many times as the result of an amniocentesis turns out to have been wrong: that is, being wrong in both cases amounts to a hypothetical possibility, but is not normal. I decided, for example, that if a parent told me they had dreamt about having a ‘Down's baby’ before the birth — in the medical literature, this is a classic after-the-event self-deception — they had in fact had such a dream. If they said they had not been upset on being told the diagnosis, this actually was the case; they were not suffering from amnesia. If they became angry at things said to them by professionals, as a majority of them did at some point, the horrifying causes of their anger were true, and were not projections of their own distress on to the professional concerned. To accept the truth of these accounts is a simple but giant step, and one which the academic and professional community is by its own self-definition incapable of taking: a social group which bases its very existence on its own claims to cleverness would risk its life if it opened even one ear to the voices of fools and heretics, especially when the topic itself is about foolishness in the form of ‘learning difficulties’. In what follows I have used my interviews with parents as a counterpoint to a professional judgement. SHOCK, HORROR AND DEMYSTIFICATION ‘When parents are first told that the baby has Down's Syndrome they are all deeply shocked’(Cunningham 1982: 28). Bernadette : With my other babies they've mostly left them quite close to me, but she was put over to the side, the doctor was slow in coming, and she went over and checked her over, instead of coming to speak to me as they usually do — she went out again and didn't even look at me  [laughs]… I had an instant bond with Marie — I thought she was beautiful the moment she was born — I can really say that. I thought she was beautiful, and I didn't mind about her being Down's Syndrome. Mentally I was prepared to cope with it you see, I'd made my mind up right through my marriage that I would. Every one of these parents can recount stories of being not believed, not looked at, not spoken to: that is what dead people experience, if the dead have experiences. For Bernadette, it's amusing. From this paediatrician's reaction, it seems as if the clinical notion of deep shock as a natural reaction is itself a projection of that professional's anxiety on to the parent. Pat : He was six months old and I'd gone down for his second immunisation and I mean the doctor I went to see was a family doctor — I've known him since I was a baby — and he just, he was looking at him and he just said, ‘Is your husband Chinese?’ And I said, ‘No.’ And he just stuck the needle in his arm, and he said, ‘Well, I think the baby's a mongol’, and he showed me the door and that was it. He wasn't looking at me. He was kind of looking down and twiddling his pen, you know…and I mean I know it sounds stupid, but I didn't mind, I think I knew anyway. I mean when he was born they laid him on me, he'd had the cord round his neck three times and he looked like a tortoise with his long neck and this little tiny head [laughs]. And I thought blimey, he's a mongol, you know, when you're looking at them, and then I was looking at the nurses and waiting for everyone to say something, and nobody said nothing. And then I thought, I couldn't say ‘Here, is this baby a mongol?’ in front of Stan, I think he would have fell over. Pat has reasons not to mind. The baby is already six months old, and she has already made the diagnosis herself, at birth. In addition, both her own parents had considerable physical disabilities. Both she and Bernadette have realised beforehand that the boundaries of human experience are wider than those indicated in the Mothercare catalogue. What about those who haven't? Rita : Well the doctor was crying, she had tears in her eyes, and she said, ‘We've got some news.’ And then the stupid thing, the doctor said to me, ‘Does she look like anybody in your family?’ I said, ‘Well you don't have to tell me, I know she's a mongol.’ She said, ‘Oh — you a nurse?’ I said, ‘No, I can just tell by her face’… So I went back and see the baby in the incubator and then I went back to the ward. None of the nurses spoke to me, nothing, till 2 o'clock that afternoon, which I'd had her at 7.30 in the morning… Yeah, yeah, well I completely rejected her. As soon as I knew she wasn't a hundred per cent, I just didn't want to know her… The exact feelings… I wanted her to die… And I'll tell you the only reason I took the baby home was because Martin wanted her. Now this looks more like it: a normal, natural reaction, even if I do have to search through several of the transcripts on my desk to find one. ‘Natural’: does this mean that we all have a gene that determines we will be shocked? In the clinical literature, the word ‘natural’ is left undefined (the medical description of this kind of shock goes back to the nineteenth-century discovery of ‘hysteria’and its symptoms in women). Rita, however, takes care to define it, and is aware of the surrounding social circumstances. The baby had been taken away immediately and wired up in an incubator for three days. Since Rita has been sent to Coventry, she has not been told that it is physically possible for her to open up the incubator herself and put her hands in. Eventually a nurse does show her, and then ‘Once I'd touched her, she was mine.’ She is further handicapped by having a sister-in-law (a nurse herself) who visits immediately after the diagnosis has been made and starts discussing fostering and adoption procedures. Most importantly, Rita, just as she makes her own diagnosis, knows — unlike the professionals — exactly what the ‘shock’ is and that it comes from somewhere: Rita : You know, the old story, my first thoughts when I had her, well one of my first thoughts, was Oh, I've got one of them kids that have silly haircuts, silly anoraks, spend all day on buses or all day in a home, weaving baskets, and that was my first thought… I don't know, I always said I'd never took the piss out of these children, but I'm sure I must have done at school, but I must admit I was embarrassed. I was embarrassed giving birth to a mongol. If we was educated with handicapped, you know, if we'd mixed with them…but we never saw them. I'd never spoken to one till we had Louise, you know, which is not fair on us normal people… They're anti-social, handicapped people, and they're kept that way. They're all at a different school all day, and they shop at different times…but you never see them in restaurants and why shouldn't they be? They're just there , you know. Like many of the parents, Rita readily agrees with the professional maxim that ‘It's natural to feel shocked’, but she clearly does not take this to be some scientific and objective concomitant of the situation, something in her genes. Such parents know that it is something they have been socialised into by a segregated society, and that things could have been otherwise: that they ought to be otherwise (It's not fair…’). Between the apparent extremes of these examples lie all sorts of individual circumstances. Some parents' reaction to the diagnosis is nullified by the additional diagnosis of some life-threatening physical condition such as meningitis or a heart defect, which to them is more distressing. Some may have previously had a miscarriage or an infant who died. For others who went through distress, over and over again the concrete feelings behind the abstraction of ‘shock’ have to do, not with newly existent beings whom one doesn't know, but with existing people in one's life — partners, family, etc. And none of them fails to recognise where these negative feelings come from, that such feelings have been  taught by a particular upbringing and environment. ‘Shock’ and ‘trauma’must be seen as an example of what psychologists call reification: sets of concrete interpersonal and societal relationships are turned into an abstract ‘thing’which dominates our language and hence our way of thinking. This self-perpetuating process of mystification that denies real feelings and experiences is a necessary prop to the status, power and basic philosophical values of a way of life; the teaching of negative feelings must go on. What needs to be emphasised, though, is that direct experience — becoming part of a way of life that includes the alien in a wider definition of what it is to be human — seems to be almost the only way of achieving demystification. Brian:The only problem I had was people thinking I had problems. ‘COMING TO TERMS’: WHOSE AND WHAT TERMS? For many parents it is as though the child they were expecting is dead. Many doctors think that it is important for parents to recognize these feelings and to go through a period of mourning for their lost imaginary baby… These feelings…may diminish in time so that the parent can come to terms with the fact that the baby has Down's Syndrome. (Cunningham 1982: 31, 39) A couple of hours after drafting this, I receive a call from a local health visitor asking advice about a child who has just been diagnosed. She tells me that ‘the mother is just going through the process of grieving for the child she hasn't had’(the child is already eight months old): the health visitor's instruction in the art of creating unpersons has been exemplary, and no doubt she is keen to pass this on to the mother. Sharon : At school when you have these, you have lessons about childbirth and babies and things, nobody ever says like not all children are born, you know, normal. Antenatal classes should talk about it. Although I said to my husband when I was pregnant, what if I have a handicapped baby? And he said he wouldn't be able to cope, but it was in the pretext that it would never happen to us. But you've got to think about it if it does happen to you. I mean if it does, you, I think you find a way of coping with it. There's no connection between the thought beforehand, and when it happens to you something different happens. Dave : I'd always tended to shy away from them, like, because like I say I think it's the fear of the unknown, what you've been told. If you don't understand something you normally tend to be a bit aggressive towards it, don't you?… Looking at what Micky's like and everything, when I thought before what it would be like and what the situation actually is, I think basically you're in another world, you know what I mean? Because it is another world. Because what you're thinking it's going to be like is completely the opposite of what is happening. For both ways of life and for both sets of values, excluders and includers, the language of ‘coping’ and ‘coming to terms’describes the transition between one world and another world; this much they agree on, even if the values they attach to these worlds are totally opposite. Many parents can put their finger on a moment or incident when they experienced this transition, which they often mark as rebellion. Phil : When the paediatrician come in next morning, I mean he only was in there two seconds, he looked her up and said ‘Typical mongol’, either ‘Typical mongol features’ or ‘Typical mongol face’, it was one of the two he said, and I could have killed him… They put Jenny [Phil's wife]in a grotty old side ward so that she didn't upset any other of the patients, no one come in and tell us anything. I grabbed one of the midwives, the senior one there, and I said to her, what happens now? And they reiterated that they would like Becky to stay in for tests but Jenny could come home, and Becky was a bit jaundiced you see. I said what happens if she hadn't had Down's Syndrome, they said she could have gone home, so I said: ‘That's it, wrap her up, we're going home. Start life as we mean to go on, we'll go home.’ That afternoon a friend came round, Ruth and Jim, and they come round with a bottle of champagne, the best you could buy, and it was just like we'd had a baby… I mean I'd had a sort of cry I suppose, but at the actual time I was glad I had a daughter [after two sons]. And after he said typical mongol, I think, I don't know, it's awkward to explain: everything seemed to fall into place. Just as the clinical professions can provide parents with the language and the concepts with which to take a negative view of the child, so they can provide the unwitting stimulus for the parent to enter a new, positive world in which things ‘fall into place’. Helen : For some reason I thought of it that they've given me this monster of a baby that I wasn't going to be able to love, and some woman came round — she may have been the hospital social worker or an almoner — and spent about an hour telling me how this was going to completely change the course of my life, I was going to be saddled with this child that would need twenty-four hour care and attention, and I had to think carefully about whether I wanted that for the rest of my life, i.e. was I going to keep him — virtually talking me into not keeping him, and I think the turning-point was that I felt there was something coming from the outside that was, sort of, really trying to urge me to reject him, and that I rebelled against it. So that I can't say I had any positive feelings in the first place, but the realisation that everybody else had negative feelings made me love him. The majority of parents reported being presented covertly or overtly with an opt-out clause when the diagnosis was first made, often couched in terms of: ‘Leave  the baby here for a couple of days, go home and think about it’(‘it’ being unspecified). Cunningham (1982) reports that if parents decide to give up the baby permanently, it is ‘for the parents who make it, the right decision,. It is important to note here than even if a parent is gripped by those negative fantasies that the textbooks claim to be real and universal, she is also immediately capable of embracing a critique of the values she is confronted with. Perhaps we are now in a position to give, from a parental perspective, an alternative interpretation of what exactly it means to ‘come to terms with’ a child's disability. For the clinical and educational professions (and the lay notions which derive their values from them), their very practice makes it clear what fact it is that you ‘come to terms’ with: you have not given birth to a member of the human species as we define it, and to which we allocate certain rights and social roles, but to an object of pathology — a ‘monster’, to use a technical term employed in medical anatomy. For the parent, the same phrase means the inverse: I have not given birth to the monster which my upbringing and socialisation led me to believe I'd had, but to a normal member of the human species as I now define it. This widening definition of what it is to be human, couched in sociologically aware terms, runs throughout the responses, and is further expressed in attitudes to amniocentesis and abortion in subsequent pregnancies. In medical practice, and especially in medical economics, it is assumed that the identification of a foetus with a disability by amniocentesis (CVS) will inevitably lead to an abortion. Yet, only a small proportion of the parents interviewed would even contemplate termination of a subsequent pregnancy should a test turn out to be positive. Some who had subsequent pregnancies had refused any kind of test, despite in some cases being aggressively pressurised by the hospital. Others had undergone a test because they ‘needed to know’, not because they had any intention of terminating. Even where doubts are expressed about ‘having another one’, they are stated in terms which imply a criticism of social arrangements rather than in terms of personal coping. Jeanette : They're such lovely babies you'd have twenty of them. I'm not sure, though. I'm not sure I could stand shlapping up and down to that bloody clinic time and time again. Similarly, cosmetic surgery is seen in the professional literature as an option (some parents choose it, some don't), or even as a kind of cure, especially by the surgeons contracted to perform it, whose understanding of the issues extends as far as the principle that if people see a physically normal child they will react to it ‘normally’ and will elicit normal behaviour. No doubt cosmetic surgery is performed, even encouraged. In this sample, however, not one parent wanted it for their own child, and in general they were more prescriptive about what was morally correct for other parents here than on any other issue. Pat : The surgeons are God, anyway, aren't they? I mean it was like years ago I  heard things about Down's children with holes in the heart and why bother to do it, but now everything's changing — let's make them more normal. But why do that? I mean they're normal to us but they're not normal to other people, so why should we make them normal to them, just to please society? I mean the world's made up of all different coloured people — why shouldn't we have different faces and all? If we all walked round with the same face and same coloured skin it would be pretty boring, wouldn't it? The world of normality is redefined. No longer a matter of distribution across a norm, of statistics and probability, ‘normality’ itself is simply a common-sense, inclusive definition of what it is to be human, with wider boundaries redefined from experience. LUCKY LEPERS ‘I am fortunate. I do not truly know what it is like to have a child with Down's Syndrome’(Cunningham 1982: 16). Kathy : Scott is the best thing that ever happened to us. I think it was more, I thought if people would feel sorry for me, then I wouldn't be able to cope with this thing, like. I didn't want any pity, that was the thing I was worried about: that people were going to pity me. I didn't want people to think I couldn't cope with it, like, 'cos I knew I could. I'm never, ever going to be frightened of anything again. Before I had Scott I would never say boo to a goose. But I think all the time where you have to keep on fighting all the time, so now like you get so mouthy in the end you can't shut up, you know [laughs], you end up winning the argument 'cos you can't shut up, like. You've had to be like that all the time, otherwise you feel like you ain't getting there, they're getting the better of you, like…’ cos you listen, don't you, when you've had the baby they are supposed to help you and advise you, so you take all their…but then you can only take so much, and you think these must be the mad ones, like. Beverley : In actual fact me having Devon, I've never met so many real people… He's made us really meet real people, you know what I mean, people with handicapped children, and to me I find them more real than some of my friends that live in another world, fantasising about the future, you know, ‘What's the kids going to be when they grow up?’ I wouldn't plan a life out for my child, I couldn't possibly do it, you know… My priorities in my mind's eye is better. Their priorities to me is out the window, if you understand my meaning. My priorities in life is smaller, more compact, but their priorities is for about ten, fifteen years from now. God forbid anything should happen to their children, never mind their house, or their car. It stand out like a sore thumb sometimes when I'm with them, I find people with  handicapped children are real people, are people who are people with their children being, talking to them, instead of things that they can give them, you know. Maybe I've swapped lenses… Phil : Well I would say that if I had my life over again I wish and hope that everything happens the same, and I think at the end of the day Becky had been the cream on top of the cake… Perhaps my opinion on morality's changed, you know, that there is right and wrong and all this and that you've got to accept people. I mean I know what it's like to be Black. I feel now that I've got an epitaph at the end of my life that I did something, I wasn't a taker… I mean we still live, which is a sad fact, but we still live in a society where we were like lepers, we still live in a society where you can still reject, and it shouldn't be that; you shouldn't have the option to reject, you should have the support there. Bravery, contact with social reality and a sense of justice are the themes of these three extracts. If they are symptoms of leprosy, then we are indeed ‘fortunate’ to know what the experience is like. LAST WORDS I have quite intentionally cited only one example of the available professional and academic literature. Apart from being one of the most widely read and influential books, it is also more enlightened than most of the published work getting through to teachers, health visitors, therapists and parents too. It does not appear to take a lofty clinical viewpoint, but partakes of the language of partnership and equality between experts and parents. I have ignored such central and prestigious characters in the drama is professor Wold of St Bartholomew's Hospital, who is seeking to perfect a cheap, early diagnostic test for trisomy 21 during pregnancy on the interesting grounds that it costs £500,000 (not accounting for inflation) to look after a person with trisomy 21 for life. Let us skirt round professor Joan Bicknell, a major authority in child psychiatry. In a bang-up-to-date textbook (see Bicknell 1988), she lectures future generations of health and social service professionals on imparting what they are to perceive as ‘sad, bad news’ to parents. Following a time-honoured tradition of psychiatric categories, she elaborates the ‘bereavement response’ to diagnosis into a farrago of stages (none of whose terms, as far as I can make out, has ever been defined):(1)‘Shock’,(2)‘panic’,(3)‘Denial’,(4)‘Grief’,(5)‘Guilt’,(6)‘Anger’(in general),(7)‘Anger Against professionals’,(8)‘Bargaining’and finally (9)‘Acceptance’. Anyone who wants to explain away the material I have offered in the interview extracts will merely have to look up item (7). Let us return to the measured tones of Cliff Cunningham. Earlier I mentioned Stokely Carmichael; and here is the White liberalism of mental disability issues. Why am I using his work to set alongside the interview extracts? I am saying that  we are confronted, beneath a language which is often common to both parties, with two competing moral philosophies, and that the language of partnership is a mirage, a deliberate and partisan disguise for the fact that one of those philosophies holds power while the other comes from beneath the underdog. There are not ‘professionals’ and ‘parents’. There is a strange tribe that believes in spells, psychometric assessments and incantations, and there is a tribe of what Beverley, Devon's mother, calls real people. The beauty of it is that while nut everyone can become Black or become a woman, anyone can join the ‘real people’. They may be parents or they may only have letters after their name, but what they have in common is this: they know that intellectual perfection and the criteria for measuring it are chimeras. In our society this knowledge is dangerous, subversive, and — make no mistake — will be dealt with as such. The best way of dealing with it, perhaps, is to draw parents into a prevailing set of values about intelligence and humanity on the grounds of an ‘equal partnership, that is spurious and reinforces the attitudes underlying segregation. Ruled out or rescued? A Statement for Balbinder Elizabeth Grugeon Elizabeth Grugeon provides a detailed account of her association with Balbinder Singh and his family. She was a friend and adviser for the family as they tried to negotiate a path through an education system which was not always easy to understand. Balbinder was the subject of a Statement and Elizabeth Grugeon charts the process from an initial expression of concern about Balbinder's lack of progress by the primary school to his transfer to a special school for pupils categorised as having ‘moderate learning difficulties’. MY INVOLVEMENT WITH THE FAMILY A long-standing friendship with an Asian family who were neighbours of mine led to my being involved in the process of Statementing their youngest child, Balbinder Singh. He was 6 years old and had been at the school for three terms when the head, knowing that I was a neighbour and friend of Balbinder's mother, invited me to go with Mrs Singh to a meeting with the educational psychologist. The head explained that he and the class teacher felt that Balbinder was making little progress and they were worried about his lack of concentration and poor language. They were considering the possibility of a place in a special school for children with moderate learning difficulties which could offer ‘smaller classes and more individual attention’. His transfer would involve a lengthy and complicated assessment procedure, and they wanted me to help to explain this to Balbinder's parents and to reassure them. This chapter is an account of the process and is an attempt to see it from the family's perspective. I had known the family for some years as I had been Mrs Singh's English tutor on a local authority adult literacy programme. Balbinder was 3 years old when I first started visiting the house, a very sociable child who eagerly awaited my arrival and the chance to play with the bag of toys I always brought with me. Over the years, in my role as home tutor to his mother, I had had a privileged relationship with Balbinder and his family. By the time he started school I had already been an intermediary between the family and the town hall, the DHSS, the local social services, the medical profession and school. Mr and Mrs Singh kept most of their official correspondence between the pages of their telephone directory and on my weekly visits we sorted out the milk tokens, rates demands, post office giros, all of which made linguistic demands which were beyond the level of their competence. Mr Singh, a Kenyan Asian, confessed to me, after I had been a friend of the family for several years, that he was neither fluent in Swahili, the language of his education up to 13, nor in Punjabi, his mother tongue. However, the family spoke Punjabi exclusively at home and had very strong views on the need to do this. They were concerned that the boys should not lose touch with their language and culture. The two older boys, aged 5 and 7, were competent in both languages. Balbinder seemed slower to talk and his mother was worried about his reluctance to speak English. As both parents spoke to him in Punjabi for most of the time this did not seem surprising. I reassured Mrs Singh that once he started playgroup there would be an improvement. In fact the health visitor diagnosed a problem with speech at his screening at age 3, and he began attending the local health clinic for speech therapy. Mrs Singh mentioned this once or twice but did not seem to set much store by it. She continued to express concern at what she felt to be his backwardness at speaking English. I wondered how many people he had the opportunity to speak to outside his family. However, the playgroup run by local parents had not been the success for Balbinder that we had hoped. There were complaints about his behaviour. He did not seem to know how to play, would not settle down, ran about too much and fought with the other children. At home, whenever I visited, he always seemed the same docile, attractive child sitting silently watching TV in the impeccably tidy and attractive furnished living room of the very small, terraced house. In the house, the lives of the three young boys seemed quiet, calm and disciplined. But the large hall at playgroup, the number of activities, different experiences and other children seemed to produce excitable and often aggressive behaviour in Balbinder. The staff were also worried about his speech, not seeming to take into account the fact that this was the first time he had come out of a Punjabi-speaking environment and was having to cope with new experiences in a foreign language. His mother's fluent, though inaccurate, English and confident manner may have led them to expect more of him. Mrs Singh worried about him a great deal, and was often very angry at his apparent lack of progress. She wanted him to learn to count, begin to write, and above all to speak English. She and the children visited my house regularly at this period, so that I could hear the oldest boy, Ravi, read. He had already overtaken his mother and she did not know how to cope with the graded readers he brought home from school or his teacher's request that she should hear him read. Whenever they visited me I listened to him reading. He was quite fluent but seemed to read without comprehension. I felt that the texts he was reading did not speak of familiar experiences or vocabulary. I remember him struggling with a story where understanding of the narrative depended on the reader knowing about canals. He could read the  words —canal, lock, barge — but the illustrations of an urban canal with tall, industrial buildings and long painted boats portrayed an unknown landscape. At 8 he was rapidly becoming a non-reader. The idea that reading might be for pleasure had not occurred to him. Balbinder was always pleased to come along for these sessions, to play with my children's toys and run in the garden. Mrs Singh brought her letters and forms for me to elucidate. I was constantly surprised at the extent to which she needed explanations for even the most taken-for-granted aspects of junior school life. The list of clothing for a school trip included ‘night-dress’ and ‘sponge-bag’. The Singh children slept in their underpants, and she wondered whether I could lend her a ‘night-dress’ for Ravi and also a sponge. Almost all documents sent home from school were incomprehensible. Letters inviting parents to join the parent — teacher association, visit the ‘Spring Fayre’, to volunteer for ‘parent-governor elections’, or attend a ‘Maths Workshop’ were put in the bin after my attempts to explain them. Schools unwittingly erect a language barrier which must exclude great numbers of parents. End of term reports contained phrases like ‘his development of spatial awareness, or ‘his confidence on the apparatus’. However phrases like ‘is working hard’, ‘always tries his best’, ‘is beginning to show some improvement, did not fool her. She interpreted them quite accurately to mean that her children were under-achieving and the message she took from them was almost always a negative one. On one occasion Mrs Singh had asked me to go with her to visit one of the boy's teachers. The teacher was brusque and busy. She brushed aside Mrs Singh's assertions that her son was not making progress by telling her repeatedly that it was unreasonable to expect anything more; she used phrases like ‘He is well below average’, ‘He is slow’, ‘He is in the bottom set, you must accept that. You can't put it there if it's not there.’ Mrs Singh was not satisfied. She wanted to know why he never brought anything home, why he had no reading book. His teacher explained that homework for 8 year olds was not school policy and Jeetinder was called in to show his mother that he could read. He produced his reading book, one of the ‘pirate series’ by Sheila Mccullagh, and read quite fluently. The teacher suggested that Mrs Singh could help by reading with him, Mrs Singh to read one line, Jeetinder the next; she was evidently unaware of the possibility that Jeetinder's reading could be more competent than his mother's. Looking at a piece of work on the board Mrs Singh said she wanted her son to write like that. The teacher, by now worn down by Mrs Singh's refusal to accept Jeetinder's limitations, told her that it had been written by ‘a highly intelligent girl’. She continued to try to convince Mrs Singh that although Jeetinder was in the bottom set he was doing well and was not ‘the bottom of the bottom set’. None of this convinced Mrs Singh who left the classroom saying in an unusually dictatorial tone to the class teacher, ‘I want you to sort him out and bring homework home.’ Later, I tried to mollify her by pointing out that the teacher had said what a nice boy he was. Looking me straight in the eye she replied, ‘Nice is in every child.’ The school's educational psychologist had made contact with the family when he had been involved in an assessment of Jeetinder, the second son, now in the fourth year at the school. There had been concern about his progress at the same stage as there now was for Balbinder's. Mrs Singh had been visited at home and the head had arranged for me to be present so that I could explain and reinforce any suggestions. In the event, I found this difficult as they seemed inappropriate. The psychologist had suggested among other things that Mrs Singh could help to improve Jeetinder's spoken and written language by reading to him at bedtime and could help to improve his numeracy by encouraging him to spend and account for his pocket money. Both ideas were culturally alien to Mrs Singh. There were no English children's books in the house, and the boys did not shop on their own nor have regular pocket money. Neither parent was fully literate in English or their mother tongue. Mrs Singh had seemed mystified by the advice, as she believed the school should be responsible for progress in English and mathematics and shrugged helplessly when I suggested that parents also had an important role. THE STATEMENTS PROCESS FOR BALBINDER My contact with the family had lapsed for a while when the head asked to see me to request help in explaining the Statementing procedures to Mrs Singh. The head told me that Mrs Singh had been coming to school regularly to express concern about Balbinder's lack of progress. The class teacher and the head were also worried; they felt that, ‘after four terms at school, he is the slowest in the class’. Their concern was that in September, when he should be moving into the second year infants with his age cohort, he would be far behind. The head had asked the educational psychologist to come and assess him with a view to producing a formal Statement of Special Educational Needs. Standardised tests had shown that ‘whereas his two older brothers had scored better on verbal ability than on visual motor ability, Balbinder had performed equally poorly on both’. As a result the educational psychologist had been investigating the possibility of a place at a local special school for Balbinder. They now wanted to explain all this to Mrs Singh and hoped that I would be able to explain the implications of what they were going to say. The same morning Mrs Singh had approached me in the school foyer, handed me a bag full of letters, and burst into tears. I realised that I hadn't visited her for some weeks and agreed to go to her house after school. As an outside observer drawn into the Statementing process by the professionals involved, I had a neutral but not disinterested role. I kept a diary of events and attempted to chart the process by which 6-year-old Balbinder was removed from mainstream education. March 3: The initial meeting Meeting with the head, the school's educational psychologist, Mrs Singh and myself at school. The head explained to Mrs Singh that Balbinder was not making much progress and that because of class sizes he would be unlikely to receive the kind of attention he needed. He explained that at Cedars (the local authority's school for children ‘with learning difficulties’) where classes are small and the teachers are specialists at coping with Balbinder's sort of problems, he might do better. He stressed that it was essential for Balbinder to start at Cedars as soon as possible, if he was going to catch up. He seemed to be suggesting that once Balbinder had been at Cedars for a while, he might be capable of re-entering mainstream education at middle school transfer. This was an idea she was to hold on to throughout the process. Both the head and the educational psychologist stressed the positive value of Cedars and the likely problems for Balbinder if he stayed on at his present school, which they told her did not have the expertise to cope with his needs. By suggesting this they began quite unwittingly to undermine her confidence in the school and in herself. She became very upset and confused, clearly feeling that Balbinder's failure was her fault. She cried a lot repeatedly saying ‘He always wants to play…he just wants toys.’ When she was calmer, she also made it clear that she felt that a stricter approach that forced Balbinder to concentrate and work harder was all that was needed. She felt that he was not doing well because he was not trying hard enough, and that his teachers were not making him try hard enough. She listened intently as they explained the Statementing procedure. They stressed that the decision to send Balbinder to Cedars would be made by Mrs Singh and her husband. The first stage would be to visit the school and then return to discuss the matter again. A date was arranged for the following week for both events and I agreed to go with them. What I did not realise at the time, but discovered later, was that Mrs Singh had no idea that transfer next September had been suggested — she expected that it would happen straight away. After she had left, the head and educational psychologist explained the Statementing procedure in more detail. In the past they had waited until after the school screening tests at 7-plus but felt that this was leaving it too late. In Balbinder's case it was not simply that he was a slow learner. There were what the head called ‘social concerns’ behind his transfer. He was developing self-control in the classroom, but found it harder on the playground where it seemed that he was easily influenced by other children to behave badly. As he put it, ‘He reverts when he is with naughty children.’ They had not given these reasons for transfer to his parents. Yet they were clearly important considerations as far as the school was concerned. It was not a foregone conclusion that there would be a place available at Cedars since there is a lot of pressure on special school places in the county. As the head of Cedars was making his entry list for September already, and would have to submit it by the end of the week, the educational psychologist was going to request a place for Balbinder before Statementing him. Thus it was essential to get Mr and Mrs Singh's agreement as soon as possible. Later on the same day, I visited Mr and Mrs Singh at home. Over tea and food we talked about the school's suggestion. Mrs Singh was upset; she felt rejected by the school her children had been attending for five years. She was depressed and angry with Balbinder. She had been crying and said that she had been ‘feeling awful’ all day. She clearly found it hard to sort out the implications of what was being suggested. However we agreed to visit Cedars together in a few days' time. The difficulty she was having in making sense of the boys' education was illustrated by the packet of letters she had brought to school in the morning. One from the LEA was about her 8-year-old son's transfer to middle school, an event generating a great deal of paper including a list of the available schools; another letter from the LEA explained parents' rights of choice and appeal, also dates of open evenings; yet another letter from the school to which he had been allocated required the parents to sign the tear-off slip and return it to their present school. Fortunately, I noticed that he had been given a place at a different school from his older brother and that it was actually a matter of filling in the appeal form requesting a place at another school. I suggested that they should also accept the invitation to take him to visit his new school's Open Evening. Mrs Singh said she would go if I came too but not otherwise. Another letter from the middle school was about a visiting theatre group and asked for money as well as a tear-off slip. We discussed with her 10-year-old son whether he wanted to see the play and we put the money for a ticket in an envelope. To his chagrin we threw away the letter about a skiing holiday. At nearly £400 for a week in Austria his parents were not interested. In the evening I consulted a friend who is also a local head teacher. Her school has a high proportion of ethnic minority children where I felt Balbinder might not have seemed such a problem. In her opinion, it was unlikely that he would get a place at Cedars at such a late stage in the year. She also felt that age 6 was too early to make what she saw as a drastic decision — once out of mainstream education she felt he would be unlikely to get back. At this stage in the proceedings, my own feelings were mixed. If the school felt it could not cope with Balbinder then maybe he would be better in a more sympathetic environment. On the other hand Mrs Singh would lose all her social contacts in the local community once she did not have to take him to school every day. The school gave her a point of reference and contact with other mothers. The middle school which both her older boys attended was a long walk from her home and made little or no attempt to involve parents. If Balbinder was bussed to Cedars every day she would be effectively cut off from any real involvement in her children's schooling, and from an important part of her own role  within the community as the mother of a young child at the local school. On the other hand I knew that her confidence in Balbinder's school had been profoundly shaken by the interview with the head and educational psychologist. If Balbinder didn't get a place at Cedars this year she would become even more anxious about his progress. March 9: Visiting Cedars School The head made us very welcome. He began by talking to Mr and Mrs Singh about the school. He stressed the normality of the children who attended it. He explained that children came to Cedars when their own school could not give them the individual help with basic skills which they needed. He explained that when a child becomes anxious he or she may stop learning. Cedars, he told them, was a special school because it had special teachers with special skills and training. All of the sixteen teachers in the school were experienced in teaching children with learning difficulties. Another special feature was the size of the groups, ten in the first year, twelve in the second and fifteen thereafter. Balbinder would be in a group with ten children. Mrs Singh seemed to be listening intently but I guess that a lot of what was being said went over her head. I am not sure that she even knows the word ‘special’; and phrases like ‘learning difficulties’, ‘becomes anxious’, ‘experienced’ are not necessarily familiar. After a while she asked, ‘These children, do they learn it at the end?’ The head replied that the school offered ideal circumstances and that most children responded positively. There is an annual review in which a report is made on the child's progress. All parents, he told them, have the right to say, ‘I want my child to leave’, and he said, ‘Our job is to help the child go back.’ They review this possibility annually and he explained that when they have identified children who will go back they let them go into mainstream school for at first a morning and then one day a week. At the moment six children would be going back into middle school in September. At this point Mrs Singh said comfortably, ‘They have learnt, that's nice.’ The head went on to explain that the school's job was to understand each child's problem. He told them that many children learned more slowly. He illustrated different ways in which reading, for example, could be taught, and how some children may not be ‘mature’ enough to cope with a ‘look and say’approach, or may not develop that way. He explained how ‘look and say’ uses eyes, while phonics uses ears. Mr and Mrs Singh listened politely but, possibly, were confused by all this specialist terminology. He went on to tell them about the school. The children started at 5 and could stay until 16. They could also leave at any time. Each part of the school — lower/ middle/upper — resembled mainstream school, the difference lying in the size of the teaching group. At 16-plus they go on to college for up to two years and follow courses which will lead to work. Several of the 15 year olds were on work experience at the moment. He then took us round the school. The lower school had its own grassed and paved play area with plentiful equipment. The rooms were small, purpose built, had carpeted floors, and each teacher had a non-teaching assistant. It was an intimate small-scale non-threatening environment. I was particularly impressed by the art room. The workshop and home economics area were also impressive, and the school had three computers. Outside was very pleasant with views over open fields and a local park. Part of the senior side had been landscaped to make an attractive outdoor work area with wooden table and benches made in the workshop. There was a swimming pool and a distant view of the donkey field. There seemed to be few ethnic minority children, one in each class perhaps, certainly none in the youngest group. After the visit the head talked about the importance of parental involvement. He explained that regular contact and discussion of ways in which parents can help at home was vital: ‘Together, we can achieve more.’ The school had an open-door policy. He then put it to Mr and Mrs Singh that they would have to think about whether they would like Balbinder to come to the school. He explained that there were a limited number of places, with sixteen or seventeen taken up for September already (I wondered whether this meant Balbinder might be unlucky, but did not like to ask). He explained the procedure by which Balbinder would be given a place. The educational psychologist would prepare notes on Balbinder. He himself would visit Balbinder at his present school. He stressed, ‘We only want him to come if it's right. Nothing happens until you say yes.’ Then Mr and Mrs Singh would come again with Balbinder, and finally they would receive a letter from County Hall. Again, he stressed that the final decision lay with them: ‘He will not come until you sign it…in the end you decide.’ Mr Singh asked his first question: ‘Would it be next September?’ The head said that that would be the case and that Balbinder would stay for as long as he needed their help. However they could make the decision to take him away ‘at any time’. Mrs Singh asked ‘Do you have the same holiday?’ and then spoke for the first time about Balbinder. She seemed distressed, ‘I mean Balbinder, he used to just sit by the telly, even now he still…he wants toys…he doesn't want to do the things, he wants to do all the time what he wants to do…’ The head nodded reassuringly, seeming to listen, but he did not encourage her to talk about Balbinder any more. Instead he went on to tell them that the shortest time they kept pupils was for two years but that usually they tried to move people back into mainstream at the time for transfer to middle/upper school. He told them that the educational psychologist was very good and really knew the children. Mrs Singh, still pursuing her own thoughts, said, ‘I wish he was just like other children, like my other children.’ The head said it was important to think about ‘whatever is best’ for Balbinder, and went back to what the school catered for —‘people think it's for mentally handicapped’. ‘It doesn't look like one’, said Mrs Singh very positively. The head told them that there were many different special schools in the county and explained where and what each one  was for, reassuring them that Cedars is ‘a school for children who have difficulty getting started with basic skills’. Its job is to help children ‘who are struggling’. He gave Mr and Mrs Singh a school booklet and saw us out. We rang for a taxi and while we waited, looked at books of photographs of school plays, trips, art work and sports days. Both Mr and Mrs Singh seemed surprised and relieved by the normality of the school. Mr Singh told me that one of his brothers-in-law had told them it was a school for mentally handicapped. This had clearly been worrying them both. When we got home I could see that they were ready to agree to the move. It was also evident that they had not weighed up the consequences. It all seemed easy — they sign on the dotted line and Balbinder would be virtually taken out of their hands. Despite the school's stated intention to involve parents as far as possible, I seriously doubted whether Mr or Mrs Singh would be capable or prepared to enter into the kind of partnership the school envisaged. Looking through the booklet the head had given them, I guessed that they would have some difficulty making sense of it. They would probably need help with sentences like, ‘class teachers, together with the help of the remedial specialist, ensure that there is a detailed understanding of the learning difficulties of each individual child.’ Terms like, ‘environmental work’, ‘a full curriculum’, ‘special programmes of work for language development’ would need to be explained to them. The school's expressed intention is that ‘parents are helped to understand the nature of the learning difficulties of their child and are encouraged to visit the school frequently to develop that understanding and to continue that approach at home.’ Neither Mr nor Mrs Singh have the confidence to take on such a role. March 12: Coping with the procedure I met with Mrs Singh and the educational psychologist in the head's room. Mrs Singh was very certain — she and her husband had decided that they both want Balbinder to go to Cedars. I tried to explore the problems Mrs Singh would have in attempting to be a fully participating parent but the educational psychologist seemed to feel that this was a problem common to many Cedars parents. The educational psychologist spent some time explaining the legal side of Statementing, which is complex. He told us that it would take many weeks to sort out and would involve a variety of procedures, such as a medical, reports from the school and visits. There would be twenty-nine days between the initial letter from County Hall and any action. The sheer amount of information seemed daunting. I arranged to visit that afternoon and to go through it with Mr and Mrs Singh. When I arrived they showed me the letter they had received from the Chief Education Officer that morning which explained the proposed Statementing procedure: The learning difficulties being experienced by your child were discussed and  you agreed that your child probably has a special educational need which requires further investigation. Therefore it is proposed to carry out an assessment of your child's needs under the Education Act 1981 with your agreement. The letter was at pains to stress the parents' involvement and their rights: ‘If it is agreed that the Authority should determine the special educational provision for your child…your further rights under the Education Act 1981 will be explained to you.’ An enclosed booklet gave further general information about the provision of special education with an addendum summarising the legal rights of parents in relation to the assessment process. In this, the mysterious twenty-nine days was explained: ‘parents will have a period of 29 days in which to seek further information from the Chief Education Officer and to make representations and submit written evidence.’ Since they had evidently made up their minds, none of this seemed important to them. Going through the Cedars' brochure with them, however, they were pleased to find a statement which they could relate to, namely that the school sets out to help children, ‘who are having problems in learning to read, find spelling and writing difficult, are unable to express themselves well, are unable to settle and concentrate…’ All these seemed to relate to Balbinder's needs as his parents saw them and Mr and Mrs Singh were beginning to seem happier. As they understood it, after a short while Balbinder might be sorted out and returned to mainstream. I did not feel so optimistic. The brochure stated clearly that while some children transferred back to mainstream schools, ‘the majority remain until they are 16 years of age’. June 5: Testing Visited Mrs Singh at home. She told me that she had been present when Balbinder was tested by the educational psychologist. Balbinder had had to do a lot of puzzles. The psychologist had said he was good with his hands. Mrs Singh said he would not sit down and kept walking about. She said he was the same at home, only wanted to play with toys and watch TV, he wouldn't do any ‘work’. I was not sure what she meant by ‘work’. She went on to her worries about Jeetinder who still wasn't bringing anything home from school. She was being racially harassed and was afraid to go out into her garden. Her husband was away in India for three weeks. People were throwing things over her garden wall and someone had painted on the front door. We spent a lot of time discussing this. In some ways Balbinder seemed the least of her problems at the time. Perhaps it was a relief that matters were being taken out of her hands. We agreed to meet at school the following week. June 10: The information for the Statement First, the head went through the school report, details of birth, address, etc. There was a brief account of professional intervention to date. Before starting school he had attended the child development centre, received speech therapy and since had been seen on several occasions by the educational psychologist. Then, there was a description of the child's functioning: he had taken a long time to settle into school, e.g. routine and order of the class. He had communication problems — speech and English language were not good. He had difficulty ‘sounding’ because of this, and it was thought to be affecting his progress in learning to read. The head attempted to explain to Mrs Singh how children have to learn the initial sounds of words and how having two languages can impede this. I think Mrs Singh understood. Balbinder has also had difficulty learning colours, numbers and sounds. His progress was slow because his retention was poor. At this point Mrs Singh looking concerned said, ‘You think there's something wrong with him inside of him?’ The head said, ‘No, he's not ill.’ Mrs Singh agreed that it must be the way he forgot things. The head said ‘Yes, he does have difficulty remembering — particularly sounding’, and felt that this could be because he was perhaps more fluent in Punjabi. There were discrepancies in the report. On the one hand Mrs Singh was told that his drawing and writing were immature, that he was still drawing and writing like a very young child; yet later she was told that he was very good with a pencil and talented at art! Having said that he was very immature the report added that there had been considerable improvement, but it had taken a long time (he had only been at school for four terms and had had a change of teacher). The head stressed that what Balbinder needed was to be in a small group, not in a class of twenty-three. In order for him to maintain interest he needed to work in short spurts. In his present situation, his difficulty in concentrating took up a lot of the teacher's time. The head then commented on his social development. Here they felt there had been much progress. Balbinder used to be ‘wild’, but he had learned to share and to take part in group work, despite still being a very lively child. The head then went on to describe the aims and provision of special education. Since Balbinder clearly made more progress in a small group where he could have a lot of attention, and where all worked at the same pace, this could be an answer. The head felt that the boy needed somebody permanently watching him. Also he needed a lot of talking in English, as he was still not sounding words clearly. Further he was a very active child, and needed specialist apparatus. They had all the necessary facilities and resources at Cedars. The head was very persuasive, showing concern for the way Balbinder would react when (or if) he fell behind. As he was already behind in mastering the basic skills which lay the foundation for all further work, he felt that Balbinder needed a lot of help if he was to do justice to his abilities. And he said very kindly, ‘That's our view of Balbinder.’ The educational psychologist gave his report. He reiterated that Balbinder's problems with language had needed attention before school. He stressed that he was a very likeable little boy. However, observing him in the classroom he had noticed his immature behaviour. He ran about a lot, and found concentration difficult. Despite much improvement in pencil and art work there had been none in reading and other school work. He was fidgety and in a dream world when being given instruction in a group. Often he watched other children and then followed and copied them. The psychologist commented that Balbinder had liked having a reading book and clearly wanted to read but when it came to reading he did not understand what he was doing but relied on guessing. He clearly wanted to do well, wanted to read but needed a lot of extra help. When asked questions he gave one word answers, though he used two words on occasion, as in ‘boys swimming’, ‘wet play’. On the tests he gave him he was better on puzzles and patterns, poor on those involving speaking and understanding. He felt that Balbinder needed to work slowly and not be pushed — he needed more time and specific help to speak in sentences. At this point Mrs Singh said, ‘They are not allowed to speak English at home.’ She felt that he spoke better in Punjabi and that he remembered better in Punjabi. She referred to her own family: parents, brother and sisters who all spoke English at home. She found this very odd. At the weekend when she had taken Balbinder to stay with his grandparents in Coventry, her brother had been trying to teach Balbinder to say ‘can I’, or ‘May I’ instead of‘I want to’. The educational psychologist listened tolerantly to Mrs Singh's comments, did not respond to them but simply repeated that Balbinder needed to be with teachers who were experienced in working with small groups. Mrs Singh said that she felt that Balbinder would always do what was wanted if it suited him. The educational psychologist told her that one of the teachers from Cedars had visited Balbinder in school and made very positive comments. It seemed that a place was available but that all the complex procedures had to be completed before it could be offered to them. He still had to have a medical. The head would speak to the school doctor that same day. Social Services would write to Mrs Singh. The procedure was necessarily long-winded but it could be completed by the end of term. Mrs Singh expressed a worry about Balbinder refusing to dress himself and ordering her to get him ready for school when he could do this perfectly well if he wanted to. The educational psychologist said this was understandable while he was feeling rather unsettled. The head said he would chase up the documents. Mrs Singh seemed bewildered by the amount of information she had been given. I promised to go and see her again on Friday morning. Throughout this interview Mrs Singh, who was still struggling to grasp the implications of what the head and educational psychologist were telling her, attempted to contribute. Her anecdotes were treated courteously but no real response was made. It seemed that now the process was under way her contribution was not required. June 12 I visited Mr and Mrs Singh. Mrs Singh and I talked Mr Singh through the meeting, point by point. He agreed with the head's account of Balbinder's lack of concentration, which obviously worried them both a great deal. He listened to what I had to say about the procedure still to be gone through and hoped that they would soon hear whether Balbinder had a place. I said that this was almost certain but the process was rather slow. Mrs Singh agreed to tell me when she heard from the doctor. They both understood that this was a formality and that he was not thought to be ‘ill’. What particularly concerned me was their feeling that Balbinder seemed to understand and respond better in Punjabi. Mrs Singh expressed her feelings that it was very important for all her children to speak Punjabi and she was afraid that they might not do this if she and Mr Singh spoke English. Both parents were very concerned that he should get more appropriate help and were now convinced that this would be provided at Cedars. June 22: Acceptance Mrs and Mrs Singh had received a letter offering Balbinder a place at Cedars. They had understood the gist but needed help. We filled in the acceptance form and phoned the school about a visit. The school secretary said all the September intake would be invited for a morning before the end of term. Balbinder, who had been excluded from all deliberations about his future, had not seen his new school yet. July 15: Balbinder visits his new school Mrs Singh, Balbinder and I set off to visit Cedars School. Balbinder was very subdued. His mother said he was not happy about the new school, and wanted to stay where he was. He had, after all, had five terms there, he would be 7 in December. He did not speak all the way. Mrs Singh remarked what a long way it seemed. We were early and stood in the playground. Balbinder looked around but clung to Mrs Singh. We went in and were ushered into the hall where a number of other new children were looking at books of photos of school trips and events. We were asked to sit in the third and fourth rows and the lower school children filed in. The head explained that the school had a lower/middle/ upper division and the lower school head briefly explained that the children were going to show the parents and new children what they had been doing. Each year group described a recent trip and showed photos and work they had done. The classes were small, as was the number of ethnic minority children. There were one, or possibly two, Afro-Caribbean children overall and one or two Asian children in each group. Mrs Singh and Balbinder noticed each one and commented. It was hot and the demonstration went on much too long, but it  gave us all some idea of how caring the teachers were and it was a practical illustration of what the school was trying to do. The children were then asked to go out to play. Balbinder was very reluctant and clung to his mother. He had lost interest in the activities. There had been too much ‘talk and show’ early on and he had been wriggling about, scraping his chair back and causing Mrs Singh to reprimand him constantly. It looked as if we would have to take him out but an older Asian boy came and took him away, and he went quite confidently. The head then told the parents about travel, uniform, swimming (once a week all the year round), the PTA, illnesses, notes for absence or non-swimming and, above all, contacting the school whenever in doubt. We were then taken to have coffee and the school secretary handed out official forms for the parents to fill in. Mrs Singh filled them in although she had already expressed alarm at the number of notes she was going to have to write to the school. Classes were allocated and Balbinder was to be in class 1 with a Mrs Allinson and a nursery assistant. It was small, with its own toilets and washbasins and an entirely private playground. Balbinder ran outside straight away, gesturing to me to come and look at it. In the playground they had a sturdy wooden house with door and windows, climbing and swinging equipment and lots of small bicycles and tricycles. In the classroom, photos of the trip to the seaside were on display and there were small circular tables. It was all on a scale much more appropriate for children than the high vaulting of his previous school and there was much more play equipment. This filled Mrs Singh with horror. She was worried by the way he roamed about touching everything, and during a long chat to Mrs Allinson expressed her concern that he could not get on with anything, and could not write or read. Mrs Allinson was very reassuring. However, Mrs Singh clearly saw Cedars as a temporary phase. Earlier on, in the playground, as Balbinder had gradually gained confidence and begun to explore and use things Mrs Singh had said, wistfully, ‘I do hope Balbinder learn so quickly he will soon go back to his school.’ On the way out the head knelt down to say goodbye to Balbinder, who was still looking rather mystified but was much less clinging and was smiling more. In the car on the way home he sat alone, opened the window and put his head out. It was very hard to imagine what he made of what was going on. No one had consulted him and he didn't seem to want to talk about it. In all these transactions Balbinder seemed a shadowy figure. Decisions were being taken about his future which no one could explain to him. Over the last few months he had become rather withdrawn and mistrustful; a subdued version of his former self. At Cedars Mrs Singh had instantly made friends with a young Asian woman (wearing trousers and a shirt) with a little girl who was evidently a year older than Balbinder. She and Mrs Singh spoke in Punjabi but her English sounded local and I suspected that she preferred to speak English. However, Mrs Singh was pleased to meet her and generally liked all the teachers and what she saw. I wondered whether she had any misgivings. The distance will certainly be a  problem. What she was making of this experience was also hard to imagine. Choice seemed to have been taken away from her, but some of her anxieties had also been allayed. PROGRESS REPORT In September Balbinder started at Cedars. My contact with the family became much less frequent. Their circumstances had changed: Mr Singh had a full-time job, they had taken a big step and purchased their council house and Mrs Singh now felt that she needed permanent work herself. The job she finally acquired during the summer holidays meant leaving home before the children and returning after them. The coach which picked up the Cedars' children stopped about five minutes' walk away from their home. Balbinder had to be seen onto it, and met at the end of the day. For the first few weeks of term this was a problem. Mr Singh could take him to the bus when he was on late shifts and collect him on early shifts. His brothers aged 8 and 10, whose school was a long walk in the opposite direction, had to be relied on to take this responsibility when their father could not. The whole operation caused Mrs Singh a great deal of anxiety. By half-term, a local parent with a child at Cedars had offered to put Balbinder on the coach in the morning and let him stay at her house until he could be picked up in the evening. Mrs Singh had now effectively become cut off from her children's education just as Balbinder had been cut off from local peer group relationships. She occasionally contacted me, and for a Christmas present gave me a photograph of Balbinder taken at school and made into a calendar. This showed him sitting at a desk, pencil in hand: his mother's vision of what school should be about. She and Mr Singh had visited the school for a Christmas event and had been pleased to hear that Balbinder was being moved into the second class. She had been worried that he was still playing too much and not learning anything. From January to July my contacts with the family were infrequent and concerned the progress of the two older boys. My advice was sought on several occasions when the family did not know how to cope with quite serious problems concerning the behaviour of one of them. Balbinder was no longer a worry. However, in July Mrs Singh phoned to ask whether I could go with her to Cedars' open evening. She wanted my opinion on Balbinder's progress. I was not able to go with her, but, as I was in contact with the school's section XI teacher at the time, I arranged to visit on my own. The section XI teacher, who had particular responsibility for Balbinder, said that he was the least of her worries. He had been moved to a higher class, seemed well adjusted and chatted a lot when she worked with him. His class teacher also felt that he was making progress. Both parents had come to the open evening and she had been able to talk to them. They had also come to school earlier in the year for the annual assessment meeting, a statutory requirement for children who are the subject of Statements. Looking back to her first encounter with Balbinder a year ago, when she had visited him at his previous school, she said that she had been shocked. He had been on the periphery of a large class and little attempt was being made to involve him in what was going on. She had felt at the time that he was ‘pretty borderline for special school’. It seemed that in a school where he was in such a minority, his language and ethnicity had been defined as particular problems requiring the rather Draconian solution of Statementing. His present class teacher and the section XI teacher both agreed that he was a slow learner, but felt that he did not exhibit the behavioural problems nor degrees of learning difficulty that characterised many of the children in the school. This was borne out by observing him in the classroom, where he was sitting quietly working, in contrast with the much less controlled behaviour of other children in this small group. In this environment he appeared to have become a model pupil. However, despite the small class and the specialist attention he was still considered far behind for a 7 year old. He could not read or write independently. His written work, like both his brothers', was neat and controlled, consisting of short accounts of daily events which the teacher had transcribed and he had carefully illustrated and copied. The question of return to mainstream schooling was not being considered. Later, talking to his teacher after a year and two terms at Cedars, it seemed that Balbinder's conversational language was developing well; he could hold his own in a small group often initiating topics of interest, describing, explaining and enquiring. However, his teacher warned that proficiency in conversational language should not be assumed to equate with proficiency in cognitive or ‘academic’ language. She reported on his ‘good imagination, something which shows up particularly in his drawings which always contain fine detail,. Out of mainstream education perhaps for the rest of his school career, Balbinder is no longer defined as a problem. His re-entry, however, either to mainstream or to the start of adult working life, may not be achieved so smoothly. The process of Statementing has disrupted his normal development. It has not taken into account the evident disjuncture between the cultural norms of his home and community and those of the school. In a more recent conversation with his mother she was still worried about him despite good reports from the school and the fact that ‘he now speaks both languages all right’. Her lack of contact with the school, the distance and her work made her feel helpless: ‘I can't rely on myself — I don't know — working all the time — how could I know.’ Balbinder would be 8 at Christmas and she saw no evidence of the improvement in learning to read and write that she was hoping for. On being a client Conflicting perspectives on assessment Derrick Armstrong and David Galloway This chapter looks at the perceptions of parents of their role in the assessment of their child's special educational needs as part of the Statementing process carried out under the 1981 Education Act. The analysis is based on observations of professional — parent and professional — child interactions during the assessments of thirty children referred to the Schools Psychological Service in three LEAs because they were thought to have emotional and behavioural difficulties. In each case these observations were complemented by interviews held with the participants. INTRODUCTION: PERCEPTIONS DIFFER Perhaps it is not surprising that, without exception, the professionals to whom we talked stated emphatically that their overriding concern was to act in the interests of their child clients. Likewise, they expressed a desire to involve parents at the centre of decision-making. The former is consistent with the ethical codes of their professional associations (e.g. Association of Educational psychologists (1984) Members Handbook). The latter, recommended by The Warnock Report (DES 1978), was established in law by the 1981 Education Act and supported by subsequent advice to professionals issued by the DES (1983, 1989). Does the 1981 Act assist or inhibit cooperation between professionals and parents? On face value the Act formalises a cooperative framework. In practice, however, the bureaucratisation of the professional — parent relationship and the assessment process may lead to a situation in which the primary function of parental involvement is to legitimise professional decisions. Many parents felt that their own contribution to the assessment was only taken seriously when it supported what the professionals were saying. On many occasions in our study we found a sharp contrast between the professionals' perception that a high degree of consensus had been reached and the parents' perception that they had agreed to a course of action because they saw no other real choice, particularly if the urgent needs of the child and other family members were to be quickly met. In the following section we use case history data to identify ways in which the professional — parent relationship operates within the context of the 1981 Act. This is followed by a discussion of the impact the 1981 Act has had on the notion of partnership. CONFLICTS OF INTEREST: THREE CASE STUDIES Each of the examples in this section illustrate the complexities which lie behind the definition of problem and special need by professionals in what they believe to be a collaborative relationship with parents. John: defining parents as part of ‘the problem' Cooperation with parents may be made particularly difficult where the professional identifies a conflict of interests between parents and child. For example, the home situation may be seen as the single most important factor ‘causing’ the child's behaviour problems. Rather than being seen as partners in the search for a solution parents may be seen as part of the problem (Moses and Croll 1987, Wood 1988). Because they are viewed in this light parents may respond with diffidence to those carrying out the assessment of their child and simply reflect back and reinforce professional perceptions. In John's case the stated reason for referral for formal assessment was his behaviour in school. However, underlying this was his teachers' deeper concern that he might be a victim of physical and sexual abuse. The evidence in support of these allegations was vague and in the event unsubstantiated despite in extensive Social Services investigation which ran parallel to the Statementing procedures. In drawing her conclusions about the family situation the head teacher pointed to the ‘fact’ that John's parents were only cooperative on the surface. ‘Mum was initially cooperative…and Mr Peel was likewise ‘quite cooperative’’ until the decision was made to Statement…after that he opted out and didn't contact me.’ Mrs Peel, however, saw things differently, saying of the head, ‘She seemed to be assessing me rather than John…it's like she's shifting the blame on to me…she used to speak to me like I was a really bad mother. I used to come home in tears.’ The school found some support for their interpretation of Mrs Peel's behaviour from a community nurse who tried to work with the family: ‘She thinks there's evidence of sexual abuse; soiling, language and sexually overt behaviour.’ In addition the nurse, too, thought that the parents were uncooperative and that they were hiding something. She stated in her report: ‘On the occasions of visiting home I have felt most unwelcome and am therefore limited in the intervention I can provide.’ She recommended that a meeting with Social Services would be helpful to alert them to the ‘dynamics’ of this family and to advise them that ‘as professionals we were anxious that we had not managed to engage and intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’. Following the nurse's report a meeting was held with Social Services. According to Mrs Peel who was invited to attend: All different people went in the meeting — the health visitor, the doctor, teachers — but I couldn't go in. When I was allowed in the child abuse officer was in the chair and he told me that his behaviour was the behaviour of a child who was being sexually abused. They said they were not saying it was, but it was the behaviour. I went home in tears. They asked me to take the children for a full medical. I didn't want to but I was frightened they would think it was true, so I let them do it. I felt because they couldn't come up with anything else they brought this up to show it was something it home…it's all been dropped now I think. From the perspectives of both professionals and parents the attempt to build a cooperative framework directed towards meeting John's needs had broken down. According to the professionals the breakdown happened because the parents were the cause of the child's special needs. Consequently, cooperation was defined by the professionals in terms that allowed them, in the words of the community nurse, to ‘intervene within the family and explore deficits in the parenting role’. The parents were expected to accept the authority of the professionals even though there is little evidence to support their judgement. The parents' sense of disempowerment was at this stage complete. Cooperation with the professionals required acceptance of the framework within which John's needs had been professionally cast: that it was their deficits as parents which had created John's needs. On the other hand, refusal to cooperate would have been perceived by the professionals as reinforcing the latter's initial perceptions. The definition of a problem, its source and the ‘needs, that arise from it are frequently established by professionals at an early stage and as we see here the parents, because they lack information and power, may find it very difficult to challenge such assumptions. John's case also suggests how the perceptions of those professionals involved at an early stage of an assessment and the actions that follow may influence, direct or constrain the later perceptions and actions of other professionals. The educational psychologist (EP) expressed surprise that on every occasion he had met John the latter had always been attentive and cooperative but felt that ‘We have to accept what we are told about his behaviour by his teachers.’ For this reason when the head teacher eventually excluded John permanently from school because of his behaviour the EP accepted that the school were acting reasonably in the circumstances and that they had made every effort with John. The EP observed that ‘John's language is so adult and behaviour so violent to other people that the school could not put up with it any longer.’ On the other hand, the psychologist also recognised how the scope for his own intervention was restricted by the school's actions. ‘The exclusion shuts doors in terms of possible recommendation.’ Likewise, the EP, after visiting the family on a number of occasions, said that the community nurse's impressions ‘don't ring true with my  own experience’. He also felt that the evidence of abuse was unconvincing but given the involvement of other agencies in this area it was beyond his remit to challenge it in compiling his advice for the Statement. Mrs Peel thought the EP to be more sympathetic than the other professionals she had encountered and that made it easier for her to convey her views to him. None the less her experiences with those other professionals led her to believe that she could nut affect the result of their deliberations. She felt she had no power to determine or influence the decisions taken by the LEA and its professional advisers. To her the prospect of a Statement is ‘a load of rubbish. It's a legal document…but they've been telling me that all along. I get a bit of paper and it's more official but I still don't get anywhere.’ However strongly she felt about the rights and wrongs of her situation she had no sense of power over its outcome. George: who needs support?, what support is needed? In this section, by looking at the case of George, we examine the interactive process and power relationships underlying the development of an apparent consensus. We show how this consensus was identified as strong from the perspective of a professional, yet fragile and disempowering from the perspective of George's parents. George is a 9 year old attending a primary school in a working-class part of town. According to the head teacher ‘It may look very nice but we have a lot of difficult families and children.’ George comes from a large family and the home situation is acknowledged by his parents to be stressful because of overcrowding and financial difficulties. One of George's brothers was recently placed in a residential school for children with moderate learning difficulties as a weekly boarder. The family have experienced a lot of conflict with George's school and since moving home some twelve months ago have made efforts, unsuccessfully, to transfer their children to a different primary school. George was referred to the LEA for formal assessment under the Act on the grounds of emotional and behavioural difficulties as an ‘urgent case’. His teachers reported that the problem was ‘behaviour in class and at home’. In school, George was described as ‘aggressive…he wanders about instead of getting on with his work…he won't conform…he's like his brother…generally he disturbs other children. He disturbs their work.’ Those behaviours were identified by his teachers as arising directly from the problems George faced in the home. At the outset the willingness of George's parents to cooperate with the school staff in discussing the home situation and how this might affect George's behaviour in school was used by the teaching staff as evidence in support of their case that George's needs could not be met within a mainstream school. As the assessment progressed those two factors were at the forefront of the school's case to the educational psychologist: (a) Disruptive behaviour in school. (b) Management problems at home identified by the parents themselves. We can see here how, at an early stage, the discourse of needs was established. The main feature of this discourse was that George's needs were conceptualised within the framework of the teachers' perceptions of their own needs: in particular the threat George was seen as presenting to order and discipline within the school. The EP's role was seen by the teaching staff as being to advise the school. The EP was ‘brought in’ in response to the teachers' perception that they lacked the skills to manage George's behaviour. However, despite the way teachers represented their views Mr and Mrs Shod doubted the severity of the problem: ‘I don't think he's any worse than other kids — he's picked on by the school.’ Their stated wish was for him to be moved to another mainstream school. As regards the home situation their perspective was subtly and significantly different from that of the school. They acknowledged the stressfulness of the family situation but wanted help toward removing the stresses rather than to have George removed from the home. It is important to recognise their willingness to consider residential school in this context. When it was suggested to them as a possibility it was understood by them as an opportunity for a breathing space in the absence of any other alternative . It was a misperception of the parental perspective that was used by the professionals to legitimise the latter's recommendations. This is illustrated in the following exchange: Mr Short : There used to be a place in Scotland where kids could go to give parents a break. I don't know if there's anything like that round here. You've got to think of the kids as well. They've never had any holiday. EP : I'll try to make some enquiries about holidays. I do feel that George will need some special schooling — he's not getting what he needs. Not because of anything to do with the school but he needs special help — I think we should think about your feelings. Let's try and get some help for you and the family. Thus the EP links parental desire for respite from family stress with the notion of special schooling. Once this link is established Mrs Shott is asked to consider a residential placement and the parents' own anxieties about their family situation and needs are used to justify the proposal being put forward. The different perspectives of EP and parents were reflected in the confusion over what had been decided at that meeting. The EP wrote in a memorandum to the LEA: ‘I feel that George would benefit from placement in a residential school for pupils with emotional and behavioural problems. Mr and Mrs Short would be happy with a weekly boarding place.’ When questioned by a researcher Mr and Mrs Short restated their preference for a placement in an alternative mainstream school. They also reaffirmed their opposition to a residential school placement. Mrs Short : I couldn't handle George at weekends if he was away all week. Elder daughter :[referring to John, George's brother, who boards at an MLD school]. It makes him worse. John says ‘You've sent me away and don't love me.’ Yet Mrs Short, despite her strongly held views, expressed resignation in playing little part in the decision-making process, a resignation based in part upon experience. ‘We didn't bet much to do with John's assessment. I didn't want him to go to residential school at all.’ The professionals were seen by Mrs Short as decision-makers and therefore when asked about the outcome of the meeting with the EP she was unclear because ‘I haven't been told.’ The parents believed, however, that the outcome of the assessment would be a placement in a special school whatever their own views. In a later meeting between parents and psychologist the former, in response to the psychologist's efforts to identify/impose a consensus, again attempted to articulate their own understanding of George's needs. EP : Last time I saw you we felt that we should be looking at some kind of school with weekly boarding. Mrs Short said she would prefer George to attend a mainstream school. EP : That's where you would like him to go? Mr and Mrs Short : Yes. EP : One possible school would be weekly boarding — if you visited there would be no guarantee. Mr Short : To be honest with you we have one child already at one of those schools and when he comes home he's a lot worse. The psychologist in a separate interview with the researcher expressed the belief that this ‘fact’ was evidence of the unsuitability of the home situation. This contrasted sharply with the parents' belief that the child's poor behaviour at home was a consequence of the latter perceiving himself to have been rejected by the family because he had been sent to a boarding school. The psychologist suggested that the parents themselves really wanted George to be placed in a residential school but did not wish to appear that they were rejecting him. ‘They see residential school as an alternative to ‘care’ but it has less stigma for them. I think that's what they've really wanted all the way along.’ The psychologist justified his own persuasive efforts with this belief that he was actually helping the parents to come to terms with a decision ‘they really want to make ’. EP : What I suggest we do — nothing's going to be decided today — I can arrange for you to have a look at one of these weekly residential schools — at this stage we're saying let's look. Mr and Mrs Short : That's OK. The validity of the psychologist's interpretation of parental motives in this case is  difficult to assess. In the end it depends upon ‘professional judgement’. Whether or not it is correct, it quite clearly differs from the parents' explicit account of their perception of how the decision has been reached and the implications it will have for George. Mr Short : As far as I'm concerned they give up too soon. Mrs Short : The way they were talking at that meeting George is going to residential school. It's going to make him worse. Tom: refusing to play the game Our third example focuses upon conflicting perceptions of the purpose of assessment under the 1981 Act and the relationship between information and control. It raises questions about how the Act itself can become a controlling force to limit parental action. Twelve months ago Tom had been placed two half-days each week in an off-site unit for disruptive children. This placement followed the breakup of his parents' marriage which was acknowledged by his mother, but not his father, as having a serious effect upon Tom's behaviour. After the breakup the parents were awarded joint custody and Tom resided for part of the week with each. Mrs Jones felt that this arrangement was itself disruptive and should be changed. Mr Jones did not agree. He felt that Tom caused him no problems and it was Tom's relationship with his mother that was at the root of the difficulties he had. Tom had recently been referred by his mainstream school to the psychological Service for assessment under the 1981 Act because teachers felt they should receive additional support for Tom's periods in mainstream school. The EP in this case felt that even more drastic measures might be required. In his view Tom was being used as a pawn in the relationship between his parents and unless his parents did come to an arrangement whereby ‘a more stable home situation’ was provided, Tom would benefit from a residential school placement. Tom's mother was highly critical of the way the mainstream school was handling him but agreed to the assessment because she felt it might help him. Initially she welcomed the professionals' involvement because she believed this might result in help and advice in identifying the reasons for Tom's deteriorating behaviour. Once the assessment had begun Mrs Jones soon became disillusioned. She complained bitterly about the lack of information she was receiving. Perhaps this reflected a lack of clarity about the purpose of the assessment and the conflicting expectations participants held of its outcome. Mrs Jones expected feedback and dialogue about the development of an intervention strategy. When she later challenged the EP she was told she should have contacted the Education Welfare Officer (EWO) designated by the LEA as being the ‘named person’. She couldn't recollect having been informed of this. In any case she had not expected that her role in the assessment would be limited to receiving information back from an  EWO: ‘We didn't ask for it [the assessment]— it was the education system who said it should be done — if I accept them into my home I don't expect them to disappear for twelve months, if they invited themselves in.’ Mrs Jones felt that the slow progress of the assessment and the limited information she received created new problems instead of resolving existing ones: ‘It introduces so much trauma — you're getting all the criticism all the time but you're not getting any information because it takes so long.’ Access to information, however, was not the only problem Mrs Jones faced. A lack of common agreement over the objectives of the assessment was something Mrs Jones had not anticipated. Whereas she had seen the assessment as a way of addressing Tom's unsettled home situation, establishing an objective base line from which she and her ex-husband could identify how their differences were affecting Tom, the EP refused to become involved in this area. ‘It's difficult if I'm to remain neutral.’ Yet the EP was willing to use this dispute as a justification for his recommendation for residential schooling. In addition, Mrs Jones was dissatisfied that little attention appeared to have been given to Tom's problems in school. She had been told on one occasion by the EP that Tom's behaviour problems might have been the result of frustration over reading difficulties. She had found this information to be very positive ‘because they can focus on dealing with it now, it spells out a lot of hope’. Yet she felt little had been done to address this problem in school and if in these circumstances she now accepted residential school she would be giving up on Tom. None the less the EP continued to recommend residential schooling. Mrs Jones's response was ‘No way am I going to agree with that.’ On the other hand, on a different occasion she expressed feelings of depression and powerlessness in the face of professional opinion, conceding that she might allow him to go to residential school if it could be shown that it was in his best interests. Once the EP had recommended residential schooling in his report Mrs Jones expressed little confidence in her ‘rights’ under the law. But she remained determined to play an equal part in defining the nature of her child's needs. She had seen the initial stage of the assessment process as an opportunity to enhance her role in the decision-making but saw it as restricting her power. She therefore decided to abandon reliance on official procedures. She moved house and with the cooperation of the new local head teacher changed Tom's mainstream school, and withdrew him from the off-site unit. The EP and LEA were now presented with a fait accompli . According to Mrs Jones they had little option in the circumstances but to allow her decision a ‘chance to fail’. DISCUSSION: DISEMPOWERMENT BY PARTNERSHIP The 1981 Education Act clearly states the procedures that must be followed to maximise parental involvement in the decision-making process. It identifies the range of information that must be made available to parents and the right of  parents to contribute their own advice and evidence to the assessment. Moreover, procedures are established for parents to seek clarification, state objections and appeal against recommendations. A strong case can be put forward to demonstrate that no decision can be taken without full consultation with parents and due deference to their views. In practice there is increasing evidence that the rights of parents under the Act are not always given prominence. A number of commentators have suggested that once the assessment procedures have been initiated parents become increasingly marginalised in the process. Dyson (1986), for example, drew attention to the ways in which professionals' confidential files often contain materials contributing to the social stereotyping of children and their families. This information might be circulated informally amongst professionals but parents remain ignorant of its existence. Chaudhury (1986) and Rehal (1989) identified how parents of ethnic minority children may be disadvantaged during special needs assessments by the failure of LEAs and professionals to take account of language and cultural factors. Goacher et al . (1988) found marked differences between LEAs in the role parents are allowed to play. ‘It seems certain that even the small change in the balance of power between professionals and parents brought about by the Act have yet to be realized in a number of Authorities’(Goacher et al . 1988: 59). It might be suggested that the disempowerment of parents arises from a combination of LEAs seeking to maintain control over the distribution of resources and professionals seeking to secure the autonomy of their professional role. Yet we can find evidence of LEAs taking their responsibilities under the Act for involving parents very seriously, presenting information and reports in ways designed to make the assessment meaningful and accessible to parents. None the less, even in these cases parents may find the concepts of ‘disclosure’ and ‘involvement’to operate implicitly as disempowering forces. Mittler and Mittler (1982) make a similar point when they argue that a clear distinction should be drawn between the concepts of ‘partnership’ and ‘involvement’. Whilst the former emphasises the sharing of power as well as expertise, the latter contains an implicit assumption of professional expertise and control. Swann (1987) has argued that as long as segregated provision exists, a means to select and allocate children will be needed. This, he suggests, is the main purpose of Statementing. Because Statementing is concerned with the allocation of resources rather than with the identification of needs strict limits are placed on the power of parents to affect the Statementing process. If Swann is correct the identification of needs will be resource-led. The 1981 Act itself may be read as implicitly setting out this principle, and Galloway and Goodwin (1987) have demonstrated its operation in practice. As Swann (1987) argues, without the power to make decisions about resources, parent involvement within the 1981 Act is concerned ‘with recruiting parents as resources in the education of their children, pursuing goals defined by professionals’(Swann 1987: 193). The way in which the concept of ‘need’ is defined by the 1981 Act may also  serve to reinforce the limits on parental power. The Act abolished the ten categories of handicap identified under the 1945 Handicapped pupils and School Health Regulations (DES 1945) and replaced them with the concept of ‘special educational need’. ‘Need’ was redefined in terms of learning difficulties significantly greater than those of the majority of children. This shifted the conceptual focus away from needs as defined in relation to the child's handicap towards educational needs arising from learning difficulties. None the less, there remains a focus upon the child as having needs rather than upon the situation as creating needs (Oliver 1988). An important implication of this is that while a particular situation may give rise to various differing, and sometimes conflicting needs (the needs of teachers, parents, other pupils, the LEA and indeed the LEA's professional advisers), the conceptual focus upon the child encouraged by the Act inhibits the development of a theoretical framework within which the interplay of needs can be examined. On the other hand, psychologists frequently have the task of mediating between the needs and interests of the different participants involved with the child and their key role in the decision-making process. Despite the ‘rights’ parents are given under the Act this is a form of power that parents are rarely able to exercise. Parental involvement in decision-making is often restricted to identifying those aspects of the child's behaviour that fit or do not fit with the views of the professionals. Parents are marginalised, not because professionals deliberately exclude them but because they are denied the opportunity to influence how need is conceptualised. Moreover, in practice, they may lack the power to negotiate on equal terms with professionals about the interrelationship between the needs of different participants in the assessment. By conceptualising the child's needs in a way that fails to acknowledge the significance of this wider context the Act reinforces and legitimises the disempowerment of parents. We can see how this occurred in our first two case studies. In both cases the parents' resignation to the inevitability of the assessment outcome arose from their having no opportunity to determine or seriously influence the objectives of the assessment nor to contribute to the conceptual framework within which their children's needs were being assessed. In the third case Mrs Jones refused to accept the proposals put forward by the professionals for meeting Tom's needs. Whereas at first she had welcomed the assessment she later came to the view that she was being given no say in the objectives of the assessment. She, too, felt that she was denied the opportunity to make a genuine contribution, in cooperation with the professionals, to the understanding of Tom's needs and the circumstances in which they were being created. Ultimately, this led her to challenge the way the professionals conceived Tom's needs. In her eyes, she could only do so by stepping outside the framework imposed by the Act. Her direct challenge to the authority of the professionals forced them to acknowledge an alternative conceptualisation of Tom's needs which carried with it quite different implications for the outcome of the formal assessment of those needs. In addition her action outside the assessment  procedures also gave Mrs Jones the power to negotiate with other participants. By securing the support of the head teacher and staff of a different mainstream school she was able to place her opposition to a recommendation for residential schooling on a firm footing and insist that her understanding of Tom's needs be tested in practice. Thus Mrs Jones's power inside the assessment process was increased by her having identified and pursued sources of strength outside that process.

ACA ACA-CTY-004 -10.4 "The scientific critique of historicism Before Sartre had even replied to Levi-Strauss criticisms, Althusser had published for Marx (1965), a work which, together with the later volume Reading Capital (1968), far from defending Sartre's Marxism from the structuralist challenge, completed the move against it, and offered a new interpretation of Marxism from which humanist existentialism and Hegelianism had been resolutely purged, with Sartre's voluntarism replaced by a more mediated form of economism. It is easy to represent Althusser's intervention purely in terms of structuralism, but to suggest that this was its only significant intellectual context is misleading. If his work needs to be considered in the context of the contemporary politics of the Communist Party, as several commentators have stressed, it also requires reference to work done in the history of the sciences, particularly that of Gaston Bachelard in the history of physics and chemistry, his pupil Georges Canguilhem in the life sciences, and Jean Cavaillès in mathematics. All four, together with Althusser's pupil, Michel Foucault, worked within an epistemological tradition which was critical of the positivism which, up to that time, had dominated the history of the sciences. To represent Althusser's work purely as a ‘structural Marxism’ therefore passes over the fact that there were distinct intellectual traditions in France whose difference was particularly pronounced in their respective philosophies of history. Much of what has been considered to be poststructuralism's wild disregard for history can be accounted for by the fact that it was operating within this — largely unknown outside France — anti-empiricist and anti-positivist tradition. In 1978 Foucault suggested that post-war French philosophy divides according to a line ‘which separates a philosophy of experience, meaning and the subject from a philosophy of savoir , rationality and the concept’: in other words, Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, against Cavaillès, Bachelard and Canguilhem, or the return-to-Hegel of Kojève in the thirties, versus the return-to-Rant initiated in the philosophy of the sciences by Léon Brunschvicg in the late nineteenth century. Long before Sartre developed his own form of Marxist-Hegelian history, Bachelard had been working in a critical relation to Hegelian historicism. What was new in Althusser was that for the first time this epistemological tradition was developed for a Marxism. Against Sartre's claim to establish Marxism's truth philosophically, Althusser reasoned that if Marxism is a science, then the history of Marxism ought to conform to the kind of history that had been developed for the sciences. The question then simply became whether it did or not. Or so it seemed. The difficulties in which Althusser subsequently became enmeshed were the result of his ignoring Canguilhem's warning that although the history of science takes science for its object, it is not itself a science, and therefore cannot claim to be value-free (or, in Marxist terms, non-ideological). As Gregory Elliott has recently emphasized, although Althusser always presented himself as the figure of the rigours of orthodoxy against the eclecticism of the existentialists, in his own work he was just as catholic, allying Marxism with non-Marxist philosophy, even if it was a history of science to which, he claimed, ‘French philosophy owes its renaissance in the last thirty years’. II BACHELARD AND THE HISTORY OF SCIENCE Against the Hegelian synthesis of all kinds of history within the same developmental schema, Bachelard argued that the history of science cannot be assimilated into the progressive evolutionary form commonly ascribed to other kinds of human history, and nor can it be mapped on a one-to-one basis against the history of its age. In certain pure sciences, mathematics for instance, although discoveries may enable changes and developments of a material kind, their occurrence cannot ipso facto be explained by being related to the allegedly determining political and economic history of their immediate era. As Levi-Strauss was to argue, different histories have different temporalities: the time scales of the sciences do not work at the same pace as other forms of history: they have their own dynamic, their own rhythm, their own times, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, that do not operate by the ordinary round of the year; Bachelard was fond of pointing out that from a scientific point of view the ten years from 1920 to 1930 were as long an era as the previous five hundred. This unevenness of development means that there can be no general history of science as such: it is uneven but it cannot be combined. Many sciences moreover share the characteristic that a major discovery means that all other models and theories are simply out of date and have to be discarded. From the point of view of the present, the past has to be excised. Contemporary science is able to designate itself, through its revolutionary discoveries, as a liquidation of a past . Here discoveries are exhibited which send back all recent history to the level of a prehistory. Here we do indeed find an example of a ‘liquidation’ of history which, it will be recalled, is exactly the accusation that Terry Eagleton makes against poststructuralism; but the actual example in Bachelard demonstrates how much more complex the issue turns out to be. Science's negative relation to the past emerges as one of its most distinctive and significant aspects, one which marks a complete break with the cumulative structures of the arts and social sciences. It means, in particular, that the temporality of science cannot be accommodated to the rhythms of traditional historiography, which has not, however, prevented positivistic historians of science from writing its history solely in terms of precursors and anachronistic anticipations of modern ideas in early thinkers, as if science unrolled smoothly and inevitably from year to year. The problem with this approach is that it overestimates the extent of narrative continuity in the history of science which, according to Bachelard's examples, works rather by sudden disruptions, discontinuities, and entire reorganizations of its principles. Science is forever remaking its own history. As early as 1934 Bachelard had argued that the revolutionary changes in physics, such as relativity theory and microphysics, meant that science itself was currently defined by its reaction against the past, and had become a ‘philosophy of the non,— non-Cartesian, non-Euclidean, non-Newtonian, and non-Baconian. These major transformations cannot be mapped onto the model of a continuous history, for its stress on putative anticipations fails to account for the way in which the whole form of knowledge can be transformed and a new understanding created. Bachelard's work on the formation of scientific disciplines led him to argue that the proper form of historical analysis should focus not upon an empirical history but upon the cognitive or epistemological status of concepts that distinguish a new science from an old one. Those concepts have not evolved from the old ones, for it is precisely their radical difference that constitutes the new science, the new ‘positivity’, produced by what he termed an ‘epistemological rupture’. Bachelard himself preferred to give examples of such ruptures rather than theorize how they took place. Althusserians subsequently placed much emphasis upon the ‘epistemological break’, and were in turn castigated for being unable to explain how it occurred. But this neglects the force of Althusser's emphasis on Marxism as itself a theoretical practice with its own history of epistemological self-correction, a possibility derived from the work of the mathematician Jean Cavaillès, who stressed the degree to which the history of mathematics, particularly set theory, could be accounted for by the dialectical development of the concept. Much of the emphasis on set theory in Lacan and others, as well as the similarity of certain of their ideas to those of Gödel, whose work Cavaillès utilizes, can be attributed to his influence: indeed it would be possible to argue that the whole emphasis in post-war French thinkers on a non-contradictory heterogeneity in which incompatible or incommensurable elements are juxtaposed against or as part of each other is  derived as much from set theory as from Freud. Cavaillès developed these ideas into a theory of science as such, which, he argued, changed not through empirical discovery but through the theoretical reworking of its own concepts in the ‘pure’ sciences. This view, whereby science progresses through the dialectic of its concepts rather than by testing its hypotheses against ‘experience’, was developed significantly by both Bachelard and Althusser. If it enabled the latter the crucial theoretical move of being able to reject the classical empiricist conception of knowledge, it was also to put him in the position of even castigating as ‘historicist’ any attempts to account for theoretical discourse in terms of its historical conditions of production — perhaps one of the major ways in which he differed from Canguilhem and Foucault. Bachelard and Cavaillès agree that the distinguishing characteristic of modern science is the degree to which it has become separated from common-sense knowledge so that consciousness and its concepts are now opposed: The break between ordinary and scientific knowledge seems to us so clear that these two types of knowledge could not have the same philosophy. Empiricism is the philosophy which corresponds to ordinary knowledge. There empiricism finds its origin, its evidence, its development. By contrast, scientific knowledge is bound up with rationalism and, whether one wishes it or not, rationalism is allied to science, and demands scientific goals. The use of scientific instruments in particular means that scientific perception is constantly at odds with the experience of everyday perception. Because scientificity is achieved through a break with common-sense forms of thinking, termed ‘epistemological obstacles’, Bachelard, like Lévi-Strauss and Althusser after him, argues that any philosophy such as existentialism that is founded on the basis of the truth of the experience of the knowing subject is bound to involve illusory or ideological forms of thought. For this reason, Bachelard refers ironically to Sartre's phenomenology as a belated form of alchemy. But if the new science is produced through a rupture with the ‘errors’ of the old, the tenacious hold of common-sense forms of thought means that any given text may simultaneously embody aspects of the old and new ways of thinking, theoretical and ideological frameworks that Bachelard, and Althusser after him, term ‘problematics’: Instead of the parade of universal doubt, scientific research requires the establishment of a problematic . It takes its real departure from a problem , even if it is badly set up. The scientific I is then a programme of experiments , whereas the non-scientific I is already a constituted problematic . Bachelard tries to think through the problem of how epistemological obstacles operated both before and after scientificity. In particular, he suggests that the educational system has a marked effect on the production and reproduction of scientific knowledge, and criticizes it for the ahistorical way in which it teaches scientific problems, theories, experiments and proofs. While pedagogy continues the myth of an elementary or easy science, language itself can also produce difficulties. The nomenclature of science does not refer to definitive concepts: It is ceaselessly adjusted, completed, varied. The language of science is in a state of permanent semantic revolution. Obstacles such as these lead Bachelard to formulate a theory of ‘material psychoanalysis’ which offers a ‘psychoanalysis of objective knowledge’to account for and think through the problem of epistemological obstacles. It is also supposed to have a therapeutic effect of a ‘brutal, surgical’ separation of unconscious and rational convictions in order‘to cure us of our images or at least to limit their power’. This separation between scientific and common-sense knowledge in turn produces a significant effect on Bachelard's thinking about history. For, as Lecourt describes it, he attempts to elaborate a system of concepts which will make it possible to think the intrication of two histories : that of the scientific and the non-scientific in the practice of the scientists. Hence this project culminates in Le rationalisme appliqué with the project of an epistemological history which is presented as a dual history; a ‘ratified history’(or history of the scientific in scientific practice) and a ‘lapsed history’(or history of the interventions of the non-scientific in scientific practice). This means that science can have two histories, which constantly intertwine but never resolve, with one evaluated as positive, the other as negative and therefore silently suppressed even though it may remain determining. Instead of upholding one at the expense of the other, Bachelard offers the possibility of a deconstructive history which would reinscribe that which had been excluded; this could also enable a differential history of science and ideology, accounting for the perpetuation of ideology after the production of science. To do so, Bachelard, as Althusser was to do later, invokes the use of psychoanalysis for the study of history and ideology. The notion of the epistemological break, while offering a theory of scientificity, and even of ideology, implied a very different view of history from that of Sartre. In some sense, it went to the other extreme, for from a totalizing history it projected a form of history in which there was no attempt to link different histories at all. Bachelard assumed the necessary division of the scientific from the non-scientific, even if de facto he was continually encountering their imbrication and finding himself in the  position of trying to keep them apart. Lecourt has pointed to the absence of ‘a concept that would enable him to think together several histories with different statuses; in short, the concept of a differential history’. Such a general concept was to be provided by Althusser's theory of relative autonomy within a structure in dominance. III ALTHUSSER AND THE SCIENCE OF HISTORY Althusser's rereading of Marx can thus be as usefully considered in the context of theories of the history of science as of structuralism; a certain conflation between the two has been possible because both were opposed to humanistic and phenomenological theories of knowledge in general and to historicism in particular. Within the general framework of his attack on the humanistic Hegelian tradition of Western Marxism, Althusser's specific objection to Sartre's attempt to mediate Marxism with existential subjectivity was that such a move went against the crucial discoveries which had founded Marxism in the first place; in an extension of Lévi-Strauss' argument, he maintained that the notion of ‘man’ that Sartre used was derived from a particular ideological definition of the human subject which represses Marx's insight that the human subject is not the centre of history, together with Freud's that the subject is not centred in consciousness. For Althusser both history and the subject are equally decentred: his attack on Sartre's claims for a unitary history (however complex its textual elaboration may have proved to be) was therefore accompanied by a critique of the notion of the unitary human subject that constitutes it. One way of characterizing Althusser's intervention would be Martin Jay's observation that he effectively destroyed the Lukácsian notion of totality. Another would be to say he attempted to theorize the very position that Sartre had fought to get out of. If Sartre's argument depended on a logic of history as totalization but broke down when he could not combine the praxis of the individual with the general logic of ‘totalization without a totalizer’ except through the proliferation of his own writing, Althusser, by contrast, exploited the possibility of history as a ‘process without a subject’, a history characterized by radical breaks and discontinuities, distinct from each other and not totalizing. It was this aspect of Althusserian theory, perhaps more than any other, that led many orthodox Marxists to consider that Althusser was not really a Marxist at all. The accusation that poststructuralism neglects history undoubtedly harks back above all to the work of Althusser who, more than anyone else, appears to have attempted to eliminate history. Notwithstanding their philosophical and political differences, there are nevertheless certain similarities between Althusser's and Sartre's projects when viewed in relation to orthodox Marxism. Althusser shared Sartre's opposition to Stalinism's emphasis on economism and technical  determinism, dissociating himself from it not through an assertion of individual agency but through a reformulation of the Marxist thesis of determination by economic relations — redefined as a causal rather than a historical relation. At the same time Althusser argued that Sartre had not isolated the central problems of orthodox Marxist theory, and as a result continued to work with some of its more questionable preconceptions. In particular, in spite of his attempt to avoid positing history as an a priori transcendent law, in the published first volume of the Critique he had still utilized an organicist teleological model of history which assumes that the end is already implicit in the beginning, and that history rolls forward to a determined end. Both Stalinism and Sartreanism assume that history is an emancipatory process of self-realization, even if the forces of production in the one are replaced by the praxis of the self-conscious human subject in the other. Althusser termed such a view ‘historicism’: an abstract philosophical scheme that imposes an overall process of transformation upon historical events. At first glance, it might seem as if Althusser himself gave up history and tried science instead. Like Sartre, he sought to constitute Marxism as a form of truth, but attempted to prove its truth not through the dialectic of history but rather as a science, authenticating Marx's ‘immense theoretical revolution’ epistemologically through a demonstration of its scientificity. In order to claim a scientific status for Marxism as knowledge rather than ideology, or non-knowledge, Althusser invoked Bachelard's historical epistemology which allowed him to posit the idea of a radical discontinuity between the two, with Marxist science separated from earlier forms of non-knowledge in Marx's texts by an ‘epistemological break’. This necessarily meant that Althusser endorsed Bachelard's arguments about empiricism and rejected the concept of history as a system of progression or evolution. However Althusser found it difficult to maintain a Marxist theory of history while avoiding its customary Hegelian form. His basic argument, that Marx proposed a new conception of knowledge defined against Hegelianism, implied an accompanying revision of the Hegelian concept of history, which, as we have seen in the cases of Lukács and Sartre, had hitherto provided the dominant model of Marxist historicism. Althusser's theory of history has been more widely attacked and denigrated than any other aspect of his work, largely because he dared to argue that, far from providing the unassailable foundation of Marxism, history was a problematic concept even in Marx's own texts: this apparently full word is in fact theoretically an empty word, in the immediacy of its obviousness — or rather, it is the ideology-fulfilment which surfaces in this lapse of rigour. Anyone who reads Capital without posing the critical question of its object sees no malice in this word that ‘speaks’ to him: he happily continues the discourse whose first word this word may be, the ideological discourse of history, and then the historicist  discourse. As we have seen and as we understand, the theoretical and practical consequences are not so innocent. (143) Althusser argues that Marx's intervention did not merely amount to the historicization of the formal categories of the classical economists. If this was the case all he would have done would have been to Hegelianize Ricardo. Marxists often imply that Marxism simply involves the introduction of a historical framework —‘always historicize!’— but this assumption can only be made, according to Althusser, because of‘the confusion that surrounds the concept of history ’: In reality, it is to introduce as a solution a concept which itself poses a theoretical problem, for as it is adopted and understood it is an uncriticized concept, a concept which, like all ‘obvious’ concepts, threatens to have for theoretical content no more than the function that the existing or dominant ideology defines for it. It is to introduce as a theoretical solution a concept whose status has not been examined, and which, far from being a solution, is in reality a theoretical problem. (93) Historicism presumes that a concept of history can be borrowed for Marxism from Hegel or from the practice of empiricist historians without difficulty and without asking how such a concept is specific to Marxism: for Althusser the crucial question is to ask ‘what must be the content of the concept of history imposed by Marx's theoretical problematic?’ That problematic cannot be identical to Hegel's because both Hegel and Marx define historical time in terms of the social totality: insofar as their definitions of the social totality can be shown to differ, so also will their concepts of historical time. For Flegel ‘historical time is merely the reflection in the continuity of time of the internal essence of the historical totality incarnating a moment of the development of the concept’(93). Historical time is the existence of the essence of the social totality and will therefore indicate its structure. Althusser isolates two key characteristics of Hegelian historical time, ‘its homogeneous continuity and its contemporaneity’. The first is well known: here time is the ‘continuum in which the dialectical continuity of the process of the development of the Idea is manifest’(94). In this schema the science of history consists of the problem of the division of this continuum into the periods that constitute successive dialectical totalities. The second characteristic, the contemporaneity of historical time, that is, the category of the historical present, is more complex but an essential element in the whole Hegelian model of history, indeed is its condition of possibility. If historical time is the existence of the social totality then the relation between the two must be one of immediacy, allowing what Althusser calls an ‘essential section’, that is ‘a break in the present such that all the elements of the whole revealed by this section are in an immediate relationship with one another, a relationship that immediately expresses their internal essence’. This section is possible precisely because the unity of the whole is an expressive totality, that is ‘a totality all of whose parts are so many ‘total parts ’ each expressing the others, and each expressing the social totality that contains them, because each in itself contains in the immediate form of its expression the essence of the totality itself’(94). Hegel's conception of historical time, then, reflects his conception of the intrinsic unity between all parts of the social totality, each a part of the whole and the whole present in each part, so that history too partakes of a self-reflective immediacy which paradoxically makes it ahistorical. Perhaps surprisingly, given his alleged ‘structuralism’, Althusser argues that the structuralist distinction between synchrony and diachrony rests upon this Hegelian version of historical time which is both continuous and contemporaneous with itself. Against this Althusser maintains that time, even chronological time, is not just an empirical entity, but a concept; that though history may be articulated in general with chronological time, each history has its own temporality, which can only be found by establishing the conceptual nexus of the history in question. In order to determine what an event is, we must know the concept of the history in which the event is to occur. For example, in order to understand the history of physics, we have to know the concept or problematic of physics in order to establish what an event in physics consists of. Of course a chronological narrative can be constructed, but the history of physics in fact has its own temporality in which the first event after Aristotle was Newton, the second was Einstein, the third black holes, etc. Now this specific temporality will have no homogeneous relation to, say, the history of literature. However, it can be articulated with other histories, indeed is articulated, according to the overall but decentred totality of the particular mode of production. Sometimes Althusser seems to imply that different histories may range through different modes of production, at other times it appears that they are specific to each, an effect of the overdetermination of the social formation. But in either case, unlike the Hegelian essential section, where each event can be shown to be in an essential articulation with the whole in a continuous and homogeneous spatio-temporality, a cross-section at any particular moment will show a heterogeneous array of presences and absences. Althusser elaborates his thesis that Marxism is not a historicism at some length, presenting a critique of the historicist and humanist traditions which he takes back from Sartre to the beginning of the century, even to the Russian Revolution itself, and in which he also includes the ‘absolute historicism’ of Gramsci and the Frankfurt School. Above all, he criticizes the ways in which Hegel reduces the diverse historical totality of a society to a single internal principle, so that history occurs only through the principle of contradiction in the dialectic. For Althusser, the apparently simple contradiction is always overdetermined: the inversion of Hegel's single principle to a dialectic generating successive modes of production  amounts to economism. This objection holds equally for Sartre's Hegelian historicism, the effect of which is to reduce the multiplicity of different practices to a single practice, ‘real ’ history’(136). Sartre's historicism shares the common tendency of all historicist interpretations of Marxism which transform ‘the Marxist totality into a variant of the Hegelian totality’: they all share the structure of the contemporaneity of a temporal presence and continuity which allows the possibility of an essential section. paradoxically therefore, Althusser argues, humanist Marxism shares the same basic theoretical principles with the orthodox economist Marxism of the Second International which politically it was its aim to oppose: for whether passive or active, fatalist or voluntarist, both reduce Marxist analysis to a single theoretical problematic. All that has happened is that the relations of production have been turned into historicized human relations. IV THE LONELY HOUR Althusser's procedure has been to show that, within a notion of history that seemed as if it could be invoked on its own as self-evident, there rests an entire presupposition about the conception of the social whole that is not derived from Marxist theory. The Marxist concept of historical time must instead, he argues, be thought through ‘on the basis of the Marxist conception of the social totality’(97). That Marxist conception is, of course, the Althusserian one: in Althusser's reading of Marx the unity of the whole is precisely not that of the Hegelian — and Sartrean — expressive totality; rather it is constituted through overdetermination, through: a certain type of complexity , the unity of a structured whole containing what can be called levels or instances which are distinct and ‘relatively autonomous’, and coexist within this complex structural unity, articulated with one another according to specific determinations, fixed in the last instance by the level or instance of the economy. (97) The Hegelian model of the coexistence of presence which allows the possibility of the ‘essential section’ is incompatible with this description, but Althusser continues to assume nevertheless that there is a totality and that it has ‘the structure of an organic hierarchised whole ’(98). This structure, made up of a succession of different levels or instances, is dominated by one form of production which forces the unity of any conjuncture, the non-economic structures determined ‘in the last instance’ by the economic (99). This last description is often misunderstood: the point is that the economic is never a simple causal function that operates alone: the economic dialectic is never active in the pure state ; in History, these instances, the superstructures, etc. — are never seen to step respectfully aside when their work is done or, when the Time comes, as his pure  phenomena, to scatter before His Majesty the Economy as he strides along the royal road of the Dialectic. From the first moment to the last, the lonely hour of the ‘last instance’ never comes. The significance of the allusion to Freud in this famous passage is to suggest that to conceive of the economic as operating in isolation is as illusory as to imagine that the ego can operate without the unconscious: they are both the reciprocal products of the other. The ‘last instance’, the economic, never operates in isolation separate from all the other instances of the social totality: it is the lonely hour that never comes. If one were to pursue the analogy with Freud rigorously, Althusser is even suggesting here that the primacy of the economic (ego) is a delusion, and that the superstructure (unconscious) is the more fundamental determining force, or at the very least that they are equally overdetermined. Whereas Sartre's totality was never totalized because it was always still in process and could never be closed, Althusser's totality is never totalizable because it is decentred and displaced in time. The different structured levels do not coexist in a temporal present which coincides with ‘the presence of the essence with its phenomena’. This means that the model of continuous and homogeneous time which Lévi-Strauss had also argued against cannot here be regarded as the time of history. This has nothing to do with turning diachrony into synchrony; the point is rather that it is no longer possible to think the process of the development of the different levels of the whole in the same historical time . Each of these different ‘levels’ does not have the same type of historical existence. On the contrary, we have to assign to each level a peculiar time , relatively autonomous and hence relatively independent, even in its dependence, of the ‘times’ of the other levels… Each of these peculiar histories is punctuated with peculiar rhythms and can only be known on condition that we have defined the concept of the specificity of its historical temporality and its punctuations (continuous development, revolutions, breaks, etc.). (99–100) These histories, their temporalities defined according to the specific concepts of particular domains, are not, however, independent of the whole: they are dependent on it, but in a structure derived from the ‘differential relations between the different levels within the whole…the mode and degree of independence of each time and history is therefore necessarily determined by the mode and degree of dependence of each level within the set of articulations of the whole’(100). So if there are different histories, they must nevertheless be related to those other histories from which they differ but with which they, articulate in a structure of relative effectivity. Such histories are constituted according to a Saussurian differential relation. Althusser therefore criticizes the Annales historians for merely arguing that  periodizations differ for different times, and that each time has its own rhythms. This is not enough, for it is also necessary to ‘think these differences in rhythm and punctuation in their foundation, in their type of articulation, displacement and torsion which harmonizes these different times with one another’— though it must be added that this begs the question of how such harmonization is achieved. For such times are not even necessarily the obvious ones, ‘the visible sequences of events recorded by the chronicler’, they may be invisible, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of…different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, only visible when their particular concepts are constructed and produced ‘out of the differential nature and differential articulation of their objects in the structure of the whole’(101–03). As an example of what he means, Althusser refers to Foucault's, remarkable studies',Madness and Civilization and The Birth of the Clinic , two instances in which the historian has had to construct the concept of their history. This is antipodal to the empirically visible history in which the time of all histories is the simple time of continuity and in which the ‘content’ is the vacuity of events that occur in it which one later tries to determine with dividing procedures in order to ‘periodise’that continuity. Instead of these categories, continuity and discontinuity, which summarize the banal mystery of all history, we are dealing with infinitely more complex categories specific to each type of history, categories in which new logics come into play. (103) This means that if one tries to take an ‘essential section’ there is no essence revealed which is the present of each level; indeed the break valid for one history would not necessarily correspond to that valid for any other which will live in a different time and in a different rhythm. The present of one level is, so to speak, the absence of another, and this co-existence of a ‘presence’ and absences is simply the effect of the structure of the whole in its articulated decentricity. (104) Any determinate mode of production, therefore, will evidence such a form of historical existence in its social formation: dislocated, uneven, absent and present. There is, Althusser stresses, no ‘single ideological base time, to which all these different temporalities can be related, no ordinary ‘single continuous reference time’ which they can be seen to dislocate (105). This differential account of history requires us to rethink a whole series of common notions such as unevenness of development, of survivals, backwardness, even, Althusser claims, the contemporary economic practice of under-development' — notions that provide the very basis of Western ethnocentrism. It also means that there can be no history in general, only specific structures of historicity. Nor is history an evolving totality; each mode of production is made up  of differentiated histories. These differentiated histories form a specific historical totality, for each history operates within the general totality of the mode of production. The economic therefore determines each history or level to the extent that its history is structured differentially against the totality which is defined as a specific mode of production. If for Hegel historical time is the reflection in time of the essence of the historical totality, for Althusser it is a function of the structure of the totality arising from a particular mode of production. No totality has a necessary transcendence embodied within it; as for the later Sartre, the course of historical change is open and will work only through the overdetermination of particular historical conjunctures. Althusser suggests that although Marxist history is defined as a theory of the modes of production, Marx did not give us any theory of how the transition was effected from one mode of production to another, nor of how each mode of production was constituted. Much of the effort of Althusserian Marxism was taken up with trying to produce such a theory, and it was the failure to produce it that perhaps was the main reason for its subsequent collapse. Althusser's influence declined in France after 1968, partly as a result of the role played by the PCF, of which Althusser was a member, in the events of May 1968, and partly as an effect of a number of critiques of his work, some of them by Althusser himself. In Britain by contrast Althusser's greatest impact occurred in the decade that followed: from the late sixties his work constituted something like a hegemonic ‘theory in dominance’. After 1978, however, the influence of Althusser declined rapidly after a series of books by two Marxist sociologists, Barry Hindess and Paul Hirst, who developed and extended the implications of those critiques already made in France. Their work made it impossible henceforth to invoke the work of Althusser in Britain without reference to the problems which they had articulated. With Hindess and Hirst criticism of Althusser's theory of history shifted to the problematic of the relation of the concept (increasingly assimilated to representation) to the real, thus reducing it to a question of epistemology. Where, though, does this leave the concept of history in Althusser? Does it have its own specificity aside from the problems of the subject, representation, narrative and interpretation, with which many have now shown that it is necessarily involved? Does this mean, as Hirst suggests, that the only concept of history must in fact still be the Hegelian one?: Teleology and spirituality are essential mechanisms of all philosophies of history. And, save for mindless antiquarianism or utter scepticism, there can be no history without a philosophy of history. It is in the philosophy of history that the past becomes a possible and rational object of knowledge. It is through the conception of historical time as a continuum that the past becomes a coherent object. For Hirst this means that there can be no Marxist ‘science of history’ that can be opposed to the essentialism and teleology of a philosophy of history. Althusser's mistake, according to Hirst, was to attempt to construct another philosophy of history; but any theory of history, he contends, cannot do without teleology, spirituality (the realization of the Idea), and the continuum. On the other hand, we would add that the lesson of Hegel's, Marx's, and Sartre's attempt also suggests that history cannot be coherently essentialist and teleological either. Hirst's straightforward characterization of Althusser's work as ‘a failure’ does not acknowledge the constant tension in the historical project itself. If Sartre's endeavour to ground the Marxist science of history suggests that the Hegelian totality and continuum can only work by a continual labour of excluding the partial and discontinuous, Althusser's effort to constitute a differentiated history shows that you cannot do it without a teleology. What both demonstrate is that any history as such has to think both, simultaneously. As long as history is assumed to operate according to the protocols of a conventional logic, where a contradiction simply means you cannot think it or do it as Hirst supposes, then it remains at the impasse he describes. Althusser's significant contribution was to problematize the concept of history by addressing its presuppositions about temporality — an area which Hindess and Hirst altogether neglect. In order to make their claim that his decentred totality is still expressive and therefore essentialist, they have to ignore the arguments about temporality in the critique of the Hegelian essential section as ‘the co-existence of presence’, and thus fail to do justice to the way in which Althusser constructs, as Foucault puts it, ‘a counter-memory — a transformation of history into a totally different form of time’. If the Althusserian mode of production is made up of differential times and histories, ‘a complex ‘intersection’ of the different times, rhythms, turnovers, etc.’, then each element cannot express the whole because the whole is only accessible as a concept, which is precisely not expressed at all. For the concept, ‘like every concept, is never immediately ‘given’, never legible in visible reality: like every concept this concept must be produced, constructed’— by the analyst. This formulation enabled Althusser to theorize a decentred totality which allowed the possibility of differences without reducing each instance to the operation of an essence or a single principle, such as the dialectic. If his notion of the mode of production as such a totality could not be sustained in a differential relation to other modes of production (notions of residual and emergent forms notwithstanding), Althusser nevertheless offered a particularly interesting theorization of the problems involved in the concept of the historical, articulating the paradoxical conditions of any theorization of history. If he showed it to be an impossible concept, he continued to demonstrate that it remains a necessary one, and acknowledged that we must learn to live with that impossibility. How does this take place? It is at this point that the subject of history re-enters; history may be a process without one, but the subject is nevertheless inscribed within history. Once again, as for Sartre, the subject operates at the pivot of the paradox. For the subject does not understand history according to its scientific formulation, but undergoes the process of inter-pellation at the level of ideology, and thus experiences it through the formulas of historicism. History, which can now no longer be considered a concept as such, is therefore made up of the incommensurable relation between these two disjunctive set-ups. It therefore operates for Althusser both at the level of science and of ideology, not in terms of truth to falsity, but as an irresolvable dialectic between the differential relations of the mode of production and the historicism of the ideological notion of history. Hence his argument that ‘the knowledge of history is no more historical than the knowledge of sugar is sweet’. What then is the relation of science to ideology, of Althusserian history to its ideological historicist formulation? The gap between them, according to Althusser, is mediated by art. This statement is often regarded as a curious relic of the values of bourgeois culture. But it is also possible to see it as an attempt to formulate the way in which the sliding incompatibility of the two can only be perceived through an ‘internal distantiation’ in which the problem of that ‘relation’is enacted by its relation , in the sense of the telling of a story — which is how we get history. If history is a process, Althusser remarks, ‘there is no such thing as a process except in relations [sous des rapports ]’. History is a matter of relations, and thus of writing reports. Althusser thus suggests that history can only be thought through as a permanent contradiction: it is a totality, but that totality is a decentred structure in dominance in which each history's history is defined not through its identity with, or difference from, a general history but by being differentiated from every other history, on which it is necessarily also therefore dependent, in a kind of negative totalization. Within the realm of ideology, on the other hand, history is experienced by subjects as a purposive continuum, with themselves as its subject. Another way of putting this would be to say that Althusser demonstrated that according to the protocols of conventional logic, history is impossible. If you try to think of it as a closed totality you get into the problems of historicism; if you try to think of it as entirely differentiated, then it becomes meaningless since there is no necessary connection, positive or negative, to anything else, nor would any one history produce any effect on another. Any differential theory of identity must think both totality and difference simultaneously. It is this structure which both Sartre's ‘singular universal, and Althusser's relative autonomy within a structure in dominance attempt to formulate, and in both cases the in-between of such simultaneity emerges as the process of writing itself. V ‘IF THERE IS HISTORY’: HISTORY, HERMENEUTICS AND HISTORICITY With Sartre and Althusser we encounter the two poles of post-war French return-to-Marxism. Although both could be said to be reacting against the ossification of Stalinism, the subjectivist and ultra-objectivist paths that they followed were antithetical. This schematic characterization, however, does not do justice either to the manner in which they attempted to keep both poles in play at once, nor to the way in which they came to concede the impossibility of the theoretical projects which they undertook. To dismiss them as failures on this account, however, would be merely reductive. Their real force can be discerned from the extent to which the problematics they set up have continued to exercise subsequent writers. Since Sartre and Althusser no one has attempted a new theorization of a Marxist history. We are not, therefore, now looking at another paradigm, another system. Rather than attempting to repeat and surpass the exalted projects of Sartre or Althusser in a new guise, later writers such as Foucault or Derrida learnt a lesson from history, and stopped to ask why such comprehensive theories, like so many of those which preceded them, could not hold together. For the grand narrative of History was always too big for its boots. Instead, therefore, of excluding history as has so often been claimed, such thinkers begin, in a rather more conventional way, from the anti-historicist perspectives of Althusser, even, arguably, of Sartre. The generic label ‘poststructuralist’ is here useful merely as a shorthand to designate those contemporary writers who share not a hostility to history as such but a distrust of simple historicisms. Lyotard, for example, is best known for his scepticism towards historicist universal narratives, advocating instead the possibility of a multiplicity of heterogeneous, conflicting and incommensurable histories. Foucault works from exactly the same tradition in the philosophy and history of science as Althusser: like him he utilizes Bachelard's concept of differentiated histories, which still stands as the major alternative, epistemic or otherwise, to historicism. If such a theorization of history, as diacritical and singular, articulated according to breaks and ruptures, was by no means new even with Althusser, it has been continued as a self-conscious derivation from him by Derrida. In Positions Derrida comments: Althusser's entire, and necessary, critique of the ‘Hegelian’ concept of history and of the notion of an expressive totality, etc., aims at showing that there is not one single history, a general history, but rather histories different in their type, rhythm, mode of inscription — intervallic, differentiated histories. I have always subscribed to this. Contrary to the claims of certain American commentators, Derrida's uncharacteristically emphatic endorsement here of Althusser's project  with regard to the possibility of ‘intervallic, differentiated’ histories, suggests the problems involved in invoking Althusser as an ‘answer’to Derrida; both are equally distrustful of any form of Hegelian historicism. This does not, however, mean that they then take up identical positions in relation to the problem of history. Derrida has not been concerned to formulate a new philosophy of history; nor has he attempted to specify new methodologies in the manner of Foucault. Describing himself as ‘very wary of the concept of history’, Derrida has rather attempted to shift the problem away from the conceptual analysis of history as an ‘Idea’ which, perhaps more than anything else, has proved to be Hegel's most enduring legacy, towards an analysis of the interstices in the implications of the general system in which it operates. In the first instance, therefore, he focuses not on history as such but on the related problem of hermeneutics and historical understanding: history here becomes a problem of meaning and interpretation —‘the age already in the past is in fact constituted in every respect as a text ’. This also involves an inquiry into the ways in which the critique of the sign affects historical representation, and the dependence of history on the genetic metaphor and on narrative. Important though these issues are, Derrida's major contribution has been his insistence that history is a metaphysical concept according to which the meaning of history always amounts to the history of meaning. As he himself puts it: From the first texts I published, I have attempted to systematize a deconstructive critique precisely against the authority of meaning, as the transcendental signified or as telos , in other words, history determined in the last analysis as the history of meaning, history in its logocentric, metaphysical, idealist…representation. The Derridean critique of logocentrism necessarily includes the concept of history insofar as it depends on notions of presence and meaning determined as truth. For all its frequent invocation as the ‘concrete’, history must by definition entail a problematic represencing of an absence; Derrida therefore argues that, even in its ‘materialist’ conceptualization, it cannot avoid a certain metaphysics. As early as the 1966 essay ‘Structure, Sign, and Play’, for example, he maintains that his analysis of the paradoxical metaphysics of ‘the centre’ is equally applicable to the historical notions of ‘origin' and ‘end’. History consists of a concept which has always been in complicity with a teleological and eschatological metaphysics, in other words, paradoxically, in complicity with that philosophy of presence to which it was believed history could be opposed. The thematic of historicity…has always been required by the determination of Being as presence… History has always been  conceived as the movement of a resumption of history, as a detour between two presences. Derrida's deconstruction of the notion of presence by the logics of the ‘always already’ and ‘originary repetition’inevitably conflict with a history constructed in terms of a teleological movement from an origin, which can always be reawakened, towards the self-realization of an idea ‘whose end may always be anticipated in the form of presence’. The meaning of such a history will always be determined through appeal to a transcendental signified, whereas a deconstructive analysis will demonstrate the simultaneous effects of the lack of such an authority. More radically still, Derrida works at the limits of any possible philosophy of history, arguing that it is not just that the problems of hermeneutics, specifically of interpretation and language, affect historical understanding, but that what in a broad sense he calls writing, or différance , determines history. At the very opening of Of Grammatology , for example, he sets out the thesis that writing constitutes the condition of emergence for all forms of historicity as such: Historicity itself is tied to the possibility of writing… Before being the object of a history — of a historical science — writing opens the field of history — of historical becoming. ‘Language as the origin of history’: on what basis does Derrida make the startling and radical claim that writing as transcendence constitutes the condition of all historicity? In order to try to elucidate this controversial argument, we can return to the well-known remark in the essay ‘Différance’: if the word ‘history’ did not carry with it the theme of a final repression of difference , we could say that differences alone could be ‘historical, through and through and from the start. Here we revert to the dialectic of the same and the other: as Derrida puts it, ‘that the same…is never the identical, means first that Being is history’. It is only through difference, by which the same becomes other and produces a tissue of differences, that history could ever take place: for if full presence were possible, then there would be no difference, and therefore no time, space — or history. Différance means precisely that you can never get out of— and therefore have no need to get back to — history. It also means that if difference in its sense of non-identity sets up the possibility of history, then difference in its sense of delay means also that it can never be finally concluded, for such deferral will always inhibit closure. It is in this sense that Derrida argues that Husserl's Origin of Geometry sets up ‘the possibility of history as the possibility of language’ whereby ‘difference would be transcendental’: writing, in the general significance which Derrida gives it of a differential marking, must be the condition of any historicity. ‘History as différance then means that history will itself always be subject to the operations of différance , and that différance names the form of its historicity. The same conditions hold for totalization. Derrida argues that though history is given the form of a totality by Hegel, his Aufhebung shows that in order to achieve that totality it must constantly transcend itself in a movement of excess. History is the history of the departures from totality, history as the very movement of transcendence, of the excess over the totality without which no totality would appear as such. History is not the totality transcended by eschatology, metaphysics, or speech. It is transcendence itself. History, in fact, works by exactly the same structure of supplementarity as Derrida charts in Of Grammatology . Here Rousseau himself demonstrates in his oscillating interpretations a history that cannot be linear, nor operate according to a single temporality, disturbing instead, the time of the line or the line of time’: We may perceive here the strange workings of the historical process according to Rousseau. It never varies: beginning with an origin or a centre that divides itself and leaves itself, an historical circle is described, which is degenerative in direction but progressive and compensatory in effect. On the circumference of that circle are new origins for new circles that accelerate the degeneration by annulling the compensatory effects of the preceding circle, and thereby also making its truth and beneficence appear. Such a history cannot be represented by the movement of a linear progression of unfolding time. Its ‘transcendence’ marks the way in which it can similarly never be limited to a finite totality, nor, conversely, to an infinity:. it exceeds itself. This process of supplementation, this ‘overabundance of the signifier’ that always goes beyond itself, is the result of a lack, or absence at the centre or origin, which must always be supplemented. Thus the argument that ‘history’ is what ‘poststructuralism’lacks, itself repeats totalization's own structure of supplementarity according to which history functions both as an excess and a lack in the origin. Insofar as it sets up such a process of necessary and constant supplementation, we could say that the impossibility of totalization produces a writing-effect whose process of perpetual deferral unremittingly provokes more writing. It is thus no longer a question of being able to produce a new concept of history, which, as Derrida puts it, ‘is difficult, if not impossible, to lift from its teleological or eschatological horizon . History cannot be done away with any more than metaphysics: but its conditions of impossibility are also necessarily its conditions of possibility. This means, as Rodolphe Gasché observes, that ‘the mimicry of totality and of the pretension to systematicity is an inseparable element of deconstruction, one of the very conditions of  finding its foothold within the logic being deconstructed’. Derrida himself, therefore, does not in any sense abjure history (or totality) but rather attempts to reinscribe it by writing histories that set up supplementary figures whose logic simultaneously invokes and works against historical totalities. From this perspective, even Sartre's Critique looks rather different from the way it appeared in the early sixties when read in the context of Lukács' History and Class Consciousness . Today it seems to evince a growing recognition that totalization cannot be achieved without a movement involving the transcendence of itself. In Sartre's terms, a totalization needs a totalizer. It must always involve an excess beyond the totality without which the totality could never be totalized, which must mean that it can never in fact be closed. Lyotard points to exactly the same structure in Marx, who could likewise never complete Capital . This endlessness of perpetual deferral, he argues, is later formalized in ‘a tragic political party…the negative dialectic of the Aufklärung ; it is the Frankfurt School, demythologized, Lutheran, nihilistic Marxism’. But instead of the perpetual threat of totalization, a spectre which the Frankfurt School anticipates endlessly, Derrida suggests rather that the problem in any structure is rather how it achieves closure. Even if this appears to have occurred, a deconstructive account will show how such a text had to dissimulate in order to cover over its own openings, or, to put it the other way round, it will show how history must always be organized by an attempted occlusion of its own conditions of historicity. This means that it is not necessary to reject totalization as such — because such a rejection assumes its very possibility, whereas all attempts at totalization such as Sartre's demonstrate rather its impossibility. Peter Dews has recently claimed that ‘post-structuralism can be understood as the point at which the ‘logic of disintegration’ penetrates into the thought which attempts to comprehend it, resulting in a dispersal into a plurality of inconsistent logics’. So poststructuralism is itself the ‘shattered mirror of the logic of disintegration. But poststructuralism precisely does not try to comprehend disintegration, for grasping heterogeneity together is exactly what all totalizing theories have unsuccessfully attempted to do. Having elaborated the paradoxical conditions of historicity, of any history or totalization, Derrida himself has been particularly concerned to analyse those such as Husserl, Heidegger or Levinas, who have been involved in investigations of time and temporality. Although it would be possible to pursue the question of history in terms of such analyses of the forms of historicity, such an enquiry would take us on a very different path from that prompted by our original question, namely if poststructuralism can apparently be faulted by reference to a history which it neglects, where in Marxism can this history be found? Since Sartre and Althusser there have been a number of possibilities: for some, the absolute historicism of the  Frankfurt School has become increasingly attractive, although in its current manifestation in the work of Habermas we might say that history has been eclipsed far more effectively than by any comparable French philosopher. If Althusser gave us history without a subject, Habermas gives us subjects without history. Otherwise there have been two possibilities which effectively continue the lines of descent from Hegelian historicism and the history of science. The most notable representative of the latter has been Michel Foucault, who has remorselessly continued the critique of totalizing forms of history and the disavowal of a general philosophy of history in favour of strategic ‘genealogical’ analyses. The alternative to this has amounted to a reaffirmation of historicism almost as if nothing had happened. This has been the course of Perry Anderson, who after his Althusserian moment has returned to espouse the virtues of empirical historical studies, under the general aegis of a historicism anchored in the recasting of orthodox historical materialism by G.A. Cohen. More influential in the realm of literary and cultural theory has been another overt defence of historicism — that of Fredric Jameson. It is to Foucault and to Jameson that we now turn."
ACA ACA-ECV-002 -1.62 "2 On Not Being Afraid of Natural Sex Differences Mary Midgley THE LURE OF THE UNIVERSAL The long-standing philosophical controversy into which this topic most obviously fits is the political one about equality. It concerns the degree to which human beings are standardised items. How far are we all essentially the same? My main point will be that this is not a simple, package-deal question. There are angles from which it is important to emphasise similarities, and others from which — for equally strong moral reasons — it is important to emphasise differences. In the last century or two, the similarities have had more emphasis from philosophers. This has happened partly for good political reasons because there was need to demand a more equal society. But it has also happened for formal reasons which are not good ones at all. There is a notion that philosophy ought only to deal with matters which are absolutely universal. Now it is true that all very wide questions have a philosophical aspect. Philosophy, therefore, often does deal with these questions. But this does not mean that it is fitted only to be used on matters at the extreme end of the spectrum of abstraction — that it can, for instance, discuss people only in so far as they are rational beings, or sets of behaviour-patterns, or immortal souls. Philosophy deals with conceptual difficulties, and these arise in the working out of quite detailed and specific ideas, as well as of wider ones. Indeed, since we actually live in particular contexts and often have difficulty in understanding them, many of our mistakes arise at that level, before more abstract speculation begins at all. The hasty flight to apparently universal rules often gives philosophical notions only a specious air of universality. It is notorious that ambitious ideas claiming to mirror the whole human condition have often turned out to describe  chiefly the condition of the group doing the theorising. When a different set of people takes up the questions, this becomes obvious. Of course, errors of this kind will always be made. We cannot jump off our own shadows. But after so many of these experiences, we ought to be becoming increasingly aware of the danger. Though we cannot look at things from all points of view at once, we can at least learn not to pretend that we are doing so. We speak with relative confidence about our own group. But to see what limitations this brings, we absolutely need to have a more lively sense of its differences from at least the groups which neighbour it. A gradient of dissimilarity leads away from each of us. Yet in spite of this, we all need to communicate and to get some general understanding of each other and of the world we live in. Total scepticism about this project is not an option for us. We therefore continually try to correct one philosophical perspective about it against another. Among these corrections, feminist ones have by now resoundingly made good their place. Earlier generations had already noticed the odd consequences which followed from Aristotle's having seen the human condition as unquestionably that of an Athenian gentleman, and Kant's having seen it as that of a Prussian bourgeois. But until lately very few people had managed to make themselves heard when they pointed out the dramatic effect of all previous philosophers having seen it as that of a man — that is, of course , not an exact reflection of what men are like, but an image of how they tend to see themselves when they contrast themselves with women. How much does this particular limitation matter? Till lately, respectable intellectual opinion has held that it hardly mattered at all. From the ancient hierarchical point of view (unchanged from Aristotle to Kant and beyond) it could not matter because women themselves did not really matter. They were in effect an inferior kind of man, with no distinctive character of their own. They thus shared in the human condition to the extent that inferior men did, and needed no special comment. On the other hand, those who abandoned the hierarchical position and held, not only that all men were equal but that all people were so, lost interest in sex differences for the opposite reason. For them, women were as good as men because they were no different from men. They were effectively men but no longer inferior ones. The move is that which Aristotle or Kant would have made if they had promoted all outsiders (such as women and non-European peoples) to the status of honorary Athenian or Prussian men. Now from certain points of view — mainly political ones — this is an admirable move. For the purpose of asking whether a given set of people may be enslaved, or deprived of their property, or denied access to the law courts, or the like, decency is best served by remembering that these are beings as conscious and valuable as ourselves, sharing our vulnerabilities and sensibilities. So we call them equal. But there is a whole range of other situations where the opposite move is needed, where we need to stress that people can differ from us, for instance over proposals to give all children the same kind of education or to make everybody live in the same kind of house. Notoriously, long and gruelling work is needed to make the notion of political equality fit both these kinds of demand. To date, feminism has contributed a good deal of fuel to both sides of this dialectic, because the case of women is a peculiar one, and introduces even more complications into an already troublesome argument. The main need, however, is to bring the two sides somehow together, since all of us at one time or another need help from both of them. I think feminists have not seen this need clearly enough. They have been too ready to use one or other of the clashing theses as occasion served, without troubling to bring them into intelligible relation. This has happened naturally enough, because it reflects the habits of those with whom they were disputing. Reformers attacking the subordinate status of women have naturally appealed to the idea of equality, because it was already recognised as a proper and powerful tool of reform. But in other situations — for instance in asserting a mother's special right not to be deprived of her children, or in offering characteristically female insights to correct a narrowly male view of life — they have equally naturally appealed to the idea of a distinct female nature. Quite sharp conflicts continually develop between these two approaches, and will continue to do so until their relation is thought out properly. Is all difference eventually to be abolished? Should the dialectic process ideally lead to a simple merging, so that the views of men and women on any matter will normally be indistinguishable? Or is the position more like that of the interaction between two separate cultures — or indeed two individuals — where each can indeed gain a great deal from the other, but will always retain its own distinct identity? AUTONOMY, SOLITUDE AND EGOISM An interesting and crucial example of this difficulty concerns the ‘social atomism’ typical of Enlightenment thinking. This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, than an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties. This unit can become bound to others only by his own free choice, and his choice is rational only in so far as he can safely expect it to serve his own interests. The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description. If ‘she’ is substituted, the ludicrous unreality of the picture at once becomes plain. The great Social-Contract theorists of the Enlightenment therefore explicitly excluded women from their systems. Each woman remained attached to some male contractor, according to the older organic and hierarchical pattern.’ The resulting brand of individualism thus contains a radical anomaly, affecting half of those present — an anomaly which, however, does not seem to have been visible until light was specially directed on to it by feminists. (This little bit of extra enlightenment is a key move in the creation of modern feminism.) There are two possible ways of curing the anomaly. One is to go the whole atomist hog and turn women too into full-time contracting egoists, no less exploitative and solitary than the males. Rousseau (1755), in his early accounts of the state of nature, attempted this heroic move, and he has recently been echoed from the feminist side by Shulamith Firestone in The Dialectic of Sex (1971). As a response to the brutal competitive individualism which is fashionable today, this proposal is understandable. If the rest of us cannot beat the gangsters, we may well be tempted to join them. But efforts to work out this atomistic society in detail are not very plausible. In particular, the situation of children both in Rousseau's world and in Shulamith Firestone's is a more or less impossible one. This is not just a matter of children's physical dependence; it concerns the emotional constitution of human beings generally. The asocial attitude which these pictures call for is not one normal to human beings of either sex. The only situation in which it tends to look so is the transient one of adolescents leaving home and protesting against their parents. Even Nietzsche expected his future Supermen to form a community. Why then has the atomistic image been so powerful? Why has it been extended so far beyond the large-scale political contexts where it was needed, to permeate  modern ideas about choice and freedom? Why, when we all know that loneliness is a paralysing form of human misery, do we go on as if we thought that the deepest need of rational individuals was to be independent of one another? Traditional thinking answered these questions by saying simply that such was the true nature of man. And it often explicitly contrasted that nature with that of woman. It is no accident that both the Greek and Latin words for ‘virtue’ originally meant ‘maleness’. Much morality, and thereby much metaphysics, has been distorted by serving a polemical purpose in a clash of ideals seen as dividing the two sexes. Theorists have constantly and explicitly used antitheses such as active/passive, reason/emotion, form/matter, mind body, autonomy/dependence as weapons in this supposed war, recommending their own ideals by directly claiming that the contrary ones were typical of women. The call to ‘be a man’ has regularly been seen as a self-explanatory moral exhortation. In this way, grossly oversimple notions about sex differences have affected philosophy far beyond the obvious context of egalitarian theory from which we started. False claims to universality have been used to cover a persistent warping in our notions of what it is to be an individual. Once we have seen it, can we get rid of this distortion quite easily? We can certainly make some progress towards doing so by peeling away the gender-drama from the conflicts of ideals in which it has often figured, and trying to see those conflicts in sex-neutral terms. Freedom, we now notice, is not always a higher ideal than those with which it competes, nor is rationality necessarily just a matter of self-interest. Certain social bonds are essential for the highest activities that we are capable of, so that the antithesis ‘bond or free’ was always a tendentious one. And so on. Can we then go on from there to a new unbiased universality? Have we reached down to the true bedrock of human life, at which sex differences are revealed as artificial and insignificant, so that we no longer need a tribal division? On this point, feminist thinking is — as I have mentioned — highly ambivalent. The egalitarian strand of it says yes, and dismisses all suggestions of genuine, irreducible sex differences as ‘sexist’. Another and at least equally powerful strand says no, because it wants to emphasise the distinctive value of women's insights, and also the special bond of sisterhood which is seen as binding women together, rather than letting them be absorbed and assimilated into  he wider human group. For both these purposes, it is inconvenient to regard the existing distinctive qualities of women — whatever these may be — as simply deformations produced by oppression, which could be expected to evaporate when that artificial pressure is removed. Those who stress sisterhood rather than equality value a great deal in women's distinctive approach as it now is (and has been in societies much less egalitarian than ours) and do not want it lost in the melting-pot of assimilation. Deeper thinking can no doubt resolve this clash. But until it does, constant confusion arises from trying to combine the two approaches. This (again) is not just a problem for feminism. It indicates much wider unfinished business in our long task of digesting Enlightenment ideas — of working out the proper relations between such large concepts as nature, freedom, equality, justice, individuality and the human affections. By ceasing to ignore the awkward case of women — as most of the traditional theorists did we can often see what has gone wrong with our thinking in other, apparently more straightforward cases. THE USELESSNESS OF STANDARDISING One point which should help us to start here is already familiar from existing discussions of equality. Political equality does not call for standardisation. Political equals do not have to be indistinguishable in any respect. They do not even have to be alike at all beyond some minimum range of conditions which puts them into the same political category. This range varies for different purposes, but the aim is always to make it as wide as possible. Thus, for basic civic rights like not being enslaved or imprisoned without trial, people should need only to be people. For slightly more demanding purposes like voting or serving on juries, they need also some minimum level of maturity and sanity, because here their actions affect the interests of others, so they need to understand what they are doing. For more demanding purposes still more is required, and it is often hard to decide just where to fix the borderline. But what the ideal of equality never demands is likeness in any respect above this minimum. In spite of its quantitative sound, political equality never means having an equal amount of any chosen characteristic. It does indeed enshrine a quantitative metaphor, because it exists to counter an older picture which used one. This was the archaic  picture of a king ten times as large as a noble, a noble ten times as large as a merchant — and so on down to the almost imperceptible peasant woman. Against this notion, the reformers contended that, in Bentham's words, ‘each should count for one and nobody for more than one’. But there does not seem to be any useful way of developing this idea by seeing people as containing equal quantities of any special substance, or equal degrees of any property. Imaginatively, however, negative moves of this kind have to be completed by devising new pictures to replace the old ones. To replace hierarchal pictures, the Enlightenment used many such images, and they often did tend to suggest some deeper kind of standardisation as the basis of equality. Thus when Burns wrote: The rank is but the guinea stamp, The man's the gold for a' that he vigorously used an ancient notion of personal worth as resting in an original standard substance, and variation as introduced by society. How ancient this thought is we can see by noticing that it is just the figure Plato used in The Republic to supply his political myth justifying political inequality (Bk. III, 414–15). The hereditary caste of Guardians must (Plato says) be believed to be originally golden while the other castes are of various baser metals, and the various metals ought not to be mixed together. Therefore — except for an occasional mutated child which turns out to be plainly of the wrong metal for its caste — ranks must remain separate. Burns triumphantly hijacks this image by extending the golden substance to the borders of manhood —‘a man's a man for a’ that', so that one could properly ask for ‘one man, one vote’. Women, however, were still perceived as being made of a different metal and, in spite of Mill, their voting remained an absurd and scandalous project for many decades after ‘manhood suffrage’ became a reality. And indeed the otherwise democratic Swiss are still of Burns's mind in this matter; their women do not vote. People who are denied political privileges like this on the ground that they are not standard items naturally tend to reply that the charge is false — to claim that they are actually just as standard as everybody else. When political conflicts rage, it is far harder to take on the awkward task of asking why this particular standard was set up in the first place. In class warfare, for instance, oppressed people easily find themselves claiming to be just as noble or gentlemanly as  their supposed betters, without properly criticising existing ideas of nobility or gentility. (Burns avoided this move, which is what gives his protest its particular dignity. ) Aspiring castes can easily be led in this way to inherit actual faults from their predecessors. More subtly and widely, they can be led to waste effort in imitating traits which had a point in the situations which gave rise to them, but become empty and even harmful when transplanted. The Victorian middle class seems to have become entangled in a good deal of bad faith of this kind by its attempts to imitate an aristocratic life which it did not fully understand. The pursuit of standardisation — the failure to value a difference — here goes beyond a mere passing mistake and becomes actively pernicious. There will be similar trouble over the gender difference if indeed as I am suggesting — it is true that ideas about the meaning of maleness have distorted moral thinking in our culture quite deeply, so as to affect the whole concept of individuality, and thereby condition the way in which some central metaphysical issues are seen. (If this is right at all, it is, of course , right to some extent for other cultures too, but that must be left aside for now.) If, therefore, women want to storm the citadel and share its existing treasures, they have to decide what to do about these autonomy-centred ways of thinking. Are they satisfactory, genuinely universal conceptual systems, which everybody in the new, gender-free intellectual cosmos can use with perfect comfort? Or are they biased, faulty and badly in need of revision? The first option is Shulamith Firestone's. It is, I think, the logical conclusion of the line in Enlightenment thought which has run from Rousseau through Nietzsche and Sartre — the strand of truly anarchic individualist thinking which avoids the vulgar Nozickian ‘libertarian’ path of concentrating on the freedom of certain selected institutions such as commercial companies, and genuinely exalts only the freedom of the individual. Anyone who finds that this entire detachment from personal ties really is their highest ideal will be happy with this kind of utopia. Shulamith Firestone undoubtedly did everyone a great service by vigorously extending this notion to women, and pointing out the absurdity of men's viewing themselves as totally detached individuals in relation to the rest of society, while still expecting to go home to a wife who would always have their dinner hot for them in the evening. But once this absurdity is made clear, many of us today will probably find that extreme individualism, when thus exposed in its full aridity, is not a  heritage that we want to claim. And that leaves us with the second alternative. We have to do the more general piece of work involved in clearing one more bias from our morality. We have to look at the range of ideals which are somehow clustered together to guide us, arrayed as they are in some sort of a rough priority system, and take out of its slot the unquestioned ideal ‘be a man’. We must examine it to see what sense it can yield us in the case of those who, as it happens, are not men in the first place, and in what way, once this is done, it will have changed its meaning for those who, by no special fault or merit of their own, actually are so. DIFFERENCE IS NOT INFERIORITY As the title of this paper shows, I am sure that we cannot hope to do this rethinking while still clinging to the currently orthodox view that there are no natural, genetically determined sex differences. This orthodox view does not really rest on factual evidence, though such evidence is sometimes brought in to back it. (There is no hypothesis which cannot find some facts to support it.) It is held because people believe the acceptance of natural sex differences to be dangerous. The danger has been a real one, but it has flowed entirely from distorted views about what the differences are, not from acceptance of difference as such. Different does not mean worse or better, it means different. And in fact the greater the difference is, the less easy does it become to dismiss one of the differing parties as a mere inadequate version of the other. This is clearly enough seen in the case of differing individuals, and also in that of differing cultures. And the case of the sexes is on the same footing. The main reason why difference is harmless has already been mentioned. Equality does not mean standardisation. One can be ‘as good as’ somebody else in all kinds of ways while still being very different from them. This may sound obvious, but it is extremely hard to remember. Life is constantly astonishing us by confronting us with new kinds of character, and thereby with different kinds of goodness. Thus Anne Elliott in Persuasion,astonished at her friend Mrs Smith's cheerful acceptance of misfortune and hardship, watched — observed — reflected and finally determined that this was not a case of fortitude and resignation only. — A submissive  spirit might be patient, a strong understanding would supply resolution, but here was something more; here was that elasticity of mind, that disposition to be comforted, that power of turning readily from evil to good, and of finding employment which carried her out of herself, which was from Nature alone. It was the choicest gift of Heaven. (Persuasion vol. 2, ch. 5) Failure to be ready for this kind of thing is the main cause of our dismissing whole squadrons of our fellow-creatures as uninteresting or inferior. This was Aristotle's mistake over women. Judging them by the standard which he used for men, in a society where their roles were totally different, he naturally did not think much of them. So far, what I say may not sound too shocking. Moral pluralism, the notion that there are different kinds of goodness, is quite acceptable to modern thought. What worries people is the idea that these differences, however valuable, are in any way naturally determined and therefore out of the control of the individual. In the case of personal differences, how much does that matter? It is true that I cannot become you, you cannot become me and Blake could not be Beethoven. But this is not an infringement of our freedom. As theologians have noticed, it is not clear that even God could become somebody other than himself. The power to become absolutely anybody goes beyond any normal notion of omnipotence; why should it be a necessary part of freedom? The idea of freedom which lies behind this kind of demand is confused in the same way as the idea of equality which calls for standardisation. Both universalise prematurely, hardening and expanding one aspect of the moral situation to cover ground that goes far beyond its relevance. Does this point lose its edge if we think of the differences as socially rather than naturally produced? This too is a strange idea. Of course, it is true that much of the individuality which people show has been the result of their upbringing. Nobody who brings forward biological causes supposes that they replace social causes. They merely supplement them, as the original qualities of food supplement the effects of cooking in accounting for the properties of the finished dish. But this fact cannot save the inflated concept of freedom just mentioned, because people's upbringing is normally just as far out of their control as their genetic constitution is. What is called ‘biological determinism’ is not more of an attack on freedom than the social determinism (or economic determinism) which is  accepted without moral qualms throughout the social sciences. What is injurious is not determinism but fatalism — that is, the pretence that bad things which are in fact within our control lie outside it and are incurable. On any view of causes, a great deal in the life of each of us is completely out of our power, and our freedom must consist in the way we handle that small but crucial area which does actually come before us for choice. This situation is far more benign than people obsessed with freedom make it sound, because what comes to us by no choice of our own is a gift — a whole world which we could not possibly have made and at which, in spite of all its horrors, we can on the whole only bow our heads in wonder. Moralists able only to think of autonomy, of the active imposition of the will on what is round us, miss the essential values of receptivity, of contemplation, of openness to the splendours of what is not oneself. Our inheritance, both social and natural, is not a shocking intrusion on our privacy and freedom, but a realm for us to live in. Morally speaking, one of the worst aspects of the autonomy-centred Enlightenment attitude has been to denigrate the receptive virtues, to make us so obsessed with giving that we do not know how to receive. As usual, one of these aspects of life does not make much sense without the other. About individual differences, much of what I am saying here may not sound too bad, but many people will want to treat sex differences quite otherwise. Here, the history of the various disputes has been important. Modern educational theory has strongly promoted the idea that individual differences are intrinsic and must not be ironed out. We have been told for several centuries now that every child is naturally different and it is therefore wrong to impose on one the mould which has been prepared for others unlike it. This important thought has been constantly at odds with the equally influential notion that we are all blank paper at birth, ready to be entirely formed by our society. This last wild exaggeration has also been popular with educators at times when they wanted to stress the importance of their task and the need to get it right. But the quite opposed notion of innate individuality has also maintained its strength, no doubt because there is so much in the experience of anybody who actually works with children to support it. If the little creatures were really blank paper at birth, nobody would ever have the slightest difficulty in writing on them whatever their particular culture required, and it would be  impossible for them ever to surprise their elders by unexpected conduct. This is so far from the truth that on the whole, for those really attending to education, the notion of innate given individuality has remained the stronger. Sex differences, however, have been put into a different box. By bad luck, the question of women's emancipation has been most often seen as parallel to that of non-European races. And race difference is, among all the differences which have been used to justify oppression, probably the most trivial. Where it does not coincide with cultural frontiers, it is insignificant. In this case, therefore, Burns's idea of treating differences of status built on it as idle and artificial is just as appropriate as it is in the case of class. It cannot follow, however, that this is true of all other differences. Burns's image of the gold is, we should notice, bound to the Blank Paper theory of human difference. Gold can be made into all sorts of other things besides guineas. Is the gingerbread which is currently stamped into men equally capable of being stamped into standard unisex persons? If we are tempted to assume so, it may be worth while looking at yet another parallel to balance the highly peculiar one of race. How about age? This certainly has a biological basis as well as a social one. The physiological states of growing organisms including human beings — vary greatly from one stage to another. Typical behaviour patterns also change. Play, sleep, sexual behaviour and other proceedings are differently distributed typically — at different ages, in a way that broadly holds across cultural barriers. What reason would there be to deny the obvious causal connections with changing physique? ‘Ageism’ is objectionable, not because it means admitting these connections, but because it means treating old people — or children — badly. There is nothing fishy about simply admitting the reality of the difference, or that of the physical causes which — alongside cultural ones — help to produce it. To insist on denying the reality of such causes is to draw a bizarrely hard line between the physical and the mental aspects of a human being — a line which does seem sometimes to be drawn in the social sciences, and may prove handy in academic feuds between them and biology, but which seems very badly suited to the realistic description of our lives. I have carefully said nothing here about the details of particular natural sex differences. The general point about the innocuousness of natural difference as such needs to be grasped on its own. Once seen, it gives us back a legitimate access to a great wealth of  traditional human experience on the matter, which must of course be critically used, but which certainly does not leave us utterly puzzled, as we might be in starting to observe a strange species. Feminists have already made good use of this tradition. I think, however, that their use of it is still often confused and inhibited by mistaken ideas about what equality demands, and that the senseless ideal of standardisation still produces a waste of effort on this topic, as on many others. This is the sort of muddle which often causes good ideas to run out into the sand. I particularly do not want this to happen to feminism; hence my choice of subject for this essay."
ACA ACA-ECV-003 -10.04 "3 Women's Right: Reflections on Ethics and Gender Brenda Almond There is a view that is as old, probably, as the human race, and certainly as old as Homer and the ancient Greeks, that there is one ethical structure that represents right for men: a composite of manly virtues, such as courage, endurance, physical stamina, wiliness and political judgement, and a corresponding but complementary conception of what is right for women, womanly virtue being seen as a mixture of timidity, tenderness, compliance, docility, softness, innocence and domestic competence. Views about the exact composition of virtue, male and female, have changed over time, and they may vary, too, with differing social and geographical contexts, but the underlying theme is constant: the theme, that is, of difference. It is recognisable even when it appears in feminist dress, as it does, for example, in these remarks of Hester Eisenstein (1984): ‘I argue that feminist theory has moved from an emphasis on the elimination of gender difference to a celebration of that difference as a source of moral values. A woman-centered analysis presupposes the centrality, normality, and value of women's experience and women's culture’(p. xviii). Clearly, a distinctively feminist conception of women's moral values will differ significantly from traditional stereotypes. But it is worth asking, nevertheless, whether the old and the new might not be rooted in the same set of facts. Any discussion of ethics and gender, then, must involve some reference to facts. But the primary question is not one about facts at all. It is about moral ideals. Should we — women and men — be aiming at a common ethical conception, a shared moral perspective? Or should we — women alone — be working to rewrite the map of morality to promote a separate moral perspective? Must we, in other words, accept an ultimate sexual apartheid as far as ethical values are concerned? The larger question, then, is not about what is, but about what  ought to be. But since answering this question involves reference to some matters of fact, it is necessary to say something about those facts. Essentially, they are of two kinds. First, there are facts about what different people's moral ideals actually are. Here it is important to know (a) whether male and female ideals diverge: whether, that is, the moral outlook people have depends in some causally related way on whether they are male or female, and (b) whether the ideals themselves are gender-relative: that is to say , whether what is good in a woman or right for a woman might not be bad in a man, or wrong for a man, and vice versa . Secondly, there are facts about the lives of men and women and the systematic ways in which their lives differ, which it would be unwise to overlook. A systematic difference in the life-experience of women and men can have ethical implications both in generating a different moral ideal making women think differently about morality from the way men think about it — and also in justifying a different moral ideal justifying, that is, a genuinely alternative moral perspective. These last points may seem to imply a flagrant disregard of the well-known difficulty, first pointed out by the philosopher David Hume in the Treatise of Human Nature (1739), of reasoning from ‘is’ to ‘ought’(Selby-Bigge ed., 1952, pp. 469–70). But no transgression against Hume's stricture is involved in pointing out that people's views about what ought to be — their moral stance and outlook — may be directly related to certain distinctive features of their lives. And no transgression, either, is involved in accepting that moral views and ideals must take account of, and be responsive to, facts. Ideals are not formed in an aseptic vacuum, but in the chemical brew of interacting personal lives and events. So let me begin by making some impressionistic guesses about the views women do in fact currently hold on morality. I can do this best by way of a personal anecdote, which might be called the Incident of the Taxman and the Philosopher. Discussing the case of a headmaster who had reported his pupils to the police for criminal behaviour, the Philosopher, who was female, expressed the opinion that, since the headmaster is in loco parentis , he should have tried to avoid resort to law; he should have dealt with his pupils himself, privately and without publicity — as would, she suggested, a loving parent. The Taxman expressed moral outrage at such a suggestion, declared that this was not his conception of the implications of being in loco parentis , and said that he, as a parent and husband, would have no hesitation in reporting  the criminal actions of his child or indeed his wife, particularly if he saw no sign of either remorse or an intention to reform. He added that apprentice-Taxmen are coached in the matter of the known duplicity of women and their willingness to lie to protect members of their family. At this point, the Taxman's wife expressed moral outrage at the discovery that her husband would, without compunction, report her misdeeds, or those of her daughter, to the authorities, and the Philosopher was left with a sense of having stumbled upon a set of basic moral presumptions which are held in common by one sex, and entirely inverted in the case of the other — a looking-glass reversal of priorities and values. As it happens, of course, this conclusion conforms to the observations of Freud, who believed that women had less sense of justice than men and are more often influenced in their judgements by feelings of affection or hostility. It conforms, too, to some more recent observations of Piaget, Kohlberg and Gilligan. Lawrence Kohlberg's empirical work on moral development follows, as far as its basic stance is concerned, the structure and assumptions of Jean Piaget, who has demonstrated apparently invariant sequences of change, not only in relation to moral development, but in other areas, too. The underlying assumption is that there is a necessary maturation of cognitive processes, just as there is of physical and motor processes. Just as every normal human child first learns to crawl, then to stand and then to walk and the motivation and capacity to do these things comes from within the child, and is not artificially imposed from outside — so, the moral development theorists hold, there is a necessary sequence of stages of emerging moral judgement. Their empirical research is directed to establishing what these stages are, and to describing the circumstances surrounding the transitions. Kohlberg's stages of moral development are usually described as a progression from lower to higher — itself an inbuilt and at first unrecognised value-judgement. The early or lower stages that he has identified are first, a stage in which children's thinking is rooted in obedience to adults, fear of punishment and acceptance of authority; then a stage of an essentially self-interested acceptance, for the sake of reciprocity, of a principle of fairness between peers; and then a further stage of seeking approval and desiring to be well thought of by one's community or group. Later comes a stage of respect for justice: recognition of the importance of rules for community living, followed by an awareness  of the universality of some of these rules and their embodiment in principles of individual human rights applying across varying cultures and societies. Kohlberg has speculated on the existence of a seventh stage in which the universal human perspective is replaced by a holistic cosmic perspective which might have a religious or even a pantheistic orientation. All this is framed in gender-neutral terms, but researchers have become aware of difficulties in finding women who can be placed by this classification in the ‘higher stages’ of moral development. Women's answers to the questionnaires by which assignments to ‘stages’ are made show them to be more heavily represented in the early stages of development rather than the later. Women desire to please. Women rebel against impersonal principles of morality which, when rigorously applied, ignore individual pleas for sympathetic concessions, for mercy rather than justice. Carol Gilligan's research, which focused on the distinctively female moral dilemma of an abortion-decision, suggested that what was emerging here was not a moral deficiency of women but a ‘different voice’ on morality. The findings of the male researchers, she claims, are dogged by what she calls the problem of women ‘whose sexuality remains more diffuse, whose perception of self is so much more tenaciously embedded in relationships with others and whose moral dilemmas hold them in a mode of judgment that is insistently contextual’. While she concedes the broad outline of the developmental model — a model which proceeds from an egocentric through a societal to a universal perspective — she sees this development as taking place, in the case of women, within a special moral conception. The nature of this moral conception is recognised by a distinctive use of a particular vocabulary: a vocabulary of selfishness and responsibility; or morality as an obligation to exercise care and avoid hurt. The particular sequence of moral development revealed by Gilligan's research is described by her in this way: first, as in Kohlberg's findings, a stage of focus on the self; then, a second level of development in which the notion of responsibility is used to balance the claims of self against the claims of other people; this stage brings a notion of the good as caring for others; it involves a protective care for the dependent and unequal. It is succeeded by a third stage at which the tension between conformity and care, selfishness and responsibility, is dissipated by a self which, in Gilligan's words ‘becomes the arbiter of an independent judgment  that now subsumes both conventions and individual needs under the moral principle of non-violence’(Gilligan, 1977, p. 492). Gilligan sees this as a morality of responsibility that stands apart from the morality of rights underlying Kohlberg's conception. In it, a positive conception of caring contrasts with the purely negative policy of non-interference suggested by an emphasis on rights. What is missing from the latter, and its omission is deliberate rather than accidental, is the detail and texture that comes with knowledge of particular people and particular circumstances. Kohlberg's research is based on questionnaires which demand a response to hypothetical and imaginary situations in which concrete detail is necessarily omitted. Gilligan points out that Kohlberg thus divests his moral actors of the history and psychology of their individual lives. Many women, confronted by Kohlbergian questionnaires, ask for, or contribute out of their own imagination, concrete detail which might help them resolve the moral dilemma with which they are presented. They are told that this sort of question or embellishment is inappropriate. Kohlberg's dilemmas are not about real people — they can't be if the aim of the research is to discover objective principles of justice. Gilligan mentions here the anonymous woman whose nonlegalistic thinking enabled Solomon to display his legendary wisdom. She contrasts that woman's sacrifice of self and principle for the life of her child with the willingness of Abraham to sacrifice his son for principle and personal integrity. What both of these examples demonstrate is the concreteness and particularity of real life situations. It is interesting to compare Gilligan's criticisms of Kohlberg on this point with Robert Nozick's parallel and equally cogent criticisms of Rawls. John Rawls, in A Theory of Justice,seeks to arrive at abstract principles of justice by means of a device which strips the procedure of arriving at principles bare of all reference to the particular and concrete. His principles are chosen by people behind a hypothetical ‘veil of ignorance’, where they know nothing of their social position in society, their sex, race, abilities or conceptions of the good (Rawls, 1972, in particular pt. I, ch. 3). Nozick points out that the very nature of Rawls's thought-experiments guarantees the type of principles that will be chosen: that they will be impersonal and grounded in future-oriented principles of distribution, rather than being personal and grounded in current or past circumstances (Nozick, 1974, in particular pt. II, ch. 7). To accept Nozick's criticism  is not to judge in favour of Nozick's conception of justice against Rawls, any more than acceptance of Gilligan's argument involves rejection of Kohlberg's abstract principles of justice. It is simply to recognise that the structure of the ‘proof’ in both cases, in Rawls's case an a priori proof, in Kohlberg's case an experimental one, actually presupposes what it sets out to establish. The outcome is guaranteed before the procedure, whether logical or empirical, is embarked upon. But Gilligan does not, in fact, reject the notion of a rights-based morality. Instead, she argues that the feminine strand should contribute to an enlarged and revised universal conception of morality, in which the ideals of compassion and care are added to the more impersonal ideals of autonomous judgement and action. She believes, then, that a morality of rights can be integrated with a morality of responsibilities — that the two conceptions are essentially complementary. This coincides with the views of some other feminist writers who have been impressed by this distinctively ‘female’ contribution to morality. Hester Eisenstein, for example, looks forward to women transforming the world in the image of what she calls ‘the woman-centered values at the core of feminism’. This means, she believes, associating feminism with the liberating traditions of Western thought, from Locke and Rousseau to Marx and Engels, tending in the direction of greater equality, shared decision-making and justice. But it means, too, transforming these traditions, by imbuing them with the woman-centered values of nurturance and intimacy, as necessary and legitimate goals of political life. (Eisenstein, 1984, pp. 144 5) Reflecting on the same contrast, Carol McMillan refers to Hegel's view of the family as an inferior organisation to the state because it is based on love. She points out that much of a woman's life is based on a spontaneity of moral response that many philosophers, in particular Hegel and Kant, would say had no moral worth (McMillan, 1982). The idea that acts of love are inferior to principled acts is a deep-rooted philosophical tradition. This area of love, care and spontaneous response which ignores, or deliberately flouts, principle and convention is one, then, where an initial impressionistic guess about male and female differences can be given an impressive weight of support. There is a second  impressionist guess, however, which it is harder to document. This is the extent to which women's moral perceptions are tied to the aesthetic. The link between awareness of beauty and recognition of the moral good was a fundamental aspect of Plato's ethical theory, but few writers since Plato have tied awareness of beauty in nature so closely to a deeper notion of the good. However, it is a striking observation that women's moral sensibilities are, more often than men's, triggered by an awareness which is essentially aesthetic. The following account is given by Helen Weinreich-Haste of a response to a question designed, not to explore this point, but simply to discover more about significant changing points in people's lives: I was driving on my way through beautiful scenery in Wales where I live and it suddenly occurred to me how this would all be altered in a nuclear war. And it just stopped me dead in my tracks. I couldn't keep driving. I had to stop and I felt really physically very unwell. And I was crying. I sat for about three quarters of an hour before I could continue the journey. (quoted in Weinreich-Haste, 1987) The woman who gave this account thereafter changed her established way of life to become an activist in the Greenham Common protest against the siting there of cruise missiles. To cite a personal response of a comparable nature, I find in myself an apparently irrational extra revulsion at the occurrence of bombings or murders that take place in beautiful places on beautiful days. It would be absurd to approve of such events taking place on grey, sunless days in dark, depressing places. Nevertheless, there is a sense of incongruity and inappropriateness about an ugly act which involves the destruction of what was, in some wider and more general sense, previously beautiful. But this, even more than the previous example, is not, of course, an attitude confined to women. It must be something of the sentiment that inspired the war poets, enduring indescribable ugliness — the mutilation and destruction of people and places amongst the fragile flowers that nature silently but abundantly proffered in the stench, decay and squalor of the trenches. The sentiment was expressed many times over, but it is succinctly put in the following lines by R. E. Vernede, who was killed in action in 1917: The sun's a red ball in the oak And all the grass is grey with dew, A while ago a blackbird spoke He didn't know the world's askew… Strange that this bird sits there and sings While we must only sit and plan Who are so much the higher things — The murder of our fellow man… Or, as Edmund Blunden put it: Bold great daisies' golden lights, Bubbling roses' pinks and whites — Such a gay carpet! poppies by the million; Such damask! such vermilion! But if you ask me, mate, the choice of colour Is scarcely right; this red should have been duller. The early war poems had promoted patriotism, justice and principle. It is striking that there was this shift from principle to aesthetic response as the war progressed. It might be that it was the incessant closeness to blood, death and suffering that brought out these sentiments in men who had, on the whole, been raised in an education system that rejected such responses as feminine and unmasculine, and that promoted an abstract conception of justice and a stern morality of obedience to rules. If so, it could be that the impact of that experience parallels in a sharpened and intensified form the impact on women of the experience of child-bearing — a potent, personal experience that, however sanitised, brings a woman face-to-face with these three realities. Again, as in the previous case, if this aesthetic response is accepted as especially characteristic of women's moral awareness, it can be argued that it is an important element to incorporate in any full account of the moral. It should be encompassed within, rather than competing against, any universal conception of morality. These are, then, two ways in which women may, and probably do, see morality in a different light from the way men typically see it. This means that the first set of questions about facts mentioned at the outset can now be answered. Male and female do appear to diverge in certain identifiable and significant ways. The moral  outlook a person has may — though this is, of course, only a statistical or average truth — depend on whether that person is male or female. But these ideals are not necessarily gender-relative. And indeed, it is the potential complementarity of the views that is their most striking feature. But before turning to the central question of what ideals men and women should adopt, it is worth speculating a little about what it is that causes these observable differences of moral outlook. Answering this question involves reference to the second group of facts which were mentioned at the beginning of this discussion facts about the systematic differences in the life-experience of women and men. Two main types of explanation are offered as accounting in these terms for the distinctive ways in which women and men approach moral questions: these are, first, predominantly biological explanations, and, second, predominantly social or cultural explanations. Differences, it is assumed, must either be biologically based, or they must be culturally induced, the result of education, upbringing and social pressure. One important aspect of attributing differences to biology as opposed to attributing them to culture is that the second type of explanation leaves room for views to change, while the former appears to rule this out. This contrast may be more apparent than real, however, for new technologies of birth and reproduction may alter the biologically given so as to make possible a changed perspective that would have been inconceivable in the past. Anti-patriarchal utopias in which male power, if not man himself, has been eliminated, and in which women have created a new social structure, are convincingly depicted in feminist science-fiction, and advocated as social policy by some radical feminist writers (see, for example Firestone, 1971). Both biological and cultural explanations, however, have sceptical implications as far as morality is concerned. If moral scepticism is to be avoided, then, it is important to appreciate both the scope and the limits of these sorts of explanation. The Biological Thesis This, which may also be called the socio-biological or ‘geneticist’ thesis, asserts that innate biological factors determine a person's morality. Thus, in the case of the sexes, it sees different moral qualities as part of male or female ‘nature’— qualities and contrasts  such as aggressiveness or docility; kindness or cruelty; selfishness or unselfishness; conscientiousness or carelessness. The thesis is essentially deterministic: we cannot escape from what our genes make of us. And so it considerably curtails the scope for morality, for it leads to such questions as: Why, if it is genetic factors that make people what they are, praise or blame them for what they do? Why not simply accept the way they — men and women — behave? The Sociological Thesis This is the thesis that it is social or cultural factors that determine a person's moral view-factors such as environment, upbringing and social context. Coupled with this factual thesis is the full-blooded relativist view that there are only these different views; that to talk about morality is to make reference to them; and that there is no fact-of-the-matter; no independent concept of right and wrong; of good and bad; of duty or responsibility. Within this second type of explanation, two very different theses may be distinguished: (i) the view that dominating differences are related to non-gender-related contrasts: for example, social class, economic structure, and a broad range of cultural factors. (ii) the view that the salient and overriding cultural phenomenon is gender. This view, then, may be distinguished from the ‘orthodox’ sociological view for separate consideration: it is the patriarchy thesis. The Patriarchy Thesis This is the thesis that women's morality, which in certain vital respects, particularly in relation to sexual behaviour, often differs from men's, has been imposed on them by centuries of conditioning by men. It differs from the standard sociological thesis in that it regards the gender difference as the most fundamental and most fully explanatory division in human society. It holds that across all cultures and forms of social arrangement women have been kept in subservience to men. In so far as there is this domination, it must be acknowledged that men have been aided in their domination of women by women themselves — sometimes older women, whose own conditioning has  matured in conformity with that of men. In other words, men's moral requirements may not be imposed directly on women, but indirectly through the filter of female complicity. Recognising this paradox lends weight to the patriarchy thesis, explaining away many apparent counter-examples. For instance, if clitorectomy often known as female circumcision — is a ‘moral’ requirement to serve male interests, it is nevertheless women who carry out, maintain and insist upon the practice, and it is women who express their moral offence if it is not carried out. This may lead those who would otherwise oppose the practice to defend it on cultural grounds. Because of its far-reaching effects on individual women's lives, however, it is difficult not to see it as, on the contrary, a potent example of the weakness of an orthodox relativist view — a view, that is, which attempts, incoherently, to maintain the equal validity of all moral perspectives. For many feminists resist the relativist conclusion in this case to demand that both women and men shake themselves free of their conditioning. This reveals a fundamental contrast between either biological or sociological determinism and the patriarchy thesis. Characteristically, the patriarchy thesis generates a revolutionary ideology rather than a fatalistic acceptance of determinism and relativism. It rejects the tyranny of local culture and regards even biological ‘necessity’ as manipulable. It results in an appeal, a call, to women to throw off the bonds of conditioning, to take freedom to control their own lives. But it must be asked how far such autonomy is a realistic possibility. If there are some brute facts, perhaps social, but founded in biological difference, which separate the lives and experience of women from those of men, may these not continue ineluctably to affect the moral ideals they may hold? Is there something about woman's experience as a biological and social being that gives her a common identity and differentiates her forever from the male? Or are differences only superficially cultural? Was Margaret Mead (1935) right to see woman as ‘an infinitely malleable clay figure upon which mankind has draped ever varying period-costumes’? And was Simone de Beauvoir (1972) justified in believing that, because women ‘live dispersed among the males, attached through residence, housework, economic condition, and social standing to certain men — fathers or husbands — more firmly than they are to other women’, they can have no common identity or history? I want to suggest that whatever anthropological and economic truths are embodied in these and similar statements, the fact is that  there are indeed certain systematic differences in the lives of women and of men, and that this fundamental contrast in life-experience does indeed account for and to some extent also justify a difference in their moral outlook and assumptions. This is not simply a matter of those aspects of women's sexual lives that are so often cited in evidence as disqualifying women from running the affairs of nations, or even from running a small business: menstruation and premenstrual tension; conception, pregnancy and childbirth; lactation and child-care. These are important, but they are surface phenomena, overtly physical. What they connect with is a much deeper and more significant fact. This central fact is the fact of change, together with the problems of identity and self-concept that this generates. For women characteristically experience change in their lives in a way which is only experienced by a man if he is unfortunate enough to be the victim of some mutilating accident or illness. The horror depicted in Kafka's Metamorphosis , in which a man awakens to discover that he has become a large insect, invites comparison with the norms of women's existence — her passages from childhood to puberty, from mature womanhood to menopause and old age; her experience of pregnancy. Kafka's Metamorphosis begins with the following passage: As Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect. He was lying on his hard, as it were armour-plated, back and when he lifted his head a little he could see his domelike brown belly divided into stiff arched segments on top of which the bed quilt could hardly keep in position and was about to slide off completely. His numerous legs, which were pitifully thin compared to the rest of his bulk, waved helplessly before his eyes. What has happened to me? he thought. It was no dream. His room, a regular human bedroom, only rather too small, lay quiet between the four familiar walls. It is interesting to compare this with Sylvia Plath's poem about her own experience of pregnancy and child-bearing: I am a mountain now, among mountainy women. The doctors move among us as if our bigness Frightened the mind. They smile like fools. They are to blame for what I am, and they know it — They hug their flatness like a kind of health. And what if they found themselves surprised, as I did? They would go mad with it. Pregnancy, however, is a relatively brief and dramatic bodily change, succeeded by reversion to something like the former state. As Plath later continues: I am not ugly. I am even beautiful. The mirror gives back a woman without deformity. The nurses give back my clothes, and an identity. This contrasts with the two major irreversible shifts of a woman's life, first to puberty, then to menopause. These not only cause a change in self-concept — the way a woman sees herself — but, more important, a change in the way she is perceived by other people. In vain she may cry, as Gregor Samsa does to his parents, sister and employer, that the same person is there inside, looking out in the same way at the world. The world sees a woman, in a way it does not see a man, as old or young, sexual or non-sexual, defining her frequently by nothing other than her biological role: mother, spouse, grandmother, widow. It is not surprising, then, that both the phases of major transition, as well as the experience of pregnancy and childbirth can bring mental disturbance and breakdown in their wake. These are rightly described as pressure-points in the lives of women. It would not be surprising, either, if this flux and change in the self were to generate a more flexible response to morality, and one that is peculiarly sensitive to the aesthetic dimension. Women's experience continually forces them to react to situations in which all the parameters have shifted. If one adds to this one other incontrovertible fact — that the overwhelming majority of women have lived their lives without economic freedom or autonomy, but as dependants or chattels lacking control over the crucial fixed aspects of their own lives — then it becomes clear that the chameleon nature of women is their necessary self-protection. As in the case of that animal, their clothes must fit their habitat, changing in response to external change. In this respect, a famously offensive passage by Rousseau on the education of girls may be seen as, after all, no more  than realistic for period and place: recommending that girls be taught to break off games they are enjoying to return to work without complaint, he writes: This habitual restraint produces a docility which woman requires all her life long, for she will always be in subjection to a man, or to man's judgment, and she will never be free to set her own opinion above his. What is most wanted in a woman is gentleness; formed to obey a creature so imperfect as man, a creature often vicious and always faulty, she should early learn to submit to injustice and to suffer the wrongs inflicted on her by her husband without complaint. (Rousseau, 1762, trans., p. 333) The ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy, then, has been no more in woman's grasp than it was within the grasp of the Stoic slave of ancient times. And just as the ethical perspective of Stoicism was shaped by the slave-status of some of its principal proponents, so the ethical perspective of women has evolved within a framework of powerlessness to affect external events — even the lives of her own children within the family structure — and powerlessness to resist the inexorable internal cycle of obtrusive biological change, with the social and economic concomitants of that change that are absent in the case of the more modulated maturing and ageing processes of men. The conclusion to be drawn from these reflections is, I believe, that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are indeed morally significant. It may be that the effects of those significant differences can be mitigated by social change, and by education for mutual understanding. But because the weight of explanation is preponderantly biological rather than cultural or social, it may be that women's moral perspective will continue to be one which reflects a distinctive range of values. The feminist goal must be the interweaving of those values, which have a richness, complexity and spontaneity lacking in more abstract conceptions, with the universalistic goals of traditional moral theory. In practice, this may mean as little as insisting on modest changes in decision-making procedures and modes of academic debate; or it may mean as much as the sacrifice of a whole way of life for activism in some major political cause. But if there is to be a new morality — new values for the new situation resulting from  technological and political change in the closing years of the twentieth century — then the creation of that new morality must in the end be a joint enterprise of both women and men."
ACA ACA-EW1-002 -10.82 "War and Coalition ""Lloyd George would secure a greater hold on the rank and file of our party and he would also be so dependent on that party after the election that he would permanently be driven into the same attitude towards our Party which Chamberlain was placed in before, with this difference — that he would be the leader of it. That would, however, Jam inclined to think not be a bad thing for our Party and a good thing for the Nation. I am perfectly certain, indeed I do not think any one can doubt this, that our Party on the old lines will never have any future again in this country."" (Bonar Law to Balfour, 5 October 1918). The First World War It is often asserted that the First World War rescued the Unionist Party from an impossible position and left it poised to become the dominating force; the war broke up Liberalism and destroyed the Liberal-Labour alliance, so opening the way for Unionism; Lloyd George carried the party to victory in 1918, incurred the odium for the post-war slump and was cast aside ungratefully in 1922. John Stubbs has identified other effects of the war in the growth of backbench activity, the ending of old issues like Ireland and the strengthening of the Unionist case in others, especially tariffs. Such objective judgements have some validity, but they do not distinguish between the positive effects of war and the damaging effects of coalition. In assessing the decline of Liberalism, it is usual to separate the effects of war and coalition, and it is equally necessary in assessing the survival of Unionism. The prospering of Unionism had less to do with the war than is generally assumed, and it was more healthy in 1914 and less certain of prosperity in 1922. Unionists of the time would scarcely have recognized the terms of the debate, for in 1922 the party was still embroiled with Ireland and the House of Lords, held a smaller share of the popular vote than ever before, and was still split as it had been since 1902; few Unionists would have seen the war as a turning-point for the better in the party fortunes. Only after 1922, with the war at last receding from memory and coalition over, did the party take the decisions that led to its successes of the next twenty years. The good effects of war can be detected only in the long term, and there were bad effects too, while the consequences of coalition for the party were immediate and almost wholly negative. It is necessary then to consider in turn the war, the effects of coalitionism, and the years between the end of coalition and the party recovery in 1924. Conservative recovery after war and coalition does not demonstrate recovery because of war and coalition, and indeed the opposite might well have been the case. The effect of the war can be seen under five heads, all following from the actual European conflict: the running of the war effort; the advance of Labour; the advent of democracy in 1918; the effect of war on the party structure and organization; and the effect of war on popular attitudes. The advent of war was not seen by Unionists as a need to turn back to a conventional patriotism, for Unionists had never doubted the patriotism of  their previous stance. In resisting Home Rule and arguing for tariffs, Unionists had seen themselves as acting in the interests of nation and empire against a government that had the interests of neither at heart. The war vindicated the anti-German tone of the tariff campaign, the calls for a stronger navy, the demands for national service, and the defence of the army. If Unionists were vindicated by the war, not just in its taking place but in its nature, then by the same token Liberals were exposed. The war took away the unfortunate necessity, as Unionists saw it, to play with fire in the national interest, but it did not materially alter their view of themselves. If the war brought them more into line with popular feeling, then it was not because they had changed, but because popular opinion (or at least the Liberal-Labour part of it) had at last seen the light. This was demonstrated in the first political crisis of wartime, a carry over from peacetime. Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would become law in the autumn of 1914 and there could now be no election to stop this from taking place. Negotiations centred on the need for national unity in the face of an agreed threat, and provided a test of the genuineness of the parties""commitment to the national cause. A political truce was called within a few days of the outbreak of war; a pact to end contested by-elections was first signed on 6 August, and a joint recruiting drive began before the end of the month. But the Irish and Welsh issues remained; the National Union agreed to approve the truce only on a strict understanding that both issues would be satisfactorily settled. Unionists demanded that both Bills should be frozen in their present position, as passed but not to become law for the duration, but Asquith would not accept this for fear of criticism on his own side. The government thus decided that both Bills would become law, but would then be suspended for the duration. A few Unionists wished to use the Lords to block this procedure, so prompting a constitutional crisis in wartime, but Law and Lansdowne persuaded the shadow cabinet to swallow their feelings. Party opinions were partially assuaged by a protest meeting at the Carlton Club and a demonstration walkout of the Commons by the entire party, but the outcome was not affected, and so Home Rule became law. The success of the party's resistance to Home Rule had been founded on absolute faith that it was the most important issue, but by 1914 this was no longer the case. Nevertheless, the party made only a limited concession; Home Rule's suspension was real, and every attempt to implement it in wartime provoked sufficient Unionist outrage to stop it. Opposition to Home Rule was put on ice for the duration with the Bill, but opposition was as genuine in 1918 as it had been in 1914. In the meantime, the war gave chances to show the responsible nature of the party through its collective action in parliament, through the restraint of its leaders and through the patriotic actions of its individual members. Winston Churchill had welcomed Bonar Law as party leader in 1911 with the reflection that ""if ever a national emergency makes party interests fade, we  shall find in the Leader of the Opposition one who in no fictitious sense places the country and the Empire first"" , a tribute that was certainly justified by Law's role between 1914 and 1918. More than a hundred Unionist MPs were usually away from the House on military service, and 125 Unionist agents served in the trenches; the party organization was used in the war effort at no cost to the country; every local party was decimated by volunteers who joined up in the first rush; and at every level, the number who joined up was more than matched by those indirectly involved through recruiting, raising money, running war charities or breeding remounts. The party as a whole proved the reality of its patriotism from the first days of the war, and the logic of this continuation from peacetime was underlined by the speed with which Ulster Unionists rallied to the flag in 1914, and the gallantry with which they died on the Somme in 1916. The war underlined the Unionist belief in the patriotism of the British people and their belief in the failings of the Liberals, but for themselves it merely confirmed what they knew already. At first all criticism of the running of the war was muted and was aimed at measures rather than men. In parliament it was difficult to adjust to the new situation, whereby the party was supposed to abstain from all criticism of the government but had no say in its decisions. Such an open-ended commitment to a government that most Unionists regarded with contempt could hardly last for long: Law found it convenient to make use of the Unionist Business Committee, constituted in January 1915 as an official opposition group, and he suggested Walter Long as its chairman, so harnessing Long's vindictive powers and giving the party some means of influencing the government without breaking the party truce. It was only the first of many devices that articulated party opinion against governments that the party theoretically supported. Unionist concerns were still as much with traditional areas of disagreement with the Liberals as with the War; the UBC made the running with its concern to shield British industry from the war, much as it had previously been intended to protect it through tariffs, and Stanley Baldwin first made his name through its committees. As John Stubbs has written, ""that backbench activism was centred in such an essentially non-landed element of the Conservative Party tends to confirm the view that the party's centre of gravity was increasingly urbanised, commercialised and industrialised"" . It also reflects the fact that many of the younger, landowning county MPs were simply absent from Westminster; as Yeomanry officers they were liable for service in wartime and, although the Yeomanry could not be compelled to serve abroad, few did not volunteer. The UBC was never more than a small minority of the parliamentary party, with a general attendance of about forty, and its influence was more a result of its being first in the field of opposition, than of its numbers or its members""economic power. It is clear though that the economic tide was running very much in the party's direction in 1915–16; in 1915 the first industrial tariffs for half a century were imposed, and by a Liberal Chancellor; in 1916 even the Manchester Chamber of  Commerce joined in the demand for industrial protection, causing the resignation of its chairman in protest at the abandonment of a century of belief in free trade. In parliament, the bitterest domestic dispute concerned one of the oldest issues of all, drink; Lloyd George proposed restrictions on the drink trade to help the war effort, and suggested that the trade should be nationalized. A pilot scheme was introduced but Unionist indignation was fierce, led by Sir George Younger for the brewers. Bonar Law first welcomed the idea as a means of reducing his party's dependence on ""the trade"" , but opposed it when he recognized the scale of party feeling. Throughout 1915–16 though the issue of increasing importance was the running of the war. A party that had thrown itself so uncompromisingly into the campaign against Home Rule, and which had long ago accepted the need for ""organization"" in domestic affairs, could hardly accept for long the leadership by ineffective compromise which was what Asquith offered. Nor could Unionists, who had flocked to the colours in 1914, accept for long inequality of sacrifice when the nation's greatest need was manpower. Unionists had less compunction than Liberals in employing compulsion for desirable ends, and the Milnerite wing of the party had been preaching the gospel of ""national efficiency"" through organization, making a positive virtue of compulsion. Once the war came, and especially after the flow of recruits proved insufficient in 1915, Unionists called for conscription and for a nationally organized war effort. At first the party leaders resisted such demands as being likely to destroy the party truce and so tried to avoid the public discussion of. such subjects. In February 1915 the National Union Executive refused to sanction a scheme to use the party agents to find recruits, since it ""might savour of compulsion"" and in April the Committee refused to debate a motion on compulsory service because of the party truce. In September, the Executive asked to meet Bonar Law to discuss the subject, now that Unionists were in government, but Law refused any outside discussion until the cabinet had made up its mind. Throughout the winter of 1915–16, Law played for time and stalled demands for a meeting of the Central Council, while Unionist ministers pressed the party case in cabinet. Party opinion was mollified by the Derby Scheme of November 1915, whereby the agents and activists of both parties were used to canvass for recruits; the party organization was turned over entirely to recruiting and the scheme cost the party £29,000. By February 1916 pressure was mounting again, and resolutions calling for compulsory national service were flowing in; the Executive refused to debate them, but passed them on to Law nevertheless. In cabinet Unionists pressed the Liberals steadily towards a full policy of conscription, which was finally introduced in May. Criticism of the running of the war went on though, and in June the Executive passed a resolution calling for a more active prosecution of the War. The Easter Rising in Dublin and the government's abortive plan to rush through a Home Rule settlement caused an even greater furore; this time  Bonar Law had to agree to a meeting of the Central Council, but only alter the cabinet had dropped the Home Rule idea, and with a stipulation in advance that questions would be allowed but not resolutions. Throughout the autumn, the barrage of criticism went on in parliament and in the party. After Carson resigned from the government in November 1915 he became the acknowledged leader of the hardliners, organized in the Unionist War Committee. The UWC was a far more serious threat than the UBC had been: it was entirely outside the control of the party leaders and backed by over a hundred MPs; it was aimed at a government that included Unionists as well as Liberals; and it seemed likely to be a vehicle for the overthrow of Bonar Law by Carson. Its importance was based on two temporary factors, the great Unionist support for its ideas rather than its leaders, and the loyalty of Law to Asquith, which left an opening for Carson. Once Law resolved, after the Nigeria debate of November 1916, that he would work with Carson and Lloyd George to enforce on Asquith the policy that the Unionist MPs wanted, his position was safe. Law's feeling for the sense of the party was less sure than usual in 1916 but, once certain of the party feeling and the national interest, he did not waver in his demand for a different sort of government. Once the political crisis of December 1916 had been weathered and a government had been formed to pursue the Unionist war policy, and with Law himself entrenched at its centre, Unionist support for both Law and for the government remained until the war's end. Agreement on the prosecution of the war remained through 1917 and 1918, and effective opposition to the government passed from the Unionist back benches to the Asquithian Liberals and the House of Lords. From his position as Chancellor, Law could exercise sufficient influence on the domestic management of the war to avoid further problems, and as Leader of the House of Commons and de facto deputy Prime Minister he could also deal with most of the political problems as they arose. So he headed off demands for a capital levy, knowing it to be unacceptable to his party, but Britain nevertheless paid for a higher proportion of the costs of the war from taxation than the other combatants; he was also able to launch the Victory Loan of 1917 at an interest rate of only 5 per cent, having a surer sense of the patriotism of potential subscribers than did the Treasury. There was thus a community of interest in the war between party and government in 1917–18 as there had not been before, and the party was hardly shaken by the secession of a few diehards to form Henry Page Croft's National party. There was no danger that the party would be outflanked on the right as long as the war remained the most pressing national and party interest, and the National party was a complete fiasco. Commitment to the war could have become a problem in itself as the chances of victory became remote. Just as Unionists had rejected an Irish compromise in 1914 after years of commitment to Ulster, so they could not envisage anything short of total victory after the national sacrifices since  1914. When Lansdowne communicated his despair about the war to the press in 1917 and called for negotiations, there was a storm of protest. He had been fading from importance for some time, had been replaced as Unionist leader in the Lords by Curzon and was not a minister under Lloyd George. He was now reviled by the party that he had helped to lead for fifteen years; in his own word he was ""excommunicated"" . Commitment to the war also determined the Unionist response to Lloyd George's disputes with the generals in the winter of 1917–18. Sympathy was with the generals rather than the Prime Minister, hardly surprisingly in view of past events, but sympathy never went far enough to weaken Lloyd George's position greatly. Haig was saved from dismissal by defenders on the Unionist side, but Robertson's removal caused a small stir, and Unionists voted in force to save Lloyd George's face in the Maurice debate. It was doubly difficult for Unionists to resist the substitution of Sir Henry Wilson for Robertson, for Wilson was the most Unionist of all the General Staff and Robertson had not enjoyed good relations with Unionists; Derby's weakness at the War Office and Law's loyalty to Lloyd George were sufficient to defuse the situation. The dismissal of Haig would have been much more serious, but with Law's advice Lloyd George did not take the risk. Over Maurice's allegations, Unionists voted under no illusions; Maurice had indicted Law as well as Lloyd George, and a packed meeting of the UWC under Carson resolved to back the government, not because they believed its explanations but because of their belief in the war. The only alternative to Lloyd George's lies were Asquith's half measures. There was a continuity then in Unionist attitudes to the war, going on into the post-war years in demands for a harsh treatment of Germany after defeat. Lloyd George discovered in 1919, as Law had done in 1914, that a Unionist party that had given its total commitment to a cause would not be fobbed off with a compromise. In the years before 1914 the iron of partisan politics bad entered into the Tory soul, and in the battle for Ulster every weapon had been deemed acceptable. After 1914 there was the same certainty about the war, and it was indeed the inflexible determination of the Unionist party, sure about ends and pragmatic as to means, that was the bedrock on which Britain's war effort rested. Opposition to Home Rule had been canalized into a patriotic war and so the party ended the war in a confident mood, as it had begun it. In the shared community of sacrifice the party had undoubtedly widened its community of interest with the British people, and was able to speak for all of the people in 1917–18 as it had spoken for only an embattled half in 1913. The party therefore reaped the benefit of its national identity in the election of 1918, capturing the mood of the moment as surely as Lloyd George did. In the strident campaign of December 1918 the Unionists were in their element, sure of what must be done as no other party was sure. In its external elements then, the war widened the Unionists""confidence and appeal rather than created it, lining up the nation with the party rather than the reverse. In its domestic aspects though, things had gone very differently: Unionist fears about the growth of Labour extremism had been widespread before the war and had stemmed from two different factors. There had been good reason to know that Labour could damage Unionist electoral prospects and the dangerous prospect of a class-based party system had been present in the Liberal-Labour alliance. Underlying this had been a deeper fear of more extreme socialists, especially the syndicalists, who might threaten violence and revolution. The War threatened to sweep away such fears in the uninhibited jingoism that greeted the outbreak of hostilities. The train was at last ""on different rails"" and Unionists could not fail to rejoice at the disarray on the left, but the different rails might prove more suitable for Trotsky's ""locomotive of History"" than for Unionist imperialism. By 1917 Unionists had more cause to fear than to rejoice, for the Labour movement had been greatly strengthened by the war in both its aspects; increasing membership and growing militancy in the trades unions, growing confidence in the Labour party, the arrival of organized revolutionary extremism in the shop-stewards""movement all pointed to a grim future. The troubles in Sheffield and South Wales, the example of ""Red Clydeside"" and the inspiration of revolutionary Russia might all be signs of a new and terrible future. Unionist fears were based overwhelmingly on ignorance, in isolation from working-class attitudes at home and in the trenches, and on the certainty that things could not be the same again. By 1918 these fears had reached fever pitch; one Conservative MP recalled that his family had expected that the end of the war would be followed by atrocities like those in Russia, that ""families like ours would be strung up from the nearest lamp post"" ; Robert Sanders was surprised to see on Armistice Day that the crowds were actually cheering the King, so unlike the fate of the Russian royal family a few months earlier. Such fears were vastly exaggerated, for if Britain ever did reach a stage of possible revolution, then it was certainly after rather than during the war, but in isolation from working-class opinions, they seemed real enough to Unionist MPs and their supporters in 1918. Unionist reactions were twofold, first to play up the war itself as a unifier of classes, and second to exploit divisions in the Labour movement in the hope of carrying them over into peacetime. The party's first object was the prosecution of the war, and this could be linked convincingly enough with attacks on malingerers and deserters; long after 1902 Unionists had continued to revile radical Liberals (including Lloyd George) as pro-Boers, and this view was easily adaptable to the Labour party in the new war. The campaign for conscription was at least in part intended to force opponents of the war out into the open, so that their lack of patriotism could be exposed when it would be unpopular. When conscription came into force, Unionists pressed for the disfranchisement of conscientious objectors, more because it would be a sign of civic excommunication than because their numbers were significant. The reverse of this policy was a Unionist proposal that all men in the armed  forces should qualify for the franchise as of right. A clear division was to be made then, with all who served their country being enfranchised and all who refused being disfranchised, in both cases irrespective of age or other considerations; the war was to be the test and the policy was to be ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?""  Neither policy was implemented, although gestures were made in each direction. As President of the Local Government Board, Walter Long surprised opponents and supporters alike by the fairness with which he treated conscientious objectors, but local Unionists on the appeals tribunals were far less tolerant. The franchise was eventually widened as a result of the Unionist demand, but not as they had expected. Unionists did though make war service a main plank of their electioneering whenever they had the chance. In 1918 Sanders noted that""I had a contest with Plummer, the Bridgwater Trades Union Secretary. His supporters said he had got wages raised and would get the agricultural labourer 40/ a week. My supporters said ""Sanders went to fight and Plummer did not.""  On such issues are the fates of Empire divided."" After the war, Unionist candidates with commissions, good war records and decorations made the most of their advantages, especially when they could be set against opponents who had opposed the war or stayed at home. Ramsay MacDonald was beaten by such a campaign in 1921 with language that made the general election of 1918 seem tame. As late as 1931, the war records of Labour candidates were still held against them, although by then Ramsay MacDonald, like Lloyd George before him, had been forgiven his sins. Exploitation of divisions in the Labour movement was the concern of only a small number of Unionists, linked mainly with Lord Milner and with Central Office. The British Workers' League was founded under Milner's wing as a front organization that was linked in principle with the coalition as a whole but was run from the Unionist side. Its leader was Victor Fisher and it was dedicated to providing a point around which ""patriotic labour"" could rally. It asserted the need for social reform within a broad imperial policy and attacked the official leaders of the Labour movement for their failure to dissociate themselves from pacifists and militants. In the Labour movement it never made much impact, for it always remained an alien force, financed and directed from outside, but it achieved something in taking the battle on to the streets in order to break up the meetings of the left. Even here more was achieved by the ""patriotic labour"" men who had originated in the Labour movement and stayed in it, such as Jack Jones in West Ham. Central Office had great difficulty finding seats for the candidates of the National Democratic Party (NDP), as the BWL had become by 1918, and it took some time even to find a place for Victor Fisher himself before he was finally installed for Stourbridge. Unionists did not wish to stand down where they had a candidate of their own ready to fight; in these circumstances, the NDP did remarkably well in 1918, winning eleven seats, all in Labour strongholds where neither Unionists nor Coalition Liberals had much desire to stand, and  they beat both MacDonald and Henderson. After the election, though, the NDP faded into the ranks of the coalition majority, having neither roots nor party organization of their own, and Unionist efforts were carried on instead through a Labour wing in their own party. The Labour vote was badly hit by the NDP even in working-class strongholds, but no impression was made on the Labour movement. The general question of Unionist attitudes to Labour was highlighted at the Special Party Conference in 1917 where Law came under a strong attack. He gave his followers an analysis of the situation straight from the shoulder, with no false optimism about the immediate prospects and considerable perception about future events: There is another thing which I know you were thinking about a great deal, which all of us must think about. That is, the future of our Party after the War is over. You would like, I daresay, if I could give you a clear and definite policy. Well, I cannot. We are looking into a fog. It is absolutely futile to try to make plans for conditions which you cannot foresee,(Hear, hear). But this I would say to you. I am not sure that you will agree with me, but I have no doubt about it; our Parry on the old lines will have no future in the life of this Country (Hear, hear). What is the future likely to be? It is all guesswork, but we cannot help thinking about it, and I have thought a great deal about it. There seems to be two possible ways in which our Party can keep its old force. One would be if- I will not say the Labour Party but the extreme Labour Party — were to get so powerful that it would be a menace and we should have thrown on the other scale all that was moderate in the Liberal Party as well as our own Party. That is not going to happen in my judgement without some leader who commands the support of a large section of the country, and I do not see where that leader is going to come from. But the other way in which our Party has a future is the way in which I would like to see it have a future. In the past we have suffered tremendously, because we have always had the whole of organised Labour against us. It is that that defeated our Tariff Reform proposal — that and that alone. Well, gentlemen, there is splitting in all parties, and when you feel that our Party is suffering a great deal, look at the others and ask which of them is worse? There is splitting in all parties, and nowhere is it more marked than in the Labour Party (Hear, hear). Now, gentlemen, this war has shown that among the leaders of Labour there is a body which is national and patriotic (Hear, hear and applause,) and feels these sentiments as strongly as we do. I feel it is our duty to try to get — I will not say on our side but to work with us — the section of Labour which is national and imperialistic (Applause) We have got to get on our side if we can, the section of Labour which recognises that for all classes, employers and employed, production is the one thing to be aimed at (Applause), and that anything which is detrimental to that is detrimental to anybody. Well, gentlemen, you have cheered this. Everybody in our Party welcomes that with their lips, but I will tell you what I think about it, and I am going to speak quite frankly. There are a great many who imagine that we can get Labour to take the shilling for us as it were and to fight simply for our old aims as an adjunct to our Party. That is not going to happen (Hear, hear). If we are going to become part of that larger Party we will have to pay the price. I am not going to attempt today to foresee what that price will be. It may be that it is a price which none of us will  pay. It may be that when the time comes our Party will be divided in regard to this matter. But, gentlemen, of this I am certain, the Conservative Party has been a good thing for this country and it is our business today, and as long as we can, to keep that Party solid; and if splits must come, to delay them as long as we possibly can (Applause). In this single speech, Law foreshadowed the development of the party for the next fifteen years; the strategic dilemma over relations with the other parties after the war, the need to make real concessions to make a coalition workable, the openings that could be created by a national leader of independent reputation (Baldwin as it turned out), and the outcome when the moderate men of all parties came together in 1931. At the same conference, Law warned the Unionists that they must accept the government's plans to extend the franchise, whatever their personal opinions: It is very difficult to see…how you could stop much short of the Bill which is now before the House of Commons. And, gentlemen, I should like to say this also; our Party if it is properly conducted has no reason to fear that the mass of the people in this country will not support it (Hear, hear). If we cannot win that support, we may as well go out of business, and it is our duty now at all events to make the best of the situation which has arisen and to see that everything is done to make our Party what Disraeli called it — and what, if it is to have any existence, It must be — a really national party. It is ironical that one of the most beneficial developments of the war years, the Representation of the People Act of 1918, should have occasioned so much party opposition. Consideration of the franchise bad followed Unionist demands for votes for servicemen, and a Speaker's Conference was set up in 1916, with the Unionist members led by Sir William Bull and Sir Harry Samuel. It seems that a deal was hatched behind the closed doors of the Conference, by which Unionists accepted a widening of the franchise to include all men and some women, in return for a Liberal agreement to accept some plural votes and a complete redistribution of seats. Liberals had argued for a wider franchise for years and Unionists had demanded a redistribution, so both sides got something of what they wanted and proportional representation was thrown in with the present mood of Labour in mind, so that the anti-socialist parties would be able to consolidate their position if necessary. Unionist reactions to these proposals, published and embodied in the Representation of the People Bill early in 1917, were very hostile indeed; it seemed a reckless step to give the biggest ever increase in the franchise in the midst of a major war, to throw away some of the plural votes on which the party had relied, and to receive in return a redistribution that could bring almost anything. A bitter debate in the Executive of the National Union on 8 February 1917 resulted in the setting up of a special sub-committee to consider the Bill; a suggestion that MPs should be ineligible for the sub-committee  because they had let down the party so badly in the Speaker's Conference was only narrowly lost. At the next meeting, the proposals were considered one by one, along with the views of the sub-committee; every proposal was criticized and a highly critical sub-committee report was adopted nem. con., with Sir Harry Samuel finally abstaining after failing to convince his colleagues of the rightness of the proposals. The party view, express d well by the Conservative Agents""journal, was that the Unionists in the Speaker's Conference had been taken in by the Liberal members, that they had not sought or received any professional advice, and that they had blundered accordingly. However, the Central Council recognized in April that a franchise change could not now be avoided, but resolved to support it only if the government would agree to restore the House of Lords at the same time. Reports from the constituencies in May showed 259 local parties against the Bill and only thirty-two in favour; eighty-three suggested no change in wartime; twice as many local parties supported votes for women as opposed the idea, by ninety-eight to forty-four, and there was little or no support for proportional representation. By May the principle of change had been accepted as inevitable, for once an extension of the franchise had been proposed, it would be suicidal for the party to oppose it, and there was thus a need to concentrate on pressing detailed amendments, for example to protect the interests and representation of agriculture. But the partisan warfare went on: Walter Long and his PPS, Sir William Bull (who had been on the Conference himself), reacted angrily to complaints from the agents and suggested that the professional organizers wanted to keep the system as complicated as possible so that they could keep their pay and privileges. The agents took this as a slander on their profession and replied in kind. Bull also continued the fight with greater subtlety through the Daily Telegraph: he wrote for the Telegraph regularly in 1917, either directly as ""our political correspondent"" , or indirectly by feeding information on the Bill to the paper, and this helped to keep at least one part of the Unionist press briefed with the official party line. It was increasingly difficult to see what the party line was: the Chief Whip, Lord Edmund Talbot, had summoned Robert Sanders back from war service and after his return in May 1917 he was pressed into the party's service. Sanders had been a Whip and a specialist in franchise matters before the war, so his return to Westminster gave an added impetus to the party campaign against the Bill; he became a sort of unofficial party Whip against a government that the party supported, cooperated closely with George Younger, by this time Party Chairman, and eventually became deputy chairman of the party himself in 1918. The battle now shifted to parliament, where the second reading was carried by a huge majority on 22 May; many Unionists spoke against the Bill, but few could bring themselves to oppose it in principle, and so Sanders could mobilize only forty MPs to go with him into the No lobby. But this signalized  the beginning of the open fight. In June the National Union finally decided its attitude: it was duly recorded that: the Unionist party…has always been in favour of: 1. An extension of the franchise. 2. [votes for servicemen] 3. Simplification of Registration. 4. An Equitable scheme of Redistribution. 5. All of these proposals to be applicable to the whole of the U.K. 6. Concurrently, a scheme for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber with adequate powers to be introduced. It will thus be seen that the Party is in favour of Electoral Reform being dealt with on a sound basis, but at the proper time. Since reform was now unavoidable it must be made certain that Ireland would be included under the redistribution clauses and that the House of Lords should be restored to entrench resistance to Labour. The details of amendments to the Bill needed to press these points were sent to each Unionist MP, from Central Office not from the official Whips, and a special committee of agents and National Union leaders was set up to give MPs professional advice. By mid July Unionists in the Commons had tabled and spoken to over 160 amendments, with the heaviest burden falling on Younger and Sanders. Pressure was such that the government, in the person of George Cave the Unionist Home Secretary, was frequently forced to allow free votes, so several useful amendments were carried. Instructions to the boundary commissioners were revoked and amended so that they would be able to consider economic interest as well as population and community in the drawing up of the new constituencies; this was regarded as vital by the Unionists, for it seemed likely that the merging of the small boroughs into the county constituencies would take away the last of the agricultural seats. Similarly, an amendment carried in November 1917 did much to nullify the reduction of plural voting rights for town dwellers. Before 1918 electors could have more than one vote, provided that they could quality in different towns or counties; it was now proposed by Unionists that the qualifying area in boroughs should become the constituency rather than the borough itself. A shopkeeper with a shop in Bristol Central and a home in Bristol West would now qualify for a vote in both constituencies; under the new system, there were few ways to qualify for plural votes, but it was much easier actually to qualify, and so tens of thousands of new plural votes were created, overwhelmingly Unionist. At the end of 1917 there was much parliamentary manoeuvring over proportional representation. The original proposal had been for PR in the cities but this was opposed by Unionists who were concerned to protect the efficacy of the business vote; Central Office also opposed the alternative vote when it was put forward in the debates, and the majority of Unionist MPs and the National Union never backed either system. The Commons could not  agree on a scheme and several were inserted in the Bill by a temporary majority of one day and then removed by another majority later. The Lords entered the fray in December with a strong preference for PR as a means of keeping both the Labour party and the Commons in check, so that in January 1918 there were disputes between the two houses as well as between and within the parties. The outcome, perhaps inevitably, was that no new voting system at all was introduced, except for the university constituencies (for it was deemed that graduates would be able to follow the mysteries of PR even if the rest of the electors could not). The Representation of the People Act thus became law in February 1918, ushering in an era of near democracy, increasing the electorate from the 7.7 million of 1910 to 21.4 million in 1918, over three-quarters of whom had never voted before. The Act of 1918 set the scene of the entire political world between the wars, often through consequences that were not seen for a generation. Unionists proved quite able to handle the new mass electorate, and their efforts to gear up to meet new challenges in and after 1911 had set them on the right road. The party took more easily to modern electioneering than did the Liberals, and gained an unexpected bonus in the votes of women, who have been a force for conservatism since their enfranchisement in 1918. What could be anticipated with confidence was the beneficial results of redistribution, for Unionists had expected them for some time. Before the war, Unionists had pointed to the huge disparity between the smallest and largest seats (in 1910 Kilkenny had an electorate of a few hundred and Romford an electorate of over 50,000), and had noted that Unionist constituencies were on average larger than Liberal constituencies, far larger than those of Nationalists in Ireland. ""Increasing population in England and migration of middle-class voters from the towns to the suburbs had led to these disparities and to a situation where any redistribution would help Unionism. In 1911–12 Major Morrison-Bell MP constructed a model to demonstrate these disparities of distribution and had toured the country with it for propaganda purposes; the obvious over-representation of Ireland was especially useful to a Unionist party that wished to claim that Redmond was holding the Empire to ransom. The changes in population in the decade 1901–10, revealed in the 1911 census, demonstrated the rapid increase of population in Unionist areas and the static position in Liberal and Nationalist areas. The LCC area had declined in population by 0.2 per cent overall, but within that Lewisham had increased by 26 per cent and Wandsworth by 34 per cent; the population of Middlesex was up by 42 per cent in ten years, Essex and Surrey both by 30 per cent , while the population of Ireland had fallen by another 2 per cent . Time was clearly on the Unionist side. In the event, the actual redistribution of 1918 came as something of a disappointment, for although there was redistribution within Ireland, the overall number of Irish seats remained the same, and there was only a small increase in the number of English seats. But there was a net gain of some  thirty seats to the Unionists in direct comparison with the last elections in 1910, a strong position for a party that was already the largest in parliament. This position was further improved by the effective withdrawal of Sinn Fein from Westminster after the election of 1918 and the second redistribution in Ireland in 1921 after the Government of Ireland Act, which gave another bonus""to the Unionists by removing about seventy opponents from the House of Commons. The net effect of the Acts of 1918 and 1921 was thus to improve the Unionist position by a hundred seats, not just in that parliament but in every succeeding one too. In other words, quite apart from the franchise changes that did the party no net harm, the changes of 1918–21 transformed the Unionists from the natural minority that they had been in 1914 to a natural majority party until the Second World War. Under the electoral system of 1918, the Unionists had a minimum vote of at least 38 per cent of the electorate, and this would bring at least 250 seats in a parliament of 615; in a political world of three parties this almost guaranteed that no other party would govern alone and that the Unionists would usually have a majority. Within this there was an equally important change, for not only did the number of Unionist seats increase, but so did the number of safe seats. Neal Blewett found just forty-eight ""predominantly middle-class"" constituencies in 1910, while Michael Kinnear found seventy-five in 1921 (and Kinnear's figure is certainly an understatement, for he could not get figures for divided boroughs outside London, many of which certainly would come into his category, so the real figure may be more like ninety). The already safe seat at Wandsworth was divided in 1918 into five safe seats; Lewisham, Hammersmith and Fulham were each divided into two seats; the number of seats in the outer London suburbs of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Middlesex went up from fifteen to forty, of which thirty-five were held by Unionists at every election before 1945. The value of such an expansion of political suburbia has been demonstrated by Michael Kinnear. There were 200 seats with a substantial middle-class element, and these were overwhelmingly Unionist at each election between the wars. If the agricultural seats are added to the middle-class strongholds, it can be seen why Conservatism was so strong between the wars, for the party could count well over 200 seats as unshakably safe and on 300 as reliable enough to be won except in a very bad year. At a time when many middle-class voters would be looking for the party that would best defend them from Labour, this Conservative strength would be of vital importance. The Conservatives would not always win under the electoral system of 1918, but they would rarely do so badly as to allow anyone else to win. The revival of activity occasioned by the 1918 Act and its redistribution may have helped to revive local Unionist parties, but in fact the war had a less serious effect than might be expected. In the first months, when hostilities were expected to last for only a few months, party activity was hardly affected at all. A registration campaign was conducted in the autumn of 1914  and Central Office encouraged the continuation of normal activities. Continuation of the war in 1915, together with the absence of key figures at every level, led to a suspension of all but routine party business. The typical pattern was for the local parties to meet only once a year in 1915 and 1916, to re-elect their officers for another year; agents who had enlisted were kept on the books by retaining half their normal pay, to compensate them for loss of earnings in the national interest and to keep them available for a resumption of partisanship. Central Office tried to keep the local parties alive, for the party truce was only renewed for a few months at a time and parliament was prolonged beyond its five-year term only for a few months at a time too. Subscriptions fell steadily and expenditure fell even more sharply with the reduction of salaries and the suspension of propaganda, so that most local parties ended the war with a substantial profit; but this concealed a real weakness, for expenditure could be revived by a single decision, while income could only be revived by many years of patient work. In 1917 the state of readiness slipped further, with most local parties holding no meeting at all, some sacking their agents, and closing their offices. The agents who remained operated a skeleton service for several constituencies, with the salary shared out too; they visited each office once a week to answer letters and transact routine business; the Annual Report for the Yorkshire Area for 1916–17 claimed ""we still say no offices entirely closed"" but this was no longer a realistic picture of party activity. Things had got even worse on the voluntary side, for without subscriptions to collect or canvassing to do, the whole basis of the voluntary party had gone. The Yorkshire Annual Report for 1920 recalled that ""November 1918 found all Party organizations the worse — not for War but for inactivity"" . The party structure was probably saved by two features, the recruiting of 1915–16 and the need to cope with the Representation of the People Act in 1918. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee ran the national campaign for recruits in the first eighteen months of the war, through party rather than national channels. The Committee was convened by the Chief Whips of the parties, and the chief professional organizers became joint secretaries. Boraston was thus directly involved in administration, and Central Office looked after the organization of recruiting meetings; the Liberal offices dealt with literature for recruitment and Malcolm Fraser was transferred to Abingdon Street to help with the management of the press. The entire effort was run like a political campaign, with the canvassers, speakers, stewards and publicity all run on tried and familiar lines. District and constituency offices were similarly involved and in many areas the national example was followed, with the agents of both parties working under a mayor or lord lieutenant. The Derby Scheme of 1915 allowed the local parties to mount a full-scale exercise in canvassing and knocking-up. When the state took over recruitment under the Military Service Acts, the party continued to be involved: many agents were transferred to the army, where they continued to  do the same job, and many party offices were lent to the government as recruitment centres. In 1917 party organization was used for the War Savings and War Aims movements. This all reflects the important part that political organizations played in the Edwardian era, for when politicians needed means of communication and organization in a time of crisis it was to the parties rather than to the state that they turned for the machinery and the expertise; it was not to be the same in 1939, with consequent effects on the state of the local parties by 1945. Through recruiting and War Aims publicity. even tapers and tadpoles could play their part in the national cause. Central Office was able to keep going at full capacity through 1915 and 1916, but here again there was a falling off in 1917. Boraston was so much involved in war work that his assistant. William Jenkins. had to be promoted to Joint Principal Agent to look after the party. and he was also given a promise of the reversion of Boraston's job. By this time too there were economies in staff and publications because of the war: Gleanings and Memoranda, the Constitutional Year Book and other semi-partisan pieces of literature were suspended in 1917 for the duration. The middle of 1917 saw the party at its lowest ebb, but the demands of an approaching general election produced a recovery. Professional advice was important to the MPs fighting the Representation of the People Bill and National Union committees began to meet again at every level to discuss the Bill's consequences for the party. There was a conference in late 1917, the Executive met regularly. and the Central Council met a record four times in 1917. The rules of the national Union were changed to allow a special appeal to working-class and women voters. Constituency parties had to be wound up and re-formed to conform to the new boundaries. and all this at the worst point of the war. Local campaigns to resist unsatisfactory new boundaries were run and in some cases were very successful. In Cheshire the plans put forward by the boundary commissioners were opposed by local Unionists and counter-proposals put forward by their chairman, Sir Alan Sykes. were adopted instead: this produced a new constituency called Eddisbury. which would be a most peculiar shape. but which would be almost wholly agricultural — and strongly Unionist. Finally. the passage of the Act into law made a general election a certainty in the near future. For the local parties this increased the urgency of changing the local structures and settling candidates; for Central Office it meant the negotiation of a pact with the Coalition Liberals and the NDP, the arrangements of a joint platform. and the production of anti-Labour party literature. all of which were under discussion from the spring of 1918. In every way, then, the party organization emerged from the war years in reasonably good shape; it had played its part in the war and its local and national structures were attenuated but intact (a major and significant contrast with the effect of war on the Liberals). and a large reform had been carried out with little trouble. Great efforts would be needed to restore the party to its strong position of 1914 and to carry on with  the fundamental changes that had been under way then, but the war years had done no lasting damage. The final effect of the First World War was less tangible, the impact of war on the attitudes of Unionists themselves, but there is no doubt that the holocaust did leave lasting effects. The effect of war on religion was among the most profound of these influences. For the party that had leaned heavily on the established Church and derived satisfaction from its role as defender of the Church, the decline of religion was a serious blow. After the war clouds rolled away old arguments about Home Rule were quickly resumed, but the issue of the Welsh Church was easily settled: Lloyd George offered compensation and the Welsh Church was duly disestablished in 1920 with little Unionist complaint. The House of Lords, trade unions, and licensing continued to raise as much heat as before in Unionist minds, but the issue of the Church was drowned in the mud of Flanders. Fisher's Education Act of 1918 raised far less sectarian strife than Balfour's had done in 1902, less even than Butler's was to do in 1944. In part the death of the old politics of Church and Chapel was a consequence of the catastrophic effect of the war on militant Nonconformity, and especially on Nonconformist Liberalism, but in part it was also due to a new doubt on the Unionist side. The Prayer Book debates of 1928 and the arguments over tithes in the 1930s showed that many Unionists still counted the interests of the Church high in their priorities, but the battles were no longer party ones. The party was as sure as ever about Christian principles, and the advent of women into the organization may even have strengthened the connection, but there was no longer certainty about forms and institutions. Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms, and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself. Bonar Law became ever more pessimistic after the death of his sons in action in 1917, but the reaction of Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain was more positive. To both of them, the human sacrifice of 1914–18 created not just a deep loathing of war but also a determination that such sacrifice should not be in vain. Baldwin had a profound distaste for those who had made money out of the war and in 1919 he made an anonymous donation of part of his wealth to the nation as his personal sacrifice; Neville Chamberlain was greatly affected by the death of his cousin Norman and determined that such sacrifice should not be wasted. For many there was a conviction that the post-war world must be made a better place, a view that recurred regularly over the next twenty years. In 1925 Winston Churchill, no empty idealist, introduced his pension scheme with the hope that the sufferings, the sacrifices, the sorrow of the war have sown a seed from which a strong tree will grow. This is the finest war memorial you could set up to the men who gave their lives, their limbs, or their health, and those who lost their dear ones in the country's cause. For the older men, who had sent their sons to slaughter, there remained a determination to make conditions better; for the younger men there was an almost obsessive guilt at having survived the holocaust when so many friends had died. In their different ways. Harold Macmillan and Anthony Eden shared the same reaction; the young Robert Boothby was one of the few who were disappointed by the Armistice, because he had been too young to fight. Not everyone was affected by the war in this way. but a large group in the party were scarred by the First World War for the rest of their lives. and as a result the party acquired a moral calibre that it had not had before. The Unionist party thus emerged from the war reassured in its identity as the national party, more closely in touch with the national mood than in 1914, with its electoral prospects much improved. but, like the rest of the nation, affected deeply by the war. The only cloud, and in 1918 a threatening thunderstorm to all appearances. was the challenge from Labour. The struggle to determine the party's attitude to the aspirations of Labour was to be its chief battleground for the next six years. Coalition troubles, 1915–1921 For ten years after 1914 the theme of party was accompanied by a strong counterpoint: the idea of coalition. For Rosebery, for Milner, even for Lloyd George, there had been temptation in coalition ever since the Boer War, but such dreams had never come into the political daylight. But when war came the persistent pedal-point of coalitionism sounded all the louder for the sudden silence of the party truce. A coalition government was formed in May 1915, continued under Lloyd George in December 1916, and carried over into peacetime in 1918. Once established, coalition proved difficult to shift and coalitionists developed an ideology of their own. During Lloyd George's premiership, the counterpoint of coalition almost drowned the theme of party, and many Unionists feared for the survival of politics as they knew it. The coalition facilitated a realignment from the two-party Liberal-Unionist contest in 1914 to the Labour-Conservative battles of the late 1920s; only with the triumph of coalition in 1916 did the old politics die, and only with the destruction of coalitionism in 1924 could the new politics be born. It is necessary to examine the idea of coalitionism and the political forces that made it a powerful alternative before considering its direct impact on the Unionist party. The most positive argument for coalition, and the one that tipped the balance in its favour, was the experience of war. The Boer War brought the first murmurs of coalitionism, a sense of national crisis brought the first attempt to form a coalition, and the advent of the First World War made it a practical possibility. In each case the argument was much the same: in crisis, it was the duty of politicians to come together so that the best men could be used to the greatest advantage, and so that shibboleths of party could be discarded. Without a combination the nation could not be properly mobilized, for any party government would be opposed by half the nation, and would be forced to consider its own extremists as more important than moderates on the other side. Coalition was the negation of the party system, for as party assumed a grouping from the centre to one of the extremes, coalition assumed a grouping at the centre to the exclusion of extremists. A coalition in 1910 would have excluded Ulster, Irish Nationalists, and Labour; coalition in 1915 excluded anti-war MPs and diehards. The very existence of coalition meant a struggle for the survival of party, a struggle that the Liberals lost, that Labour  won by keeping clear, and that Unionism almost lost too. By May 1915 Unionist leaders were convinced that they must give up some independence if they were to influence the war; the liquor issue seemed to show the danger of staying aloof, and the shell scandal seemed to show that they were needed inside. National and party interest thus combined to make Sonar Law promote a coalition, but it was the national interest that was cited as the reason for joining Asquith. It was also the national cause that prompted Law to accept a junior position; he took the Colonial Office himself, a backwater in wartime, and Liberals retained most of the major posts. In a negative way, Unionists had an important influence on the new government. securing the removal of Haldane, the demotion of Churchill and the placing of munitions under Lloyd George. Unionist ministers were also able to move the Liberal majority closer to the Unionist view of how the war should be run, notably on conscription and compulsion. Asquith's 1915 government was only halfway to coalition; it was in fact a coalition of parties rather than a coalition of men, and it was run so as to maximize continuity. Unionists were therefore soon frustrated by what seemed the weakness of their leaders in swallowing- Asquith and getting nothing in return. In parliament the position seemed worse now that the Unionist leaders sat on the government front bench while their followers continued to sit as the opposition. But it was the continuing failure in the war and Asquith's inability to take important decisions in time that really fuelled Unionist discontent in 1916. By the summer of 1916 the Unionist backbenchers were used to voting against the government. and were close to acting as a full opposition again under Carson. In the crucial Nigeria debate in November Law actually did quite well, for he persuaded a narrow majority of Unionists to back the government. At the height of the criticism, Law met constituency chairmen and agents at the Queen's Hall and told them that the question whether or not this government was wise must be judged on very broad grounds. This is the question which everyone ought to ask himself, and the only question — are we as a nation in a better position to prosecute the war as a consequence of it than we would have been by any other arrangement? I have no doubt of it. A year later he recalled that he had supported Asquith because""rightly or wrongly. I was afraid of any alternative at the time"". In 1916 he cited conscription and the suspension of trades union restrictions as things that coalition had done for the nation; Gleanings and Memoranda headlined the speech ""The Coalition Form of Government almost indispensable.""  The argument for coalition was pragmatic. that no other government was fitted to the war effort, but it had significant undertones: coalition was especially useful in providing the party with allies more able to secure the cooperation of the working class. Although the Nigeria debate was a relative success after a year of criticism, its significance was not lost on Law: it was held on the subject central to  Unionist economic attitudes; Law and Steel-Maitland were singled out for censure, a pointer to the level of party discontent Party feeling had built up much as Law's own had done; having fought off the direct attack, he took the party along with him in the effort to reconstruct the government on more businesslike lines. There is no question of Carson, Law and Lloyd George conducting a conspiracy to unseat Asquith in December 1916; Law and Lloyd George at least wished to retain Asquith in government and they kept him informed about their plans. Asquith's fall was the result of his own miscalculation, especially of his reluctance to believe that the Unionists would prefer Lloyd George to himself in a contest. When the real crisis broke the Unionist ministers acted to strengthen Lloyd George's hand, from a conviction that only greater power for Lloyd George could put enough drive into the war effort. Unanimity was less marked in the scramble for office after Asquith's departure; ""the three Cs"" , Curzon, Chamberlain and Cecil, managed to keep official party interests to the fore by ensuring that Curzon rather than Carson should join the war cabinet — disloyalty might be useful but it should not be seen to pay. For the rest of the war, the party's loyalty to Lloyd George was strengthened when he became not only the organizer of victory but the inspiration of the country. National service remained the prime reason for coalition. With the approaching end of war in 1918 coalition became more positive because the coalition now had to deal with the issues that had been put aside for the duration, and more controversial because this pushed some Unionists into outright opposition. The government had prepared ambitious reconstruction plans, partly devised to put a moral basis into the war effort and partly produced by progressive ministers and their advisers. It could now be argued that the unity of wartime should be carried on to deal with peacemaking, demobilization and economic reconstruction. The government that had won the war would smooth the transition to peace and would redeem its promise of a land fit for heroes. Such was the argument adopted by most Unionist candidates in the 1918 election, a positive programme of the sort put forward by Lloyd George in 1910. A deal on the government's actual policies was done, again like that proposed in 1910, except that the Unionists now held rather more of the cards. The basis of the argument was still the national interest, but the emphasis was now on positive domestic possibilities rather than on negative foreign problems. Underlying the Unionist acceptance of coalition in 1918 was a darker attitude to the future than appeared in the coalition programme. It was important to retain Lloyd George, not just as the man who had won the war but also as a man who could talk to the working class; and if a revolutionary situation were to arise, then it would be far better if Unionists could call on Liberals to help resist it. The post-war coalition thus had two distinct justifications, a positive sense of what could be done and a negative dread of the alternative. In 1920 Birkenhead put forward both lines of argument when  he argued for greater coalition cooperation in the press. Gradually. though. the failure of coalition policies. failure to deliver the goods in almost every sphere. reduced the positive side of the argument to nothing. By 1922 coalition was based on fear, though by that time on fear of parliamentary Labour rather than revolution as such. It was still possible to argue. as Younger did in January 1922, that a coalition could best carry through the policies that Unionists wanted, but by then the main Unionist demands were directed against Labour anyway. the reform of trade union law and restoration of the House of Lords. By the autumn, the arguments for coalition were entirely negative. Coalitionism, though. was a matter of men as well as measures. The change to a real coalition in 1916 had been occasioned by the need to give Lloyd George a freer hand as much as by concern for structures. The government then developed a momentum of its own as a focus of loyalty that ran against the party system. There had always been more in common between the front benches than either had in common with their followers in the country. By 1920 several Unionists actually thought of themselves as coalitionists. Austen Chamberlain made no secret of his belief that coalition produced better government than party. and he reached a stage of heavy dependence on Lloyd George; Birkenhead found it more congenial to work with men of ideas like Churchill than with the squires who would fill out a Unionist ministry; Balfour had always striven to practise government by agreement. and Curzon was attracted by the glamour of the ""first eleven"" . By 1922 the team of brilliant men who had governed for the past six years could not but see themselves as irreplaceable. They could not easily accept a return to old party cries or the need to oppose men who had become close friends. Nor were such responses confined to the cabinet, for many Unionist MPs could not bring themselves to oppose Lloyd George in 1922 after six years of backing him, and one at least never broke the habit: ""He had become fascinated by Lloyd George. and until the end of his life he would not allow a word of criticism to be heard in his house. If anything went wrong in any part of the world he always said ""That's because you got rid of the little man"" . ""In the organization too there were exponents of continued cooperation; although Younger worked to defeat coalition in 1922 he did not rule it out as a future possibility. Locally. electoral pacts between Liberals and Unionists to resist municipal Labour created the same direct contacts and in some places the pacts remained for the rest of the inter-war years. Coalitionism was not then only a political creed, but also a web of friendships and habits that underpinned political cooperation. By 1922 it was for some such a strong attitude as almost to obliterate the normal responses of party. Coalitionists saw well enough the contradiction between politicians who were elected through parties and a government that was the negation of party. and party men saw it too; hence the contentiousness of the various schemes to square the circle by fusing the two coalition partners into one  organization. Coalition had become a political habit that would be quite difficult to break and had sapped the party's confidence in itself. Most MPs who voted against Lloyd George in 1922 did not envisage a Unionist government as the final outcome, and the defeated ministers did not expect their discomfiture to be permanent. When coalition died in 1924, not all recognized that coalitionism must die with it. In the coalition years the party encountered severe difficulties, some endemic to coalition as such, some related to the times, but together they created a general frustration from which the party was lucky to emerge so well. The first source was frustrated ambition: for seven years from 1915 the party had a share of government. but not a full or fair share. In the Asquith coalition Unionists had eight cabinet posts and Liberals thirteen, although there were far more Unionists in the Commons. Unionists had a majority in Lloyd George's war cabinet, but were little better placed in his government as a whole. From 1916 Unionist MPs were the only reliable support for the government. and from 1918 they had a parliamentary majority of their own, with three times as many seats as the rest of the coalition, but they never held as many as half of the government posts. as table 7.1 demonstrates. At the highest level, Unionists could be satisfied, for they held the most prestigious offices, but the number of jobs was never sufficient to reward the deserving aspirants. Throughout the coalition, there were never more than fourteen offices of cabinet or departmental rank to satisfy the combined ambition of 300–359 MPs and a large number of peers. Normally, the ratio was roughly equivalent to one post for every seven MPs; in coalition, Liberals were appointed on a ratio close to that norm, but Unionists had a proportion of jobs to MPs more like one to twelve or fifteen. Table 7.1 Unionist share of coalition governments, 1915–1922 Cabinet Unionists in Total no. of Total no. of Ministers cabinet ministers Unionists May 1915 22 8 24 9 December 1916 23 13 32 14 January 1919 21 10 30 14 January 1921 21 12 29 14 October 1922 22 11 29 13 The discontent caused by lack of opportunity can be clearly seen in a number of cases, but was a general phenomenon that affected all but the top dozen in the party's collective leadership. At its simplest, about a dozen men were not ministers who would have held office in a Unionist government. and about thirty junior men did not hold a post at all as a result of coalition. (And this at a time when the Unionists could install their own government whenever they wished, through their control of both Houses.) Selborne had resigned from Asquith s government in 1916 and was not offered a post by Lloyd George. From the House of Lords and the National Union he became a  thorn in the flesh of the party leaders, where in a party government it would have been inconceivable that such a man, at the height of his powers and with powerful connections. should be left out. Steel-Maitland had been appointed Party Chairman in 1911 to a post ""of cabinet rank"" , and had served loyally for four years without pay or reward. When the Asquith government was formed there was of course no post for such a recent recruit to the front bench. He wrote to Law to protest when he was offered only an under secretaryship. pointing out that he had only accepted the Chairmanship because of the offer of a cabinet post. Law consulted Balfour and replied that Balfour had not promised in such a way as to bind his successor. that ""of cabinet rank"" did not imply a seat in the cabinet (if not. it is hard to see what it did imply!), and that all must make sacrifices. For eighteen months Steel-Maitland worked with Law at the Colonial Office, a useful liaison that kept the leader and Chairman in close touch. When Lloyd George formed his government. there was a bitter exchange of letters, for Steel-Maitland was now expected to serve under Walter Long. an old enemy. In disgust Steel-Maitland resigned as Party Chairman and in 1919 he despaired of ever getting a senior post and resigned from the government too. He was a man of strong ambition and had a doubtful reputation as an intriguer, but he was an able man who had deserved better of his party. After six years as Chairman, he knew all the important party figures and he became a dangerous foe; in the National Union he combined with Selborne to mount a campaign against coalition and as a Birmingham MP he threatened even- Austen Chamberlain's home base. In normal times, Selborne and Steel-Maitland would have been tolerated and both would have been at least partially silenced by the restraint of office. The same can be said of the junior ministers who finally wrecked the government in 1922; many of these would have been cabinet ministers in a party government. as indeed they were in 1922–23, but they had few prospects under coalition. The careers of Bridgeman. Wood, Amery. Sanders and Lloyd-Greame would at the least be held up for years by coalition, for there was no room for their promotion. This is not to say that they opposed coalition in 1922 merely from personal motives; they had a legitimate ambition to serve their country and resented what they saw as the promotion of less able Liberals. They could only blame the coalition system. for only a change of system would give them their chance. In 1918 Sanders thought he had a chance to become Chief Secretary for Ireland, but was soon reduced to considering himself as a possible Speaker; in 1921 he was passed over for Chief Whip because it did not suit the coalition to have such a partisan in so sensitive a post. and he was fobbed off with an under-secretaryship; in 1922 he worked actively to bring the coalition down. The cases of Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Derby illustrate a different truth about coalition. Both held high office under Lloyd George. but both chose eventually to leave the government. Derby was a weak man whose subservience could usually be taken for granted (in Haig's words he was like  ""the feather pillow [who]bears the marks of the last person who has sat on him"" ), but he was very conscious of his position in the party. Lloyd George dominated him but could never prise him away from his party roots; when Lancashire opinion moved away from coalitionism in 1922 Derby moved with it, and provided the opposition with added credibility. Cecil was more concerned with policy than with party or personal ambition; he parted company with Lloyd George over the League of Nations and post-war diplomacy; once outside the government he manoeuvred with other discontented ""outs"" . with Steel-Maitland to project Grey as a possible national leader, and with Salisbury to provide principled leadership for discontented Unionists. Thus the existence of coalition served to divide the collective leadership by separating those who had power and influence from those who did not, by separating the senior men from their junior colleagues and by cutting off those under the Prime Minister's influence from the rest. Difficulties were accentuated by personal prejudices that had not been broken down. The senior ministers fell easily into the habit of cooperation. but many in the party refused even to attempt the transition. Lloyd George had been the Liberal most hated before 1914 and. after a brief honeymoon with Unionists in 1917–18, he regained his old standing by 1920. Early in 1918, a meeting of Unionist leaders considered future relations with Lloyd George and ""Bob Cecil and Curzon [were]against touching him on the ground that he is such a dirty little rogue"" . To diehards, Lloyd George was ""the"" Welsh Walpole ""and friend of MacDonald who would peddle any opinion and give in to any Labour leader if it would help him to stay in office"" . Neville Chamberlain referred to him as ""this dirty little Welsh attorney"" and Stanley Baldwin called him, somewhat ambiguously. ""the goat"" . There was then a deep distrust throughout the party. as Law discovered in 1920: Bonar addressed a mass meeting. He spoke on excess profits, negotiations with Russia and Ireland. His audience was against him on all these questions and there was no enthusiasm. After the meeting he said to one of the local people that it was very unlike the Last Conference in 1913 when he attacked L.G. for 45 minutes amid great applause. The local man replied ""There would have been as much enthusiasm if you had done the same tonight.""  The honours scandals, the employment of the press lords, incessant changes of policy, and a profligate waste of money were all taken as signs of the degradation of office by Lloyd George. Other Coalition Liberals were disliked as warmly as Lloyd George, more for their present policies than for their past. Edwin Montagu was accused of anti-British motives for his Indian policy; with Reading as Viceroy there were openings for the diehards""latent anti-semitism. Christopher Addison was unpopular because of his advanced social policy and he was eventually driven out by the Unionists. But the bête noire second to Lloyd George was Churchill, whose war record seemed to prove all that Unionists had alleged about his excitability and his unfitness for office. Law was very angry when  Churchill was put in office by Lloyd George in 1917, and the National Union resolved that it was ""an insult to the Army and Navy and an injury to the Country"" . The men at the head of coalition Liberalism were therefore execrated as dangerous. corrupt. or irresponsible enemies. and the same gulf separated Unionists from the rest of the party. especially when the ""coalies"" tried to keep open their avenue of escape by parading their Liberalism. At Leamington, in May 1920, the coalitionists were finally driven out of the Liberal party. but Walter Long only noticed what they had said before they were excommunicated: We have been patient. loyal. self-sacrificing and what do we find? Our Liberal colleagues go down to Leamington and ask the audience to believe that they are just as Liberal as ever they were. In other words that there has been no Coalition, no mutual concessions. but that they have swallowed us. To frustrated ambition was added frustrated partisanship. as Unionists were denied the opportunity to criticize men who were still regarded as enemies. just because they were colleagues. Some refused to accept the restriction but many more nursed resentment in their hearts. Throughout the coalition Ireland, the Empire and the House of Lords continued to divide Liberals and Unionists as always. Over India the Unionists resented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms in general. but nothing stirred their animosity more than the treatment of General Dyer after the massacre at Amritsar. Dyer was applauded by the diehard press to make up for his censure by the government. and a collection for his benefit soon raised $15,000. Any post-war government would have met Unionist critics in its reconsideration of Britain's imperial role, but the existence of a bipartisan policy did not help to secure acceptance. Criticism ran along similar lines over Lloyd George's middle eastern policy. and over his preference for Greece over Turkey. Ireland provided a clearer division. Unionists were critical of Ulster obscurantism when voiced by Carson in 1918 and in no mood to fight another war in Ireland, but neither would they tolerate the coercion of Ulster. While Asquithians were attacking the Black and Tan policy as immoral, the Unionists were accusing the government of irresolution. The truce of 1921 was attacked as a typical piece of Lloyd George chicanery, and it needed all the efforts of the party leaders to stop the party from breaking up the government there and then. Finally. the House of Lords was a prime domestic reason for Unionist acceptance of coalition. but a constant source of friction. No agreed reform plan had been forthcoming in 1917–18 but it remained an agreed priority of the government to the end, and pledge after pledge was given. Each year it was put off because of the impossibility of devising an acceptable scheme. It was exactly the issue that could be best settled by a bipartisan government. for that would avoid charges of the gerrymandering of the constitution; time would show whether the coalition would deliver the goods, and coalition would be judged accordingly. In all these policy questions. and in the others that still separated the parties. the party reacted as an independent group and not as a partner, for the Lloyd George government was never a focus of loyalty for Unionists. Complaints about government appointments or policies could only be met by Law with the barren reply that the party could not expect total control and that in coalition such things must happen — which is just what the critics were saying too. Individual Unionists played important parts in the government and many Unionist policies were implemented in full, but the party as a whole never took the government to heart as its own. The party never indeed accepted coalition as an idea; a majority of MPs accepted the advice of its leaders to keep the actual government in being. but it was always a decision for now, never one for always. Coalition thus involved inevitable difficulties which could only be kept in check as long as the sense of crisis lasted. The decision to continue collaboration after 1918 can only be understood through the actual events of that year. Active consideration of the future began early in the year. for a general election could not be long delayed after the new franchise came into effect and the war was at a particularly gloomy stage. No advice to the government expected victory before 1919 at the earliest, and after the rout of the Fifth Army in March 1918 defeat stared the government in the face. So in the winter of 1917–18 murmurs of opposition began to grow louder than at any time since Lloyd George became Prime Minister, the Asquithians revived their interest as they scented a chance to bring Lloyd George down. and the press became more hostile — The Times and the Morning Post as well as the Liberal papers. The idea of a general election was therefore a tempting one for the government. for a khaki election like that of 1900 would present the government as the war party and leave Asquith and the Labour party no way to avert destruction. In March 1918 the Unionist leaders agreed to open up negotiations with Lloyd George's supporters and set up a subcommittee of Law, Long. Younger and Clyde to investigate. Behind the scenes talks about a coalition programme were initiated and the party""managers met to share out the candidatures for the projected election. By July an outline agreement had been presented to Law and Lloyd George, by which 150 seats were allocated to Coalition Liberals, but no decision of principle was taken. Throughout this tine, the assumption was that the government was seeking a mandate to continue the war, and as late as October Bonar Law could still see ""almost no chance of any joint action of this kind unless it is begun as the result of an election which takes place during the war and under the pressure of war conditions"" . But by that time a renewed coalition and a coalition election would not be arranged to get a mandate for war so much as to reap the benefits of victory. A few months later Sanders recalled that Lloyd George had""prophesied great unpopularity for the government during the period of demobilisation and said if we had an election in the Spring we might get a  Bolshevik Government. I always held that view and did all I could to press for an election before Christmas in order that we might get a majority large enough to stand the racket."" In the course of negotiation. the Unionist leaders realized how much of their own programme could be extracted from Lloyd George. and they recognized too the enormous boost to his prestige that had come with victory. For Law, the issue was that many Unionists would in any case feel compelled to support Lloyd George and that he might command a large personal following in the constituencies; it would be useful to capture him as Joseph Chamberlain had been captured in 1886. There was then little belief in the value of the Coalition Liberals, but a strong belief in the value of Lloyd George; he would be a good advocate with the new electorate and he would in due course be disarmed as Chamberlain had been. As Law told Balfour,""that would be not a bad thing for our Party. and a good thing for the nation"". The final decision was taken at the end of October, with victory only a few days away, and was announced with the publication of a letter from Lloyd George to Bonar Law, a letter actually drafted by Law as a summary of their agreement. By the time that the deal was presented to Unionist MPs on 12 November, two important developments had taken place. The war had come to an end, so an election would now be very soon indeed, and Asquith had turned down Lloyd George's suggestion that he rejoin the government. Law supported the offer to Asquith, and it was logical for him to do so; a government bent on post-war reconstruct on and resistance to Labour would be strengthened by Asquith's presence. But Asquith's refusal greatly strengthened the Unionist position. as it left Lloyd George wholly dependent on his allies. The deal done between the Whips was in any case a good one for the Unionists: Coalition Liberals would have a free run in 150 constituencies (a figure suggested by Guest, but then rigidly adhered to by Younger). but Unionists would have at least twice as many, and they would now be free to attack sitting Asquithians too, and with Lloyd George as an ally. The joint manifesto proclaimed that imperialism would be the coalition's chief objective. and on specific issues that interested the Unionists Lloyd George promised an open mind on tariffs and no coercion of Ulster. Commending this agreement to his followers, Law was anxious that they recognise the advantage of Lloyd George as an ally, for ""at this moment, Mr Lloyd George commands an amount of influence in every constituency as great as has ever been exercised by any Prime Minister"" . Law was equally keen to point out that little was being risked, and to set at rest the fears of his supporters: What I propose does not mean that our Party is going to cease to exist. We go into this election — at least if I have my way — as a Unionist Party forming a portion of a coalition. I should be sorry if it were otherwise. From the time that my colleagues in the House of Commons did me the honour of electing me to be their leader I  have felt that I was in the position of a trustee; and even throughout the war the one thing that I have aimed at constantly has been to preserve. if it could be done, the unity of our Party. What was proposed was not the submersion of party in a wider unit, but a parliament of collaboration between independent groups; no more was discussed in 1918 and, despite the strength of the arguments for further collaboration, they would scarcely have carried the party to a greater commitment. The scale of what had been achieved in capturing Lloyd George was underlined by incidents surrounding the letter of agreement between Law and Lloyd George. At the meeting of Unionists of 12 November, Law read the letter and impressed his audience with the concessions that Lloyd George seemed ready to make. At the meeting of Coalition Liberals though. Lloyd George gave only a summary of the letter and stressed its Liberal contents. When MPs returned to the Commons, it soon became clear that all was not well, as Robert Sanders noted: Our people became suspicious at once. I spoke to Guest and urged the publication of the letter. On Wednesday afternoon [13 Nov.] Bonar sent me word to come to Downing Street where I found L.G., Balfour, Bonar, and Auckland Geddes. Meanwhile there had appeared in The Times a fairly full report of L.G.'s speech to his own followers. L.G. said it must have been sent by someone in the audience who could write shorthand. He said he spoke impromptu. that he had a difficult job and that he was anxious to make things easy for his Liberal supporters. It was agreed that a joint meeting should be held, at which he, Bonar and Barnes should speak. I pressed for the publication of the letter. L.G. rather deprecated that saying he was not in love with it. Further pressure was applied by the Unionists and the joint meeting on the 16th went off well, with ""the famous letter"" duly printed and handed out. Unionists were only interested in a deal that would make Lloyd George's capture public. both to give them maximum advantage at the coming election and to spread the maximum disaffection in the Liberal party. The election was announced, parliament was dissolved, and polling arranged for 14 December. One problem remained to be settled, which was the working out of the electoral pact. No details were given to the National Union or to the constituencies involved, so much hard work had to be done and much recrimination endured before the party could settle down to the campaign. Overall the party had done very well, getting 362 of the 531 ""coupons"" that were offered by Lloyd George and Law to approved candidates, but locally the position could look very different. In Wales the Unionists had only two coupons out of twenty-two, because most of the sitting Liberals backed Lloyd George, but this did not much impress Welsh Unionists. In Brightside the Unionist candidate had been specially demobilised for the election; the Central Office agent for Yorkshire persuaded him to stand down, but it took a  visit to Central Office before his supporters could be persuaded to support a Coalition Liberal that they had opposed at the last three elections. It was only the fear of Labour and strong pressure from Central Office, including the withdrawal of financial aid, that kept the local parties in line, and some rash promises had to be made. So in Banbury and in Newport local Unionists were assured that the deal was for one election only. and that acceptance would not preclude them from running a Unionist next time, promises that caused trouble later. Leigh Maclachlan of Central Office later recalled the anguish that such talks caused there: Deputation after deputation came pouring in from constituencies whose candidatures had been assigned to Lloyd George Liberals. At last, after one particularly painful interview, Sir Robert Sanders, looking thoroughly upset. turned to the writer and said""You must see any further deputations there may be. I won't be a party to turning down any more of these good fellows."" Financial control may have been a vital weapon. for the local parties that defied the pact were mostly from strong and independent city parties used to financial independence. Overall, though, only nineteen Unionists stood against couponed opponents; in only one constituency. Morpeth. did such Unionist defiance cost the coalition the seat. On the other hand, five of the nineteen rebels won comfortably on their own, against Coalition Liberals, Labour, the coupon, and their own leaders. A case can be made out for the 1918 election as a Unionist victory rather than a coalition victory. Unionists had some success against the coupon and even more in places where no coupons were allocated, as in Cardiff and in Manchester. The issues of the election were certainly more likely to benefit Unionists than anyone else: an outspoken patriotism, a pursuit of the fallen foe, and a call to restore the conditions of 1914."" Lloyd George received a hero's welcome wherever he went, but then so did Churchill in 1945, and it is impossible to tell now whether Lloyd George would have fared so well if he had had Liberals rather than Unionists at his back. Unionist candidates used his letter to Law as an election leaflet to reassure their supporters and to parade his capture to the nation. There is little doubt that the coalition was returned to power mainly on Unionist votes, although this was not widely recognized at the time; the Unionists had never won so many votes before, and it was perhaps natural to attribute their success to their new asset. In the general pattern of inter-war elections though. 1918 fits in easily enough: in 1922 the party won the same share of the vote with a similar number of candidates, but without Lloyd George. The scale of the triumph of 1918 no doubt owed something to Lloyd George, but the fact of Unionist victory did not, for without the pact the party would certainly have won some of the Coalition Liberal seats that it prevented them from attacking. and these would have made up for some of the others perhaps won for them by Lloyd George. It may even be that the coupon helped to limit the size of the Unionist victory and to prolong the life of the Liberal Party. In parliament there was no mistaking the size of the victory: there were 382 Unionist MPs out of 707: without Sinn Fein the Unionist preponderance became overwhelming. Not all Unionist MPs ever supported the coalition, but almost all of them took the Whip at some time; the Unionists made up three-quarters of the government side of the House. Unionists therefore looked forward to domination of the government: but this never happened. and the party as a whole played only a junior role for the next four years. Their majority gave Unionist MPs a virtual veto over policies and appointments in the long run, but their junior position in government prevented any more positive control. This tension led on to attempts to fuse the government parties in 1920, to the failure of almost every government policy, and to complete deadlock by 1921. Fusion became possible in 1920 because of the difficulties already met by the government. Lloyd George's absence in Paris had accentuated the arguments about policy; peacemaking had produced a major Unionist rebellion in a telegram to Lloyd George from 233 Unionist Mrs in April 1919, urging stronger action on reparations; the appointments of F. E. Smith as Lord Chancellor (as Lord Birkenhead). and of Churchill and Addison, had been much criticised. The attack on Birkenhead was especially revealing; it centred on his lack of gravity in the highest legal office, but it was occasioned too by his lack of concern for party in the excitement of office. Unionists also resisted Lloyd Georges attempt to go on running things as in wartime, insisting that the war cabinet should be wound up after peacemaking was completed. Nor did they like Addison's reconstruction plans: his Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill was eventually passed. setting up a Ministry of Transport. but only after Unionist MPs had shorn it of railway and electricity nationalization. Similar action forced the abandonment of coal nationalization after the Sankey Report. and of parts of the Excess Profits Tax. Bonar Law was now Leader of the House of Commons without a department, and it was indeed a full-time job to keep the governmental process going there. Outside Westminster the government was losing support: eight seats were lost at by-elections in the first eighteen months of peace. Turnout rose as the opposition parties recovered from their disarray of 1918 and there was a large turnover of votes. When local elections were resumed in 1919 there was a large Labour advance, and only local pacts stemmed the tide in 1920. The weakness of the government at its roots was demonstrated by the events at Stockport in March 1920, when a vacancy occurred there; weeks of argument were solved only by the resignation of the other sitting member, so that there could be a double by-election with one Unionist and one Liberal candidate as in 1918. By the time Stockport had been settled Lloyd George was moving to prevent such situations from recurring. He proposed the fusion of the two coalition parties into a new party, which would be launched on an inspiring  programme of strong government and social betterment. The serious economic situation and the delicate state of Labour relations demanded a stronger government to hold the ring. for the attempt at fusion took place just a month before the post-war boom began to collapse. a development that punctured the inflationary crisis and took""the heat out of the Labour militancy. So, for various different reasons, most of the Unionist leaders approved of Lloyd George's intentions; the party managers agreed because they feared that continuing disorganization on the Coalition Liberal side might eventually wreck the government. Birkenhead put the case for a new party in articles in the Weekly Dispatch. a round robin from ninety-five MPs supported fusion, and Balfour formally proposed fusion in a letter to Bonar Law on 10 March 1920. Other Unionists, including Law himself, were less sure, even though they shared their colleagues""concern about the political and economic situation; nevertheless it was agreed to go ahead, but that Lloyd George should make the first move. Lloyd George would propose fusion to his Liberal supporters, and Bonar Law would follow suit on the next day. In the event the reactions of Coalition Liberal ministers were so uniformly hostile that Lloyd George moved quickly into reverse; when he met Coalition Liberal MPs, he merely suggested greater cooperation with Unionists and did not mention fusion as such. Bonar Law promptly gave up the whole idea, with obvious relief, as he told Balfour: The result of this will probably be not to attempt any real fusion of the Parties but to get cooperation. something on the lines of the Liberal Unionists and Conservatives in the early days. This will be difficult to arrange and will certainly not be efficient, but personally I am not sorry at the turn events have taken. I do not like the idea of complete fusion if it can be avoided, but I had come to think, as you had also, that it was really inevitable if the Coalition were to continue. But it always seemed to me more important from L.G.'s point of view than from ours. As a Party we were losing nothing and, since the necessity of going slowly in the matter has come from L.G.'s own friends, I do not regret it. In March 1920, as in November 1918, Lloyd George's open dependence on the Unionists had been openly demonstrated. When the Coalitionists were driven out of the Liberal fold at Leamington in the following May dependence became even greater, for it removed the only theoretical alternative that Lloyd George and his friends had left. It remains to decide whether the Unionists would have accepted fusion if Lloyd George could have made it a real option in 1920. The party in the Commons would probably have done so, though not without a severing of all connections by a determined minority; there is little doubt though that the party outside parliament would not have accepted fusion, or that they could have prevented its implementation. The parliamentary party could determine the shape of governments and election campaigns. but they could not change the structure of the party itself without a positive vote from the National Union and overwhelming approval in the constituencies. At the Party  Conference of 1920, which coalitionists had hoped would approve fusion, it was estimated that about five-eighths of the delegates were in favour of the existence of the coalition, and the rest against it on principle, but that hardly any of them approved its current policies. The Executive elected at that Conference was packed with diehards, and ""a debate on cooperation against Labour revealed the depth of division: a motion calling for closer collaboration met strong opposition, but so did one calling simply for a Unionist government: They must turn out the man who was the greatest danger to the Conservative Party"" ,(a voice — ""Lloyd George"" ).  ""Yes, if you allow conditions to continue as at present you will find a deliberate attempt is being made to assassinate the Conservative Party.""  In the end a meaningless compromise was made, and the Conference called on all good men to come together to resist socialism, but also insisted that the Unionist party should not sacrifice any of its independence in the process. It is difficult to see how this Conference could""possibly have approved fusion; even if it had done, half the constituencies would probably have refused to implement the decision. A motion which would have specifically committed]the party against fusion was not put on the chairman's decision; the diehards accepted this ruling without demur, no doubt because they felt that they had already made their point. Bonar Law's position remains enigmatic, for he promoted fusion and yet was glad to see it fail. He was never an ideological coalitionist and never fell under L.G.'s spell, for all their good personal relations. Had his colleagues backed fusion in 1920 Law would have accepted it, but he would hardly have stuck to that position in the party crisis that must have followed. His relief in avoiding such a parting of the ways is understandable. With the failure of fusion, and with the subsequent failure of Liberal reunion in May 1920, the coalition settled into a stage of continuous crisis. The deepening economic recession defused the worst industrial problems, but the failure of fusion had deprived the government of the only way of bringing coalition and party into line. From now on time was on the side of the anti-coalitionists, for the approach of another election would eventually reopen the argument to their advantage. By the time of the next possible resolution of the problem at the end of 1921, coalition had signally failed to provide Unionists with what they had hoped for, and Lloyd George had become an electoral albatross rather than an asset. The failure of the programme of 1918 stemmed above all from the lack of real agreement at the time; despite the negotiations, the coalition's electoral manifesto and campaign of 1918 went little further than Lloyd George's letter to Bonar Law. When coalition ministers began to bring forward legislation in 1919 they met a hail of criticism, from Liberals hostile to decontrol and Unionists lukewarm on social reconstruction. To keep all his supporters in balance, Lloyd George had to offer something to all of them, but this meant that every coalition scheme was also hotly opposed by a part of the coalition. Lloyd George disarmed his opponents on Ireland with his Russian policy, and his opponents on Russia with his Irish policy, and they did not combine to oppose him. Another example of this division of opponents was the Amritsar Debate of July 1920. Conservative MPs. voted 122 to 93 against the government. Lloyd George was upheld in this division by the votes of Labour and Asquithian Liberal M.P.s who at the time vigorously opposed his repression of Ireland. Such a balancing act could keep his government in being only by increasing his own reputation for lack of principle. Instead of a systematic policy of imperialism, Unionists had Montagu's Indian policy and Milner's policy in Egypt; instead of settlement in Ireland there were outrages; instead of a broad social policy there was first a reckless waste of money and then an abandonment of almost all that had been proposed. In only one area did the coalition succeed totally, but this argument was a double-edged sword: Lloyd George had weathered the storm of labour unrest, and after ""Black Friday"" this was clearly abating. What was now needed was a means of countering Labour's electoral appeal, and for this a Prime Minister with a cleaner political reputation would be needed. The more the revolutionary threat receded, and the more Lloyd George appeared as a loser of votes, the more the Unionists would be tempted to cast him adrift. In most of this Lloyd George was desperately unlucky, both in the failures and reconsiderations of policy and in the development of his own reputation. Many coalition schemes were wrecked by Unionist hostility, yet Unionists also complained when the government then changed course. The following scenario was typical: government introduces social scheme balanced to meet Liberal and Unionist influence in government, but tilted slightly to Liberalism by the minister in charge; Unionists in the House of Commons wreck the plan and denounce the waste of public money; government withdraws the scheme and is then accused of unprincipled change of front by Unionists. Such was the logic of coalition when the balance of the government did not correspond to the balance of parliament. Successes of the government would always be claimed by all its members, but failures would be left to the Prime Minister. Rapid changes of policy were in any case dictated by circumstances. The uncertain foreign situation was typified in Eastern Europe where in 1920 the Poles seemed likely to extinguish the Bolshevik regime, and a year later the Bolsheviks almost took Warsaw. At home the sudden switch from inflation and boom to stagnation and slump in a few months made changes in policy inevitable. Ireland was a nightmare for all parties; the fifty-year respite gained by Lloyd George in 1921 was certainly based on pragmatism rather than principle but no other policy could have worked. In field after field the government was forced to change course, earning a reputation for dishonesty and lack of principle that, when allied to Lloyd George's prior reputation, could only do him great damage. Nothing exemplified this more than the campaign for public economy which shook the government in 1921. A public  that had seen income tax rise fivefold in five years were only too ready to believe that their money was being wasted. During the war the national crisis kept discontent within bounds, but when income tax actually went up again in 1919 (to pay amongst other things-for homes for heroes) the reaction of taxpayers was very hostile indeed, especially when in 1920 inflation reached unprecedented levels too. The first to sense the new mood was the press, and an Anti-Waste League was founded by Lord Rothermere. Two by-elections at the Wrekin and one at Dover showed the threat that independents could pose on the anti-spending tack, and Lord Salisbury tried to guide the agitation into respectable channels through a People's Union for Economy. Two further Anti-Waste victories in June 1921, on Salisbury's doorstep in Hertford and in the ultra-safe Unionist seat of St George's Westminster, were too threatening to be ignored. Government spending had already been reviewed and cut substantially, but the time had now come for a great public gesture; this was supplied by the appointment of the Geddes Committee, a typical Lloyd George manoeuvre using businessmen instead of MPs or ministers. When the ""Geddes Axe"" fell in February 1922, it proposed cuts in the social services which alienated once and for all the Prime Minister's last admirers on the left; moderate Unionists like Stanley Baldwin disliked the Geddes Axe as being too arbitrary and too indiscriminate, but the rest of the party criticized it as too little, too late, and unlikely to be implemented anyway. Resolutions continued to call for further economies and lower taxation, so the government got no credit for what it had done. After the summer of 1921 the Anti-Waste threat receded, but this was largely because Unionist candidates were now on the bandwagon with them, demanding cuts as loudly as anyone. After St George's, almost all Unionist candidates ran without making promises to support the coalition; this did not mean that all of them joined the diehard group when elected, but it showed that coalition was no longer seen to be a winning ticket. By 1921 indeed frustration with coalition was building up such a head of steam as seriously to threaten its future. The party managers continued to bewail the organizational weakness of Coalition Liberalism, but there had been little opportunity for organizational collaboration; one of the few joint ventures, a magazine called Popular View, was abandoned in 1921 because of the impossibility of producing a lively magazine out of continuous compromise. Money was short in the party by 1921 because there had been no proper revival since the war; members were constantly described as apathetic, and were in no mood to give their time or their money to a party that did not know where it was going. The state of the organization was causing concern to the party managers, for it would deteriorate further unless some definite decision about the future were taken. At the end of 1921 Younger still favoured coalition, but the balance had become a fine one. The National Union had much less doubt, and by 1921 it was committed firmly against coalition. Younger was in a very exposed position, for he was  Chairman of the National Union Executive responsible for carrying out its decisions, as well as Party Chairman and so committed to the leader and the coalition. He tried to escape the cross-fire by getting the two offices separated but could not get the new rules approved. The actual administration of the National Union was separated from Central Office in 1921, and it appointed its own secretary thereafter; it was a change of no great importance, for the National Union continued to work from Central Office and the Principal Agent continued to be Honorary Secretary, but it was a minor declaration of independence. The question that exercised the National Union most of all was the House of Lords, and regular deputations were sent to Law to press for action. By early 1922 tempers were short and the Chairman of the Central Council publicized the dispute in March with an open letter to Austen Chamberlain. This brought a reply from Salvidge, still a convinced coalitionist: I read with amazement Sir Alexander Leith's letter to you in this morning's press. The inference in his letter is that he speaks for the Council of the National Union of which he is chairman. As a member of that Council I emphatically deny that he has had any mandate, or that he is justified in assuming that the Council as a whole takes his view. Despite Austen's soothing reply, Salvidge took the matter up at the next meeting of the Executive, when he demanded whether or not Leith had been satisfied with Austen's reply. Salvidge was right to claim that Leith had overstepped the mark and that he had no mandate for his action, but it is clear that he rather than Salvidge really represented the views of the National Union. In March he explained that he had acted in a personal capacity only and that Chamberlain had suggested that their correspondence be published. At the May Executive the government was rapped over the knuckles for its failure to reform the House of Lords, ""a breach of the understanding upon which the allegiance of the Unionist Party to its leaders depends"" . Salvidge proposed to delete these insulting words but could not even find a seconder; nine MPs were present, including Younger, Sanders and Neville Chamberlain, all of whom must have approved of the resolution or seen the futility of attempting to amend it. The National Union also reacted fiercely to the attacks on Younger by coalitionist ministers, most of all Birkenhead's description of him as ""the cabin boy"" and Lloyd George's of ""a second-class brewer"" . There were fears that it was intended to remove him and substitute someone more acquiescent. In March 1922 Steel-Maitland proposed a strong motion of confidence in Younger that was a clear rebuke to his critics; Younger lowered the temperature by asking Steel-Maitland to withdraw the motion, but the Executive accepted this only ""on the understanding that Sir Laming Worthington-Evans would make known to his colleagues in the Government that the Committee would bring the matter up again unless the attacks by Ministers on Sir George Younger ceased"" . The National Union was then hostile to coalition and quite determined to use its independence if  necessary to protect the interests of the party. The views of the local parties were less clearcut — although the National Union itself was no more than the sum of the local party leaders. There was support for coalition in the North and in Scotland, where local cooperation was pushing back municipal socialism in 1920–21, and also in Birmingham, where Austen Chamberlain traded on the family name and Neville brooded uneasily on the course of events. In southern England, there was forthright opposition, for here the benefit of cooperation was negligible and the Labour threat more remote. Sanders found that Somerset was almost wholly hostile to coalition, and Middlesex and London were both equally critical. It was now that the assurances of 1918 that the pact would be for one election only came home to roost; wanting to be ready in plenty of time, many local parties were by 1921 selecting candidates who would oppose sitting Coalition Liberals. In Newport it was the Licensing Act of 1921 that brought about this decision, but in other places it was India, or Ireland, or public spending. Local parties also pressed sitting MPs to declare that they would fight next time without the coalition label and many gave way to these suggestions. Local parties were not very representative of Unionist voters, but this did not affect their independence or their control over their candidates. There was little to be done to prevent this inexorable build up of pressure from the roots. Taking the lead against the coalition was a small but implacable group of diehards; they were never more than a few dozen in the Commons and, although they attracted shifting support on particular issues, they never threatened the coalition majority. The Lords were more diehard, as they had been ever since 1911, but unless their powers were restored they would denounce the government in vain. Diehard opinions ranged from the virulent obscurantism of Northumberland, Page Croft and Cooper, who saw politics as a black-and-white struggle between good British imperial-minded Christians and Jewish-dominated marxist wreckers, to the high-minded Association of Independent Peers, who were primarily concerned with the effect of coalition on the standards of public life and its failure to halt the drift towards class politics. The strongest weapon in the diehard armoury was the press, for it had the reliable support of the Morning Post, National Review and Spectator, and intermittent backing from the papers of Beaverbrook, Rothermere and Northcliffe. Of the Unionist press, only the Daily Telegraph supported the coalition, and it could make little head against such a tide. This motley bunch of adventurers, undesirables and patriots had by 1921 accepted the general lead of Lord Salisbury. As the son of a Unionist Prime Minister, Salisbury used his name and connections to weld the diehard opposition together and awaited his opportunity. He was desperately worried that coalition, as a cynical combination to keep Labour down, would produce a reaction among working-class electors that would eventually put Labour in power. This was the most respectable strain of Unionist opposition to the  coalition. When the Unionist won the by-election at Newport in 1922, on working-class votes and on an anti-coalition platform, his agent explained that""the working classes had never understood the Coalition. They had regarded it rightly or wrongly as a wangle and as an attempt to ally capitalist forces against the worker."" It was such fears that Salisbury set out to quieten, using his People's Union for Economy to widen the diehards""appeal, and calling for a return to the classless tradition of Conservatism. His own group called itself the Free Conservatives, set up an office to rival that of the official party, and supplied money and professional assistance to rebels at by-elections. Salisbury did not share half the views held by those who accepted his lead, but he was a focus for the increasing Unionist discontent, a respectable public figure acting from the highest motives; by 1921 he had made the diehard opposition a formidable force. In any calculation of the party's future prospects Bonar Law would be a key figure. Throughout the coalition, Law was prepared to support its continuation, but he was rarely prepared to argue for concession that would weaken his own party. In private he got on very well with Lloyd George, but he never hid his doubts; in 1917 he told Unionists that Lloyd George was a man who has the defects of his qualities"", and told his audience that he was saying no more than he had told the Prime Minister to his face; when in 1920 he was told that Unionists would rather hear him attack Lloyd George than defend him, he told this story to the Prime Minister too. For ten years Law had been at the heart of the party's reactions to political events, largely because his own views mirrored those of his followers almost exactly. The extreme diehards had written off Law as the dupe of Lloyd George because he did not come out fighting against coalition policies, hence the witticism that the coalition was an alliance between a flock of sheep led by a, crook and a flock of crooks led by a sheep. But to the bulk of the party, Law s presence in government was a guarantee of the party's independence; with Law in charge the party would extract from coalition whatever there was to be gained, but at no risk, and when stripped of all complications this was more or less what Bonar Law intended all along. He was therefore as vital a figure as Salisbury, and in something of the same way: Salisbury was the link between the anti-coalition forces outside the government, and Law was the link between anti-coalitionists outside and critical Unionists within. Successive crises were dealt with by Law without resolving the fundamental disequilibrium of the situation, for the conflict between coalition and party was as real in Law's own mind as in the minds of a host of Unionists who continued to give general support to the government. It was therefore an event of major significance when Law's retirement was announced in March 1921. He had been unwell for some time and had now gone into a state of collapse. Lloyd George announced his resignation to the Commons on 17 March in a speech that was close to tears, and the reaction of Unionist MPs was equally emotional, testament to Law's great standing in his  party. The effect of the resignation was increased by its suddenness: within two days Law had laid down all his offices and gone abroad. Maurice Cowling has suggested that Law's resignation was tactical, that he could not face reconciling his party to the coming Irish negotiations, and that he was giving up office so as to be available as an alternative to coalition in the future; in Gaullist terms he was becoming a Prime Minister ""in the reserve of the republic"" . Lloyd George perhaps entertained similar doubts, for his first reactions were to suggest that he should resign too, and to ask if he might speak to Bonar Law's doctor. But there can be no real doubt that it was on medical advice that Law resigned, for he was advised that only a complete break would save him from total breakdown, and he was actually suffering from the disease that was to kill him in less than three years. For six months in 1921 Law was in France, cut off from most political information and from all political action. His position after his return in September should not affect the assessment of his resignation in March. The effect of Law's abrupt departure was magnified by the departure at about the same time of Walter Long, the only other Unionist of weight who combined an acceptance of coalition (as a defence against Labour) with a determination that the integrity of the party should not be compromised in any way. Long's health had been deteriorating for years, but he had kept open his channels of communication; like Law his influence was based on years of devotion to the interests of the party, and like Law's that influence had been used to argue the case for coalition. In February 1921 he gave up office and soon afterwards he accepted a peerage and retired from active politics. With the passing of Law and Long there were no Unionists in the cabinet who had both authority and detachment; the link had been broken, but its importance was demonstrated with devastating effect when both intervened to influence the events of October 1922. By this time Long would not have been a possible leader, and so the third contender of 1911 alone remained: Austen Chamberlain. There was some speculation about alternatives, with some canvassing the claims of Derby and Salisbury and others imploring Lloyd George to take over the leadership and unite the parties in a shotgun wedding, but Austen's claims were undeniable. He was elected leader of the party at the Carlton Club on 21 March 1921, proposed by Captain Pretyman who coined in his speech the idea that Conservative leaders ""emerged"" rather than being elected. Austen had certainly emerged as leader, for nobody could have stood against him with any prospect of success, and it was appropriate that his succession should be marked by Pretyman, who was a respected backbencher of long service and represented the inarticulate centre of the party. At the time of his election, Austen was seen as a party man who would be even more attentive to Unionist interests than Law had been. This was a natural enough view for those who remembered his tariff opinions before the war, his stout defence of Ulster and his diehard opinions in 1911. But by 1921  Austen was an ideological coalitionist for both personal and tactical reasons: he had fallen under the personal sway of Lloyd George, he was influenced by Birkenhead and Horne, and he had no doubt that a coalition alone would be able to contain Labour. The intolerance he had shown for free-traders before 1914 was now turned on rebel Unionists who rocked the coalition boat. He had perhaps been too long in high office, too isolated from discordant views by the well-oiled Birmingham machine to take full account of the volume of dissent. Any doubt about his attitude should have been set aside by the speech with which he accepted the leadership: There are moments when the insistence upon party is as unforgiveable as insistence upon personal things, when the difficulties which the nation has to confront call for a wider outlook and a broader union than can be found even within the limits of a single party, and when the traditions of more than one party, the ideas of more than one party need to be put into the common stock. For the next eighteen months, Austen Chamberlain worked behind the scenes to maintain the interests of his party, just as Law had done, but he had no personal sympathy for the diehards or their views, and he made no gestures of conciliation to them. His public speeches were all aimed at converting the party to a positive belief in coalition, leading it from the front — and in a direction where many Unionists did not wish to follow. In losing Law the party had lost a conciliator; in electing Austen it had gained an inflexible leader who would not always put party first. There was reason to think, as the Financial News suggested, that""Mr. Bonar Law's resignation is more than a nine-days wonder. It is probably the beginning of the end of Coalition Government. ""The advent of a convinced coalitionist to the leadership of the largest coalition party was indeed the beginning of the end for coalition."
ACA ACA-EWW-004 -0.87 "SOME NUMERICAL METHODS 2.1 INTRODUCTION In this chapter we shall discuss some numerical methods for solving problems formulated in terms of matrices. However, it must be stressed at the outset that we can do no more here than to indicate the basic principles involved, and give illustrations of a few of the almost innumerable variants of basic methods that exist. Quot homines, tot sententiae: almost every worker in the field has his pet variation, which suits him ad his computer better than any other. For a wider discussion, readers are referred to texts such as Bodewig (5) and Wilkinson (6). Most of the numerical problems which arise in matrix studies (particularly those which derive from dynamical systems) lead ultimately to one or both of two basic processes:(a) the inversion of a numerical matrix;(b) the evaluation of its eigenvalues and vectors. It will be convenient to deal with these under separate headings. The methods themselves also divide into two broad categories:(a) direct methods, in which the solution requires is reached in a finite, predictable number of operations;(b) indirect methods, in which the solution is usually obtained by successive approximation procedures, when the number of operations is determined by the rate of convergence. I: RECIPROCATION; LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 2.2 DIRECT METHOD FOR MATRIX INVERSION Under this heading we give three methods which are all very different in principle. Each has variants; for each there are circumstances which favour its use. 2.2.1. Pivotal condensation This method is the simplest, and probably the most universally used. Suppose we have a square matrix A =  of order n for which we require to find the reciprocal R: then AR = I. Now it is possible to write down a sequence of matrices  Mr (r is usually n or n + 1, depending on the variant employed) which when used as a chain to premultiply A, condense it to the unit matrix, so that  which evidently implies  The numerical procedure is to operate successively on 91); given A we can write down M1 and we evaluate  so that(1) becomes  Knowing B we can now write down  and form  and so on , until R is obtained. As we shall see, in practice it is not necessary to write down the matrices  merely perform simple operations with the rows of A and I in (1), which is all the matrices  do. For ease of exposition, let us suppose n = 4. Consider the matrix product, corresponding to (3)  In writing down  we have first arbitrarily selected a non-zero element  of A as a pivot (underlined) for this first step in the operation.  is then obtained from the unit matrix by replacing its second column (corresponding to the subscript 2 of  by the third column of A divided through by  with negative signs for the off-diagonal elements. The third column of B is then null except for a unit in the position corresponding to  The product makes it clear that all we are doing, in fact, is to operate with the rows of A in a manner similar to that often used in the condensation of determinants. Thus row 1 of B is now 1 of A minus  times row 2 of A; row 2 of B is row 2 of A divided throughout by 3; row 3 of B is row 3 of A minus  times row 2 of A; and so on. Having obtained B, we now select a pivotal element in it for the next step; the selection is arbitrary except that the element must be nonzero and must not be in the second row, which contains the unit. For example  in which  has been chosen as the pivotal element. We now choose a pivotal element in C, excluding rows 2 and 3 containing the units. Note that  and  cannot both be zero, or A would be singular and R would not exist; similarly for  We choose a nonzero element from these  four -say  and then  The last step is not arbitrary: we must exclude the first three rows (containing units), so that the only choice for pivot in the next step is D44, which cannot be zero. We write down , evaluate E =  obtaining a matrix which if the rows are rearranged by premultiplication by an obvious matrix , becomes the unit matrix. As we have said, in practice we do not need to write down M1 etc. When we use  as a premultiplier of (1) we combine the rows of I in exactly the same ways as those of A. We can therefore write the two arrays side by side and operate on rows of 2n elements. For example, to summarise what has been done above (we refer to row i as ) we use Table 1.  When the left-hand array has been condensed to I, the right hand array is R.  This method has a number of variants. First, it is possible to operate with columns, using postmultiplying matrices Mi; but this is really only transposition of operations on rows. The variants derive mainly from the choice of pivot. In the so-called optimal pivoting method, one chooses the element of largest modulus from among those available. In a second variant, one chooses the element of largest modulus in each column in turn; in a third, the diagonal elements are chosen in order; and in a fourth, the diagonal elements of largest modulus are chosen in turn. The third has the advantage that no final rearrangement of rows is required; on the other hand, it fails if a pivot becomes zero, or even very small. The third variant is usually described as ""diagonal pivoting without row interchange"" , the fourth as ""diagonal pivoting with pivotal strategy"" . It is to be observed that the determinant of A is readily found from the condensation procedure. The determinant of  is , etc. It follows that the determinant of A is , i.e. the product of the pivotal elements chosen, multiplied by the determinant of , which rearranges the rows, and so has the value , according as to whether the number of interchanges is even or odd. Example 1 We exemplify these procedures using the matrix  This matrix, in fact, has the determinant 100; since its elements are integers, the elements of the reciprocal will be terminating decimals. In the intermediate steps, however, the numbers are incommensurable: for brevity of exposition we give four decimal places only, though of course a computer will normally employ a much greater number. (i) Optimal pivoting In Table 2, the last array on the right is the required reciprocal. Note that, in the rearrangement of the last step, we crossed three rows in bringing  to the top; then the new second row  crossed two rows in going to the bottom. Since the total number of crossings, 5 is odd,  has the determinant -1; accordingly       Coincidentally, this example also illustrates he second variant: it is adventitious that the largest element among those available occurs in the first, second, third and fourth column in succession. There is thus no difference in the working. However, in the optimum method a computer is required to scan all elements available, i.e.  in successive steps, while in the second variant only m,(n — 1),…, 1 need scanning. In this example, therefore, the second variant has the advantage; in a matrix of large order, the scanning process can take considerable computer time. No scanning is needed in the third variant, where the diagonal elements are prescribed. (ii) Diagonal pivoting We now treat the same matrix by the third variant (see Table 3). For this example, this variant presents no difficulty. Also  as before. The student is invited to effect this reciprocation by means of the fourth variant, in which the largest diagonal element available is chosen as the pivot at each stage; it begins with the bottom right-hand element. 2.2.2 The method of submatrices This method has nothing in common with the pivotal method, but has great advantages in certain circumstances. (a) Suppose we have a computer which will accommodate a matrix of order m, but we require to reciprocate a larger matrix A of order n where . (b) Suppose we have a matrix B of which we know the reciprocal ; B is now bordered, so that it becomes a submatrix of a larger matrix A, and we require A-1. The method of submatrices is particularly useful in solving both these problems. Let A be partitioned in the form  Here A is of order n, B of order m, E of order n — m; C and D are in general rectangular. Let the reciprocal of A be similarly partitioned:   Then the equations  provide relations from which, in general,  , may be explicitly found. Various formulae are possible, but the most advantageous from the computational standpoint appear to be the following. Write  Then  as may be checked by evaluating  It is to be noted that, although these formulae involve a number of multiplications, only two reciprocations, B-1 (of order m) and  (of order n — m) are involved. Problem (a) It is clear that the formulae just established provide a method of solution for problem (a) since  and the computer can reciprocate both B and  and perform the required multiplications. Example 1 Although it is very small, we may use the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4) to illustrate the principles involved. We shall here partition it into four square submatrices, each of order 2. In this simple illustrative case we avoid decimals. Thus    We are now able to evaluate the remaining submatrices of the reciprocal as  Accordingly, the reciprocal is  in agreement with the result found earlier. Problem (b) It is also clear that Equations (3) and (4) provide a solution for this problem. We are given  and we border B as in (1) and apply our solution to obtain  The working is then exactly as in the example just given. The formulae are, however, rendered much simpler if we have only line bordering, i.e. C is a column, D a row, and E a scalar. Then X is a column, Y a raw, and  a scalar. It follows that we can provide the answer to a third problem,(c): the successive evaluation of the reciprocals of the leading minors of a matrix A until  is achieved. Example 2 Again, we choose the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4):(i) The leading minor of order 1, b1, is the element 6: reciprocal 1/6. (ii) Using (i), we apply the formulae (3),(4) to find the reciprocal of the leading minor of order 2, viz:  Here   and we deduce  (iii) We now use this result to examine the third order minor  Then  similarly,  Also  Note that, in Equations (4) which we now evaluate,  is a matrix of rank 1. We find  (iv) Using , we proceed to obtain the reciprocal of . We leave this step to the reader, but observe that  Since an element in the reciprocal of a matrix M is defined as the ratio of the cofactor of the corresponding element in M to the determinant , it follows that, for example,  and hence   In this example, therefore,  2.2.3 Column (or row) building This method makes use of Theorem IX of  which states that if we have a square matrix Ao of order n, and know , then by a simple calculation we can find the reciprocal  of a new matrix , where  is a unit rank matrix, also of order n,  being an arbitrary column and row respectively. A second application of the theorem enables us to find , where  and so on, until we find , where  In this present context, suppose we have a matrix A of order n and require to find its reciprocal. Then it is possible, using (1), so to choose, , etc. that Ao is transformed into A, when a last simple calculation gives  The method has many variants: we can build A column by column, or row by row, or column and row simultaneously. We give here what seems to be the simplest approach. We choose  (or possibly a scalar matrix ). Then, if  is the isolating row vector, we form  Here  is the first column of A except that the leading element  is diminished by 1; thus the first column of  is identical with that of A, while the (n — 1) remaining columns are those of I. By Theorem IX of 1.22  Next we evaluate (this step is not quite so simple)  so that  Here  is the second column of A but with the second element reduced by 1;  and  is the second element of  Further steps follow this  pattern and are obvious. We may, however, observe that (4) may be written  i.e. as the sum of  and a rank 1 matrix of which the rows are proportional to the second row of . Example 1 We choose the same numerical matrix as before (Equation (2.2.1.4)), viz:  so that    2.2.4 Triangulation We have already seen, in  that reciprocation of a triangular matrix can be achieved by a simple process of back-substitution. Accordingly, if we first reduce a matrix A to triangular form we can then proceed to determine its reciprocal. The usual reduction to triangular form is by a pivotal condensation similar to that described in 2.2.1, except that we only remove elements below the diagonal. We may best illustrate this with out usual example (see Table 1). What we have done is to keep  but use it to eliminate the leading elements of  and so on, reducing the number of rows by 1 at each step. We have now, in effect, achieved the equation    This has been obtained by triangulation without row interchange. If we now proceed to the process of back-substitution, this is in effect operating again with rows, and all it does is to compete the process which was done continuously in the pivotal condensation of 2.2.1. There is thus no advantage at all in he intermediate triangulation step. However, much attention has been given in the literature to inversion of triangular matrices by methods other than back-substitution, particularly iterative methods. We illustrate below one direct method. Triangulation has many important uses. When we reduce a matrix A to triangular form, we write it as . We may first note that the product of the diagonal elements of the leading matrix in (1) is evidently . If we divide each row through by its diagonal element,(1) becomes  The leading matrix here is of the form I + C, where C is null except for the elements above the diagonal. Now, provided  as r increases,  as may be checked by premultiplication by I + C. In this example   and on use of (3) we obtain from a single multiplication  Premultiplication of(2) by (4) yields finally  in agreement with results given earlier. 2.3 ITERATIVE METHODS These methods are well suited to computers and often have the advantage that, should an error occur, at worst it lengthens the computations a little. 2.3.1 Improvement of an approximate reciprocal This is an important topic; it often happens that an approximate reciprocal of a matrix A is known: perhaps from a rough calculation, or one in which an error has been made, or even that belonging to a neighbour matrix of A. Refinement of this approximate reciprocal is then required. The usual procedure is as follows. Let R be the exact reciprocal and  the approximation. Write  Then  Premultiply by  then since   Thus  is a new approximation to R, and we may repeat the cycle as required to obtain R, subject to convergence of the method. The conditions for this are readily established. From (2) we find.  and further steps give   and so on. Thus, provided  as r increases, the method will converge very rapidly. This will normally be the case of R1 is a reasonably good approximation, when the elements of  will be small. At each step the method requires the multiplication of two matrices such as AR1, the subtraction of the result from 2I, and then the second multiplication, e.g.  to obtain the next approximation. An alternative procedure which achieves the same result but is more convenient computationally is the following. Write  Then  Inversion of this and premultiplication of the result by R1 gives, provided  as r increases.  It is readily checked, in view of(3) et seq., that he product of the first two terms in (5) is R2, of the first three is R3, and so on . The number of matrix multiplications in this procedure is the same as before; but the squaring of  etc. is usually relatively easy since they become rapidly smaller in practice. Indeed, if, for example in (5),  and higher powers are sensibly null to the order of accuracy required, we can write  saving one multiplication. In practice, since the numbers in  and I become progressively and rapidly more disparate, it is better to deal with them separately; i.e. the operations in (5) are carried on as follows; we are given A and R1:(i) evaluate  (ii) evaluation …until to the order of accuracy required a power of E1 is sensibly null. (ii) evaluate  and add R 1 to get R 2 ,(iv) evaluate  and add  to get ,(v) evaluate  and add  to get , and so on. Normally, very few steps are needed. Example 1 Suppose we are given  Then A is the matrix of our previous examples, and R1 an approximate reciprocal, given to three places of decimals. It is required to find the reciprocal R of A, correct to six places of decimals. Then  where the figures are exact.  is thus exact to six decimal places, viz:  but  would require 12 decimal places. We retain only eight:  an to this order of accuracy  is null. Hence   Since  is null, we can apply (6), when  where we have retained eight decimal places. Finally, to six decimal places   2.3.1 General Iteration The most general iteration procedure appears to be the following. We require to solve RA = I for R. Write the known matrix A as A = B — C, where B is a matrix having a known (or easily found) reciprocal. Then the problem can be written  where we have written  There are various iterative methods for solving (2). For example, we may write it as  and use the regression formula  so that , for example , if Ro = 0, we should obtain  and so on . Evidently, these are successive steps in the solution of (2), which is valid of  as r increases.  A rather more rapid method is to write (5) as  For the simple reciprocation of a matrix A these methods hardly compete with pivotal condensation; however, they do have a place in the parallel problem of solution of linear algebraic equations. It must be stressed, however, that the choice of B must be such at  has eigenvalues with moduli all less than unity; Sylvester's expansion then shows that  as r increases. There are certain physical problems yielding matrices for which this can be guaranteed; but in general some trial and error is involved. It should be noted that (2) can be written alternatively as   leading to  It is important to observe that this general iteration procedure is really exactly the same as the method given in 2.3.1 for improvement of an approximate reciprocal. The first of Equations (4) shows that  is an approximate reciprocal, and then Equations (2.3.1.5) and (6) are the same, provided E1 and E are the same. Now, if B-1 is the same as R1,  so that the methods are effectively the same. This result shows that, although in (1) no restriction is placed on B, it must in practice be a reasonable approximation to  if the method is to converge. Example 1 We illustrate Equation (6) here. Let  Here we have chosen B as the lower triangular portion of A, and C is of course B — A. We are given that   To four places of decimals we now find  and to this order of accuracy,  is null. Then, successively (note that these are not the steps of (4)).  and  is in fact the exact reciprocal of A.  2.3.3 Special iteration procedures In Equation (2.3.2.1) the only restriction placed on B was that it should have a known or easily-found reciprocal. We now discuss two particular choices for B. (a) Seidel iteration. Here B is chosen to be the lower triangular part of A, including the diagonal, with all superdiagonal elements null. B is then reciprocated as in 1.9(8) an the methods of the last paragraph applied. The example given there is in fact an illustration of Seidel iteration. (b) Simple or diagonal iteration. Here B is chosen to be the diagonal matrix of the diagonal elements of A. Its reciprocal can therefore be written down. It is mostly used when A is a ""sparse"" matrix, with elements dominated by the diagonal; B-1 is then a reasonable approximation to R. If this is not the case, the method may not converge, or do so very slowly. For example, if we take the matrix A of the last example, an choose  then  This matrix has two real eigenvalues, 0.319 and 0.597, and a pair of complex eigenvalues of modulus 0.999. The powers of E therefore converge very slowly indeed. A better illustration follows. Example 1 Let   Then, if we retain eight decimal places  Hence, if  and so on, we find as successive approximations to  correct to six decimal places,  2.4. SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX Certain matrices have properties which make reciprocation rather easier than would otherwise be the case. We give a few examples. 2.4.1 Symmetric matrices The reciprocal R of a symmetric matrix is itself symmetric. For if A is symmetric and we transpose AR = I to get  then evidently  (see also 1.22, Theorem I, Corollary).   It follows that we do not need to compute all the  elements of R; n (n + 1) /2 elements, comprised in the diagonal and below, are all that are required. Example 1 We give in Table 1 a scheme for pivotal condensation of the matrix just examined in Example 2.3.3.1. For convenience, the reciprocal has been multiplied by 103; we work to six decimal places on the left, three on the right. If the last four rows of Table 1 are taken in reverse order, the required reciprocal is obtained. It is to be noted that the starred numbers in Table 1 do not need to be calculated, though it is convenient to write them down. Provided that appropriate proportions of  are subtracted from  as they stand to give zeros in the first column, the array of numbers on the left in  can be written down; when the rest of  is found, the third element of  can be inserted, and so on. Also, when  is reached, this gives the last row of R and hence also the last column, so that the eighth elements in  can be written down, and so on. However, in practice, the programming required to avoid these calculations could be more time-consuming than the straight pivotal condensation, when the symmetry of the final result gives a check on the calculations. The procedure in Table 1 also exemplifies triangulation without row interchange. The product of the underlines elements in the table gives . 2.4.2 Positive definite (symmetric) matrix The method to be described is usually attributed to Choleski. It is a simple matter, which we leave to the reader, to show that if A is real, symmetric and positive definite, then it can be written as the product BTB where B is real and triangular. Then if  and since B is triangular,  is readily found. We give a simple example. Example 1 Let  The leading element gives  (use of — 10 makes no difference). Then ab = 30, b = 3; ac = 10, c = 1; ad = -10, d = -1. Next  and so on. In this way it is quickly established that  Inversion of B as in 1.9(8) then yields  and then  It may be of interest to note that if x ={p, q, r, s}is any vector of real numbers, not all zero, then the quadratic form  may be written (see also 1.22, Theorem XIII)  where  so that, where the second term does not involve p, the third p, q, and the fourth p, q, r,  and is always positive under the conditions given. If A is not pos. def., the elements of B are in general complex. 2.4.3 Persymmetric matrix The reciprocal of a persymmetric matrix is not in general also persymmetric; e.g.   A persymmetric matrix can be treated as symmetric for the purpose of reciprocation, but otherwise it is not special. 2.4.4 Centrosymmetric matrix We shall consider here only matrices of even order; the odd-order case is quite straightforward, but is algebraically more complicated. A centrosymmetric matrix A is characterise by A = JAJ, where J is the reversing matrix. Inversion of this gives  since J2 = I; the reciprocal of A is therefore also centrosymmetric, as are the integral powers of A. If A is of order 2m, it can be partitioned into four submatrices, each of order m, thus  other representations are possible, but this appears to be the most convenient. If (2) is premultiplied and postmultiplied by  the result is A as required. We can write the reciprocal of A as  and then the product of (2) and (3) yields (twice)  These may be solved if either P or Q is non-singular; we assume P-1 exists, and we write R for P-1Q. Then from (4) we obtain  The reciprocation of A may thus be effected through two reciprocations of order m, instead of the much more laborious single reciprocation of order 2m. Example 1 Consider  Then, in the above nomenclature  Accordingly,  A caution must be added: the method is not always viable. Thus, for example,  but this result cannot be obtained by use of (4) since by inspection the submatrices of order 2 are all singular. 2.5 LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS A set of linear algebraic equations (often called simultaneous equations) has the form Ax = p. Here A is, in general, a rectangular matrix of order m × n with given elements, p is a given column of m elements, and x a column of n unknowns; it is required to find x. Suppose first that . Then we have more equations than unknowns. If (1) is soluble, there must be n independent equations; if these are written first, we can partition (1) in the form  where B is square and non-singular. Then  If s does not satisfy (2) the set of equations is inconsistent, and (1) does not have a valid solution. If, however, the equations are consistent, then the solution (2) for x uses only n of them; the remainder are superfluous. Now let. In this case, we have fewer equations than unknowns; we now partition (1) in the form (B, C){y, z}= p, where B is square, of order m, and y is a column of m quantities. We now obtain the partial solution for x  in which we determine m of the unknowns x in terms of B, C, p and the remaining m — n unknowns z. This is the parametric solution of 1.10. Example 1  Consider  as partitioned, the solution is (see (2))  and  so that the equations are consistent; if they are taken any two at a time, the three cases all yield the same answer. However, had the last element in p been other than 4, the three pairs of equations would have given three different answers. Example 2 . Here, a simple example is  which yields  In Examples 1 and 2 the main numerical problem is the solution of BX = r, By = p — Cz, where B is square. We now confine our attention to the case where A is square and non-singular; this is obviously germane to the above solutions. 2.5.1 Direct Method Our problem is to solve Ax = p, for x; here A is a given square and non-singular matrix of order n, p is a given column of n quantities, and x a column of n unknowns. Formally, the solution is obvious: x = A-1p. We can therefore obtain our solution by inverting, using any of the methods of 2.2, 2.3, and postmultiplying the inverse by p. In some problems we require to obtain x for each of a set of values for p; e.g. the elements of p may be functions of an independent variable, and we require x for each of a number of values of the variable. If this number is high — in particular if it exceeds n — then labour is saved by inverting A and using (2). If, on the other hand, the number is small, labour is saved as follows. We use the approach of 2.2.1; but instead of operating on (2.2.1.1) with the matrices Mi, we operate directly on (1). Evidently, we then progressively approach the solution (2). The computations, by simple operations on rows, are effected in exactly the same way. Indeed, reciprocation is really only the solution of a particular set of linear algebraic equations, in which the vectors p are successively  For a single set, in pace of e1 we use the single vector p. Example 1 Suppose we require to solve   The square matrix used here is that employed for the Examples of 2.2; we choose diagonal pivoting without row interchange. The working of the left-hand array is thus identical with that of Example 2.2.2.1. See Table 1. The last four figures in the right-hand array are given correct to three decimal places and are in fact the exact solution. 2.5.2 Iterative methods We exemplify the general iteration procedure of 2.3.2; we write B — C for A, where the reciprocal of B is known or easily obtained. Then Equation (2.5.1.1) can be written  so that, if F is written for B-1C, the solution is given by  say. As before, this may be developed in either of two ways, provided  as r increases: x = q + Fx, suggesting the regression formula  or  Though the computations may be different, these two formulae are equivalent; for if xo = 0 the regression formula gives  and so on. We illustrate (3) below. Example 1 It is required to solve  The square matrix has been used in Example 2.3.2.1. We again choose B to be A except that the elements to the right of the principal diagonal are all zero: then, as before     Note that here F = B-1C: in the previous example, E = CB-1. We now construct the iteration table (see Table 1), beginning with x1 = q and applying (3). Since, in view of the fact that F has two null columns, the first two elements of x are always multiplied by zeros, it is not necessary to compute them until the iterations are complete. At the beginning of the iteration, we have retained only two decimal places: later three, then four, until to this order of accuracy the iteration repeats. Finally, the first two elements are computed, when the last column (here x10) is the solution required. It may be observed that equations of the form x = q + Fx arise naturally in some dynamical or quasi-static problems, e.g. the distortion of a structure under applied load, when the load is varied by the distortion. 2.5.3 Choleski's method for positive definite matrices Let us now suppose that in 2.5.1 A is pos. def. Then as in 2.4.2 we can write A as  where B is triangular. The equations for solution are now  Write y for Bx; then (1) can be solved in two steps:  and then Bx = y for x. It may be noted that a set of equations Ax = p, where A is general, may be cast in the above form by premultiplication by AT:  However, this does not appear to offer any computational advantage. Resolution of  into  implies A = CB where C is an orthogonal matrix, so that . Again, however, this does not appear to offer any worthwhile computational short-cut. Example 1 Suppose we wish to solve  As in 2.4.2, we can quickly resolve the square matrix into  A self-explanatory scheme for computation is shown in Table 1. Here BT, p are written at the head of the left-hand array; by obvious row combinations we find y at the bottom. This and B are inserted at the top of the right-hand array, when again obvious row combinations give the required solution at the bottom right: in summary   2.5.4 Least squares In 2.5 we noted that if we have more equations than unknowns, the equations must be consistent, or a unique solution does not exist. Nevertheless, especially in experimental work, cases often arise where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns. For example, suppose we have a measurable quantity f which we have reason to suppose is a polynomial function of an independent variable t:  and we wish to find the m coefficients . Measurement of f at each of m values of t would provide m equations for the m unknowns; however, since f is measured and so is inexact, it may be thought better to measure f at n values of t, where  in order to minimise the effects of experimental error. How do we proceed to find optimum values of the coefficients ? The ""least squares"" solution of this problem is due to Gauss. Let the n equation in m unknowns  be written Ax -p = e, where A is of the order (n × m), x is the column of m unknowns , p is the column of n measures values of f, and e is a column of n errors. We are given A and p; e will vary with x. Gauss' proposition is that x will have its optimum value when the sum of the squares of the errors, ie.e  is a minimum. Now  and for this to be a minimum, its differential with respect to x (see 1.11) must vanish; i.e.  which is our original set of Equations (2) with e = 0, premultiplied by AT; it gives m equations for the m unknowns. Example 1 Suppose we expect the relation (1) to be  and suppose further that we have the following experimental table:   Then in view of(5) our equations for solutions may be written  Before we proceed to the least squares solution, let us see what results would be obtained if we solved these equations three at a time, with e taken to be zero for each set of three. We should get  These are all very different. Moreover, if we adopted the first solution and applied it throughout, e would become (the first three elements have been assumed zero)  which is clearly quite unacceptable for the later measurements. However, if we premultiply (6) by AT as in (4) we get  and the solution, by inspection, is x ={1, -2,1}, i.e.  If we now return to (6) and use this solution, we find  which compares very favourably with the result given earlier.  2.5.5 Least squares: weighted errors In the basic Gaussian method just described, it has been tacitly assumed that  all errors are equally likely. The method is readily adapted, however, to cases where some weighting of errors is desirable: it is merely a case of premultiplying (2.5.4.2) by an appropriate diagonal matrix. Example 1 Suppose we wish to put a straight line  through the following set of experimental points:  Suppose further that, in view of the experimental method, we may expect errors in f to be proportional to t. Let us first examine the straight Gaussian solution. The equations can clearly be written  Premultiplication by AT yields  so that the optimum lime, if all errors are equally likely, is f = 0.57t + 1.80. However, we are given that errors are likely to be proportional to t. To make them equally likely, we must multiply the first of Equations (1), at t = 1, by 6; the second, at t = 2, by 3; the third, at t = 3, by 2, etc; i.e. we premultiply (1) by Diag(6,3,2,1,5,1,2,1). The result is   and premultiplication of this by  yields  to two decimal places. Hence in this case, the optimum line is f = 0.50t + 2.01. For comparison, the errors e in the two solutions (2) and (3) are (the lines intersect at t =3)  and it is clear that in the second case the errors increase markedly with t, as required. II: EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS 2.6 THE CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION The n eigenvalues of a square matrix A = (Aij) of order n are given (see 1.16) by the roots of the characteristic equation  which, in expanded form, can be written  In theory, therefore, the calculation of the eigenvalues of A is straightforward: we form the characteristic determinant in (1), expand it to the form (2), and solve this by any suitable means to obtain . Having obtained the eigenvalues, can readily find the corresponding eigenvectors. If r is a known eigenvalue (which we assume here to be unrepeated) and  the corresponding column and row eigenvectors respectively, then   Since  are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we can in each vector make a suitable element unity; then Equations (3) provide in each case n linear algebraic equations for the (n — 1) unknown elements: one equation is superfluous, or can be used as a check. For example, if we make the last element of  unity, and partition () to isolate its last column and row, we can write (3) as  which give  Equations (5) can be solved by any of the methods of 2.5 (the second would be transposed to , and then  Unfortunately, so far as the expansion of (1) to (2) is concerned, theory and practice are at odds. With  general, the labour involved in the expansion is quite prohibitive even for small values of n, and indirect methods are always used in practice. We describe two such methods below; first, however, we observe that, in (2), we can readily obtain the two coefficients p1, pn, since (see 1.22, Theorem II, III)  The evaluation of a numerical determinant, even of high order, is very quickly accomplished on any modern computer by reduction to triangular form; thus we can find p1 and pn without difficulty. It remains, however, to find p2, p3,…, pn-1. 2.6.1 Location method In Equation (2.6.1) we arbitrarily assign (n — 2) different values to  (other than  = 0, which we have in effect used to determine pn) and then evaluate the (numerical) determinant for each of these. We then obtain n — 2 linear algebraic equations for the n — 2 unknowns pi. A caution should be added: most the arbitrary values of  should preferably lie among the zeros of  (; otherwise inordinately high accuracy may be needed. At this stage, the zeros of  () are now known, but their approximate locations may often be inferred from their sum and product as given by (2.6.6) and (2.6.7). Example 1 Let  The sum of the eigenvalues is thus  and their product 3906.25 (=p4). Their arithmetic mean is thus about 11 an the fourth root of  about 8. These suggest that we might use  = 20,  = 10 in (2.6.1); we have already used  = 0 to obtain . It is readily found, by condensing the numerical determinants,  Now we know that  or  Insertion of  = 20,  = 10 in (3) together with the numerical values of  (gl}) from (2) yields the two equations  which give p2 = 606.25, p3 = 2812.5. Hence  on factorisation. The eigenvalues of A are thus 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5. We illustrate the calculation of the eigenvector  corresponding to the eigenvalue 12.5. Then   giving  of which the solution is (any method from 2.5 may be used)  and it is readily checked that these also satisfy the fourth equation. 2.6.2 Iteration method In view of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, A satisfies its own characteristic equation; i.e.  Postmultiply this by any arbitrary column co and write . Then a computer will rapidly evaluate the successive products  and so on. Accordingly (1) yields  This provided n linear algebraic equations for the n unknowns pi. As before, we can find  independently if we so wish. It must be added, however, that this method is not suitable when n is large. As we shall see later, the columns ci usually tend to proportionality as i increases, so that Equations (2) become increasingly ill-conditioned; also the numbers involved can assume widely different magnitudes. Example 1 We use the matrix A of (2.6.1.1) with co = e4. It is found that successive columns ci are then   Accordingly,(2) can be written  in agreement with (2.6.1.4). With the particular choice of co, p4 enters into the last equation only. Accordingly, if we calculate p1, p4 from the trace and determinant of A, we can discard the last equation and substitute for p1 in the remainder, when (3) reduces to  Any two of these (consistent) equations give p2, p3 their values in (4). 2.7 POWER METHODS The most commonly used device for finding the eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix A is the power method, or one of its many variants, in which A is effectively raised to a high power. We illustrate some aspects of the basic principle. 2.7.1 A dominant eigenvalue Sylvester's expansion for A is (see 1.18), in its simplest form,  and in view of the properties of the constituent matrices ,  Since the order of the terms on the right is immaterial, there is no loss of generality i supposing1 to be the eigenvalue of greatest modulus. If for the moment we assume it to be real and unrepeated, then all other eigenvalues have smaller moduli. Thus if r is increased sufficiently, say to a value s, the first term on the right of (2) dominates the rest, which become relatively insignificant. Then, in the limit,  By use of (3) we thus find both 1 and . We could in theory find them from As only, since , but there is a practical difficulty. Unless the  modulus of 1 is close to unity, the numbers appearing in Ar (r large) are either inordinately large or small; in practice therefore it is usual to find not Ar but a matrix proportional to it: at each stage in the power evaluation, a homologous element is reduced to unity. Example 1 Let A be the matrix in Equation (2.6.1.1). Then, if we reduce the bottom right-hand element to unity, we have  We now evaluate B2 and divide through by the bottom right-hand element to obtain  Evaluation of F2/2.4997 repeats F except for occasional small differences in the fourth decimal place. Now, if we round off to three decimal places, we find that F can be written as the unit rank matrix, proportional to    If we now revert to A and postmultiply by   Thus, 1 = 25. Also, the inner product  is  so that normalising to make  unity: Note that  so that A has been raised fairly rapidly to a high power. An alternative. There is, however, an alternative device which is in practice more commonly used; this is repeated premultiplication by A of an arbitrary column  as in 2.6.2. We successively evaluate  etc. If we postmultiply (2) by co and write  (ki is of course a scalar) we obtain  Accordingly, provided that co is not such that k1 () vanishes, the first term on the right dominates the rest as r increases, until in the limit when r = s  Example 2 We exemplify this using the same matrix A as above; also, we adopt the device of reducing at each stage a homologous element (in this case the bottom element) to unity, beginning with co = e4. The first step is  Proceeding in this way, we find successive columns as in Table 1. Also given are the dividing factors at each step. Since c16 repeats c15, they give x1; also the dividing factor 25 is 1. To complete the solution, we now require to find ; this could be done by repeating the iterative procedure, evaluating , where  is an arbitrary row, or more usually, by the device given in (2.6.4), viz:  giving  We leave it to the reader to show that in this example,(7) leads to  or to a scalar multiple of it. We normalise  in the usual way. We may note in passing that (as they should) the columns  and  of Table 1 agree with the last columns of B, C, D, E, F (subject to rounding-off errors in the last place of decimals). This leads naturally to a comparison of the two methods. There are two reasons why the second method is commonly used. First, if an error (even of rounding-off only) is made during the successive squaring process, it is multiplied by itself   subsequently, an persists through the calculations; in the second method, if an error is made in calculating ci, this only amounts to choosing a new arbitrary column, an at worst may prolong the calculations. But, mainly, the first method usually involves more work than the second. It is difficult to quantify ""work"" exactly, but if the number of individual multiplications is taken as a guide, then, if A is of order n, each of the n2 elements of  involves n multiplications: i.e. n3 in all. If r squaring processes are needed, we perform rn3 multiplications, yielding , r must be an integer. In the column process, each step involves n2 multiplications; hence, to reach the same accuracy, between  and  multiplications are needed. Now, provided the eigenvalues are reasonably separated, column iterations usually number between 15 and 50. Suppose, in a particular case, 25 are required. Then the ""work"" is measured as  From Table 2, r must be 5, with the work measure for squaring 5n3. The ratio is n/5; so if  the work involved in squaring is greater. If, say, n is 100, the work is 20 times greater.  2.7.2 Subdominant eigenvalues: deflation Again, for the moment we assume the eigenvalues of A to be real and unrepeated; and we assume that in (2.7.1.1) they appear in descending order of modulus. If, as in 2.7.1 we have found , then Equation (2.7.1.1) can be written  The known matrix on the left now has all the eigenvalues and vectors of A except the first set, and it can be treated as in 2.7.1. The process of reducing A in this way is known as ""deflation"" . Evidently the eigenvalue 1 has been replaced by zero, so that A1 is singular. Having evaluated A1, we can again apply column iteration. However, we need not begin with an arbitrary column; we can readily find an appropriate column to begin with, which avoids many iteration steps. An example will make this clear. Example 1 We continue Example 2.7.1.1. The iterations have shown that 1 = 25, while x1 is proportional to{ 1,2,3,5}and  to (1,7,5,4). Normalising these, we find   Note that  vanishes when premultiplied by . We now revert to the iterations for 1 an observe that, for example, c9 of Table 2.7.1.1 is mostly composed of x1. The remainder will clearly be mostly . Since x1 is orthogonal to , the part of c9 due to x1 will disappear when it is premultiplied by A1 (see 1))). Thus we find  and dividing by the last element, we find as a starting column co for iteration with A1   The iterations give us successive columns as in Table 1. Column c9 repeats c8, so that 2 = 12.5 and  is proportional to{ -0.5, = -0.5,0,1}. As before, we now find that  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising, we find  We proceed to the third eigenvalue; we further deflate A by subtracting the unit rank matrix (3) from A1:  Note that  = 7.5, while  is in fact doubly degenerate; it vanishes when premultiplied by  or . As before, we choose a column from Table 1 — say c3 ={-0.4978, -0.4992, -0.0015,1}— and apply it as a postmultiplier to . The result is a column proportional to{ 0.981, 0.0095,— 1.0095, 1}. We leave it to the reader to show that this leads rapidly to 3 = 5 with x3 proportional to{ 1,0,— 1,1}an that  is then found to be proportional to (27, -11, -15.8). We normalise this to obtain  an now further deflate A to obtain A3; in this case, as will be seen, no iteration is required to obtain a solution:   In obtaining the last form of(5) we have noted (a) that ; since the other three eigenvalues have been replaced by zeros, 4 = 2.5;(b) A3 is, by inspection, of unit rank an so, with 4 extracted, can be written in the form (5). This completes the solution. With the four terms of the Sylvester expansion now given numerically in (2),(3),(4) and (5), the whole solution can be expressed compendiously as  2.7.3 Subdominant eigenvalues: sweeping Although the delation procedure discussed in 2.7.2 is the most straightforward possible method, other devices are often useful and sometimes preferable. We now discuss ""sweeping"" , which takes two forms. (i) First method Instead of operating with a deflated matrix, we operate on the original matrix A (or a part of it) with a column vector from which all contributions from x1 have been ""swept"" away. This is valuable, for example, when (as is often the case in dynamical problems) A is sparse. Deflation destroys this characteristic; the sweeping method under discussion does not. With r = 0, Equation (2.7.1.5) becomes  Hence if we choose co to make k1 zero, it will contain no contribution from x1, and, as r increases sufficiently to a value s,(2.7.1.5) will tend to  The condition  means that we can express one element of co in terms of the remaining n — 1. In theory, if co is chosen in this way, the iterations will in due course yield (2) without further attention. In practice, rounding-off errors soon produces inaccuracies which re-introduce small  proportions of x1, which tend to grow relatively rapidly. It is therefore best to apply the criterion  at each step; i.e. to calculate one element of cr from this criterion when the others have been found. This means that we can ignore one row of A; we exemplify this below. As before, we need not be completely arbitrary i our choice of co (though it must satisfy ) from (1), a column free of x1 is  with co arbitrary. But we can with advantage choose co to be a column in the previous iteration to find1 etc.: this will contain mostly x1, some , but little else; then  eliminates the contribution from x1. Example 1 We use the same example as before, restating for convenience what we have already found.  Note that  have been normalised to give . Now any postmultiplying column say{ a, b, c, 1}, must satisfy  In performing our iterations, therefore, we may ignore completely the first row of A; we use the last three rows to find the corresponding elements in a column, and then apply(3) to find the top element. For our initial column co, we again choose the column c9 from Table 2.7.1.1, in the iteration to find 1 etc.; thus for our present purpose  Then  and  As it should, this column vanishes when premultiplied by . We divide throughout by the last element to obtain as our new starting column  then the iterations, using (3) at each step, begin   We postmultiply A (ignoring its top row) by the column (4) to get the column of three numbers on the right; divide by the last element to get the bottom three elements in the next column, and find the top element from (3). In this way, we obtain the successive columns and dividing factors in Table 1. Thus we find . As before, knowing 2, we find  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising:  The same principle serves for the third root. If cr ={a, b, c, 1}then  and  must both vanish; we find   If we select c3 from Table 1 as our new co, it already excludes x1, so that  will also exclude . This is  If this is written{ 0.9333,0.0333,— 1.0333,1}, it satisfies (6). We now iterate on A, but ignore the first two rows:  We leave it to the reader to show that this converges quickly to 3 = 5, x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. In the usual way,  is found to be proportional to{ 27, -11, -15.8}. Normalising:  As before, no iteration is needed for the completion of the solution. If we choose the last column above (which excludes x1 and ) as a new co, then a column which also excludes x3 is  Since x1, , x3 are excluded, this column is proportional to x4. Premultiplication by a row of A gives 4 = 2.5; completion of the solution is straightforward. (ii) Second method Instead of sweeping our iterated columns at each step, we can do it one for all with the aid of a ""sweeping matrix"" . In view of(3) we may write  If (8) is used as postmultiplier of A, it is clear that A is deflated by the sweeping matrix in (8) to   (note that A1 here differs from the deflated form A1 of 2.7.2). If A is of simple form (e.g. sparse) this characteristic may be partly or wholly destroyed in forming A1; on the other hand, A1 has a column of zeros, and thus its own simplicity. This means also that the umber of the head of a column iteration is always multiplied by zero, an so need not be calculated till the final step. We are thus effectively operating with the third-order submatrix of A1 when its first row and column are omitted. As before, we may find a suitable initial column such as(4). We then perform the iteration, omitting the first element of (4):  The numbers produced in this way reproduced exactly those of the last three elements in the columns of Table 1, as well as the dividing factors; they are of course exactly the same calculations, but with the matrices associated differently. At the conclusion, the top element of the final column is found by use of the first row of A1. We must emphasise, however, that the row vectors A1 are not , . Hence, when 2 has been found, we revert to A itself to find . For the next root, we use another sweeping matrix based on the second part of (5):   If this square matrix is used to postmultiply A1 we find  We now iterate on the submatrix  to determine the last two elements of x3; we leave the completion of the solution to the reader., 2.7.4 Shifting and inverse iteration Theorem IV of 1.22 noted that, in view of the identity  addition of a quantity{ ge}to each of the diagonal elements of A implies the addition of{ ge}to each of the eigenvalues of A. We note here, additionally, that the constituent matrices zii of A are unaltered by such a change. Sylvester's expansion gives (see 1.18)  whence  The device of adding{ ge}in this way is known as ""shifting"" , and has a variety of uses. For example, with hindsight, we know that the eigenvalues of A in (2.6.1.1) are 25, 12.5, 5 and 2.5. the rapidity of convergence of the initial power solution depends principally on the relative separation of the eigenvalues 25 and 12.5, i.e. 2:1. If we reduce all eigenvalues by 7.5, they become 17.5, 5,— 2.5,— 5 and the relative separation is 31/2:1 which yields much quicker convergence. Note that this is the optimum: the second and fourth eigenvalues now have equal moduli. To select the optimum requires accurate knowledge of the eigenvalues, which at the outset of a calculation is of course not available; but if one has a general idea of the disposition of the eigenvalues, shifting can save much time. The principle use of shifting, however, lies in inverse iteration. Suppose, for example, that the matrix A is the system matrix of a vibrating mechanical system, and suppose further that this system is excited by a  forcing vibration of frequency corresponding to  = . It is desired to determine the eigenvalue (and its vectors) nearest to  in order to study the response. To approach this problem, we first note that Sylvester's expansion for negative powers of a matrix B gives  It follows that the eigenvalue of B with the smallest modulus now becomes the eigenvalue of B-1 with largest modulus. Hence, to solve our problem, we first evaluate B = A — the eigenvalue of A nearest to  now becomes the eigenvalue of B nearest zero, i.e. of smallest modulus. (Note that A, B and B-1 all have the same constituent matrices zii.) We therefore invert B and iterate on B-1 as usual to obtain our solution. Example 1 Once more we choose the matrix A defined in (2.6.1.1) and used in previous examples. We also let  = 5.5. Then  If we invert this, e.g. by the methods of 2.2, we obtain  We postmultiply this by an arbitrary column co: here we choose co = e1 and iterate as usual. The successive columns are given in Table 1. The iterations converge rapidly to x ={1,0,— 1,1}with the eigenvalue of B-1 equal to -2. Hence the eigenvalue of B is — 0.5 an of A is 5.5 — 0.5 = 5, in accordance with results obtained earlier for 3 and x3. Note that, since the eigenvalues of A are in fact 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5, those of B are 19.5, 7,— 0.5,— 8, and of B-1 therefore 0.0513, 0.1429,— 2,— 0.124. The relative separation of the two roots of largest moduli is here 14:1. Clearly, the method is not restricted to mechanical systems: by its means we can study the eigenvalues and vectors of any matrix A which lie near any given value o of .  2.7.5 Confluent eigenvalues So far, we have restricted our attention to unrepeated real roots of the characteristic equation belonging to a matrix A; we now consider the case of two equal real roots. Multiple roots are in practice very rate (except perhaps for mechanical systems moving freely in space, when multiple zero roots can occur: but these have a special simplicity). The treatment for two roots is readily extended to the multiple case if required: even for two roots, however, we require to examine two cases (see 1.21). We assume the roots to have dominant moduli, any roots of greater modulus having been removed by deflation etc. (i) Characteristic matrix doubly degenerate When a repeated eigenvalue 1 makes the characteristic matrix doubly degenerate, we know (see (1.21.14)) that the Sylvester expansion of the system matrix A is  It follows that we can use the power method to find 1; postmultiplication by co gives in the limit, when r is sufficiently large, say s,  We thus find 1 without difficulty; but the determination of z11 + z22 requires further consideration. Now   and  is thus, in general a linear combination of 1, . At this point, the iteration has given no indication that a double root is involved; however, this becomes apparent when we seek the row vector corresponding to cs: for all first minors of 1I — A vanish and we cannot find a unique row vector. To proceed, it is simplest to generalise (2.6.4) by partitioning off the last two rows and columns of 1I — A, thus:  Here  is a square submatrix of order  of order 2;  has two columns and  has two rows. Then  These algebraic equations are solved for ; we now have two independent columns  which annihilate 1I — A when used as postmultipliers; and correspondingly for the rows . We now normalise them; we evaluate  Then m is a square matrix of order 2 and, for example,  are normalised rows and columns. Finally  Note that only the sum  is unique. If they are individually expressed as  and  then their sum can be written  where M is an arbitrary non-singular matrix of order 2. This replaces x1,  with two different linear combinations (x1, ) M of them, with corresponding changes for . It will be observed that in this approach we have not used cs (which we have already found); its introduction would spoil the simplicity of (2). When x1,  have been found, it is possible to check that cs is a linear combination of them., Example 1 Consider the matrix   It is assumed that at this stage we have no knowledge of its eigenvalues. If we choose  and iterate in the usual way, we find quite quickly that  Normally, we would choose  However, if we attempt to use (2.6.4) to find , it at once emerges that all first minors of 1I- A vanish, indicating that 1 = 12.5 is a repeated root. We therefore apply (2) with  This gives for the solution of (2)  Since the columns and rows are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we may now write  (for simplicity of exposition we have multiplied the first column on the right by 3). The product of the numerical matrices in (8), in that order, is (see (3))  If we premultiply  we ca finally write  These enable us to choose, if they are required,  but, following (5), we could equally well use any two different linear combinations o x1, , represented by (x1, ) M provided these are associated with ., /div4. (ii) Characteristic matrix simply degenerate This case is rather more difficult: the difficulty derives from the appearance of a unit in the superdiagonal of the spectral matrix of the given matrix A. For simplicity of exposition we assume here that A is of order 4: extension to larger matrices is obvious. We know (see 1.21) that ,  so that  on expansion of the triple product. We know further that, in view of the properties of the constituent matrices zij,  When  is absent, this reverts to the simpler case dealt with under (i). Our task now is, given A, to resolve it numerically into one of the forms (12), i.e. to find 1 etc. Sine, a priori, we do not know the nature of A, we should approach this task as usual by iteration with A on an arbitrary column co. If we write  then postmultiplication of (13) by co yields  When the iterations have proceeded so far, say when r = s, that contributions from 3, 4 are insignificant and may be neglected, then   Previously, with  absent, at this stage  equalled . Now, owing to the last term, this is no longer true and successive columns tend to show a near arithmetical progression in their elements. It is true that, when s is very large  the columns tend ultimately to x1 (last term in cs dominant), but the number of iterations required is very large. However, in place of the simple  we can drive from (15) the relation  In practice, therefore, if convergence seems very slow, we evaluate three successive columns fully, omitting the reduction of a homologous element to unity, and solve the quadratic  for at least two homologous elements. If they have a common root, we test the remaining quadratics to see if they are satisfied by this common root. If they re, then the root is 1 and the iterations have proceeded far enough (r = s) for only terms in 1 to remain. Knowing 1 we use (15) to evaluate  giving us a column proportional to x1. Knowing 1, we now form the matrix 1I — A; if we put r = 0,1 in (13), multiply the first by 1 and then subtract the second:  Premultiplication of this by , or postmultiplication by x1, annihilates it; none of the other vectors does so: the matrix is rendered simply degenerate by the presence of z12. We may, however, use (2.6.4) to find , we then known 1 and  subject to scalar multipliers. To find  we revert to (11), which yield, inter alia,  or  Since 1I — A is simply degenerate, the last equations provide, in general , n — 1 independent linear equations for  (and ). However, one element in each of these vectors may be assigned arbitrarily. For, since (1I — A) x1 vanishes, the equation for  is also satisfied by , where q is arbitrary; so, for example, if we choose a non-zero element in , the homologous element in  may be made zero by appropriate choice of 1. Similar considerations apply for . We are thus able to solve (19) for  and . Having done this, we now require to normalise: we evaluate  and we may then choose our vectors as, for example, ,  and the pair  which we now call . We have now obtained 1 the vectors  and , and the auxiliary vectors  and ; we are therefore in a position to deflate A (see (12)) by removing all contributions from these quantities. The solution is then completed in the usual way. Example 2 We require to find the modal and spectral matrices of  We begin by iterating on co. If we choose co = e4, then after about 18 steps, four successive columns are  These show very slow convergence; indeed, the elements show a near-arithmetical progression. We therefore choose, say, the first of these columns and without reducing the last element to unity, calculate the next two columns:  We choose, say, the first and last elements of these and solve   The common root 12.5 also satisfies the middle two quadratics; hence we find 1 = 12.5. We now use (17) and find{ 2.2875, 4.6875, 7.5, 13.125}— 12.5{ 0.165, 0.355, 0.57,1}={0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.625}and hence  may be taken as{ 1,2,3,5}. Using (21) we now evaluate  and it may be checked that postmultiplication by  gives a null product. We use (22) as in (2.6.4) to find , we leave the solution to the reader: it is found that  which when used to premultiply (22), annihilates it. We now proceed to find the auxiliary vectors. If we write  (the first element of  is nonzero, so that of  may be taken as zero) then we solve, using the appropriate submatrices (see(19))  The solution is . A similar calculation yields . We must now normalise these. We evaluate  Note that here, since the second row and first column of the product are necessarily orthogonal, m is triangular; also in this case it happens that m-1 = m. Accordingly, we may choose to retain the columns  and to adopt the rows, orthogonal to , ,   We are now able to evaluate  and  We can now deflate A (see (21)) to  Note that trA1 = 7.5; also A1 is doubly degenerate, being annihilated by postmultiplication by both  and . Iteration with A1 on co = e4 produces quite quickly the simple eigenvalue 3 = 5 and vector x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. We then evaluate 5I — A1 and employ (2.6.4) to obtain . Normalising this with x3, we obtain  and we are now able to deflate A further to   Since  and  is the only remaining eigenvalue,  and  can be written  which completes the solution. The results may be expressed compendiously as  The numbers are not of course unique. We could, for example, divide x4 by any factor f provided we multiply  by f. However, if for example we divide  by 10 and multiply  by 10, we must replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by 10. 2.7.6 Conjugate complex eigenvalues and vectors of a real matrix So far, we have restricted our studies to real eigenvalues. However, complex eigenvalues and vectors are of frequent occurrence , and require special consideration. First, if the matrix is real, then its characteristic equation must have real coefficients. Hence, if it is satisfied by , then it will also be satisfied by ; complex eigenvalues of a real matrix therefore occur in conjugate pairs. In a similar way, if the eigenvector corresponding to  is , then the relation  implies the conjugate relation; hence p — iq is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue  Evidently, the vector in (1) is arbitrary to a scalar complex multiplier, say  +  another vector satisfying (1) is thus  Any arbitrary linear combination of p and q may therefore be taken as the real part of the vector, with a corresponding combination for the imaginary part. If we expand (1) we obtain successively  If we eliminate q we find   The same equation is satisfied by q. This suggests that the square matrix in it is doubly degenerate and that p, q can each have two arbitrary elements; but this is not so. When  p are known, q is uniquely related to p by  in which  is not singular. What is said above gives a background to what follows. We assume once more than  have dominant moduli, any eigenvalues of greater moduli having been removed by deflation etc. Again, a priori, we assume nothing is known of the nature of A, so that the process of finding the dominant eigenvalue and its vector is approached as usual by iterating with A on an arbitrary column co. Once again, for simplicity, we assume A to be of order 4. The Sylvester expansion of A gives  Accordingly, if we perform the usual iteration on co and continue until, with r = s, terms in 3 and 4 are negligible.  where  is a complex scalar. Now, as we have seen (p + iq) is arbitrary to a complex scalar multiplier (and p — iq similarly). We are therefore at liberty to choose  and then  Elimination of p, 1 from these three equations yields  Note that, since  this is precisely the same as Equation (3); however, in the iteration case, it is only true when the iterations have proceeded sufficiently far for the terms in 3, 4 to disappear, when cs consists only of p. Now in practice, with a pair of complex eigenvalues, the elements in  tend to change sign periodically: there is no point in reducing a homologous element to unity, since there is no convergence to a settled form. When  behave in this way, conjugate complex eigenvalues must be suspected; and then three consecutive columns must be periodically tested to see whether various pairs of  homologous elements give consistent values for . When this happens, the iteration has gone far enough, and we can take p = cs, when q is determined from the second of equations (6), which is in fact the same as (4). We now know{ gm},{go}p and q. Finding  is not so straightforward. Knowing  we can either(i)Solve  with one element of  arbitrarily assigned. We then have to solve a set of linear algebraic equations with complex coefficients;(ii) Iterate with A postmultiplying an arbitrary row ; this will lead to  (and  again) as for p, q. (iii) Solve the equations which parallel (3) and(4):  Since  are known, this, like (ii), involves only real numbers; on the other hand, it requires , the evaluation of which requires considerable computer time if the order of A is large. On the whole, since most modern computers can work with complex numbers,(i) seems the most straightforward. When we have obtained  we can perform a check, which is in any event needed when the vectors are normalised. For since  belong to different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal, and  so that  For the process of normalisation, we require to evaluate  and m is evidently diagonal; in view of the check equations (9) it can be written  the determinant of which is , so its reciprocal is readily written down and we can obtain normalised forms of . We can now deflate A. Since  a deflated matrix A1 is  We can therefore use A1 to obtain the remaining eigenvalues and vectors of A in the usual way. Example 1 Let  If we use this for iterative premultiplication of an arbitrary column, say the summing vector, successive columns are as show in Table 1.  It is apparent from the first that the vector elements are changing sign; so we do not reduce a homologous element to unity (though in general we might periodically remove a power of 10). If, starting say at c5, we test to see if pairs of homologous elements give consistent values for ,  in (7), we find  this is not so. However,  give nearly consistent values; we therefore begin with  accurately:  If these three columns are used in (7) then any two pairs of homologous elements give . We thus obtain  Also, we may now choose  and using the second of Equations (6) we now find  We now have to find , and for this we use (8). One element of  can be arbitrarily assigned: here we assign the value 1 to the third element and solve  which, if we omit one column (e.g. the last) from the square matrix, gives  We omit the details of solution; the answer is   Note that  Accordingly,  and if we postmultiply p + iq as given by (14) and (15) my m-1 we obtain as our normalised p, q,  We are now able to deflate A. Equation (11) becomes, with A given by (12) and use of (13),(14),(15) and (16),  A1 is, in fact, doubly degenerate; it is annihilated by both the columns immediately above it. iteration with A1 on an arbitrary column quickly leads to the result  Further delation leads at once to  which completes the solution. 2.7.7 Adjacent eigenvalues: Two eigenvalues with nearly-equal moduli When two eigenvalues have nearly-equal moduli, it is obvious that very many iterations will be required for a direct solution. The following device can be helpful in this case. Suppose the iterations have proceeded so far that only contributions from the two nearly-equal eigenvalues remain. Then we can write, when a homologous element is not made unity,  Here a, b, c, d; p, q are the values of a homologous element in the various columns; a, b, c, d are known. Elimination of p, q, yields two equations which may be solved for 1 + 2 and 12:  Hence, ,  are readily found. When they are known, then  which follow from the first two of Equations (1). When 1, 2 are very close, both numerator and denominator in (2) tend to be small differences, so that accurate calculation of a, b, c, d is desirable. In practice, iteration in this case behaves rather like that for a defective matrix (2.7.5), in that convergence is slow and successive columns tend to a quasi-arithmetic progression of the elements. The occurrence of nearly-equal roots is more common than that of a defective matrix; hence tests to see whether homologous elements yield, in (2), consistent results should be applied first when convergence is slow.   Example 1  Iteration on a column, beginning with co = e4, yields successive columns as given in Table 1. At this stage, we make consecutive accurate calculations, to see if we can get consistent values for :  Using the elements of the last line in (2) we obtain  The elements of the first line give  The results are consistent, as indeed are the results from the second and third lines. By inspection (or from the implied quadratic)  We now evaluate the eigenvectors:  so that we may take  I now remains to find the corresponding row vectors and to deflate A for  further study; we leave this to the reader. However, we may note here that  whence . 2.7.8 Applicability of power methods We have seen that the power method can be used to obtain dominant eigenvalues and the associated vectors, and, by deflation, sweeng, shifting and inverse iteration, can also be used to find all non-dominant eigenvalues and their vectors; the results are obtained seriatim. This implies that, if one is interested only in a limited number of eigenvalues, the power method is the obvious choice. For example, suppose we have a mathematical model with n = 100 for study of the vibration characteristics of an aircraft. The aeroelastic engineer will usually be interested only in the fundamental mode of vibration and a few overtones, say 10 in all; in the usual model this implies the dominant and the 9 immediately subdominant eigenvalues and vectors. The vibration engineer will be concerned with a band of frequencies near the engine rotational speed, and so will use shifting and inverse iteration. But in any event, the mathematical model will usually involve the finite element concept which gives accurate values for the lower band of frequencies, but is often quite unrepresentative of the top frequencies. Evaluation of all frequencies and modes is therefore not normally required. For such a model, power methods are the obvious choice. However, if interest attaches to all eigenvalues, and in particular if there is less concern with the associated vectors, other methods may be used. We now begin a brief study of transformation methods. 2.8 TRANSFORMATION METHODS In these methods, we apply a succession of similar transformations to a matrix A:  and so on, until A is transformed into a form giving the eigenvalues directly: it may be a triangular form, or the ultimate canonical form  (or  if A is defective). Since the transformations are similar, all the derived matrices B, C, D,…have the same eigenvalues as A; and if we proceed to the diagonal form, then the chain product X3…gives the modal matrix X. 2.8.1 Jacobi's method for a real symmetric matrix In 1.22, Theorems VIII and X, we have shown that a real symmetric matrix  has real eigenvalues and that it cannot be defective. Moreover, its modal matrix is orthogonal; hence  Jacobi's method is as follows. We begin by searching the off-diagonal elements of A (since A is symmetrical, we usually use the upper half only) to find the element Auv of greatest modulus. We then construct the orthogonal matrix , which is the unit matrix except that the units in the (u, u) and (v, v) positions are each replaced by  and the zeros in the (u, v) and (v, u) positions by  and s respectively. Then  and we may evaluate  of which the relevant submatrix is (omitting all other rows and columns)  which yields  We now choose{ gth}1 such that Buv vanishes; i.e.  This fixed{ gth}1. If than 2{gth}1 is positive, we take 2{gth}1 to lie in the first quadrant; if negative, in the fourth, Then{ gth}1 lies between  = c is positive and  has the sign of tan 2{gth}1. With c, s fixed, we can now evaluate B fully. Elements other than in the uth, vth columns and rows are unaltered from those in A; at the intersections of the uth, vth columns an rows the new elements are given by (3)(with Buv = 0), while the remaining elements Biu, Biv in the uth, vth columns and rows are  We may make two deductions. First, from (3) we have  and since only these diagonal elements have changed, it follows that  as it must in a similar transformation. Next, fro(5), squaring  and adding, we have  and since only the uth, vth columns and rows have changed, we deduce that the sum of the squares of all the off-diagonal elements of B is less than that of A since we have replaced the two elements Auv of A by zeros in B. Thus  Having evaluated B, we repeat the procedure to find C; we select the element Bpq of largest modulus and find  from (see 4))  we then proceed as before to construct  and . C will have Cpq = 0 and may also have cuv = 0 (if ); but this situation will not persist. At some stage, in general, elements formerly made zero will again become nonzero, though usually smaller than before. Thus Jacobi's method does not terminate in a finite, predictable number of steps; indeed, the umber may be very large. Nevertheless, following (6)  and, in an overall sense, the off-diagonal elements therefore become progressively smaller, until eventually we obtain a matrix in which the off-diagonal elements are all vanishingly small: i.e. a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. We give below an example, but must enter the caveat that because of its small order (n = 3) it converges radly. At each stage, the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements decreases by at least one third. However, if we had a matrix of order 100, it would have 9900 off-diagonal elements, and we can only say that at each stage the sum of the squares of these elements would decrease by 1/4950 at least; convergence to diagonal form is likely to take very much longer than for a small matrix. We may add two observations. The method is viable if Auv is reduced, not to zero, but to some lesser modulus; nevertheless, reduction to zero is obviously best. Also, the method requires only that A is real and symmetric: its state of definiteness is irrelevant. In the example below, A has a negative eigenvalue. Example 1 Let  We select the off-diagonal element of largest modulus (underlined) and evaluate (we record only six decimal places)  Hence  and then  Note that  also  thus we have effected a considerable overall reduction. The second step is to obtain C. For this we select the underlined element in B an evaluate in succession   and then  Note that the zero elements in B have become nonzero in C; however,  is now 2.19132; compare  above. Proceeding in this way, after six transformations, we find to the order of accuracy employed  2.8.2 The LR and QR methods We now describe briefly two methods which are applicable to any square matrix A, whether symmetric or not, real or complex, simple or defective, non-singular or singular. Here, we shall merely state and illustrate the methods; for proofs, readers are referred to Wilkinson (6). We may note, however, that while a complex matrix A = B + iC (B, C real) may be treated as such, using complex arithmetic, it is more usual to treat its real equivalent  which (see Theorem XI, 1.22) yields the eigenvalues and vectors of A and its conjugate. 2.8.3 The LR algorithm It is a straightforward process, readily programmed for a computer, to resolve a matrix A into the product L1R1 where L1 is a lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal, and R1 is an upper triangular matrix. For a model, we here take n = 4; it is tycal of any order. Let    Apart from the top row of  which by inspection is identical with that of A, we have here 12 equations ad 12 unknowns. From the first column of the product we have  which determine p, q, r. The second column yields  which, with p,. q, r known, determine in succession 2, s, t. The remaining unknowns 3, x33, n and the last column of R1 are found progressively in the same way. Note, however, that A11, 2, x33,…are divisors (vots) in this procedure, so that a voting strategy may be needed. Note also that , so ; hence, if A is non-singular, the diagonal elements of R1 must all be nonzero. Indeed, this program is very suitable for the numerical evaluation of determinants. The  algorithm resolves A into the product  as above, and then multiplies the factors in reverse order to obtain a new matrix B. Since  and then  is a similar transform of A. B is, in general, a fully populated matrix of which the last column is that of R1 (thus A14 reappears in B) and the last row that of L1 multiplied by x44. When B is found, it is in turn resolved into the product L2R2 and  evaluated, and so on. As the succession of similar transforms proceeds, it is found that (a) the elements below the diagonal become progressively smaller,(b) the diagonal elements tend to the eigenvalues, in descending order or modulus down the diagonal. When the process is well established, it is found that (with n = 4 as our model) the element  becomes approximately  in . When this element becomes very small  tends to decrease by the factor  and  by  and so on. Accordingly, if the eigenvalues of A are widely spaced, convergence of the  method is fairly rad; if, however, there is a pair or group of nearly-equal eigenvalues, then very many iterations may be required before the end result is achieved. This is an upper triangular matrix T, of which the diagonal elements are the(real) eigenvalues in descending order of modulus, and which still retains the  element A14 in the top right position. If A has a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalues, then T is not strictly upper triangular: the diagonal includes a block of order 2 such as  with  on the diagonal of T and  below it. In this case, the solution of  yields the complex eigenvalues. the numbers,  not in general constant under transformation; but if the iterations have proceeded so far that I is in the quasi-triangular form, the trace and determinant of (3) are invariant, so that the complex roots are fixed. As the LR transformations proceed, the most rad convergence is to the smallest eigenvalue in the bottom right-hand corner. Indeed, if there is a zero eigenvalue, it appears in the first transformation, i.e. in B. It follows that shifting (see 2.7.4) can be used with great advantage to accelerate convergence. When the element in the bottom right-hand corner has reached a settled value (i.e. the eigenvalue), we can deflate the transform, by omission of its last row and column, before continuing the iterations with a matrix of reduced order., /div4. Example 1 We choose the deflated matrix i (2.7.2.2) as A:  Since , the bottom right-hand element of  vanishes, as it should. We now evaluate the product in reverse order:  The reader is invited to check that, if B is resolved as it stands into  then C =  will also have its last row null, the zero eigenvalue thus repeating. We may therefore deflate B, omitting its last row and column and continue the iterations with the leading first minor of B. It is found that, after 22 more iterations, working to six decimal places,  Thus, the eigenvalues of A are, in descending order of modulus, 12.5, 5.0, 2.5, 0. The whole operation may in fact be summarised as LT = AL:  Recovery of the eigenvectors in the LR procedure is not straightforward, especially if deflation has been used. Since the eigenvalues are known, probably the simplest method is to use (2.6.4). However, if we have not deflated, then clearly  leads to (see (5) above)   We now require to transform T to . If TP = PA, then tycally  where PA has been multiplied out. Identification of the elements on each side, beginning with the superdiagonal, leads to  giving a, d, f. The remaining unknowns, b, e, c are found progressively. With P determined in this way, we have  so that the modal matrix of A is the product LP. The reader is invited to evaluate LP, using the numerical values of (5) in (6), and in particular to note that the eigenvector belonging to the zero root is that originally associated with the eigenvalues 25 in (2.7.2.6) The LR procedure is thus simple and easily programmed. However, in practice, it normally requires very many iterations before convergence is achieved; moreover, the process of recovering eigenvectors outlined above is apt to be ill-conditioned, and some other procedure is usually to be preferred. 2.8.4 Pre-reduction to upper Hessenberg form As we have seen, the LR procedure (and the QR method, to be discussed shortly) annihilates the elements of A below the diagonal. This is, however, usually a very long process; and while it can be accelerated by shifting and deflation, it is in fact better to depopulate A below the diagonal, as far as possible, as an initial step. An upper Hessenberg matrix has only zeros below its infradiagonal; and it is possible to transform any matrix A to this form by a similar transformation. This is the best that can be done to depopulate a matrix below its diagonal; if one could remove infradiagonal elements as well, there would be no problem in finding eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix. We illustrate reduction to upper Hessenberg form with a general matrix of order 4; it is clear that the procedure applies to matrices of any order greater than 2. We  write AK = KH as  Just as we have done earlier, we can evaluate the n2 unknowns progressively. The first column of the product gives  which determine h11, h21, p, q (note that here, also, a voting strategy may be needed). From the second column  which yield in succession  and so on. Thus, by progressive substitution, we arrive at the Hessenberg matrix ; it possesses the same eigenvalues as A. If we apply the LR or QR algorithms to H, the Hessenberg form is retained at each step; thus, instead of removing all the elements below the diagonal, we have to remove only those in the infradiagonal. Much computer arithmetic and time is thus saved. Transformation of A to H therefore greatly improves the LR algorithm; we have introduced it here, however, because for the QR method it is a sine qua non. We may add here, in passing, that it is possible by simple substitutions to reduce any matrix A to tridiagonal form — populated only in the superdiagonal, diagonal and infradiagonal. However, for our present purposes this is unnecessary; and in any event it often involves ill-conditioned equations and so lacks accuracy. Example 1 We again choose the matrix A of (2.8.3.4). The reader is invited to check that, if A is transformed as in (1), then  If we now treat H as our basic starting matrix A and resolve it into L1R1 then  As will be seen from , resolution of an upper Hessenberg matrix requires an upper Hessenberg L1, i.e. a matrix with zero elements everywhere except in the diagonal and infradiagonal. Both the resolution of A into L1R1 and the subsequent evaluation of  (B is also of upper Hessenberg form) are thus much simpler than when A is fully populated. 2.8.5 The QR algorithm We assume that the matrix A is already in upper Hessenberg form. Then, in parallel with the LR algorithm, we write  where , as before, is upper triangular. However, here we do not resolve A into  instead, we require that  shall be a orthogonal matrix:  Thus  is our similar transformation of A into B. We then transform B into C:  and so on, until the transform is eventually an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of A in its diagonal. It remains to explain how Qi is chosen. There are various possibilities; the most popular methods are those of Givens and Householder (6). Here we describe Givens' method; and as before, for simplicity of exposition, we choose n = 4. Let the matrix, pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form, be  Also, let  where . Then if we evaluate  as a chain, beginning by premultiplying A by the last of the three matrices in (4), and if also we take  then A is first replaced by a matrix in which the leading element of the infradiagonal vanishes. The top two rows of A are altered; in particular, 2 is replaced by . In the next multiplication we take  and then the second element in the infradiagonal vanishes. Finally, with A33 now altered to  we put  and complete the chain. The result is the upper triangular matrix R1. We now have to complete the similar transformation by postmultiplying by Q1; the result,  is again of upper Hessenberg form. We now repeat the cycle to obtain  and so on. As before, it is found that the infradiagonal elements become smaller at each step until the similar transform of A is ultimately upper triangular (or quasi-triangular if A has complex eigenvalues); i.e. a matrix T given by  The following point is important. In our treatment above, B is the product of a chain of seven matrices. When the multiplications are carried out in the order indicated, the upper Hessenberg form is maintained throughout, If, however, we begin by multiplying the central three matrices, the upper Hessenberg form is lost, with a accompanying loss of simplicity. It is now apparent why A must be pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form. Equation (4) employs one matrix for each nonzero element below the diagonal — three in this case; n — 1 in general. There are thus 2n — 2 multiplications in each iteration. But if A were fully populated, the number of multiplications would be n (n — 1). Example 1 The reader is invited to work through this example; we avoid repetitive labour by the use of hindsight. Consider the matrix defined in (2.7.6.12) and reduce it, as in (2.8.4.1), to upper Hessenberg form. The result is a new matrix  We now, with hindsight, use a shift of 0.2; i.e. we work with the matrix A — 0.2I. Shifts are always used to improve convergence: this particular shift requires only one step. The matrix is now  and after the six multiplications implied (see (4)) in  it becomes   Thus A — 0.2I has a zero eigenvalue; we recover B by adding 0.2I and can then deflate and consider the reduced matrix  Once again, to avoid repetitive labour in the example, we use hindsight: we now apply a shift of 0.4 and consider  We require only one step (four multiplications) to reduce this to  We now recover  by adding 0.4I and deflate by omission of the last row and column:  In any similar transform of  the trace and determinant are unaltered. The two eigenvalues of  are thus determined by  The required eigenvalues are thus 0.2 (bottom right-hand element of B), 0.4 (bottom right-hand element of ) and . The convergence properties of the QR algorithm are superior to those of LR, particularly when shifts are used and deflation is performed whenever possible. If complex eigenvalues exist,""double shifts' (see Wilkinson (6)) may be made and two QR steps performed simultaneously to give rapid convergence while all arithmetic is kept real. The QR method is thus very powerful and of quite general applicability; it is probably the most popular technique on modern main-frame computers for the evaluation of  eigenvalues of non-symmetric matrices. On the other hand, recovery of eigenvectors, though possible, is very difficult and often inaccurate, and some quite different routine (e.g. (2.6.4), when the eigenvalues have been found by QR) is recommended., 2.9 MATRIX PENCILS Our discussion of this toc is very limited, though we look again at the subject, also briefly, in 2.10. 2.9.1 Eigenvalues and vectors of matrix pencils Any lambda-matrix of the form C — B, which can in general be rectangular, *is described as a matrix pencil (see 1.15). If C is square, of order n, and non-singular, the pencil is described as regular, since in the polynomial equation obtained by expansion of  the coefficient  which does not vanish, so that there are n eigenvalues i which satisfy (1). It is clear that these eigenvalues belong also to the matrix . For each root i there will be at least one linear relation between the columns of the pencil, so that we may write  and  is an eigenvector of the pencil. The pencil is described as simple if there are n independent vectors  so that we may write the set compendiously as  where  is of simple diagonal form, even through it may include multiple roots. If, on the other hand, one or more auxiliary vectors are required, so that the spectral matrix takes the form , then the pencil is defective. In particular, a pencil is simple if B, C are real and symmetric and if C is pos. def. This proposition is proved in Corollary 1 of Theorem X of 1.22. However, it does not follow that if B, C are real and symmetric, the pencil is simple, or its roots real. The reader is invited to study the two pencils  Pencil (i) is real and symmetric; it has two equal eigenvalues  = 1 and the spectral matrix is of elementary Jordan block form; it is defective, with only the single eigenvector{ 2,1}. Pencil (ii) also has real, symmetric coefficients; but its eigenvalues are , with independent vectors{ 1,1 + 1}and {1,1 -i}. It is thus simple. In both (i) and (ii),  is negative, and so C is not pos. def. (see 1.22, Theorem X). If B, C are real and symmetric, and if in addition C is pos. def. then as in Theorem VIII of 1.22, the eigenvalues are real and finite and the eigenvectors real. We ow restrict our attention to simple pencils, where symmetric or not. In parallel with (2) we have the equation  and this leads to the counterpart of(3)  Postmultiply this by X and use (3); then  For simplicity, let us now suppose all roots i to be distinct. Then  permutes with a diagonal matrix and is therefore itself diagonal:  But (see (3)) is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix; we may thus write  and then from (5)  In the special case where B, C are symmetric, we may evidently identify Y with X. So much for the elementary properties of pencils. We turn ow to their numerical treatment. First, if we have a simple pencil C — B, we may premultiply it by C-1 to obtain I — A, A = C-1B; we may then obtain the eigenvalues and vectors of the pencil by applying any of the methods of 2.6–2.8 to A, and often this is the simplest procedure. However, cases can arise where this is not the best approach. For example, suppose C to be tridiagonal and B diagonal. Then C-1 is in general fully populated, and so would be C-1B; the simplicity of the pencil is thus lost in A. The same is true when C, B are sparse. We now give an example in which C, B are sparse and symmetric. The reader is invited to study this closely, since it illustrates more than the possible treatment of a pencil. Example 1 Consider the pencil  here C is tridiagonal and symmetric; B is diagonal. Also (though this is immaterial for our present purpose) both are centrosymmetric. The pencil thus has particular simplicity as it stands. We re required to find the eigenvalues i which satisfy , and the corresponding vectors. First, if we attempt this evaluating A = C-1B we find  Thus A is fully populated and is not symmetric (though, as it must, it remains centrosymmetric). We therefore return to the original form (8). A possible way of dealing with this is to use the location method (see 2.6.1). If we write  then  (since P is of order 4); we therefore require to assign three arbitrary values to  and then, by simple triangulation, evaluate  for each of these. Since the product of the roots is , we may choose  = 2, 1,— 1 as reasonable arbitrary values. Then we find, using a typical direct triangulation  while . Fortuitously, we have found one of the zeros of. Disregarding this for the moment, we write   and use the above values; we find  the solution of which is . Hence  or  To find the zeros of  () we may, for example, use the companion matrix (see 1.16), which, in this example, is  the eigenvalues of which are the zeros of (10). We may find these in the usual way by iteration: we repeatedly premultiply an arbitrary column, say , by M. Successive columns are then given by Table 1. We observe that, owing to the particular form of M, we need calculate only the top element of each column, in this table; the remaining elements are those of the previous column, one step down. In fact, we re only solving the regression formula   which is equivalent to the iteration with M; this is in effect Bernoulli's method of solution of  () = 0. To six places of decimals, we have now found 1 — 6.464102. Hence  on extraction of the first factor. If we set up a regression formula (or companion matrix) for the cubic, we find the next factor to be ( + 1), as we have already noted. In face  so that the eigenvalues are . We now look briefly at the eigenvectors. Typically  which is of course singular. We treat it by the method of Equation (2.6.4), using the first three rows, to obtain with x4 =1,  so that we find at once . In this way, with the eigenvalues in order of modulus, we find  A point of interest may be noted: the individual vectors are either centrosymmetric or centroskew, just as a symmetric structure has either symmetric or antisymmetric modes of vibration. We leave it to the reader to check that (see (3))   and also that  are diagonal. To complete this discussion, we may observe that the companion matrix, or its equivalent — the regression formula, may be used to find complex roots of a determinantal equation (see 1.7.6). For example, suppose we find  Then we may set up the regression formula  and if we begin with , we find for successive values of   The periodic change of sign, with no settled ratio, indicates complex roots. We therefore apply Equation (2.7.6.7) to the last 4 figures in sequences of 3 (we assume contributions from the other roots to be vanishingly small):  which give us . Hence (13) has the factor ; and we may write  so that all he factors of (13) are complex. 2.9.2 Deflation of a matrix pencil The eigenvalues and vectors of a simple pencil (not necessarily symmetric) will satisfy  Write these as  then  are evidently the eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalue i of C-1B. If we normalise them so that  then Sylvester expansion of C-1B (see 1.18) is  so that we may express B in terms of C, etc., as   Now suppose that we have found . Then we are able to evaluate, on the left-hand side,  and evidently a new pencil, which has all the eigenvalues and vectors of the original pencil except that 1 is replaced by 0, is  This is Lancaster's deflation formula. We may note two points:(i) since  has a zero root, must be singular,(ii) it is not necessary to normalise the vectors; we can write B1 generally as  Example 1 We use the pencil defined in (2.9.1.8) and we assume first that we have found an eigenvalue 1 = -1 and the associated eigenvector . Since the pencil is symmetric we shall have y = x. Now, using (2.9.1.8), we have  Hence, from (5) we find  which, with B defined as Diag(1,2,2,1) gives  This matrix is simply singular; indeed, as is indicated by (3), it is annihilated by postmultiplication by : in (3),  is orthogonal to , i = 2,3,…, n. Accordingly, the pencil P1( ); has a zero eigenvalue. The deflation can of course be repeated. If, using P1( ),; we now find an eigenvalue 2 = 0.6 and the associated eigenvector , then   and then we may calculate  which, with B1 given by (6), yields  By inspection, B2 is doubly degenerate; it is of course annihilated by postmultiplication by  or . A third deflation would produce B3, a unit rank matrix, which in this instance (n = 4) would be the last term in (3). 2.9.3 Iteration with submatrices of vectors We conclude this section with a description of a method often used in the following circumstances:(a) The problem is formulated as a matrix pencil; if it is of dynamical origin, we re given a non-singular symmetric stiffness matrix C of order n and a corresponding symmetric mass matrix B: the problem is to find certain modes and frequencies satisfying , x being proportional to exp (b) the order n is large, say  (c) Interest attaches only to a relatively small number, say , of consecutive frequencies and modes, beginning with the fundamental. The process is one of iteration with a submatrix of p vectors, where p is a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought, and involves the solution at each step of an eigenproblem of order p only. Since B, C derive from a mechanical system and are non-singular, they will be pos. def., and accordingly (see Theorem VIII of 1.22) the system eigenvalues are all real, finite and positive. if we write  then the full problem may be written  where X is the modal matrix,  the spectral matrix, and A = C-1B the dynamical matrix. It is assumed that the eigenvalues in  (and the corresponding eigenvectors in X) are so ordered that  has the eigenvalues   in descending order of magnitude down the diagonal, so that 1 and the first vector in X define the fundamental frequency and mode. We are not concerned to solve (1) as a whole. If it is partitioned in the form  where Y is of order (n × p) and  square, of order p,(2) gives  and only the first of these equations concerns us. However, we may note that (see 1.19) premultiplication by  of the first equation in (1), and transposition, shows that  are both diagonal. For analytical purposes we may normalise X so that  which imply, inter alia,  Having set out some preliminary considerations, we now state the method. Select a set of starting vectors Yo, arbitrary except that they must be linearly independent; then evaluate the (n × p) matrix  and use Wo to form the two square matrices of order p  Now solve the eigenproblem (any suitable method from this chapter may be used)  for its modal matrix Mo; the spectral matrix Ao which emerges is (see below) a first approximation to Ay. Then an improved approximation to Y is  where do is an arbitrary non-singular diagonal matrix which may, for example, be used to make a homologous element in each of the corresponding columns of Y1 and Yo the same; do is useful, but not essential. This completes one step. The next step uses Y1 in (6) to give W1 = AY1, and the cycle of operations is repeated until convergence occurs. We may note some interesting aspects of the method. (i) If Yo consists of one vector only, so does Wo, and then  are scalars, s is the modal matrix . If we choose  in (9) then  and this is the single vector iteration discussed in 2.7.1. Moreover, the trivial  eigenproblem gives a first approximation to 1 as the Rayleigh quotient. (ii) If Yo happens to be the correct set Y, the method makes this apparent at once, for then in view of (3)  so that , on use of (5)  Thus both matrices are diagonal, so that the eigenproblem is again trivial, having the solution . Then  when scaled appropriately, repeats  showing that both equal Y. (iii) If Yo happens to be a set of linear combinations of the vectors in Y, the correct solution is obtained in one step. For we may then write  where P is a square matrix of order p, non-singular since the columns of Yo and of Y, separately, are linearly independent. Then  in view of(3). Thus, on use of (5),  On premultiplication by , the eigenproblem (8) reduces to  which has the solution  If do is chosen as  The condition envisaged in (iii) is, in general, unlikely, unless for example a neighbour system (see Chapter 3) supplies a good approximation to Y. In most cases, we must write  where R, like Yo, is of order (n × p). In this general case  in view of(1). Then the eigenproblem matrices become  where (4) has been used. We therefore have to solve for   Knowing Mo, we now use (11) to evaluate   whence in turn we find  Since  is non-singular, we may reduce the eigenproblem based on W1 to  which we solve for the unknown . A third step leads to  It is clear from (13),(16) and (17) that after r steps we have to solve  If  is written as M,(18) in partitioned form is (see (10))  or, on expansion,  Now, since all the eigenvalues in  are greater than any of those in , when r is sufficiently large the terms in  become negligible compared with those in , when (19) reduces to  and if s is on-singular, this in turn reduces to  which has the solution . This shows that convergence is complete. Two things must be noted here. First, although when r is large, in an overall sense the terms in  those in , yet the smallest element in  is not necessarily much larger than the largest element in . As a result calculation of the last two or three eigenvalues in  may not be very accurate. It is for this reason that we choose p to be a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought. Second, reduction of the eigenproblem to (20) requires s to be non-singular. Now R has p linearly independent columns, and therefore also p linearly independent rows. Thus s can be non-singular; but it is not necessarily so, and then Y as given by the method may be deficient. For example, if the top row of s were null, the first vector in X (the fundamental mode) would be absent in the make-up of Yo, and this absence would persist. There is no certain way of avoiding this difficulty when Yo is chosen arbitrarily; but in practice it does not often arise. Although the eigenproblem to be solved at each step is vastly less time-consuming and expensive than direct methods applied to the full system, yet it does take much time. However, after a few steps v, and  usually become heavily diagonal, so that Mr tends towards I; this occurs before the vectors Yr have converged. In these circumstances, use of the Collar-Jahn method, described in Chapter 3; may greatly expedite the solution. An example of this is given in 3.9. Further reference to the method is also made in 8.5. Example 1 The small-order example which is all we can give here does not of course do justice to the method, but at least shows how it works. We begin with an illustration of the situation in (iii) above; the reader is invited to check the arithmetic. Let  Then  Suppose now we are given, or choose,  It then follows that  The eigenvalues of  are thus 10 and 5 and   The reader should check that these are eigenvectors of A and that they correspond to eigenvalues 10 and 5. We have thus obtained our solution, in this case, in one step. It will be found that each column of  is in fact, a linear combination of the columns of  Example 2 We use the same A, B, C, as in Example 1, but select as our starting vector submatrix  In choosing Yo we have selected simple vectors which are clearly linearly independent, and which between them bring all elements in A into operation in the formation of Wo. We then find  where the product is quoted to four significant figures. Its eigenvalues are 9.805, 2.411 and, very approximately (great accuracy is not necessary),  which yields, again approximately,  Proceeding in this way, we find at the end of the fifth step  and in the sixth step this gives   These are so nearly diagonal that the eigenproblem is trivial; the eigenvalues are 10, 4.9987. However, we do not obtain convergence until after the 10th step, which gives eigenvalues 10, 5 and  The second columns should be{ 1,1,0, -1}. 2.9.4 A variant We now give a variant of the method of 2.9.3; we do so partly because the variant can save computer time, especially if may iterations are required, but also because it enables us simply to bring out certain features of the method, which lead to possible modifications. For simplicity, we assume that the eigenvalues sought are all different. We are given the matrices C and B, both symmetric an pos. def. We may therefore use Choleski's method (see 2.4.2) to find a lower triangular matrix L such that , and may then evaluate , accordingly the equation  may be written  and S is symmetric and pos. def. Now, instead of using the three matrices C, B and A = C-1B as in 2.9.3 we work only with S. Suppose we now proceed as in 2.9.3: we begin with the submatrix Yo and successively evaluate  and we then solve for Mo the eigenproblem  Then a new approximation to Y is   At this point we may ask: what is the purpose of eigenproblem? The answer appears if we premultiply and postmultiply Equation (5) by appropriate quantities to give since do permutes with ,  on use of (6). Transposition of (7) shows (compare 1.19) that  permutes with  and is therefore diagonal, as is . The columns of  are thus mutually orthogonal; this is the purpose of evaluating Mo: its use orthogonalises the columns, an our ultimate objective is the orthogonal set Y. A second step with Yo in (2) replaced by Y1, leads to the eigenproblem (compare (5))  Again we may pause and observe that (8) gives us  directly; we do not need to find Mo first from (5) and then M1 from (8). Thus the step (5) is unnecessary. Then, in its turn, the step (8) is unnecessary; and so on. Indeed, in theory all that is required is that a sufficient number of direct iterations is made, with the columns orthogonalised as the last step; in practice, however, the numbers would become increasingly ill-conditioned as S is raised to a high power and approximates to a unit rank matrix. However, it is probably sufficient if the columns are orthogonalised at, say, every fourth iteration. If we do this, the procedure is as follows. Begin with Yo and evaluate successively . At this stage, evaluate  and solve the eigenproblem  for M. Then a new approximation, which has mutually orthogonal columns, is , with which in place of Yo the cycle is repeated, and so on. Example 1 We use the same matrices B and C as in Example 2.9.3.1. then, if , , we find, to four decimal places,    As our starting matrix we choose  This has mutually orthogonal columns; however, as we shall see later, it is not a good initial choice for the first column. We ow form , at each stage making the ""11"" and ""22"" elements unity. We find  we require  as it stands. We now form v,  as in (9),(10), and solve (11) for M. To sufficient accuracy, we find  and then a new Yo is, with d chosen appropriately,  and it may be checked that these two columns are, sufficiently nearly, orthogonal. We now repeat the cycle. This time we find   and  and again, sufficiently nearly, the columns are orthogonal. A third cycle leads to the eigenvectors (and eigenvalues) of S:  We leave it to the reader to establish that the eigenvectors of the original system, given by premultiplication of w by  may be written  2.10 IMPROVEMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS It frequently happens, both in dynamical problems and in other eigenvalue problems that we have approximate values for one or more eigenvalues (and perhaps vectors) and require to obtain more exact values. This problem, from another viewpoint, is discussed more fully in Chapter 3. Here we shall deal only with some simple cases. 2.10.1 Problem formulated as a matrix pencil For simplicity, let us first discuss the undamped oscillations of a mechanical system having n degrees of freedom, the equations of motion of which have been derived by Lagrangian methods from energy considerations; they will appear, in the usual notation of dynamics, as  Here x is the column of coordinates; in what follows, we assume the last element x to be non-nodal (if it is not, it can be made so by rewriting the equations in a different order). Also C, the inertia matrix, will be symmetric and pos. def. and B, the stiffness matrix, also symmetric and non-neg. def; finally, F is a column of applied forcing functions. In simple harmonic motion, these forces, and x, will be proportional to exp  and if we then write  for{ go}2,(1) reduces to the usual formula  . We observe that, in addition to the given matrices C and B,(2) contains 2n + 1 other quantities, viz. λ, x, and F. Since we have n equations, we can determine any n of these quantities in terms of the remaining n + 1, to which we can ascribe arbitrary values. Here, we shall (a) choose λ as an independent variable; (b) prescribe the value unity for ; (c) prescribe the value zero for each of the first n -1 functions in F, the last being written f. Then f and the coordinates  become functions of λ, and we note that when f vanishes (i.e. all the functions F vanish in (2)), λ will be an eigenvalue and  the corresponding eigenvector. We not write, in partitioned form, , , and, since the pencil in (2) is symmetric, , where  is a square submatrix of K of order n = 1. Then (2) becomes , which yields, progressively, , . Since the submatrices in (5) are all functions of λ,(7) and (8) give f and ξ (or x) as functions of λ. Now suppose we have an approximation  to an eigenvalue. Since f is a function of λ which vanishes at the eigenvalues, we may use it in the Newton-Raphson method to obtain an improved approximation : , the zero suffixes indicating that the functions are calculated for . Equation (8) is not suitable for differentiation; instead, we obtain another form for f by premultiplying (6) by ; we obtain , and since K is symmetric it follows that , which, with K given by (5), reduces to . In a numerical calculation, we use (11) for  and either (8) or (10) for f. If we use the latter, we must note that, at , , when Equation (9) reduces to , i.e. the well-known Rayleigh quotient. In the numerical evaluation of this, we obtain x from (7) with . Having obtained  we can adopt it as a new  and repeat the cycle of approximation, which is known to be quadratically convergent: i.e. if  is the true eigenvalue, then for small differences . Equation (9), with  given by (8), is analytically precisely equivalent to (12). In numerical applications, they may differ, depending on the accuracy with which  and ξ are evaluated. Probably (12) is the user to use. Example 1 In Equation (1), let . Suppose we are given an approximate eigenvalue . We evaluate  , which we have partitioned as in (5). Then ξ is given by (7) as , and the reader may check that this yields . We give this to four decimal places only: it is not necessary to calculate ξ to great accuracy, but once found, it must be used consistently, and calculations made accurately. We deduce that for , the approximate eigenvector is , and we are able to calculate , , whence . If we round this off to a new , we quickly find that  also, i.e. 40 is an exact eigenvalue; also the corresponding eigenvector becomes  . If, instead of the Rayleigh quotient, we use (9) directly, we require from (8) . Hence (see also (16)) , in close agreement with (16). Problem formulated in terms of a single matrix If we premultiply (2.10.1.2) by  and write , we obtain the problem in terms of the characteristic matrix of A: . Note that here A is, in general, not symmetric; however, it evidently possesses the same eigenvalues as the system (2.10.1.2). Let us now abandon the connection with a mechanical system, and treat this as a problem involving any given real matrix A, the eigenvalues and vectors for which have to be found. The treatment is closely similar to that of §2.10.1. As before, we choose λ as an independent variable, assign the value unity to  and zeros to the first n -1 elements of G: ; we also write, remembering that A is not symmetric, . Then Equation (2) gives us , from which we obtain as before , . We now look for the left vector  corresponding to x as the right vector; in §2.10.1 this was : here it is different. In place of(2) we write ; by the same argument as before, we set , , hence from (4),(9) and (10) , yielding , , and on comparison of (12) with (7) we see that h and g are identical; this is not surprising, since they are evidently similar functions and have the same zeros, i.e. the eigenvalues. As before, we now employ g in a Newton-Raphson application to improve the accuracy of any given approximate eigenvalue . Premultiplication of (5) by  gives , and then, differentiating term by term, we have , which in view of(4) reduces to . Accordingly, as before . This is the parallel to (2.10.1.12); as before, we can, if we wish, use g as given by (7) for alternative treatment, but we shall not pursue this here. Example 1 In (2), let . This matrix is, in fact, obtained from our previous example by evaluating . However, we shall treat a different eigenvalue: suppose we are told that there is an eigenvalue in the neighbourhood of . We evaluate and partition . Then we find at once from (6) and (11) that , , and hence, from (15), . If we round this off to a new , and repeat the calculation — we leave it to the reader to check this — we find ; finally, rounding this off to 20 and repeating again, we find that 20 is an exact eigenvalue and that the corresponding right and left eigenvectors are, respectively, , . 2.10.3 Factorisation of A into two symmetric matrices In Equation (2.10.2.1) we derived A as the product of two given symmetric matrices,  and B; this was done for convenience in the examples. For completeness, we interpolate here a brief discussion of the reverse procedure: it was shown in §1.19 and Theorem V of §1.22 that a matrix can always be factorised into two symmetric matrices, but the subject was not pursued there. Here we obtain the most general solution. We first continue the discussion of §1.19, and treat the most common case in which A has distinct eigenvalues. It was shown there that A permutes with , which is therefore diagonal. This diagonal matrix, D, is arbitrary, since X is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix. Write where P, Q, R,…are arbitrary. Now if (see §1.18) we write , C may now be expressed as , so that C is expressible as an arbitrary linear sum of the n symmetric unit rank matrices . Next consider the case where A has two equal eigenvalues α, but is not defective. Then A can be written with the (2 × 2) scalar submatrix αI in the leading diagonal position. This means that D is not necessarily diagonal; corresponding to αI there may be a (2 × 2) block which is arbitrary except that it must be symmetric and non-singular. This therefore contains three arbitrary quantities, giving n + 1 in all. Finally, suppose A has two equal eigenvalues α but is defective. As previously, we note that   since  is symmetric. Accordingly  with K as defined in Theorem V of §1.22. Thus  permutes with . This implies that  is diagonal except for the leading (2 × 2) submatrix. Now the following submatrices permute (see also §1.21) , , where a, b are arbitrary. The second of these is thus the leading submatrix of , whence in  it is , which is symmetric and contains just two arbitrary quantities; there are thus just n arbitrary quantities in all. Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult. However, these studies employ the modal and spectral matrices, and in practice these may not be known. We can, however, find directly the general solution of . Write , so that C contains n (n + 1) /2 unknown elements, n in the diagonal, viz. p, q, r,…, and n (n -1) /2 elsewhere, viz. a, b, c…. Now the conditions that B is symmetric provide just n (n -1) /2 linear algebraic equations connecting the unknowns, so that we can determine a, b, c,…in terms of p, q, r…which are arbitrary. The procedure is best illustrated by means of a numerical example: we choose A to be the matrix of (2.10.2.16). Then . Then the condition that , for example, leads to , and there are five other such equations. We set them out thus:  These are then solved, e.g. by direct operation on rows, when a, b, c,…emerge as quantities linear in p, q, r, s. To set out the result compactly, we write , where …have zero diagonals except for a unit in the first, second,…place respectively. In this example, we can write , where to keep the elements numerically simple, we have extracted the factor 1/3 from  and . This is evidently the most general form of C. Postmultiplication by A yields B in the form  . When p, q, r, s are assigned numerically, C and B are known and then the factors  and B of A are found. We can recover the matrix C (and also B) defined in (2.10.1.13) by assigning to p, q, r, s the values 1, 1.52, 3, 0.92 appearing in the diagonal of C. The following characteristics of , , etc. are to be noted. First, since each contains zeros in its diagonal, it cannot be pos. def. Next, the ranks of the matrices do not conform to any simple pattern:  is of rank 4,  and  of rank 3 and  of rank 2. Finally, in relation to our main problem, since for the Rayleigh quotient (which gives eigenvalues identical to those of A) , and since also p, q, r, s are arbitrary, it follows that , i = 1,2,3,4, though this result is not particularly helpful in practice. 2.10.4 Another method for improvement of eigenvalues We discuss here the same problem as that in §2.10.2, but vary the treatment. The eigenvalues are determined by Equation (2.10.2.5) with g = 0, viz. , where α is the submatrix of A corresponding to , and  is the last diagonal element in A. From this we find , , and elimination of ξ leads to the equation for λ  . This equation is not easy to solve numerically as it stands; however, if we are given an approximation  to an eigenvalue, we write  for the exact eigenvalue, which therefore satisfies (4), so that we obtain , which is now an equation for ε Write  then . Thus , provided ε is sufficiently small. Insertion in (5) leads to , or, if , , , etc., . Finally, if  is written , we obtain the scalar equation . Provided the series converges, this may be solved for ε in any suitable way; often a regression procedure, beginning with ε = 0 on the right-hand side to give a new approximation on the left, will solve the equation in two or three steps. Comparison of (8) with (3) shows that, when ε has been found from (9) , so that both eigenvalue and vector are found. Example 1 Once again, we use the matrix specified in Equation (2.10.2.16) and we are given that it has an eigenvalue near . Then, in (6), with n=4, . Also, ; ; ;. Hence, using (7), we obtain , , , , , and it is in fact unnecessary to proceed further. We now evaluate the scalars ; they become , , , , . Hence Equation (9), for ε, becomes , and if we collect the linear terms and rationalise:  and solution of this, by regression or otherwise, gives ; . Also, using (10) with , we find  or ."
ACA ACA-HRG-003 -10.06 "CHAPTER 10 Polymer Characterization — Chain Dimensions and Structures As the size and shape of a polymer chain are of considerable interest to the polymer scientist it is useful to know how these factors can be assessed. Much of the information can be derived from studies of dilute solutions; an absolute measurement of polymer chain size can be obtained from light scattering, when the polymer is large compared with the wavelength of the incident light. Sometimes the absolute measurement cannot be used but the size can be deduced indirectly from viscosity measurements, which are related to the volume occupied by the chain in solution. Armed with this information we must now determine how meaningful it is and to do this a clearer understanding of the factors governing the shape of the polymer is required. We can confine ourselves to models of the random coil, as this is usually believed to be most appropriate for synthetic polymers; other models — rods, discs, spheres, spheroids — are also postulated, but need not concern us at this level. 10.1 Average chain dimensions A polymer chain in dilute solution can be pictured as a coil, continuously changing its shape under the action of random thermal motions. This means, that at any time, the volume occupied by a chain in solution, could differ from that occupied by its neighbours, and these size differences are further accentuated by the fact that each sample will contain a variety of chain lengths. Taking these two points into consideration leads us to the conclusion that meaningful chain dimensions can only be values averaged over the many conformations assumed. Two such averages have been defined: (a) the average root mean square distance between the chain ends ; and (b) the average root mean square radius of gyration  which is a measure of the average distance of a chain element from the centre of gravity of the coil. The angular brackets denote averaging due to chain polydispersity in the sample and the bar indicates averaging for the many conformational sizes available to chains of the same molar mass. The two quantities are related, in the absence of excluded volume effects, for simple chains by   but as the actual dimensions obtained can depend on the conditions of the measurement, other factors must also be considered. 10.2 Freely jointed chain model The initial attempts to arrive at a theoretical representation of the dimensions of a linear chain, treated the molecule as a number n of chain elements, joined by bonds of length l. By assuming the bonds act like universal joints, complete freedom of rotation about the chain bonds can be postulated. This model allows the chain to be pictured as in figure 10.1(a) which resembles the path of a diffusing gas molecule and as random flight statistics have proved useful in describing gases, a similar approach is used here. In two dimensions the diagram is more picturesquely called the ‘drunkard's walk’ and r f is estimated by considering first the simplest case of two links. The end-to-end distance r f follows from the cosine law that  see figure 10.1(b), or  When the number of bonds, n is large, the angle θ will vary over all possible values so that the sum of all these terms will be zero, and as  equation(10.3) will reduce to  This shows that the distance between the chain ends, for this model is proportional to the square root of the number of bonds and so, is considerably shorter than a fully extended chain. The result is the same if the molecule is thought to occupy three-dimensional space, but if it is centred on a co-ordinate system both positive and negative contributions occur with equal probability. To overcome this the dimension is expressed always as the square which eliminates negative signs. This model is, however, unrealistic. Polymer   chains occupy a volume in space, and the dimensions of any macromolecule are influenced by the bond angles and by interactions between the chain elements. These interactions can be classified into two groups: (i) Short range interactions which occur between neighbouring atoms or groups, and are usually forces of steric repulsion caused by the overlapping of electron clouds; (ii) Long range interactions which are comprised of attractive and repulsive forces between segments, widely separated in a chain, that occasionally approach one another during molecular flexing, and between segments and solvent molecules . These are often termed excluded volume effects. 10.3 Short range effects The expansion of a covalently bonded polymer chain will be restricted by the valence angles between each chain atom. In general this angle is θ for a homoatomic chain and equation (10.4) can be modified to allow for these short range interactions. For the simplest case of an all carbon backbone chain such as polyethylene, and  so that equation (10.5) reduces to  This indicates that the polyethylene chain is twice as extended as the freely jointed chain model when short range interactions are considered. 10.4 Chain stiffness As we have already seen in chapter 1 for butane and polyethylene, steric repulsions impose restrictions to bond rotation. This means that equation (10.5) has to be modified further and now becomes  where  is the average cosine of the angle of rotation of the bonds in the backbone chain. The parameter  is the average mean square of the unperturbed dimension, which is a characteristic parameter for a given polymer chain. The freely jointed dimensions are now more realistic when restricted by the factor ζ the skeletal factor — composed of the two terms  where σ is known as the steric parameter and is  for simple chains. For more complex chains, containing rings or heteroatomic chains, e.g. polydienes, polyethers, polysaccharides, and proteins, an estimate of σ is obtained from    Values of the unperturbed dimension can be obtained experimentally from dilute solution measurements made either directly in a theta-solvent (see section 9.9) or by using indirect measurements in non-ideal solvents and employing an extrapolation procedure. The geometry of each chain allows the calculation of , and results are expressed either as σ or as the characteristic ratio . Both provide a measure of chain stiffness in dilute solution. The range of values normally found for σ is from about 1.5 to 2.5 as shown in table 10.1. 10.5 Treatment of dilute solution data We can now examine some of the ways of calculating the polymer dimensions from experimental data. THE SECOND VIRIAL COEFFICIENT An investigation of the dilute solution behaviour of a polymer can provide useful information about the size and shape of the coil, the extent of polymer-solvent interaction and the molar mass. Deviations from ideality, as we have seen in section 9.7, are conveniently expressed in terms of virial expansions, and when solutions are sufficiently dilute, the results can be adequately described by the terms up to the second virial coefficient A 2 while neglecting higher terms. The value of A 2 is a measure of solvent-polymer compatibility, as the parameter reflects the tendency of a polymer segment to exclude its neighbours from the volume it occupies. Thus a large positive A 2 indicates a good solvent for the polymer while a low value (sometimes even negative) shows that the solvent is relatively poor. The virial coefficient can be related to the Flory dilute solution parameters by  where  is a molar mass dependent function of the excluded volume. The exact form of  can be defined explicitly by one of several theories, and while each leads to a slightly different form, all predict that  is unity when theta conditions are attained and the excluded volume effect vanishes. Equation (10.10) can be used to analyse data such as that in figure 8.7. Once Θ has been located, the entropy parameter ψ 1 can be  calculated by replotting the data as  against T. Extrapolation to , where , allows ψ 1 to be estimated for the system under theta conditions. This method of measuring Θ and ψ 1 , is only accurate when the solvent is poor, and extrapolations are short. The dependence of A 2 on M can often be predicted, for good solvents, by a simple equation  where γ varies from 0.15 to 0.4, depending on the system and k is a constant. EXPANSION FACTOR α The value of A 2 will tell us whether or not the size of the polymer coil, which is dissolved in a particular solvent, will be perturbed or expanded over that of the unperturbed state, but the extent of this expansion is best estimated by calculating the expansion factor α. If the temperature of a system, containing a polymer of finite M, drops much below Θ the number of polymer-polymer contacts increases until precipitation of the polymer occurs. Above this temperature, the chains are expanded, or perturbed, from the equilibrium size attained under pseudo-ideal conditions, by long range interactions. The extent of this coil expansion is determined by two long range effects. The first results from the physical exclusion of one polymer segment by another from a hypothetical lattice site which reduces the number of possible conformations available to the chain. This serves to lower the probability that tightly coiled conformations will be favoured. The second is observed in very good solvents, where the tendency is for polymer-solvent interactions to predominate, and leads to a preference for even more extended conformations. In a given solvent an equilibrium conformation is eventually achieved when the forces of expansion are balanced by forces of contraction in the molecule. The tendency to contract arises from the both the polymer-polymer interactions and the resistance to expansion of the chain into over extended and energetically less favoured conformations. The extent of this coil perturbation by long range effects is measured by an expansion factor α, introduced by Flory. This relates the perturbed and unperturbed dimensions by  In good solvents (large, positive A 2 ) the coil is more extended than in poor solvents (low A 2 ) and α is correspondingly larger. Since α is solvent and temperature dependent a more characteristic dimension to measure for the polymer is  which can be calculated from light scattering in a theta-solvent, or indirectly as next described. FLORY-FOX THEORY The molecular dimensions of a polymer chain in any solvent can be calculated directly from light scattering measurements, using equation (9.36), if the coil is large enough to scatter light in an asymmetric manner, but when the chain is too short to be measured accurately in this way an alternative technique has to be used. Flory and Fox suggested that as the viscosity of a polymer solution will depend on the volume occupied by the polymer chain, it should be feasible to relate coil size and [η]. They assumed that if the unperturbed polymer is approximated by a hydrodynamic sphere, then [η], the limiting viscosity number in a theta solvent, could be related to the square root of the molar mass by  where  Equations (10.13) and (10.14) are actually derived for monodisperse samples, and when measurements are performed with heterodisperse polymers, the appropriate averages to use are M n and . The parameter Φ was originally considered to be a universal constant, but experimental work suggests that it is a function of the solvent, molar mass, and heterogeneity. Values can vary from an experimental one of 2.1 × 10 23 to a theoretical limit of about 2.84 × 10 23 when [η]is expressed in cm 3 g -1. A most probable value of 2.5 × 10 23 has been found to be acceptable for most flexible heterodisperse polymers in good solvents. For non-ideal solvents equation (10.13) can be expanded to give  where a  is the linear expansion factor, pertaining to viscosity measurements, and is a measure of long range interactions. As the derivation is based on an unrealistic Gaussian distribution of segments in good solvents, it has been suggested that α η is related to the more direct measurement of α in equation (10.12) by  Considerable experimental evidence exists to support this conclusion. INDIRECT ESTIMATES OF  It is not always possible to find a suitable theta-solvent for a polymer and methods have been developed which allow unperturbed dimensions to be estimated in non-ideal (good) solvents. Several methods of extrapolating data for [η]have been suggested. The most useful of these was proposed by Stockmayer and Fixman, using the equation: when Φ is assumed to adopt its limiting theoretical value, B′ is related to the thermodynamic interaction parameter χ 1 by  and examination of equation (10.10) shows that B′ is also proportional to A 2 . The  unperturbed dimension can be estimated by plotting  against M ½; K θ , is obtained from the intercept and  is calculated from equation (10.14). A similar procedure has been proposed by Cowie and Bywater, in which the intrinsic frictional coefficient [f]measured from sedimentation or diffusion experiments, will provide the same information using  where  and P o is a ‘constant’ with a limiting value of 5.2. These extrapolation procedures all depend on the validity of the theoretical treatment and reliability must be judged in this light. Fortunately, it has been demonstrated that most non-polar polymers can be treated in this way and results agree well with direct measurements of . For more polar polymers, specific solvent effects become more pronounced and extrapolations have to be regarded with corresponding caution. INFLUENCE OF TACTICITY ON CHAIN DIMENSIONS Studies of the dilute solution behaviour of polymers with a specific stereostructure have revealed that the unperturbed dimensions may depend on the chain configuration. This can be seen from the data in table 10.1 where isotactic, syndiotactic, and atactic poly (methyl methacrylate) have different σ values. If the size of a polymer chain can be affected by its configuration, the microstructure must be well characterized before an accurate assessment of experimental data can be made. This can be achieved using n.m.r. and infrared techniques. 10.6 Nuclear magnetic resonance (n.m.r.) High resolution n.m.r. has proved to be a particularly useful tool in the study of the microstructure of polymers in solution, where the extensive molecular motion reduces the effect of long range interactions and allows the short range effects to dominate. Interpretation of chain tacticity, based on the work of Bovey and Tiers, can be illustrated using poly (methyl methacrylate). The three possible steric configurations are shown in figure 10.2 where R is the group . For the purposes of n.m.r. measurements three consecutive monomer units in a chain are considered to define a configuration and called a triad. The term heterotactic is used now to define a triad which is neither isotatic nor syndiotactic. In the structures shown, the three equivalent protons of the α-methyl group absorb radiation at a single frequency, but this frequency will be different for each of the three kinds of triad, because the environment of the α-methyl groups in each is different. For poly (methyl methacrylate) samples, which were prepared under different conditions to give the three forms, resonances at τ = 8.78, 8.95 and 9.09 were observed, which were assigned to the isotatic, heterotactic, and syndiotactic triads respectively. Thus in a sample with a mixture of configurations a triple peak will be observed and the area under each of these   peaks will correspond to the amount of each triad present in the polymer chain. This is illustrated in figure 10.3, where one sample is predominantly isotactic, but also contains smaller percentages of the heterotactic and syndiotactic configurations. The analysis can be carried further. The fraction of each configuration, P i , P h , and P s , measured from the respective peak areas, can be related to ρ m the probability that a monomer adding on to the end of a growing chain will have the same configuration as the unit it is joining. This leads to the relations  Curves plotted according to this simple analysis are shown in figure 10.4 where they are compared with experimental data obtained for various tactic forms of poly (α-methyl styrene). Differences in the microstructure of polydienes and copolymers can also be made using n.m.r. In the polydienes the difference between 1,2- and 1,4-addition can be distinguished on examination of the resonance peaks corresponding to terminal olefinic protons, found at , and non-terminal olefinic protons observed at . Not only is the local field acting on the nucleus altered by environment, it is also sensitive to molecular motion, and it has been observed that as the molecular motion within a sample increases, the resonance lines become narrower. Determination of the width, or second moment, of an n.m.r. resonance line, then provides a sensitive measure of low frequency internal motions in solid polymers and can be used to study transitions and segmental rotations in the polymer sample. Line widths are also altered by the polymer crystallinity. Partially crystalline polymers present complex spectra as they are multi-phase materials, in which the molecular motions are more restricted in the crystalline phase than in the amorphous phase. However, attempts to estimate percentage crystallinity in a sample using n.m.r. have not been particularly successful. The method is illustrated in figure 10.5 for poly(tetrafluoroethylene) where glass and other transitions are readily detected. Below 200 K the chains are virtually immobile, but above 200 K the lines sharpen as  rotation begins. This is associated with the glass transition, but the way the line width increases in this region is governed by sample crystallinity. 10.7 Infrared spectroscopy Infrared spectroscopy can be used to characterize long chain polymers because the infrared active groups, present along the chain, absorb as if each was a localized group in a simple molecule. Identification of polymer samples can be made by making use of the ‘finger-print’ region, where it is least likely for one polymer to exhibit exactly the same spectrum as another. This region lies within the range 6.67 to 12.50 µm. In addition to identification, the technique has been used to elucidate certain aspects of polymer microstructure, such as branching, crystallinity, tacticity, and cis-trans isomerism. The relative proportions of , and ; addition in polybutadienes can be ascertained by making use of the differences in absorption between (CH) out of plane bending vibrations, which depend on the type of substitution at the olefinic bond. Terminal and internal groups can also be distinguished, as an absorption band at about 11.0 µm is characteristic of a vinyl group and indicates . The  is characterized by an absorption band at about 13.6 µm, whereas the  configuration exhibits a band at about 10.4 µm. An estimate of cis-trans isomerism can be made by measuring the absorbance A of each band, where  and I o and I are the intensities of the incident and transmitted radiation respectively. This is calculated by locating a base line across the minima on either side of the absorption band and the vertical height to the top of the band from the base line is converted into a composition using the equation  where P cis is the fraction of cis configuration, A cis is the absorbance at 13.6 µm, A trans the absorbance at 10.4 µm, and if we assume that the 1,2 content is negligible. Polyisoprenes can also be analyzed in this way, only now the bands at 11.0 and 11.25, µm are used  to estimate the  and , while a band at 8.7 µm corresponds to the  linkage. The infrared spectra of highly stereoregular polymers are distinguishable from those of their less regular counterparts, but many of the differences can be attributed to crystallinity rather than tacticity as such. The application of infrared to stereostructure determination in polymers is less reliable than n.m.r., but has achieved moderate success for poly (methyl methacrylate) and polypropylene. In poly (methyl methacrylate), a methyl deformation at 7.25 µm is unaffected by microstructure, and comparison of this with a band at 9.40 µm, which is present only in atactic or syndiotactic polymers allows an estimate of the syndiotacticity to be made from the ratio . Similarly  provides a measure of the isotactic content. An alternative method is to calculate the quantity J as an average of the two equations  where the absorption band at 10.10 µm is now used. If J lies between 100 and 115 a highly syndiotactic polymer is indicated, if between 25 and 30 the polymer is highly isotactic. For polypropylene, the characteristic band for the syndiotactic polymer appears at 11.53 µm, and the syndiotactic index I s is . Values of I s about 0.8 indicate highly syndiotactic samples. Spectra can be measured in a number of ways; for soluble polymers a film can be cast, perhaps even on the N a Cl plate to be used and examined directly. Measurements can also be made in solution, if the solvent absorption in any important region is low, or by a differential method. 10.8 X-ray diffraction The extent of sample crystallinity can influence the behaviour of a polymer sample greatly. A particularly effective way of examining partially crystalline polymers is by X-ray diffraction. The crystallites present in a powdered or unoriented polymer sample diffract X-ray beams from parallel planes for incident angles θ which are determined by the Bragg equation  where λ is the wavelength of the radiation, d is the distance between the parallel planes in the crystallites, and n is an integer. The reinforced waves reflected by all the small crystallites produce diffraction rings, or haloes, which are sharply defined for highly crystalline materials and become increasingly diffuse when the amorphous content is high. If the polymer sample is oriented, by drawing a fibre, or by applying tension to a film, the crystallites tend to become aligned in the direction of the stress and the X-ray pattern is improved. In some samples of stereoregular or symmetrical polymers, the degree of three-dimensional ordering of the chains may be sufficiently high to allow a structural analysis of the polymer to be accomplished. Sample crystallinity can be estimated from the X-ray patterns by plotting the density   of the scattered beam against the angle of incidence. If this can be done for an amorphous sample and a corresponding sample which is highly crystalline, a relative measure of crystallinity for other samples of the same polymer can be obtained. In figure 10.6 the shaded portion is the amorphous polypropylene, while the maxima arise from the crystallites. 10.9 Thermal analysis When a substance undergoes a physical or chemical change a corresponding change in enthalpy is observed. This forms the basis of the technique known as differential thermal analysis (DTA) in which the change is detected by measuring the enthalpy difference between the material under study and an inert standard. The sample is placed in a heating block and warmed at a uniform rate. The sample temperature is then monitored by means of a thermocouple and compared with the temperature of an inert reference such as powdered alumina, or simply an empty sample pan, which is subjected to the same linear heating programme. As the temperature of the block is raised at a constant rate  the sample temperature T s and that of the reference, T r will keep pace until a change in the sample takes place. If the change is exothermic T s will exceed T r for a short period, but if it is endothermic T s will temporarily lag behind T r . This temperature difference ΔT is recorded and transmitted to a chart recorder where changes such as melting or crystallization are recorded as peaks. A third type of change can be detected. Since the heat capacities of sample and reference are different ΔT is never actually zero, and a change in heat capacity, such as that associated with a glass transition, will cause a shift in the base line. All three possibilities are shown in figure 10.7 for quenched terylene. Other changes such as sample decomposition, crosslinking, and the existence of polymorphic forms can also be detected. As ΔT measured in DTA is a function of the thermal conductivity and bulk density of the sample, it is non-quantitative and relatively uninformative. To overcome these drawbacks an alternative procedure known as   differential scanning calorimetry (DSC) is used. This technique retains the constant mean heat input but instead of measuring the temperature difference during a change a servo-system immediately increases the energy input to either sample or reference to maintain both at the same temperature. The thermograms obtained are similar to DTA, but actually represent the amount of electrical energy supplied to the system, not ΔT, and so the areas under the peaks will be proportional to the change in enthalpy which occurred. An actual reference sample can be dispensed with in practice and an empty sample pan used instead. Calibration of the instrument will allow the heat capacity of a sample to be calculated in a quantitative manner. This information is additional to that gained on crystallization, melting, glass transitions, and decompositions."
ACA ACA-HXH-003 -1.02 "The form of your argument When you write an essay what you typically do (put at its simplest) is gather material and then arrange it. In Chapter 2 we looked at sources of information and at how to gather material. In this chapter we focus on how you arrange your gathered material in the form of an argument. In Chapters 4 and 5 we consider in more detail the writing techniques through which you can present to best effect the kinds of argument described here. 3.1 ESSAY TYPES As we discussed in Chapter 1, the underlying purpose of writing essays in literary studies is to argue a case. In achieving this end, essays follow certain general patterns of development and direction, which are definable in terms of the focus they give to their subject matter and the different modes of argument they adopt. We now consider how the substance of those different sorts of essay is organised and presented, starting with techniques for commenting on a given passage. Commenting on a given passage In writing on a given passage — often in response to a general question in a ""Practical Criticism"" or ""Commentary and Analysis"" course — it can be helpful, in considering what to say, to organise your answer around the following questions:(a) Who is the speaker? What sort of person (or creature) appears to be speaking in the text? How do we know? What words, phrases or markers of attitude indicate this? (b) Who does the passage seem to be addressing? Who (or what sort of audience) must the implied addressee(s) be, so far as we can tell from the passage itself? (c) What theme or general issue is the passage concerned with? How far is a specific position or attitude taken towards that theme (which may be anything from a conventional topic, such as lost love, to an apparently unresolvable philosophical question, such as the meaning of life)? (d) What is the overall function or effect of the passage? Does it seek to persuade, command, inform, satirise, impress, amuse? (e) How would you describe the style of the passage? Is it colloquial, elevated, ornate, comic, ironic, archaic, conventionally poetic, etc.? Which particular words or phrases indicate this most clearly? (f) Are there any noticeable changes of mood (or direction in the narrative, if there is one)? Does the passage switch from one style to another, and if so why? (g) How far is the passage supposed to be realistic? Is it just about what it describes? Or is it representative of something more general? Is it symbolic of a theme or topic that is not itself explicitly mentioned in the passage? Is it allegorical (i.e. each character or event in the passage stands for something else in a parallel story)? (h) What effect does the passage have on you? And would it be likely to have a significantly different effect on other readers (e.g. readers from a different historical period, different class, different country, different gender or ethnic group, etc.)? There are many aspects of any given passage to describe besides these. But such a checklist of questions can be a helpful prompt if you are faced with a passage and cannot find a place to start. Beginning with one or more of these questions is likely to carry you into other, new areas of your own. Analysing and interpreting Beyond answering basic questions of the kind listed above, the next stage of analysing a text is to investigate its patterning or STRUCTURE. Cases of interesting structure might include a rhyme pattern, an unusually high proportion of adjectives, or a particular type of narrative. Every analysis is also to some extent an interpretation; so if for example you choose to  summarise a narrative, you will, by selection and emphasis, be interpreting what the most important incidents and characters are. Analysis and interpretation of structures in a text are useful if you can make something of them — if, for instance, you can say something new on the basis of having identified a rhyme pattern. Typically, you use an analysis or description of a text to claim some kind of connection between the features analysed and something else about the text, such as its meaning, its effect on a reader, how good it is, or its historical origins. In most cases the connection is one between observation (of structure) and response (your interpretation). Without observations, responses are mere impressions. Without responses or interpretation, on the other hand, observations are unworked-out descriptions. In between, there are different strengths of connection between these two aspects of reading, ranging from CAUSATION, through CORRELATION, to COINCIDENCE. Consider a simple example. You analyse a poem as having an especially regular rhyme scheme; you also find that the poem makes you feel cheerful. You now try to connect these two perceptions, by saying that (a) the rhyme scheme causes the cheerfulness; or (b) there is a relationship between the rhyme scheme and the cheerfulness, but it is one of correlation; or (c) the regular rhyme scheme is connected with the cheerfulness because they are both caused by something else (such as the genre or subject matter of the poem, perhaps); or (d) there is in your view no relationship between the rhyme scheme and the feeling, and they coincide without there being a causal or correlative relation between them. Coincidence is the least interesting of the three relationships; it is also the most common. Causation, conversely, is likely to be the most interesting, but it is also the most difficult to demonstrate. This is because, with a literary text, what is caused is often inside your head: an emotional response or an impression of meaning. While such states are central to literary studies, it is difficult to describe them precisely or effectively; and for this reason, although they are of great interest, they are also inevitably weak points in your argumentation. Descriptive essays Not all essays are discussions (or analyses) of individual, given passages. In the case of more general or abstract essays (on whole works, on authors or on critical issues), it is necessary to find other means of organising an  argument — though some of the means also turn out to be applicable when looking at individual passages. The simplest form of general essay organisation involves just the presentation of a sequential commentary or description. But what gives us the sequence? One common sequence is chronology (e.g. the development of a novelist's concerns throughout her lifetime). But there are other kinds of sequence, too, such as a text-by-text commentary on works in a collection (e.g. Lyrical Ballads); or you might recount events in a narrative, telling your reader the story in the order in which it happens. There is, however, a difficulty with the mode of organisation which follows an already existing sequence: it lacks anything by way of your own analysis or commentary. The materials you have collected together (the events in the story, the biography of an author, etc.) are simply presented in the same order in which they originally occur; and this generally produces uninteresting and unoriginal essays. Essays which describe their material sequentially in a list-form resemble commentaries on prescribed passages which work through the text line by line. The problem in both cases is that no process of reworking, assimilation or re-presentation has taken place: there is little added by you. Using the same information available for a sequential description, however, it is possible to organise an essay in more interesting ways. You can demonstrate a process of reordering, and so your own contribution, by reshaping the material around an overall organizing principle or generalisation. For example, a classificatory system imposed on the material divides it into abstract categories (e.g. into a chronology on the basis of definable periods; or into a typology, or system of sorting on the basis of formal likeness and difference). Any classificatory system you use to organise your essay has to be explained, of course(e.g. divisions between historical periods need to be discussed and justified). But introducing a classificatory element almost always radically improves a descriptive essay. It enables you to get straight into analysis and debate, leaving basic description to passages of supporting illustration; and it emphasises your point of view or commentary rather than mere repetition of materials possibly already available to your reader in their original form. (Always ask yourself: why should anyone read my essay, when they could read the original?) One fruitful form of classification starts from a keyword (sometimes a historical term such as ""Restoration"" ; a conceptual term such as  ""nature"" ; or a genre term such as  ""tragedy"" ). Consider the case of tragedy. If you are writing on this topic you can work out a list of different sorts of  tragedy. This prompts you to do something else, namely to work out the relationship between the parts of the list: why all the different sorts of tragedy are all called tragedy, what the historical sequence and links between them are, etc. Classification is also useful when you are working with a text which has not been extensively discussed, but which relates to classifications which have been discussed. For example, if you choose to write an essay on the novel A Very Quiet Street by the contemporary Glasgow author Frank Kuppner, you may not find it easy to get any critical work either on the book itself or on this writer (since no books may have been written about him). But you can work out how Kuppner's novel would fit into various classificatory systems, and then discuss the novel from this point of view. You can try to work out whether it is autobiography or murder mystery and how it works within these genre classifications. Or you can classify the novel according to where it was written, ""West of Scotland"" , and think about it as an example of writing from this locality. Classifications are often a basis for finding correlations. As an illustration of this, consider the following project: An essay on metaphors used in advertisements This imaginary project might begin with an analysis of the metaphors used in ten advertisements. We decide to look for a connection between types of advert and types of metaphor. In order to do this, we classify the adverts into types ""aimed at women"" and ""aimed at men"" (we could instead have classified them as ""television"" versus ""magazine"" or ""Italian"" versus ""British"" , etc.; and if our first attempt to classify gets us nowhere we might try one or more of these alternatives at a later stage). We then also classify the metaphors into types: ""metaphors where an object is treated like a part of a body"" and ""other types of metaphor"" . We are now in a position to ask whether one type of advert typically uses one type of metaphor. If the answer is ""yes"" , then we have learnt something (a correlation, which may turn out to be an instance of causation); and in writing it down we will be saying something new. If, on the other hand, the answer is ""no"" , then we eliminate this line of enquiry, and perhaps try one of the alternative classifications of adverts and metaphors we suggested above. Argumentative essays In this mode of organising an essay, you divide the issue you are addressing into conflicting positions, or points of view, or sides of an argument. So the structure of the essay becomes a comparison of claims made from differing viewpoints, assessing the validity and appropriateness of each. Sometimes you can organise your essay around an already existing critical controversy (e.g. between established schools of thought, such as ""New Criticism"" and ""Post-structuralism"" ). In order to accentuate the general significance of your arguments, it can be helpful to generalise from individuals to movements, or types of thought (you discuss Leavisism, for instance, rather than Leavis's work in particular ). In presenting ideas of the school or movement, however, you will need to be careful about distinguishing your own words from your paraphrase of the positions you are representing. Be explicit at the point where you leave off summarising and your own words take over (see below, Chapter 5, pp. 105–7, for techniques which enable you to do this). You will also need, in this type of essay, to signal that you are aware of the dangers of reductionism: that is, of simplifying the work of a school or movement until it no longer adequately represents what anyone associated with it would recognise or subscribe to. Experimenting A literary experiment changes a text and looks at how the change affects a reader. For example, you choose a narrative, then imagine a different ending for it, and think what implications this would have. Such an ""experiment in your head"" focuses on the writer's actual decision about an ending, but also begins to tell you about how endings work in general . As in this simple mental experiment of the narrative ending, most experiments in literary studies involve taking related versions of a text and seeing what effects on a reader the differences between them have. The selected texts (or versions of a single text) will be alike in many respects, yet different in perhaps just one basic way — called the VARIABLE. You are likely to be looking for the relation between the variable part of the text (called the INDEPENDENT VARIABLE because you are manipulating it by making changes) and the variation in the response of the reader (called the DEPENDENT VARIABLE, because it depends on the variation, or changes, made to the text). One of the crucial rules about doing an experiment is to report it fully, so that it can be repeated if necessary. You also need to control the circumstances in which you conduct the experiment, in order to eliminate, as far as possible, conflicting or distracting variables (such as tiredness, lateness in the day, unequal difficulty of the texts used, etc.). If your experiment involves other people (e.g. if you are comparing different readers' responses), you need to consider ethical issues which arise, including (a) getting their permission to use the results;(b) showing them the results and explaining them;(c) not using their names when you report the experiment (even if they have given permission for this, there is  unlikely to be any point);(d) the ethical problem that sometimes an experiment is best conducted if the test subjects don't know what it is for; that is, if there is a ""secret agenda"" . If your experiment involves large groups of informants, then you also need to think about the significance of numerical results you may produce; and for this, guidebooks about experimentation and the use of statistics may be needed (see sections 1 and 4 of the Booklist for suggestions). Providing contexts for texts Another form of argument to be considered involves analysis of what else was happening at the time a text was written and first published. You can begin to find this out by using an ANNALS, which functions as a short-cut summary of historical facts if you do not know much about a text's historical background. For example, Emily Brontë's novel Wuthering Heights was published in 1847; the annals The Teach Yourself Encyclopedia of Dates and Events tells us that in 1846 the term ""folk-lore"" was coined (which may be relevant to the presence of fairy-tale elements in the novel). Remember here too the issue of correlation, causation and coincidence. Sometimes a correlation or co-occurrence is incorrectly presented as a causality, for example, by the use of ""therefore"" in this sentence: Dickens and Thackeray were concerned with demanding social justice in an attempt to make life better, therefore their literature adopted realism as a method. There could be a causal link between demanding social justice and realism as a method, but it is not shown. There may be merely a less direct link. It might be, for example, that these authors' social concerns and their use of realism both come from a common source: increased knowledge of social reality as a result of sociological work in the nineteenth century and the urbanisation of Britain; that is , a correlation rather than a causation. Comparing texts Because a text always relates historically to other texts, one way of developing material for your essay is to compare texts. Texts are sometimes altered editorially for particular purposes, and in this respect, for example, you could compare Shakespeare's play Henry V with a version of the play revised for performance in the eighteenth century. Such a comparison would tell you about changes in language and in  aesthetics, about the demands of performance in the eighteenth century, and about changes in social values. Even if you have no interest in the play Henry V itself, the comparison helps you to learn about eighteenth-century attitudes, by providing information and insights you can then use to look at eighteenth-century drama generally. Another type of comparison arises from the fact that literary texts often adapt other sorts of text. You might compare, for instance, a real letter from 1740 with one of the letters in Richardson's novel Pamela (published 1740, and made up of a sequence of imitation letters). From this you might learn about Richardson's method of writing, as well as about differences between writing which is really private compared to writing which only pretends to be private. Or you could use a text which has been translated from one medium into another. By comparing the film Apocalypse Now (1978) with the story on which it is based — Joseph Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" (1902)— you might gain ideas about differences between film and writing as media, or differences between an early twentieth-century text and a late twentieth-century text; you might also get ideas about narrative by comparing how the two narratives are the same and how they differ. Finally, a comparison essay always involves a decision about how to organise the comparison. If, for example, you compare the film Gregory's Girl (GG) with the play A Midsummer Night's Dream (MND), on which it is partly based, you could organise the comparison as: GG narrative compared with MND narrative; GG characterisation compared with MND characterisation; etc.; summary of comparison. Or you could organise the comparison as: GG narrative, GG characterisation; MND narrative, MND characterisation; etc.; comparison between the two texts. Generally the first mode — point-by-point argument — is preferable, since it foregrounds comparison rather than description. The second mode of presentation has the damaging tendency to defer argument and analysis until a closing section, before which come extended passages of paraphrase and basic description. Finally, remember that point-by-point comparisons can become tedious if extended too far; a formal analysis always needs to be subordinated to some more general point you want to make. Using a definition or the history of a word in an argument An argument can sometimes be built around the definition of a word. Consider, for example, an essay on ""Islamic elements in Byron's poetry"" . One thing you might want to do as a way of putting an argument together would be to look up the word ""Romanticism"" in the dictionary, since Byron's poetry belongs to this literary movement. You will probably find that there are several competing definitions, together with examples which will help you think about Romanticism. On the basis of the definitions you find, you could even construct your own definition of Romanticism which would help give direction to your essay. You might for example define Romanticism as ""an artistic movement centrally concerned with the relationship between the self and others"" . The next step would be to explore whether the ""others"" could be represented in Byron's poetry by people who follow the religion of Islam.  ""Romanticism"" would be a KEYWORD for this essay. Another keyword might be ""Islamic"" . Many words have a history which reflects the history of ideas and the history of society. One way of finding material for your essay is to look up your keyword in sources concerned with the social history of language and ideas, such as the OED or Raymond Williams's Keywords. The OED for example tells you that the word ""Islam"" was first used in English in a poem by Shelley, six years before Byron's death. If you now find and read Shelley's poem, you gain the possibility of comparing Byron with Shelley in terms of how they represent Islam. The dictionary entry also suggests that the term ""Islam"" was new to English-speaking culture at this time, and prompts you to look up other words, including ""musselman"" and ""mohammedan"" ; reading the entries on these words will give you further clues relating to the representation of Islam in English-speaking cultures, and so further material for your argument. 3.2 ORDERING THE PARTS OF YOUR ARGUMENT An essay is made up of parts, each part relating to the parts around it, with a forward movement so that what comes first leads to what comes next. Working out the part-structure of your essay is a way of working out what your argument is; and if the organisation of parts is clear, this helps your reader to understand how the essay develops. Here, for example, is an initial organisation of an essay on the Scottish novelist Josephine Tey: introduction career as a London playwright recent critical appraisal powers of description  humour education church the divided self the divided self — most of all as a woman her final novel — The Singing Sands. As it stands, this organisation does not make clear how the parts relate to each other, what the development is, or even what the point is of some of the parts (why should there be a special section devoted to her final novel but not the others, for example ?). So we might reorganise the parts like this: introduction biographical details (including career as a London playwright) qualities as a writer — powers of description — humour themes — education — church — the divided self — most of all as an artistic movement centrally concerned with the relationship between the self and others. — woman (as a theme), and in relation to the divided self recent critical appraisal conclusion: her final novel — The Singing Sands. Our revised version is the result of the following organisational changes:(a) We put ""career as a London playwright"" into a larger section called ""biographical details"" , because there are other relevant biographical points we will want to make. (b) We grouped ""powers of description"" and ""humour"" in a section called ""qualities as a writer"" ; we can now add other qualities to this section if we wish. Similarly we have made a group of ""themes"" . (c) We moved ""recent critical appraisal"" after our analysis of powers of description and humour because these sections give our own critical appraisal; now, by the time we outline other people's opinions we have something to compare them with, and can therefore do something more interesting than just repeat them. (d) We have made explicit the reason for focusing on the last novel — we chose it because it acts as a summary of Tey's work, and so is an appropriate topic for a conclusion. With a longer dissertation, be careful not to overload the first part, especially if it is a biographical summary, a description of historical context, or a literature review — all of which are potentially interminable. To overcome problems of overloading the opening section, try to avoid the following structure:(a) literature review;(b) introduce case study;(c) detail of case study;(d) analysis, findings and conclusion. In such a structure,(a) usually becomes overloaded. Instead, try something like:(a) scene-setting; reasons for interest; the problem;(b) case study;(c) analysis of findings;(d) discussion of wider themes; relation to existing work. In this revised format you present material from your literature review, paradoxically, at the end (under ""relation to existing work"" ), where you examine implications and applications. 3.3 ASSERTION, JUSTIFICATION AND PRESUPPOSITION At many points in your essay you will just want to propose or say something; so many of your sentences will be ASSERTIONS. When you make an assertion, what you are doing is telling your reader something you think is true. Assertions can be signalled by writing ""I would suggest"" , or ""I would argue"" , but often it is just assumed that whatever you say is your suggestion or argument. In this section, we look at two important questions you should ask about any assertion you make in an essay: (a) Does the assertion need further justification?(b) Does the assertion presuppose too much? We begin with justification. If all your essay consisted of was just a series of assertions, there would be little connection or development between the parts: there would be no argument. An assertion is the basis of an argument when it is combined with a justification: assertion: ""Dickens showed an incorrect view of the London working classes.""  Justification could be given for this assertion by describing Dickens's view of the London working classes, then describing the view of one or more modern historians, then showing that the two views are significantly different to the extent that Dickens's could be called incorrect. This could be developed further by defending your assertion against an alternative — a Dickens critic who says that Dickens had an accurate view of these matters — and showing that the alternative view is incorrect, or that the critic provides no supporting evidence (and so that there is no reason to believe the alternative view). While justification of assertions is the motor which drives your essay forwards and builds your argument, you cannot justify each assertion you make. Moreover, how important you think it is to justify your assertions will depend partly on what sort of writing you are engaged in; a film review in a newspaper, for instance, is a genre where few assertions are justified. On the other hand, your reader will be interested in your writing only to the extent that what you say is convincing; and while a film reviewer or a famous literary theorist may be able to rely on their position or fame to guarantee the authority of what they say, you will need to rely on the quality of your argument. Nevertheless, there are no fixed rules about justifying arguments in literary studies. The conventions about what counts as a convincing argument vary with time and place. Some people think, for example, that value judgements ( ""this novel is Greene's best"" ) cannot ever be justified; you may disagree — it depends on your ideas about value and whether you think a value judgement is an arbitrary decision on the part of a reader. If you make an assertion which you think in principle could be justified but which you don't have space to justify, you can alert the reader by adding a phrase like: ""I am assuming that…"" , ""we could argue that…"" , or ""it is generally accepted that…"" ; the advantage of using these phrases is that you acknowledge that there is some possibility of disagreement. When you write a sentence, you claim that something is true, that is, you explicitly assert a proposition. If you write ""the second novel Dickens produced was called Oliver Twist"" , then you are explicitly asserting that it is true that the second novel Dickens produced was called Oliver Twist. As you write, however, you inevitably commit yourself not only to propositions you explicitly assert, but also to other propositions which are implicit in, or presupposed by, the words you actually write down. In writing the above sentence, for example, you PRESUPPOSED that Dickens produced a second novel.  ""Pre-suppose"" means in effect that you have already supposed or claimed this without needing to write it down. Hidden commitments of this kind are often the result of using particular words (here, ""the"" ) or phrases or constructions. Consider the following sentence: William Golding's best novel, Lord of the Flies, is a reflection of the widespread pessimism about the morality of children in the 1950s. This sentence makes a number of claims, some more overt than others. The overt claim is ""Lord of the Flies is a reflection of the widespread pessimism about the morality of children in the 1950s"" . But two other claims are being made as well: ""Lord of the Flies is William Golding's best novel"" , and ""There was widespread pessimism about the morality of children in the 1950s"" . These two claims are both presupposed by the sentence; that is, the sentence just assumes they are true. Such hidden assertions can easily be discovered, but it is less easy to notice two further presuppositions in the sentence: ""It is possible to evaluate texts (i.e. say that one is the 'best')"" and ""It is possible for texts to reflect social attitudes"" . So what this example shows is that a sentence which seems to contain one assertion can turn out to contain many different assertions, some in the form of presuppositions. This is unavoidable, and occurs all the time as you speak or write. But there is a good reason for making yourself aware of presuppositions: you need to be as conscious as possible of all the assertions you are making, including hidden ones. Presuppositions and hidden assumptions are the hiding place for common sense and shared assumptions. If you think a particular assumption might reasonably be disagreed with by the reader of your essay you should make that assumption explicit (and then provide some support for it). For these reasons, it is useful to know what the words, phrases and constructions are which regularly conceal presuppositions, so that you know what you are letting yourself in for when you use them. * We have seen one kind. A phrase like ""the second novel Dickens produced"" is not itself a statement of fact, but can be rewritten as a sentence to show its presupposition ( ""Dickens produced a second novel"" ). Using ""the"" at the beginning of a phrase implies general agreement about the existence of whatever the phrase refers to. A similar mechanism works in: What is Kristeva's position on gender-positioning in this article? This presupposes that Kristeva has a position on gender-positioning in this article. * Other words which carry presuppositions are the adverbial words and phrases which mean ""again"" (ITERATIVES): Emily Brontë began writing the novel once more. This presupposes that Emily Brontë had begun writing the novel before. * Presuppositions are sometimes embedded with particular verbs, including FACTIVE VERBS like ""regret"" or ""know"" , which presuppose that what is regretted or known is a fact. At the end of the book, the main character regrets believing in God. This presupposes that ""the main character believed in God"" . There are also IMPLICATIVE VERBS which imply one action by stating another: Victorian writers managed to persuade us that… This presupposes that Victorian writers tried to persuade us that…* Some connectives such as ""although"" , ""since"" and ""because"" also conceal presuppositions: Because Dickens was a social reformer, he focused in his work on poverty. This presupposes that Dickens was a social reformer. * It is also possible to put presuppositions into a sentence by just rearranging the parts, as in the following example (called a CLEFT), based on ""Senecan influence brought blood to Renaissance tragedy"" : It was Senecan influence which brought blood to Renaissance tragedy. This presupposes that something brought blood to Renaissance tragedy. A superficially similar rearrangement (called a PSEUDOCLEFT because it looks a bit like a cleft but isn't one) is shown in this example: What contemporary novelists do well is comment on novel-writing rather than tell stories. This presupposes that ""contemporary novelists do something well.""  * Another arrangement of the sentence which carries a presupposition is the COUNTERFACTUAL CONDITIONAL: ""if X had/hadn't been the case, then Y"" : If Renaissance dramatists had not known Seneca, they would have been less interested in blood. This presupposes that ""Renaissance dramatists did know Seneca.""  * Finally, another place for presuppositions to hide is in a clause which sets the scene in a sentence; an example is the TEMPORAL CLAUSE, as in the following example: When Blake saw his first angels he was sitting in his garden. This presupposes that Blake saw angels. It is worth checking your essay to make sure that you are not presupposing things which you don't believe are true, and that you aren't hiding anything in a presupposition which needs to be made explicit and justified. But presuppositions are essentially a tool rather than a nuisance — a way of expanding the power of your writing by enabling you to say a lot in a short space. They allow you to imply things without saying them directly, and so to develop complex arguments in relatively short passages of writing. As you write, there are some ideas which you present as ""given"" information; they form an assumed background to what you wish to assert. Presuppositions contribute to that given information. Other ideas are presented as ""new"" information: they are what you offer as new, and so of interest. By judging which information to present as given and which to present as new, you establish an important dimension of your relationship with your reader. You are signalling what you take as common or assumed ground between your reader and yourself, and what you are representing as worthy of attention, as ""new"" ideas. Consider this simple introduction to an essay: Shakespeare's birth in 1564 marks the beginning of the high period of English drama. When he later produced a series of outstanding tragic works, what he managed to do, in effect, was to bring about the transition from crude medieval drama towards the more sustained literary achievement of the Renaissance. In this opening, a number of ideas are not stated, but presupposed:— Shakespeare was born in 1564. — There was a high period of English drama (which had a beginning). — Shakespeare produced a series of outstanding tragic works. — Shakespeare tried to bring about a transition. — There was a transition from crude medieval drama towards Renaissance drama. — Other dramatists did not bring about such a transition. — There is a literary achievement of the Renaissance. — There was a Renaissance. All these ideas — each of which is in principle arguable — are compacted into two relatively short sentences and are linked together in a gradually unfolding argument. But the writer could equally have made different  decisions about what should be treated as given (shared background knowledge) and what should be presented as new. The essay might have started in any one of the following ways:(a) ""Arguably there is a transition between…""  (b) ""William Shakespeare was born in…""  (c) ""The concept of a 'Renaissance' in history can be established…""  The distinction between given and new information contributes substantially to the level at which your essay is pitched. This, in turn, gives your reader a sense of what sort of debate or discussion you see yourself as being engaged in; and it is this, alongside whatever concrete arguments you make on a given topic, which shapes a reader's or examiner's general response to what you write. 3.4 GENERALISATION In this chapter so far we have focused on specificities in your argument — the presuppositions in your sentences, the specific things you can say about particular texts, the setting of something in its context, and so on. However, specific observations always needs to be related to general claims or GENERALISATIONS, without which the specific can just seem trivial and random. For example, a specific observation about some aspect of a text (such as its rhyme scheme) could lead to a generalisation based on how it fits with other related observations (the rhyme schemes of other poems by the same poet). A concrete comment on some special element of the text (such as a particularly striking metaphor) could lead to a more abstract general discussion of its significance beyond the text (what makes any metaphor striking?). Generalising from your experience of reading one unique passage or making a specific concrete observation leads to speculation about patterns or regularities, and beyond this to thinking about causation and correlation, which are central to explanation and argument. So generalisation is important as a way of pulling you out of just describing the details of your individual experience as a reader, enabling you to make statements which are likely to be of interest to others about patterns or structures in the way literary texts work. In practice, you might, for instance:(a) Broaden your essay's conclusions, so that they could in principle be applied to other books, or an author's work as a whole. Example In an essay on an eighteenth-century play, which has argued that the women in the play are generally seen to be a source of disruption or confusion, you could conclude by asking whether women are general sources of disruption, broadly understood, in eighteenth-century drama. (b) Treat a specific question or topic as an instance of a more general question or topic. Example The topic ""Islamic elements in Byron's poetry"" could be given greater interest and significance by placing it in a more general discussion of ""foreignness"" in British Romantic texts. (c) Try to link together the scattered specific observations you might make on a text. Example If you have a paragraph on irony in Conrad's ""Heart of Darkness"" , a paragraph on characterisation and a paragraph on narrative closure, you could try to link them together by talking more generally about the abstract relationship between irony, characterisation and narrative closure. 3.5 SIGNALLING YOUR ATTITUDE TOWARDS YOUR OWN ARGUMENT As you construct your argument, you will be obliged to make judgements about how firmly you are committed to each of its ideas, and how strong the evidence is for believing them. As you present ideas, therefore, you need to consider issues of EPISTEMIC MODALITY. Epistemic modality (the word ""epistemic"" means ""to do with knowledge"" ) involves various markers in language of the degree of certainty or possibility a speaker or writer feels towards what is being said. It includes modal verbs such as ""must"" and ""may"" , as well as phrases such as  ""it is possible that…"" ,""it is likely that… "". A range of adverbial expressions, including ""apparently"" and ""actually"" , have a similar effect. Two different problematic situations are likely to arise as you present your argument. The first is that what you say seems obvious; so, in slight embarrassment, you add ""obviously"" or ""of course"" — implying ""of course everyone knows this"" . The second situation is that you feel there is a risk of overstating the line of argument you are pursuing. Consider first the effect of adding ""of course"" to a sentence. George Eliot of course believed that… If we already know what we are being told — as ""of course"" implies — then the question immediately arises why we are being told again. Sometimes ""of course"" is added not because the information is obvious, but rather because you want to create the effect of being someone so deeply familiar with the material that this information is basic or obvious. Consider the different impression of yourself which you would give if you wrote: Dickens, of course, was a novelist. As opposed to writing: Dickens, of course, completed the last double instalment of Martin Chuzzlewit in the middle of June 1844. As in most other areas of essay writing, there is no fixed rule governing use of ""of course"" . What you need to do, in using the expression, is to anticipate what effect its use is likely to have on your probable readers — and act accordingly. When, on the other hand, a claim you are making looks overstated (possibly unsustainable in its generalised form, or stronger than the evidence you have properly warrants), it is possible to tone down what you are saying by using indicators (HEDGES) that show you recognise the difficulty of certainty in the area. You can replace simple statements of fact or opinion with hedges such as ""it seems likely that…"" , ""this may be…"" , ""it is reasonable to suppose that…"" , and occasionally with ""relatively"" , ""in effect"" , ""seemingly"" or ""it seems that"" . Other useful words here are, ""evidently"" , ""rather"" , ""somewhat"" , ""generally"" , ""on the whole"" , ""can appear to"" and ""arguably"" . Take special care with ""arguably"" , however. This word works well as a hedge as regards a passing topic (e.g.""this is arguably also the case in Aphra Behn's other works… ""). But if you use ""arguably"" in the case of a central or major argument you are making, you invite the unspoken response: ""Well, if it's arguable, then let's hear the arguments, since this is what the essay is supposed to be about.""  You should also note, in using hedging and qualifying expressions, that they will affect the overall tone or REGISTER of your essay (as we shall examine in the next chapter). They may suggest that you have no confidence in your argument or even that you can't make up your mind — and that does not make for much of an argument. 3.6 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary In this chapter, we have described the different forms an  argument in literary studies can take. In any argument you develop, we have suggested that it is important to distinguish between views you are taking for granted, views you are directly asserting and views with which you disagree. By signalling clearly the significance of the ideas you present — and the attitude you are adopting towards them — you enable your reader to follow the essay as a coherent and developing debate, in which the generalisations and conclusions you finally draw will seem reasonable and justified. Specific suggestions * Remember, writing an essay means arguing a case (see p. 51). * Begin work by identifying the problems you hope to solve and structure the essay around them (see p. 51). * Get into the habit of routinely asking a list of questions about any text you have to analyse (see p. 52). * Analysing the structure of a text is useful only if you can make something of it, such as linking it with something else about the text in a correlation or causal relation (see p. 53). * Organising an essay around a pre-existing sequence (such as historical order) is straightforward but often not the most interesting or useful option (see p. 54). * Explore how the text can be understood according to a classificatory system (see pp. 54–5). * If your essay works by comparing other people's arguments be careful not to be too simplificatory, and clearly indicate the origin of each argument you present (see p. 56). * Consider modifying a text as an experiment, to see how it works (see p. 56). * Material for your essay can come from the text's original historical context, or through comparison between texts (see pp. 57–9). * Start your essay with a statement of the problem you wish to investigate (see p. 61). * As a way of finding the best structure for your essay, write out all the main points you think you need to make, and rearrange them until they develop as an overall argument (see pp. 59–61). * Try to draw the general significance out of specific observations (see p. 56). * It may be better to discuss other people's ideas at the end rather than the beginning of your essay (see pp. 60–1). * Know your presuppositions (see pp. 62–5). * Think through the implications of inserting words like ""of course"" and ""arguably"" (see pp. 67–8). Exercises (1) Find an anthology of poetry, and open it at page 50; take the first poem on that page (all of it, including any part before or after page 50), and answer the eight questions on p. 52, section 3.1. (2) Choose a poem (the same one as in exercise 1 if you like), and put the title after the first stanza, so that it is in the middle of the poem instead of at the beginning. You have just changed an independent variable. How does it change the meaning or effect on the text, as far as you as a reader can tell? (This is the dependent variable.) Briefly explain what the result of this experiment tells you about the function of the title in this poem (see p. 56). (3) In 1902 the first major science fiction film was made, in France: the twenty-one-minute silent A Trip to the Moon, by George Méliès. Look up 1902 in an annals or book of dates and events, and make a list of ten other events or publications (historical, artistic, literary, philosophical, musical, scientific, etc.) from 1902. Discuss how you could refer to some of these events or publications if you had to write an essay on A Trip to the Moon in its historical context. (4) Pick an essay topic you have recently completed. Using our discussion of essay types above (pp. 53–7), decide which of the following types your essay is: DESCRIPTIVE If so, how is it organised: line by line? thematically? etc. ARGUMENTATIVE If so, what are the main conflicting positions or theories you are evaluating? EXPERIMENTAL If so, what did you actually do to provide evidence that might persuade your reader? Now reconsider the question you were answering. Do you now think the way of organising your essay was in fact the best way of approaching the topic? Assess possible alternatives. (5) Pick an essay question (either from our list in Chapter 1, or from work prescribed during your course). List on a piece of paper all the presuppositions you think the title contains (as we have done above, pp. 63–5). Now underline all the presuppositions in your list which seem to you to require justification or refutation, leaving others which you feel are relatively uncontroversial. Now consider those that you did not underline. Is it possible to identify the considerations which lead you to believe that these presuppositions don't need justification or explanation in your essay?"
ACA ACA-HXH-006 -0.24 "Grammar, punctuation and spelling You may have learned English as a child or as an adult. But no matter how fluently you speak English you are likely to have at least some problems when you write it. This chapter is about a number of the problems you may face in writing words (e.g. spelling) and in writing sentences (e.g. punctuation and ""grammar"" ). This chapter comes after the chapter on writing the essay because it is likely to be most useful to you when you come to re-read and correct what you have written. 6.1 MISTAKES AND VARIATION Different users of English speak and write English differently. Whereas Scots generally write ""colour"" and Australians write ""I know the answer"" , Americans generally write ""color"" and Indians in many circumstances write ""I am knowing the answer"" . No one owns English, and no one has a natural right to tell other English speakers how to use it. When people publish prescriptive grammar books, or dictionaries which tell you how to spell words or style manuals which tell you how to punctuate, they are either making their own choice between different possible (in many cases, arbitrary) rules or conforming to rules which have been selected at some point by others from a range of possibilities and passed down through history. Of course, just because a rule could have been different doesn't mean that you should ignore it. If you ignore the rule which tells you to drive down the left- hand side of the road in Britain you may crash your car. Similarly, you can ""crash"" your essay by breaking the most influential — though finally arbitrary, simply conventional — rules of writing. Here is an example. Some people write ""it's cover"" (as in ""the book has on it's cover"" ), with possessive ""it"" followed by apostrophe and ""s"" . Books which give rules of punctuation will tell you that this is a mistake. Possessive ""its"" should be written without an apostrophe, just as possessive ""his"" is written without an apostrophe; only the ""it's"" which means ""it is"" should be written with an apostrophe. Should you follow this rule or not? It would be possible to argue that ""it's cover"" is just a different convention of punctuation, rather than a mistake. Perhaps it is not in the grammar books because the grammar books do not reflect how people actually use language. You can accordingly make a decision about using it's or its on the basis of what you gain and what you lose. Using a variation (possessive it's) means that you are asserting your right to your own language; but you may well also alienate your reader, who might decide that, at least in her or his view, ""you can't write properly"" . The variation might help your reader understand you and your writing, or it might hinder understanding of what you write. In the end, you have to make your own decision. But it is useful to know what the conventional rules are, and also to bear in mind who you are writing for. The relationship between you and your reader(s), especially in academic courses, is not generally an equal one. So this is one further factor to consider as you weigh up the alternatives. One solution to the problem is to think of the prescribed forms of standard written English as a sort of register: a variety to be used for specific purposes (including writing coursework essays and exam answers) which nevertheless may not be a variety that you identify much with, by comparison with the usage of your family and friends. In the rest of this chapter we discuss some common errors (or variations) in spelling, grammar and punctuation. (Note that we consider the related issues of the role of active and passive grammatical constructions in writing style elsewhere, in Chapter 4, pp. 83–4, and the use of inverted commas round quotations in Chapter 5, p. 106.) 6.2 SPELLING AND HOW WORDS ARE PUT TOGETHER A written word is a combination of letters, while a spoken word is a combination of sounds. Letters do not correspond exactly to sounds, with the consequence that knowing how to pronounce a word doesn't necessarily mean you know how to spell it (and vice versa). This mismatch between speaking and spelling leads to SPELLING MISTAKES. Spelling mistakes do not usually stop your writing being  understood, but in many contexts they carry undesirable connotations which you may wish to avoid ( ""doesn't read"" , ""illiterate"" , ""badly taught"" , etc.). Like any rules, spelling rules can be broken for particular effect, as in the poet Ezra Pound's dismissive spelling of ""culture"" as ""kulchur"" , or the hostile spelling of ""America"" as ""Amerika"" . Some of the differences between letters and sounds are: — the letters are the same wherever English is used, but the sounds of English (particularly vowel sounds) change dramatically from region to region; — there are far fewer letters than sounds, so that, for example , the five written vowels have to stand for two to three times as many spoken vowels; — two letters can stand for one sound (the letter-pair ""sh"" stands for a single sound), and one letter can stand for a sequence of two sounds (in our dialect, ""o"" in the word ""no"" stands for two sounds in sequence, a vowel first, followed by a ""w"" sound made with the lips); — the spelling of English was more or less fixed several hundred years ago; but the pronunciation keeps changing, so that even where a letter once corresponded more or less to a sound, now it may not; — there are (often rather obscure) conventions which have been adopted about spelling, which need to be learned. One example is the rule ""i before e except after c"" (hence ""believe"" not ""beleive"" , but ""conceive"" not ""concieve"" ). Understanding general differences between spelling and speaking may help you to improve your own spelling, and may make it more interesting to focus on spelling as an issue in your writing. And there is another aspect of the construction of a word which it may also be helpful to know something about: that some (particularly longer) words are built out of other words, by adding prefixes at the beginning or suffixes at the end. One simple example of this relates to the use of""s, discussed in the previous section. This is an example of a SUFFIX, which enables you to take a word and build another word from it. You can take the noun John, then add ""s and make a new word,"" John's "", meaning"" belonging to John"". (With nouns in the plural, such as students, the convention is simply to add an apostrophe, as in ""the students' books"" ; with names already ending in ""s"" , apostrophe ""s"" is still generally added — so Keats's, rather than Keats', though the apostrophe without an additional ""s"" is nearly always used for ancient classical names, as in Augustus'.) What is interesting here, however, is that the word its (the possessive pronoun, meaning ""belonging to it"" ) is not built by taking it and adding 's to it. Instead (and this runs against our intuitions, hence the likelihood of mistakes in this area), its is a single, complete word which does not contain a suffix. So it is worth remembering that there is another, different suffix, s, which expresses plural and which does not have an apostrophe. You can take poem, add s, and get the plural poems; poem's is accordingly an incorrect way of writing the plural of poem because you have used the wrong suffix. (Use of""s to indicate plurals is a very common error in essays, especially with dates: so, the 1920s, not the 1920's.) Thinking about the way a word is put together can sometimes help you to remember how to spell it. You can remember how to spell ""repetition"" (not ""repitition"" ), for instance, by remembering the related word ""repeat"" which has ""e"" ; ""repetition"" is made by adding the suffix ""ition"" to ""repeat"" (and then cutting out the ""a"" ). Even the notorious ""one consonant or two?"" problem can sometimes be solved this way: ""reccommend"" can be seen to be the wrong spelling because the word is made by adding the prefix ""re"" to the word ""commend"" . It is even possible to use this method when there is no suffix involved: you can remember how to spell ""separate"" (not ""seperate"" ) by linking it with the loosely related word ""pair"" . It is often possible, then, to understand and so overcome spelling errors, once you understand why you are making an error and can work out a way of reminding yourself of the correct form. For example, if you spell ""existence"" as the incorrect ""existance"" , you could try to understand why — in this case, because there are two suffixes, one ""-ence"" and another ""-ance"" , and you have chosen to add the wrong one to ""exist"" (the two suffixes are confusingly pronounced basically the same). Spelling ""incorporate"" as the incorrect ""encorporate"" is similar, this time because you have chosen the prefix ""en"" instead of the prefix ""in"" . For each word you have problems spelling, try to think of a reason why. Even if the reason doesn't seem fully convincing, or seems in itself unimportant, the process of analysing the word can sometimes serve as a trigger which enables you to remember the correct spelling. Thinking about why you make particular mistakes (rather than just resigning yourself to being ""a bad speller"" ) is one way of overcoming spelling problems. It is also important to develop the habit of checking words in your own writing. Do this as a separate routine after writing if you are concerned not to interrupt the flow of composition. Use a dictionary — almost any English dictionary is adequate for this purpose; and check all words of which you are even a little unsure. It is easy to become complacent and just feel that most of the words are probably right even when they aren't. However you organise your checking routine, it is crucial to present written work which has been checked over for spelling. The credibility of your work will suffer severely if key words, such as technical terms or people's names, are misspelled. After all, what would you, as a reader — even as a reader sympathetic to language variation and unpersuaded by prescriptive manuals — be likely to make of an essay on symbolism which repeatedly tells you that things are ""symbollic"" ? 6.3 GRAMMAR: HOW SENTENCES ARE PUT TOGETHER Grammatical errors and grammatical variations can arise when you put words together into phrases and phrases together into a sentence. There has been a lot of work — both recently and in different traditions over a very long historical period — on how sentences are put together. The details of how sentences work are very complicated; and even now no one understands fully what the actual rules governing the combination of words and phrases in any given language are. (It is possible to learn about aspects of sentence structure by studying linguistics, specifically the part of linguistics called SYNTAX.) One by-product of investigations into grammar has been the production of introductory books like Teach Yourself English Grammar, and A University Grammar of English, which provide accounts of most basic aspects of sentence formation. What we say in this chapter is simplified. But we hope it will be helpful with some of the more common grammatical problems writers run into. Before beginning our discussion, however, we should perhaps emphasise once more the distinction between an error and a variation. Class, regional and ethnic variation is a source of difference between people as regards ways of writing a sentence; but, just as in spelling, there are STANDARD forms of written grammar, which are intended to override differences and be common to everyone. Even so, there is no unchallengeable rule book or authority you can turn to which will tell you exactly what is standard and what is not. 6.4 GRAMMATICAL WORDS AND THE USE OF ""THE""  GRAMMATICAL WORDS typically have very specialised meanings and can be particularly difficult for non-native speakers to learn. Among the grammatical words which cause problems are the prepositions (words like ""of"" , ""on"" , ""to"" , etc.); choosing the right one can sometimes be difficult, as in the following example: impediments of industrial advances The preposition here should be to. Grammatical words and grammatical objects like suffixes (as we have seen — expressing possession, plurality or past/present tense) are a particular problem in writing, particularly for non-native speakers, and we will see further examples of this. One of the hardest problems to confront, though, is the correct use of ""the"" (the definite article), a word which has no direct equivalent in many languages. Here are some sentences (written by people whose first language is not English) where we would not have used ""the"" : No movement in the British literary history before Aestheticism… Art deals with the non-existent, unreal, abstract and decorative images. I want to undertake the postgraduate study in Britain. Now here are two cases where we think ""the"" should have been used (__ indicates where we would put ""the"" ): In __1950s the Theatre of the Absurd developed. …and were part of the hierarchic domesticity which society, __ bourgeoisie in particular, acted upon. Even though we can be quite sure that we would use ""the"" in these examples, it remains difficult to explain exactly how we decide. This is typical of what it involves to speak a language fluently: you can do something consistently and in agreement with other speakers without being able to explain why. This description of ""fluency"" is hardly helpful to anyone who is having difficulty with English grammar or idioms, however. So what we will try to do is to work out a preliminary understanding of the conventions which tell English speakers when to use ""the"" . As elsewhere in this chapter (and book), our basic assumption is that understanding leads to learning.  ""The"" is used to introduce a NOUN PHRASE, or a group of words centring on a noun which together name something (the noun phrase is given in boldface in the above examples). What ""the"" does is to tell the reader that what the noun phrase names is something (or belongs to a group of things) which is already familiar to the reader. In the above examples, ""the"" has a meaning something like ""the phrase which follows names something which belongs to a group which is already familiar to you"" . So we say ""the 1950s"" because, as part of an implied group of decades (the 1940s, the 1960s, etc.) the 1950s form part of a common way of categorising the passing years. And we say ""the bourgeoisie"" because the bourgeoisie forms part of a familiar group of class types: the working class, the upper class, etc. It is exactly this kind of function which gives the first three examples their odd effect. By saying ""the postgraduate study"" , the writer is implying that there is a familiar group of types of study — the undergraduate study, the postdoctoral study, etc., rather like the classification of decades or social classes. But this intuitive classification does not exist in an analogous way. So the only justification for saying ""the postgraduate study"" would be if the writer had already named a group of types of study (so creating the classification), and then compared the postgraduate element with an element of undergraduate studies. Thus something of the effect of using ""the"" with postgraduate study might be seen in the following (still slightly unidiomatic) example: Of the two phases of study which I want to pursue, I want to undertake the postgraduate study in Britain and the undergraduate study in America. Our discussion of these examples suggests that you can use ""the"" if you have already created a situation where you are naming a group of which the ""the"" phrase indicates a subgroup. Consider in this light the following modification to one of the other examples given above; all we have done is to add a group of things ( ""kinds of images"" ) of which the relevant phrase can be treated as a part: There are various kinds of images which can be explored. Art deals with the non-existent, unreal, abstract and decorative images. Science deals with the existent, real, concrete and functional images. One problem for the non-native speaker of English is to decide when a group can be assumed to be familiar. For example, the group ""types of class"" (giving ""the bourgeoisie"" ) seems established, but not the group ""types of study"" (so disallowing ""the postgraduate study"" ). Knowing these sorts of convention seems to be as much part of knowledge of the culture as knowledge of the language. So solving the difficulty involves a combination of understanding with memorisation of particular examples. 6.5 THE PRESENT AND THE PAST TENSE, the grammatical expression of time, is a source of two distinct kinds of problem, each of which we should consider. One problem relates to the grammatical word ""have"" when it is used to express past tense (the ""perfect"" use of ""have"" ): Women have been particularly targeted in magazines, especially during the Second World War, when the British government has realised the importance of women's magazines as a channel of communication. Native speakers of English typically use ""have"" in the present tense (as in these two examples) only when they want to imply that the event described is still happening or is still the case. So we understand the first ""have"" to mean that women are still targeted — which in this instance probably isn't the meaning the writer intends. The second ""have"" (= ""has"" ) seems odd because the realisation happened only during the Second World War and is now clearly finished. The second problem involving tense relates to whether you should use the present or the past tense in your writing. It is generally the present tense which is used when you describe a text, even when you describe it in terms which place it in the past (e.g. by mentioning the author): In Los Gusanos (1991) John Sayles describes Miami as it was in the early 1980s. He constructs a complex set of interrelationships between the different ethnic groups. It would sound odd to put this description into the past tense, with ""described"" and ""constructed"" , unless you were deliberately emphasising the the fact that this book was produced at a particular point in the past, for example in order to compare it explicitly with a book written more recently. The present tense is generally also used when telling a story, as in a summary of the narrative of a novel. The present tense is used in this case because it carries a sense of immediacy and impact. Past tense, on the other hand, is generally used for describing situations or narrating events outside the work(s) you are discussing, such as those of national or cultural history or the development of literary traditions. Once you have decided which tense to use for a particular section of your essay, check that you are consistent — do not for example start a narrative in one tense and later change into another, unless you have a very good reason for doing so. 6.6 CO-REFERENCE One of the techniques of cohesion (see Chapter 5, p. 100) is that instead of repeating a phrase, it is possible to use what are called grammatical words like pronouns ""it"" , ""he"" , ""she"" , ""they"" , or demonstratives like ""this"" . However, this too can be a source of writing difficulties. Usually you would use the demonstrative ""this"" rather than the pronoun ""it"" to refer to a text; that is, you would not do as the following writer has done: Serrusalmus by Lesley Glaister. It is about an amazing patient of ""Agoraphobia"" , Marjorie. Instead, the writer should have simply combined these into a single sentence without ""It"" , or kept two sentences but replaced ""It"" with ""This text"" . A common problem with co-referential items like pronouns and demonstratives arises when it is not clear what they refer to: Sir William Lucas is ""in earnest contemplation of the greatness before him"" and his daughter Maria ""frightened almost out of her senses"" when they meet Lady Catherine at Rosings, which expresses their simplicity and nature to be easily impressed by grandeur and presentation. This is not surprising, since Sir William had been knighted… The difficulty here lies in what ""this"" refers to in the second sentence. Is it (a) how Sir William Lucas feels, or (b) how Maria feels, or (c) the relation between their feelings and their ""simplicity and nature"" , or (d) some combination of these? (Notice, too, an analogous problem with ""which"" in the preceding sentence.) The writer of this essay should have noticed the possibility of an ambiguity or difficulty for the reader in tracing the reference back, and could have solved the problem by replacing the ambiguous word ""this"" with a phrase which makes clear who or what is being referred to, such as, perhaps ""That Sir William should feel this is not surprising since he had been knighted.""  6.7 SUBJECT AND VERB The beginning of most written sentences fits a pattern or template which we can represent like this: subject phrase —(optional) auxiliary verbs — verb… The SUBJECT is a phrase: usually a group of words, generally centred around a noun, which together name something. Between the subject and the verb there can be various words, including the perfect ""have"" discussed in the last section (an example of an optional auxiliary verb). Two familiar  mistakes in written English (made even by fluent native speakers) occur between the subject and the verb: one involves ""agreement"" , the other involves punctuation. We look first at the agreement problem, and come to the punctuation problem as part of a more general discussion of punctuation. In many grammar books you will find a rule which says that the subject AGREES WITH the verb. This rule refers to the fact that a subject which is (or is centred around) a singular noun is followed by a verb which has the suffix s added to it. In older forms of English (roughly until the sixteenth century), and in many other languages, there is much more agreement than this; so it may be the leftover, or residual nature of agreement in English which is the source of its difficulty. Certainly some dialects of English (such as Urban Black English in the USA) have developed further, to the point where there is no agreement at all. Here are some examples where the subject does not agree with the verb (i.e. these will therefore generally be classed as ""mistakes"" ). The main noun in the subject is boldfaced, the verb is italicised. The study of commercial advertisements in general aim to isolate a single issue. Advocates of Northrop-Frye-style genre analysis believes… The analysis of the adverts demonstrate that… The use of ambiguity and puns are another feature… In each of these sentences the subject contains several nouns. And in each subject, the central noun (the one in bold face which defines the basic meaning of the subject) is the first one. The writers have mistakenly made the verb agree not with this noun but with the final noun in the subject. For example, in the first case, it is the study which aims to isolate the issue (and so ""study"" should agree with the verb), and not the advertisements which aim to isolate the issue. The following sentence shows a slightly different (but also common) agreement error. This chapter deals with the different linguistic choices that shapes women's magazine advertisements. Shapes should agree with choices (i.e. it should be ""choices that shape…"" ) but the intervening ""that"" seems to have interfered, as though it is taken to be a singular subject. A third common agreement error involves sentences which begin with ""There is"" or ""There are"" , with the real subject shifted to later in the sentence. It is this shifted subject which decides whether the verb is singular ""is"" or plural ""are"" : In some cases there was plenty of references to the protagonist's body parts. Here the verb should have been ""were"" because of plural ""references"" . Another common error involving the match between subject and verb involves unrelated (or so-called ""dangling"" ) participles, which occur when a participle used at the beginning of a sentence does not match with the grammatical subject of the sentence. (A PARTICIPLE is a verb form ending in ""-ing"" or ""-ed"" .) Unrelated participles do not usually seriously impede a reader's understanding, but they are generally considered incorrect forms. Consider the following example (with the unrelated participle italicised): Having discussed this poem's beginning, the next stanza shows a marked change of mood. The writer means that she or he has discussed the poem's meaning, but the sentence literally says that the next stanza discusses the poem's beginning (an unintended meaning). This is because ""the next stanza"" is interpreted as the subject of the dangling participle. Compare: Encouraged by the success of her early publications, Charlotte Brontë gave over increased amounts of time to writing. Here, by contrast, it is Charlotte Brontë who is the implied subject of ""encouraged"" ; and she is also the grammatical subject of the sentence. So in this last example the participle form does match up and produces a grammatically well-formed sentence. 6.8 PUNCTUATION Punctuation is a way of showing your reader the structure of your sentences: it separates successive units (such as sentences by full stops, or items in a list by commas) and specifies what function words have (for example when an apostrophe indicates possession). Conventions of punctuation have changed (and some writers, such as William Blake, Emily Dickinson and Samuel Beckett, have experimented with different, personalised conventions). The basic conventions for the four most common punctuation marks are: The FULL STOP (also called a PERIOD or FULL POINT) Put a full stop (.) at the end of a complete sentence (i.e. a sentence which at least contains a verb). Be careful not to break up a sentence with a full stop: Although she was a mentally ill person who lived in her own mind and was allocated a limited number of mental processes. She was determined to act, to do something about this predator. Here, the writer has put a full stop between ""processes"" and ""she"" , probably because the whole sentence (with a comma instead of a full stop) would have been long. But this is incorrect because the ""Although…processes"" clause is adverbial (see below under discussion of commas,), and so should be separated from the ""She…predator"" part by a comma. SEMICOLON Put a semicolon (;) between two complete clauses (in linguistics often called ""sentences"" ) to make them one larger sentence: The next verse is significantly longer than the first; this can be understood as a symbolic representation of the importance of its contents. Whenever you use a semicolon, note that you also had the option of using a full stop instead. Putting two sentences together into one sentence, instead of keeping them as separate sentences, indicates a certain degree of closeness between them. ( ""Closeness"" here means association of meaning or way of dealing with related topics, not simply physical closeness.) COLON Put a colon (:) between two complete clauses to make them one larger sentence: The difference between Pip and the other characters appears again when we see how people deal with this: Pip continues to show Estella that he still wants her, never giving up. This ""instruction"" for how to use a colon is the same as the instruction for how to use a semicolon. Both are used to put two sentences together into one. The specific effect of using a colon instead of a semicolon is to suggest that what comes next is a more specific example, or an explanation, of what was said in the first sentence. Thus colons are used to expand and explain; semi-colons tend to introduce thoughts connected in other ways. COMMA The comma (,) is the most commonly used punctuation mark inside a sentence. It is not normally used between two complete sentences (where a semicolon or colon is used instead), but is used to separate off various supplementary things in a sentence. These include: * Two complete sentences where the second sentence begins with ""and"" , ""but"" , or ""or"" (though this usage varies depending on the ""dialect"" of written English you use): This is Dickens's final comment, and in future he avoided the topic of school education. * A comment (not in itself a complete clause) about the main clause — like the comments in italics below, which may include indications of time, place and manner (and which are called ADVERBIALS): Whenever she leaves the house, the heroine seems to become bolder. Lawrence concentrated on writing rather than painting, which was fortunate. * Additional information is added in a phrase or clause placed next to(in APPOSITION with) something already named in the sentence which it also refers to. In such cases, commas are placed both before and after the added phrase or clause (which is italicised in the examples which follow). Melville's great novel, Moby Dick, is in many ways a troublesome one. The pagan, who with his tattoos and shrunken heads appears to be a terrible savage in the beginning, turns out to be the most noble character in the novel. Many writers incorrectly put a comma only before the appositive element and forget to put one after it as well. Generally, when you wish to punctuate a piece of optional, additional information or an aside that you are embedding in the middle of a sentence — for example with commas, dashes or brackets — then whatever punctuation you use should be placed both before and after the added element to signal its boundaries, not just at one end or the other. In many cases, however, despite the existence of general conventions it remains a writer's personal decision whether to use a comma or not. Some people like using commas and others prefer not to. Commas help your reader to understand the structure of a sentence, but like any other kind of detailed structuring they risk interfering with reading instead of helping it. Punctuation has sometimes been used to imitate the pauses a speaker might make if reading a sentence aloud, and commas often keep something of this function still. As an example of how punctuation rules work, consider the rule which forbids you inserting a comma to separate the subject and the verb. Despite this rule, writers commonly do this, as can be seen from the following examples: The quasi-totality of students in my department, opted for English… However, a close analysis of his individual texts, has been under-researched… Existing biographical, historical and philosophical works on Oscar Wilde, have enhanced our knowledge and understanding of his literary personality… These are interesting cases of punctuation. It is possible that the writers may have decided, in each case, that the rule had to be broken in order to help the reader follow the sentence. Evidently in each sentence the purpose of the comma is to tell you that an unusually long subject has finished and that the verb is about to follow. But is it a good idea to break the punctuation rule, even for such a reason? It is arguable that the reader may actually be confused rather than helped by the deviation from convention, precisely because she or he is expecting you to conform to the rules of punctuation. The question of keeping to convention versus innovating is particularly acute in this kind of example; and on balance it may be a good idea to reformulate problematic sentences slightly so that they can follow punctuation conventions and be clear at the same time. Another place where writers put commas ""illegally"" is between a verb which describes saying and the sentence which presents what is said: …what John Clarke calls, ""the subcultural bricoleurs"" … This example is an interesting one because different people have different views about whether or not it is in fact ""illegal"" . We think the writer probably used a comma here in imitation of a similar kind of example,""John Clarke said, 'these are subcultural bricoleurs…' ""We ourselves would not have used a comma in the example above because we think in that example there is a greater degree of interdependence between the parts of the sentence. In this rather similar example, however, we think it is much clearer that the comma is a mistake and far less likely that it is simply a style variant: This has the implication that, novel-writing in Wales… The writer probably put a comma to indicate that a new sentence was starting. But the comma confusingly hides the close grammatical relation between ""implication that"" and the sentence which follows. Our way of viewing these difficulties with commas suggests a significant point about punctuation in general: you use commas (and other forms of punctuation including dashes and brackets round parentheses such as this one) where there are identifiable breaks between the parts of a sentence. You use semicolons and colons to indicate specific relationships between sentences that you wish to connect together into a larger, composite sentence. But decisions about exactly when to use each type of punctuation vary from writer to writer. It is difficult to establish precise rules. As you punctuate, however, remember that departures from convention result in writing which appears incorrect and which can be difficult to understand. 6.9 SUMMARY, SUGGESTIONS AND EXERCISES Summary The main point we have made in this chapter is that in a relatively formal style such as that of academic essay-writing, much of the impact and credibility of what you write is achieved by the way it conforms to conventions. Such conventions cover many aspects of writing, including grammar, spelling and punctuation; and for this reason, it is important to develop routines to ensure that your work is presented appropriately in these areas. Working through a series of commonly occurring problems, we have identified relevant conventions and suggested strategies for avoiding mistakes. Specific suggestions * Where spelling is concerned, try to understand your mistakes in terms of the relationship between sounds and letters, and the construction of some words out of suffixes and prefixes. Understanding sources of error may help you to remember correct forms (see pp. 116–17). * Check over your drafts, and separate the overall process of writing from the more mechanical process of checking for correct spellings, grammar, etc. (see p. 117). * Use reference books, to help you understand your mistakes and to act as a guide (see p. 118). * If you are not a native speaker of English, learn where your weak spots are and check them; you may well have problems with choosing the right preposition, inserting ""the"" correctly, or using ""have"" with the correct meaning (see pp. 119–21). * Use the present tense for describing the content of a text or narrating the story. Make sure that you use tense consistently in a passage (see p. 121). * Use a pronoun only when it is completely clear what it refers to (see p. 122). * Pay particular attention to the relationship between the subject and the verb in a sentence: check agreement, watch for unrelated participles, and remove intervening commas as necessary (see pp. 122–4). * Remember that a semicolon can be used instead of a full stop, but a comma normally cannot (see p. 125). * Use commas to help your reader understand the structure of your sentences (see pp. 125–8). Exercise (1) The following passage, which is the closing section of an essay on the central issues raised by the play Hamlet, contains a number of spelling, punctuation and grammatical errors. Using suitable reference sources if necessary, correct the mistakes in the way that you might do going through a piece of your own before submission. At the same time, amend other aspects of presentation (such as register, use of quotations, etc.) in ways suggested in this and previous chapters. Hamlet is up against not just a man, but a king, he will have to strike when the king is unarmed, And he would also have to be able to explain his actions, and yet even his mother does not believe him, but only see him as mad  ""Hamlet thou has't cleft my heart in twain.""  To conclude, the play does give us the answers to the questions we demand from Hamlet, we understand the delay's he makes in killing Claudius due to the nature of his thoughts, he is concerned with the future of his soul and this seems to me the central issue in Shakespeare's Hamlet."
ACA ACA-J57-004 -10.79 "THE UNCODIFIED CONSTITUTION A CONSTITUTION MAY BE DEFINED as a body of laws, customs, and conventions that define the composition and powers of organs of the state and that regulate the relations of the various state organs to one another and to the private citizen. The United States has a constitution; so does the United Kingdom. Expressed in purely formal terms (Table 4.1) there is very little similarity between them. Indeed, the differences are such that to the student weaned on a study of the United States Constitution, the British Constitution is nearly incomprehensible. Even to the student of British politics it is not well understood. Nonetheless, the differences should not be emphasized to the exclusion of certain common features. Both Constitutions are strong ones in that they reflect and reinforce their respective political cultures. The United States Constitution is considered by Americans to embody the principles of a higher law, to constitute ""in fact imperfect man's most perfect rendering of what Blackstone saluted as"" the eternal immutable laws of good and evil, to which the creator himself in all his dispensations conforms: and which he has enabled human reason to discover, so far as they are necessary for the conduct of human actions."" As the embodiment of a higher law, it thus not only needs to be distinguished from ordinary law but also needs to be protected from the passing whims of politicians — hence the introduction of extraordinary procedures for its amendment. By contrast, the British Constitution is admired by Britons for reflecting   the wisdom of past generations, as the product of experience — in short, a constitution that stipulates what should be on the basis of what has proved to work rather than on abstract first principles. The empirical orientation to change that underpins such a constitution also favors flexibility in amendment: as conditions change, so some amendment may be necessary. Formal extraordinary procedures for its amendment have not been found necessary. The differences in political culture have thus produced somewhat different constitutions, but the attachment to them is similar in the two countries. Also, as we shall see, there are certain similarities in sources in the means of interpretation. New nations from the eighteenth century onward have found it both necessary and useful to codify their constitutions. At the time that the Founding Fathers promulgated the United States Constitution in Philadelphia, a written constitution was exceptional. Today it is the norm. Having lacked the opportunity to create a new constitutional framework afresh from first principles, Britain now stands out as one of the few nations lacking such a document. FORMS OF EXPRESSION The absence of a written constitution similar to that of the United States and other nations has led to the British Constitution being described as unwritten, but such a description is misleading. As we shall see, various elements of the Constitution find expression in forma, written enactments. What distinguishes the British Constitution from others is not that it is unwritten, but rather that it is part-written and uncodified. The lack of codification is of especial importance. It makes it difficult to identify clearly and authoritatively what constitute the provisions of the Constitution. there are certain principles that are clearly at the heart of the Constitution, parliamentary sovereignty being the prime example, but there are many provisions, be they expressed through statute law or the writings of constitutional experts, that are of constitutional significance but on which there is no clear agreement that they form part of the British Constitution. It is this lack of codified certainty that makes a study of it so fraught with difficulty. Because one cannot have recourse to one simple authoritative document to discover the provisions of the Constitution, one has instead to research four separate sources: statute law, common law, conventions, and works of authority. Such sources are also relevant in analyses of the United States Constitution. Congress may pass measures of constitutional significance, for example, certain stipulations of electoral law or the War Powers Act. Provisions of the Constitution are developed and molded by judicial decisions. In seeking to interpret the Constitution, the courts may have recourse to works by constitutional experts. The difference between the two countries is that in Britain such sources are primary sources, and in the United States, the primary source is the written document. SOURCES Of the four sources, statute law is perhaps the best understood and nowadays, the most extensive. It provides the main source for the part-written element of the Constitution. It comprises acts of Parliament and subordinate legislation made under the authority of the parent act. Many acts of Parliament that have been passed clearly merit the title of constitutional law. Acts that define the powers of the various state organs (for example, the 1911 and 1949 Parliament Acts) and acts that define the relationship between Crown and Parliament (notably the Bill of Rights of 1689), between the component elements of the nation (the Act of Union with Scotland of 1706, for example ), between the United Kingdom and the European Communities (the 1972 European Communities Act), and between the state and the individual (as with the Habeas Corpus Act of 1679 or the Administration of Justice Act of 1960) clearly constitute important provisions of the Constitution. They are published in authoritative, written form and, as acts of Parliament, are interpreted by the courts. This is the most important of the four sources both in quantitative and qualitative terms. It has increasingly displaced common law as the most extensive form of law in Britain and it is the most definitive of the four. It takes precedence over any conflicting common law and is superior to the conventions of the Constitutions and to works of authority. It precedence derives from the concept of parliamentary sovereignty. Common law constitutes the law and customs of ancient lineage that have been upheld as law by the courts in cases decided before them. Once a court has upheld a provision as being part of common law it creates a precedent to be followed by other courts. In past centuries, when few statutes were enacted, common law constituted the main body of English law; today, it has been largely but not wholly displaced by statute law. Certain principles derived from common law remain fundamental to the Constitution, and these include the principle of parliamentary sovereignty. Under the heading of common law comes also prerogative powers — the powers and privileges recognized by common law as belonging to the monarch. Although many prerogative powers have been displaced by statute, many matters at the heart of government are still determined under the authority of the prerogative. These include the appointment of ministers, the making of treaties, and power of pardon, the dispensing of honors, and the declaration of war. By convention, such powers are normally exercised formally by the monarch on the advice of ministers (the ministers, in practice, take the decisions). There is no formal requirement that Parliament assent to such decisions. This is in stark contrast to the position in the United States, where Congress alone has the formal power to declare war and the Senate's consent is necessary for the ratification of treaties and the appointment of federal public officers. (In practice, the differences are not that great: ""presidential wars"" have been waged without a congressional declaration of war, while in Britain a government taking military action abroad will seek the consent of Parliament.) In 1972, the Treaty of Accession to the European Communities was signed under prerogative powers. IN 1982, a naval task force was despatched to the Falkland Islands under the same authority. Although diminishing in number, prerogative powers clearly remain of great importance. Generally included under the generic heading of common law is the  judicial interpretation of statute law. Unlike those in the United States, British courts have no power to hold a measure unconstitutional. They are limited to the interpretation of provisions of acts of Parliament. Even in exercising their power of interpretations, they are limited by rules of interpretation and by precedent. (The exception is the House of Lords, the highest domestic court of appeal, which is not now bound by its previous decisions.) Nonetheless, judges retain the power to distinguish cases and by their interpretation they can develop a substantial body of case law. In interpreting acts of Parliament, they assume Parliament to have meant what, on the face of it, the words of an act appear to mean. Unlike the United States Supreme Court, which can delve deep into the deliberations of the Founding Fathers to try to elucidate what was meant by a particular provision of the Constitution, British courts are not permitted to look at the proceedings of Parliament in order to determine what Parliament really meant. The third and least tangible source of the Constitution is that of convention. Conventions of the Constitution are most aptly described as rules that are considered binding by and upon those who are responsible for making the Constitution work, but rules that are not enforced by the courts or by the presiding officers in either house of Parliament. They derive their strength from the realization that not to abide by them would make for an unworkable constitution. They are, so to speak, the oil in the forma machinery of the Constitution. They help fill the gap between the constitutional formality and the political reality. For example, ministers are responsible formally to the monarch. Because of the political changes wrought in the nineteenth century, they are by convention responsible now also to Parliament. By convention, the government of the day resigns or requests a dissolution if a motion of no confidence is carried against it in the House of Commons. By convention, the monarch gives the Royal Assent to all legislative measures approved by Parliament. The last time a monarch refused assent was during the reign of Queen Anne (1702-1714). Queen Victoria in the nineteenth century contemplated refusing her assent to a measure but wiser counsels prevailed. No formal, authoritative documents set forth these rules, and they find no embodiment in statute law. The courts may recognize them, but the courts have no power to enforce them. They are complied with because of the recognition of what would happen if they were not complied with. For the Queen to refuse her assent to a measure passed by the two Houses of Parliament would draw her into the realms of political controversy, hence jeopardizing the claim of the monarch to be ""above politics.""  A government that sought to remain in office after losing a vote of confidence in the House of Commons would find its position politically intenable: it would lack the political authority to govern. For ministers to ignore Parliament completely would prove equally untenable. Some conventions may be described as being stronger than others. Some on occasion are breached, while others are adhered to without exception. On three occasions in this century, the convention of collective ministerial responsibility has been suspended temporarily by the prime minister of the day. In contrast, no government has sought to remain in office after losing a parliamentary vote of confidence. The point at which a useful and necessary practice is accorded the status of a constitutional convention is not clear. Once a practice has become well established in terms of the relationship within or between different organs of the state, finding recognition in works of authority and by those involved in its operation, then it may be said to have reached the status of a convention. At any one time, though, there are a number of relationships that may be said to be in a constitutional haze. Is it a convention of the Constitution that the government of the day must consult with interested bodies before formulating a legislative measure for presentation to Parliament? Prime Minister Harold Wilson appeared to give some credence to this view in 1966 when he said in the House of Commons that it was the duty of the government to consult with the Trades Union Congress and the Confederation of British Industry. Few other authorities have supported Jennings' assertion and it has not found acceptance by most practitioners of government. It is usual for governments to engage in such consultation, but it is not yet a convention of the Constitution that they do so. The fourth and final source of the Constitution is that of works of authority. These have persuasive authority only. What constitutes a ""work of authority"" is rarely defined. Various early works are accorded particular standing by virtue of the absence of statutes or other written sources covering a particular area. The statements of their writers are presumed to be evidence of judicial decisions that have been lost and are therefore accepted if not contrary to reason. Among the most important early sources are Fitzherbert's Abridgment (1516) and Coke's Institutes of the Law of England (1628-1644). More recent works have been called in aid on those occasions when jurists and others have sought to delineate features of the contemporary Constitution; this has been the case especially in determining the existence or otherwise of conventions. Such conventions are prescribed neither by statute nor by judicial interpretation, so one must study instead scholarly interpretations of political behaviour and practice. Especially important authoritative works in the nineteenth century were those by John Austin and A. V. Dicey. Important names in the twentieth century have included Sir Ivor Jennings, Sir Kenneth Wheare, O. Hood Phillips, and E. C. S. Wade. Given the disparate sources of the Constitution and the fact that important relationships within and between organs of the state are not laid down in any one formal or binding document, it is not surprising that one must have recourse to books by constitutional scholars to discover the extent and nature of those relationships. Works of authority tend to be consulted more  frequently in the field of constitutional law than in any other branch of English law. Given the disparate primary sources of the Constitution and the difficulty in determining where the Constitution begins and ends, it is perhaps not surprising that there are no extraordinary procedures for its amendment. Statute and common law of constitutional significance are subject to amendment by the same process as that employed for other legislative enactments. Conventions can be modified by changes in behaviour or by reinterpretations of the significance of certain behaviour. Works of authority can be rewritten or subjected to different interpretations in the same way as can other texts. MEANS OF AMENDMENT Much the same can be said about constitutionally significant statute law, judicial decisions, and works of authority in the United States. Even the provisions of the formal document, the United States Constitution, may be amended by judicial decisions and custom usage. The difference between the two countries is that the formal wording of the United States Constitution can be amended only by an extraordinary process, i.e., one that goes beyond the provisions employed for amending the ordinary law. (Because of the extraordinary procedures necessary for amendment, the provisions of the Constitution are sometimes referred to as ""entrenched."" ) No such formal amending procedures exist in Britain, where there is no formal document. As may be surmised from the foregoing, there is no single body endowed with the responsibility for interpreting the provisions of the Constitution. As in the United States, statute and common law are subject to judicial interpretation, but there is no power of judicial review, at least not as the term is understood in the United States. The courts cannot declare a legislative measure or an executive action contrary to the provisions of the Constitution. INTERPRETATION The courts can influence and to some extent mold certain provisions through their interpretation of statute and common law. Indeed, their use of common law has been of especial importance in outlining and protecting certain rights of the individual. However, at the end of the day, they are subject to the wishes of Parliament. Judicial interpretation of statute law can be overridden by a new act of Parliament. By virtue of the concept of parliamentary sovereignty, the act would be definitive. The judges serve to enforce and interpret such acts: they cannot strike down an act. Identification and interpretation of conventions has little to do with the  courts. Conventions arise as a result of changes in the relationships within and between different organs of the state. Their delineation rests with scholars, and their enforcement rests with those at whom they are aimed. As with conventions, they are beyond the purview of the courts. The Constitution, in short, is subject to interpretation by different bodies, the most prominent being politicians, judges, and scholars. The same can be said of the United States Constitution, but in Britain there is no body that stands in a position analogous to that of the United States Supreme Court. It is an important difference, reflecting the differences in political culture. The Lockean basis of constitutional interpretation in the United States -a higher law cognizable by independent, rational magistrates operating free of outside interests — finds no parallel in Britain. The central provisions of the Constitution are listed in Table 4.1: parliamentary sovereignty, the rule of law, a unitary (as opposed to a federal) system, and what I have termed parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy. Although there is some dispute as to whether it should remain so, the preeminent provision is that of parliamentary sovereignty. In the nineteenth century, the great constitutional lawyer A. V. Dicey identified it as being one of the two main pillars of the Constitution, the other being that of the rule of law. Dicey's work has had a major and lasting impact. Despite subsequent criticisms, the two pillars identified by Dicey still stand. While some critics have considered them weak and unnecessary pillars, supporting a crumbing edifice, they remain crucial to an understanding of the British Constitution. MAIN PROVISIONS The most succinct definition of parliamentary sovereignty was offered by Dicey. Parliamentary sovereignty, he wrote, meant that Parliament had ""the right to make or unmake any law whatever; and, further, that no person or body is recognized by the law of England as having a right to override or set aside the legislation of Parliament.""  An act passed by Parliament would be enforced by the courts, the courts recognizing no body other than Parliament as having authority to override such an act. Parliament itself could substitute an act for an earlier one. One of the precepts derived from the principle is that Parliament is not bound by its predecessors. Once Parliament has passed an act, it becomes the law of the land. It is not open to challenge before the courts on the grounds of being unconstitutional. Although Dicey claimed more ancient lineage for it, the principle of parliamentary sovereignty became established as a judicial rule in consequence of the Glorious Revolution of 1688 and subsequent Bill of Rights, which established the relationship between the Crown and Parliament (see  Chapter 3). It was the product of an alliance between Parliament and lawyers and of the intimidation of judges by the House of Commons. Assertion of the principle served to do away with the monarch's previously claimed powers to suspend or dispense with acts of Parliament and it served to deny judges the power to strike down measures. It came to occupy a unique place in constitutional law. The principle finds no expression in statute or any other formal enactment. It exists in common law but enjoys a special status beyond that enjoyed by other principles of common law. Its underpinnings are not only legal but also political and historical. It is now too late to challenge the principle. Judicial obedience to it constitutes what H. W. R. Wade referred to as ""the ultimate political fact upon which the whole system of legislation hangs.""  No statute can confer the power of parliamentary sovereignty, for that would be to confer the very power being acted upon. It is therefore considered to be unique. As Hood Phillips states, ""It may indeed be called the one fundamental law of the British Constitution.""  The second pillar identified by Dicey was that of ""the rule of law.""  Identifying what is meant by the term is extremely difficult. Few students of the constitution would deny the important of the tenet. Dicey himself argued that it comprised ""at least three distinct though kindred conceptions"" : ""That no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary courts of the land"" ; that ""no man is above the law [and]every man, whatever be his rank or condition, is subject to the ordinary law of the realm and amenable to the jurisdiction of the ordinary tribunals"" ; and that ""the general principles of the constitution [are]the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the courts.""  These three conceptions have been subject to various criticisms: that many of the discretionary powers are vested in officials and public bodies, that many officials and bodies have powers and immunities that the ordinary citizen does not have, and that certain rights have been modified by or enacted in statute. Further it is not clear why Dicey's third conception should be considered ""kindred"" to the other two. Some students of the Constitution find Dicey's analysis useful, ad others tend to be dismissive. The important point for our purposes is that there is no agreed definition. The rule of law, then, stands as a central element of the British Constitution, but no one is sure precisely what it means. There is some common ground in that it is assumed to imply certain substantive and procedural rights, government must be subject to the law, and the judiciary must be independent. The problem is one of determining what those rights are, how they are to be protected, and how the independence of the judiciary is to be maintained. There is a further problem. The concept of the rule of law is not logically compatible with that of parliamentary sovereignty. Parliament could if it so  wishes confer arbitrary powers upon government. It could fetter the independence of the judiciary. It could limit or remove altogether certain rights presumed to exist at common law. The rule of law, in short, could be threatened or even dispensed with by parliamentary enactment. Dicey himself recognized this problem and sought to resolve it. He argued, in essence, that the rule of law prevented government from exercising arbitrary powers. If government wanted such powers, it could obtain them only through Parliament (Parliament itself has never sought to exercise executive powers) and the granting of them could take place only after deliberation and approval by the triumvirate of monarch, Lords, and Commons. Such an argument serves to explain potential impediments to a government intent on acquiring arbitrary powers. It does not deny the truth of the assertion that Parliament could, if it wished, confer such powers upon government. Indeed, many observers would argue that given the growth of cabinet government, the potential for government to seek and receive such powers is significantly greater now than was the case at the time when Dicey was writing. For many critics of the existing Constitution, parliamentary sovereignty no longer constitutes an encouragement to the rule of law but rather exists as an impediment to its attainment. So long as parliamentary sovereignty remains ""the one fundamental law"" of the Constitution, there is no way in which substantive rights can be entrenched and put beyond the reach of Parliament. The third feature of the Constitution that I have listed — that the United Kingdom is a unitary state — is a less difficult one to comprehend. The United States is a federal nation. The power vested in the federal government is that delegated in the United States Constitution: all other powers not delegated rest with the states or the people. In the United Kingdom, no powers are reserved to national or regional bodies. If they were, Parliament would not be omnicompetent. Parliament exercises legal sovereignty. It can confer certain powers and responsibilities upon regional and local authorities, and it can also remove those powers. The unitary nation is that of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Wales was integrated with England in 1536 by act of Parliament (the Laws in Wales Act), and Scotland and England were incorporated in 1707 by the Treaty of Union and by the Act of Union with Scotland. Ireland entered into legislative union in 1801. Following an armed uprising, the emergence of the Irish Free State was recognized in 1922 and given the status of a self-governing dominion. (The Irish Constitution of 1937 declared the country to be a sovereign independent state, a position recognized by the Westminster Parliament in 1949). Excluded from the Irish Free State were the northern six counties of Ireland, forming part of the traditional region of Ulster. The Protestant majority in Ulster wished to remain part of the United Kingdom, and the province of Northern Ireland has so remained. The fourth element of the constitution is one that I have described as a parliamentary government under a constitutional monarchy. It is this element that is especially important in terms of the current relationships among the different organs of the state and the one in which conventions of the Constitution are predominant. It constitutes an assembly of different relationships and powers, the product of traditional institutions being adapted to meet changing circumstances. The developments producing this form of government were sketched in Chapter 3. The results, as we have seen, were parliamentary government in the sense of government through Parliament rather than government by Parliament, with a largely ceremonial head of state. The essentials of this form of government may be adumbrated as follows. In the relationship among government, Parliament, and the monarch, the government dominates. Although lacking formal powers, the cabinet is recognized by convention as being at the heart of government. It is responsible for the final determination of policy to be submitted to Parliament, for the supreme control of the national executive in accordance with the policy prescribed by Parliament, and for the continuous coordination and delimitation of the interests of the several departments of state. It is presided over by the prime minister. The prime minister is appointed by the monarch. By convention, the monarch summons the leader of the party with a majority of seats in the House of Commons. (In the event of a party having no overall majority, the monarch summons whoever he or she believed may be able to form an administration). The prime minister then selects the members of his or her cabinet and other government ministers and submits their names to the monarch who, by convention, does not deny the prime minister's choice. By convention, ministers are drawn from Parliament and, again by convention, predominantly from the elected house, the House of Commons. Although the government is no longer chosen by the Commons, it nonetheless is elected through the House of Commons: there is no separate election of the executive. There is a separation and overlap of powers between the government and the House of Commons in Britain but no equivalent separation of personnel. Government ministers are drawn from, and remain within, Parliament. Formally, ministers are responsible to the monarch. By convention, they are responsible for their policies and actions to Parliament. Ministers are responsible to Parliament through the convention of individual ministerial responsibility which assigns to them control of their departments, for which they are answerable to Parliament. The cabinet is similarly responsible to Parliament through the convention of collective ministerial responsibility. This convention, one scholar writes, ""implies that all cabinet ministers assume responsibility for cabinet decisions and actions taken to implement those decisions.""  It also has begotten two other conventions. It is a corollary of collective responsibility that any minister who disagrees publicly  with a cabinet decision should resign and that a government defeat in the House of Commons on a vote of confidence necessitates either the resignation of the government or a request for a dissolution (there is no convention as to which of these alternatives the government should select). Party cohesion ensures that the cabinet usually enjoys a parliamentary majority, but political parties remain unknown to the Constitution. The cabinet approves government bills to be presented to Parliament. (In drawing up measures, it is aided primarily by its officials — that is, civil servants — and will consult normally with interested bodies: such consultation, though, enjoys no formal recognition in constitutional terms.) Within Parliament, the most important house is the Commons. The House is expected to submit bills to sustained scrutiny and debate before giving its assent to them (or not giving its assent to them, but the influence of party usually precludes such an outcome). Formally, the House is free to pass or reject bills as it wishes. The House of Lords is more constrained (see Chapter 3); it was forced to accept a restricted role under the terms of the 1911 and 1949 Parliament Acts. Under the provisions of the 1911 Act (a measure to which the Lords acquiesced under threat of being swamped with a mass of new Liberal pro-reform peers), the House could delay passage of nonmoney bills for only two successive sessions, such bills being enacted if passed by the Commons again the succeeding session. Money bills, those certified as such by the Speaker of the House of Commons, were to receive the Royal Assent one month after leaving the Commons, whether assented to by the House of Lords or not. The only significant power of veto retained was that over bills to prolong the life of a Parliament. (The delaying power over nonmoney bills was reduced by a further session under the terms of the 1949 Parliament Act, itself passed under the provisions of the 1911 Act.) In practice, it is rare for the Lords to reject government measures, and there is a gentleman's agreement among the parties in the House that a bill promised in a government's election manifesto should be given an unopposed Second Reading (see Chapter 11). Once a bill has received the assent of both Houses it then goes to the monarch for the Royal Assent. By convention, this assent is always forthcoming. As already mentioned, not since Queen Anne's reign has a monarch refused assent. Queen Victoria contemplated such refusal but was persuaded otherwise. By convention, the Queen exercises her powers on the advice of her ministers. In certain extreme circumstances, Her Majesty may find herself in a position in which she is called on to use her discretion in making a political decision. Such cases are rare, though the Queen would probably prefer them to be nonexistent. The strength and the value of the contemporary monarchy derives from being above and avoiding political decisions. The moment a bill receives the Royal Assent it becomes an act of Parliament. It is then enforced and upheld by the agencies of the state. It is binding and, by virtue of the doctrine of parliamentary sovereignty, cannot  be challenged by the courts, nor can it be overridden by any other authority. The development of a form of representative democracy in the nineteenth century led Dicey to distinguish between legal sovereignty, which continued to reside with the triumvirate of the monarch, Lords, and Commons, and political sovereignty, which he deemed to rest with the electorate. This somewhat clumsy distinction has a certain utility. The electorate may have the power to choose the members of the House of Commons but the will of the electorate is not something formally recognized by the courts. The courts recognize and will enforce only acts of Parliament. Under the provision of the 1911 Parliament Act, the maximum life of a Parliament is five years. (Previously, the period was seven years.) Within that period, the prime minister is free to recommend to the monarch a dissolution — in effect, to call a general election. Unlike the United States, Britain has no fixed-term elections at a national level. The ability of a prime minister effectively to call a general election has been regarded by some writers as the most important weapon in ensuring parliamentary support. The prime minister can threaten to recommend a dissolution if he or she does not receive the necessary support to get a measure through. Such a threat may constitute a bluff in that the prime minister would have more to lose if an election was called than would most MPs (the PM could lose office: most seats are safe seats and so most MPs could expect to be reelected), but nonetheless it has proved a potent influence in determining parliamentary behaviour. It would be exceptional, albeit not unknown, for MPs of the government party to vote against their own side on a vote of confidence. No government in the twentieth century has lost a vote of confidence as a result of dissent by its own supporters — hence the dominance of government. In summary, then, the fourth element of the Constitution — parliamentary government under a constitutional monarch — may be seen to comprise different relationships and powers. These relationships and powers are the product of traditional institutions being adapted to meet changing circumstances and are prescribed by a variety of measures of statute and common law and by convention. The working of the various relationships within the framework established by law and convention is made possible by the operation of bodies not formally recognized by the Constitution, namely political parties. To understand contemporary British politics, one has to understand the constitutional framework. As we shall see, to understand British politics fully one has also to go beyond that framework. The shifting and complex web of relationships and powers that forms the British Constitution is not an easily discernible one. There are some powers  and relationships that recognizably fall within the rubric of the Constitution. Others are less easy to classify. Sometimes a feature of the Constitution is discerned as such only at the time when it has just ceased to have much relevance. Walter Bagehot's The English Constitution, published in 1867, constituted a classic description of a Constitution that had not previously been so well sketched, yet a Constitution that was to undergo significant modifications as a result of the passage that very year of the Second Reform Act. Bagehot's work continued to be regarded as an authoritative work long after the Constitution had undergone fundamental change. CONCLUSION Grasping the essentials of the Constitution at any given moment is clearly a demanding and confusing task. It is confusing even to those charged with its interpretation and to those who seek to make it work. To the student of the subject, the British Constitution appears complex, confusing, ill defined, and in many respects amorphous. Such a reaction is both natural and understandable: the Constitution does exhibit those very characteristics. At the heart of the difficulty of delineating clearly the essential features of the Constitution is its ever-changing nature. Constitutional norms serve to influence and mold political behaviour. Conversely, political behaviour helps influence the contours of the Constitution. As we have seen, such changes are made possible by the assimilating influence of conventions.  ""The conventions of the constitution,"" as Professor LeMay observed,""have meaning only when they are looked at against a background of continuous political change. It is very difficult to say with certainty what they were at any particular moment. Above all, they cannot be understood ""with the politics left out."" "" The Constitution has proved adaptable to changing political conditions. In recent years, however, its relevance has been questioned. The patchwork quilt of powers and relationships stipulated by the Constitution has been criticized for being neither useful nor relevant in the political environment of the 1970s and 1980s. There is, as we shall see, pressure from many influential sources for the Constitution not only to be further amended but also to be radically altered. In some cases there are calls for a new constitutional settlement. It is this pressure for change and its implications that subsequent chapters will explore."

Jane Hall had booked into the Riverside Hotel, she walked over to the reception desk and rang the bell, hello I'm Jane Hall I've booked a weekend stay here, ah yes Miss Hall if you would just like to sign here, here's your key, your room is six floors up, third on the right, have a nice stay. She took the lift up to the sixth floor and came to the room one O nine, which was her room, as she entered she noticed cobwebs and dampness on the walls, she flung her bed, bags on the bed and went downstairs to supper, after her supper she went to report, she went to the reception desk to report the cobwebs and dampness, she rang the bell a few times but no one answered, she was just about to go back to her room when she heard Mr Sandy the receptionist in the back room talking to her assistant, I put the body in Miss Hall's wardrobe, Jane ran upstairs and sure enough there was a body, Jane rang the police then straight away, please could you come to the Riverside Hotel, there's something I think you should see, there was a knock at the door and Mr Sandy answered it, hello, oh hello we've just had phone call from here, are you sure this is the right hotel? Yes, well I didn't call, but I did said Jane, well you leave, well I'll leave you to it said Mr Sandy, if you would come upstairs, the policeman and Jane entered her room, please look in the cupboard, I think we've got a case Sarge, do you mind if I make a quick phone call? Go ahead, hello is Sergeant Briggs there please, if you would just hold for a minute, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep, hello this is Sergeant Briggs who's calling? Sergeant it's P C Garfield, Sergeant Huddersfield and myself are at the Riverside Hotel, we've just found a body in Miss Hall's wardrobe room one O nine, well could you describe him? He's about six foot two, short black hair, moustache, blue eyes and according to his record card he's twenty seven and his name is John Banks and he lives at 36 Church Hill Road, Upper Tracey, and we think he's been shot, I'll be right over, stay where you are. About fifteen minutes later Sergeant Briggs entered Jane's room, we'll take him back to the station and tomorrow we'll go around and ask a few questions. Oh by the way Miss Hall do you know anything, said P C Garfield, well said Jane I wasn't going to tell, but I think Mr Sandy and their assistant knows something about it, because about twelve thirty this morning I was going to report about the cobwebs and dampness on the walls and I heard Mr Sandy and his assistant talking in the back room. Well just that they had put the body in my wardrobe, that's a start thanks. The next day the policeman went where Mr Banks lived and they rang the bell, hello, hello are you Mrs Banks? Yes, yes I am. Well we've got some bad news about your son John, oh I think you'd better come in. Well what have you got to tell me about John? I'm afraid, I'm afraid, no, I am very sorry to tell you this but your son has been murdered said Sergeant Briggs, murdered, but how? He was shot, John my poor John, what am I going to tell his wife? He was married? Yes to a Mrs Stow before, I'm sorry we have to tell you like this, anyway do you know why he came to the hotel? Yes he had booked there for a week, I think it was for a business meeting with Mr Sandy, that's all I know. Mr Sandy, are you sure said P C Garfield? Yes he's the receptionist there isn't he? Yes he is, you've been a lot of help, thanks. At midday Sergeant Briggs and P C Garfield went back to the Riverside Hotel to talk to Mr Sandy. Do you know anything about Mr Bank's death said Sergeant Briggs? No, yes you do, don't lie, I heard you yesterday morning, twelve thirty, you were talking to your assistant in the, about you put the body in my wardrobe said Jane, okay I know something, in fact I know a lot more than all of you. I know who did it. Who said P C Garfield? Ah but that would be telling, just tell us said Jane, you really want to know don't you? Look stop playing games and tell us said Sergeant Brigg, okay it was me said Mr Sandy. I could of guessed said P C Garfield, but why? Well I was having an affair with his wife and I loved her so much I wanted to marry her, I wanted his land and his money, so I thought if he was out of the way it would be easier to get what I wanted and of course it was. I hope you know how many years you'll get for this said P C Garfield, of course I do I'm not stupid. Well if you come with me sir, I think it's gonna be about eighteen years for you mate, said Sergeant Briggs, thanks for all your work Jane, that's alright Sarge, a quiet weekend that's all I wanted, some weekend this has turned out to be said Jane  Very good, right, good, let's hear yours I'll just read this bit  and we'll talk about it later on, yes go on. If you Liz, Elizabeth pretending to be Jessica or is Elizabeth really Elizabeth. Chapter one, Elizabeth was sitting comfortably on a low branch on a tall pine tree in the Wakefield's back garden, she had her knees up round her chin and was leaning against the trunk, this was Elizabeth's thinking seat, the place that she went to be alone, there was a lot to think about, tomorrow Mrs, Mr Davis her form teacher would announce the winner of the class essay contest. Elizabeth had written about saving the world and she thought her essay had a chance of winning, the prize was a year's subscription to the winner's favourite magazine. Elizabeth was going to subscribe to the mysteries around the world, she loved reading Amanda Howard mysteries, but she was also looking forward to tomorrow because it was the first of April, April fool day, April fools day. The day went, her and her sister, her twin sister, Jessica, did their annual April fools day joke, they "
DEM DEM-KE2-005 18.59 "Elizabeth had won the essay competition and was just about to stand up when Jessica got up  and she walked  up to Mr   and she asked  and he asked her what magazine she wanted for the year  and she said Rock Seventeen  Jessica knew what magazine Elizabeth wanted and she just said Rock Seventeen. Then she had to stay behind and got Jessica's detention  and was late for her next lesson  and got another  detention  for running in the main building. But the trouble was they were both at the same time after school where she was meant to be decorating the hall for the disco after school that night. Then, she got Jessica's C for her cooking class instead of the A Jessica got off hers. But, after school she went to her detention with Mr   and course, the note said  going to the dentist, sudden toothache. So she went to  her other detention and there was another note saying, had to pick up my child from school. So, she went to decorate the hall and got sent out with people saying  she was Jessica. Elizabeth slammed the kitchen door and dropped her  bag. What's wrong said Jessica? So Elizabeth told her everything that had happened today  and after half an hour they decided to tell everyone what the they had done at the disco that night. So that night, at the disco  they told them and at last they believed them  and sorted out the magazine thing and changed the magazine to  Mysteries from Around the World. And then, they changed the cookery marks. And Jessica said, I'll race to the cake  and the twins were back to normal . Mm! Now  right! Well I am going to have to look at them both. And see if I, I like them both. There's, there's a lot of work gone into those . Erm  i if I'm honest I think I found  Holly's easier to understand  on a first reading  but that may be because I think perhaps read it. Perhaps, in a slightly more clearer way than you did. That doesn't mean that yours isn't as good. So I, what I want to do now, and I have do eve take time to do it, I can't do it just now when you're here. But I want to look at them both  and I will go through them as well and mark them for spelling and for  for your punctuation and everything else. But, really you both put a tremendous amount of work in! They're great! Can I just say something? Yeah. Cos, didn't gonna say  know when Jessica  got up  cos I've got pretend  erm got up  for the erm  So what's it? What is it? It's April Fool. Yeah, it's April Fool's  Yeah. day. Er, what they do, every year they switch identities e , Jessica pretends to be Elizabeth, and Elizabeth pretends to be Jessica  but, this year they don't do that cos tha all their friends like know  and, this year cos their teachers and things still think that they're erm  so , they swapped identities they like, give detention and things to the wrong people and  stuff like that. And, when Jessica gets up to do  get the magazine it's cos Mr  told her but course she thought it was Je , erm Elizabeth but she wa wasn't  so What's D T? That's detention. She went to her detention, I see! Right. So we just sort of say  essay, D T to show what I mean. Yeah. Well  well yes we used to get  used to get detention, yes, but erm  the thing we used to get more than anything else  was pink paper. Mm? Did you have to take it home to your parents? Pink paper To show that you've  was  been naughty? Pink paper was a foolscap sheet of paper like  like that Mm. but it was pink! Pink! And if you had to do  if you had, say, three sheets of pink paper because you've been naughty and done something wrong, you had to fill three sides of pink foolscap paper with writing. You might have to write an essay or you do copy writing on the pa , do three sheets of pink paper, you had to three sheets of writing! And it was pink paper  and at the top it had space for your parent's signature so that when you've done the work your parents had to  Mm. sign it so they'd know if you'd had pink paper. What erm  That was the, that was the worst, that was the pink paper, and then  what we normally have to do. you got  yo would have to take and hour or take two hours, or take three hours and if you take up to three hours  or if you got three separate hours  that was detention  and if we were in our in the junior part of the school  in the first three forms  erm, you then had to go into school on Saturday morning. In the senior school we had to go into school Saturday morning anyway! And you had Wednesday  We we  afternoon off. No, we didn't! We we worked  Monday to Saturday  Our when my  morning. When my  We had games on Wednesday afternoon but we had, in the senior school  When my we had school on Saturday morning as well as the rest of the week! My erm  my dad's mum, they used to go to school Monday, Tuesday  Wednesday morning, have Wednesday afternoon off, all day Thursday, all day Friday and Saturday morning! But they would have Wednesday afternoon off. Oh! Right. For some reason ! Okay. So we've got a little time left. Erm  let's  have a look at your  English  these English progress papers. Okay. Because, I want to do a little bit of that  erm  we are going  Ah! what page are we on now? We started something last week. , I mean I've finished that. Yes, what paper was that? The Locuses. About the Locusts. What page was that? I don't know. I don't know. Here it is! Here's the page. Page twenty eight. Page twenty eight. That's right. Now, how far did we get with that? Erm, we finished the bit about the locusts. Right. So  Ten to five. Okay. Number eight  we've got to do. I think. Look, look! Look! Yes. Number eight. I think you hold it right at the end. Do you? Do this don't you? Oh you do don't you? Did we mark it? No. The  Did we not mark it? They're all ma they're alright though. Cos we didn't   Cos we but we didn't the last one? So right! Okay. So we'll go on to page  that page twenty eight, number eight. If you'd like to do it now and then we'll mark it. Number eight? Number eight. Paper over  Oh! there. Yes! Underline the correct answer in the brackets. So write it down, don't underline it. Just write the, write the sentence down. How do you write it though? You gotta choose the correct one. Mm. This should be very apt from what you've just been doing. Mm! My, am I, am I an author now? I don't know. Mm? That might well be mightn't it? I know I'm, no I'm just coming to sort you out because  as you say you did that with Mrs . So, you haven't done this yet? I've done that  Terry. Right. Wait for Lucy to do it  and then we'll read it out. Oh! Ooh ooh ooh! Don't think, the spelling's wrong. Yes I have! Cos I  I'm usually a good speller! One of these. Over to dad and Becky. Oh, she's terrible! Mm. Doesn't know how to spell scene! Does she not? No, she  No. i , when we have like, something like scene one she puts S double E N! Mm. Oh! She doesn't know how to spell having. She goes, she puts erm, A, hey, no H, H A V E I N G! She's useless at spelling! Right , so what have you got there? Well now, it should a be a person who writes books is An. An. An! Oh! An author. Mm. An author. Why do you put an instead of a? Because it's got a vowel! Because author  A vowel. comme , starts with an A, right, a vowel. Right, number nine. So do number nine. Mhm! Oh! So what have you got? It's a journalist. Journalist. A person who writes articles for a newspaper is a journalist. For a newspaper is a journalist . Journalist! Good! Right! Number ten then. When he breaks   Oh sorry I didn't mean to  It's when  we break into a house to steal  is called a It's called  it's called a prisoner! Mm mm . Do you know the story  o , first of all I was gonna write about fairground  about a erm  ghost  Ghost  train  then I thought, no, I wouldn't write that. Then I was gonna write about  a hotel  you know, erm Heartbreak Hotel  thought no, wouldn't write about that. Want something exciting, so I thought a murder ! Yes. So it's a burglar, right? B U R G L A R.  A murder. E actually yours made me think of a story that I was told many years ago on a coach trip over Dartmoor Mm. when a lady who lived on Dartmoor for many, many years  erm  was telling  stories of things that had actually happened True? to her. Well, for instance, that she lived in a in an old vicarage, cos her husband had been a  a, no a tri , priest in the Church of England and er  we her house was haunted  and she was telling us stories and sh she quite often saw the ghost, she was never worried, she never  cos it never frightened her it wasn't vicious or anything like that and she often saw it  quite matter of fact . As a matter of fact, she often saw this ghost. But, she was telling the story of a man who was travelling over the moor  and it was many years ago   on horseback  and er he  was completely lost and wan , it was getting dark and he wanted to  stay somewhere for the night  and he sort of travelled and couldn't see anywhere and eventually down a long drive he saw a house wi , blazing with lights  so he went down this house  and er, all the windows were alight, you know  were lit up  and he knocked at the door and knocked at the door, and knocked at the door and couldn't get any answer, no one ever came to the door  so in desperation he thought well this is no good! So he went back up onto the main road and very little further on, in fact, he in fact found a village  and spent the night at the hostelry  and he said to the man in the hostelry  you know,he that he'd been lost and that a  a little bit back on the road he'd seen this big house all alight and he had erm, you know, gone in the drive and tried to get  get a room there but  couldn't make anybody hear  and the erm  the inn keeper said, no he said er  you wouldn't make anyone hear there, he said and if you go back there tomorrow  the house won't be there! And he went back  and it wasn't! Weird! Why not? It had gone! What a ghost made it? Yeah. I like, I love  Told a lot of ghost stories, yes! I love listening  in my   to ghost stories in Dartmoor. Oh I know this really  story! Go on then. Right, it's about this erm  lady, I'll make it that she lived on Dartmoor with her erm grandson  erm  and her  moth and he sa daughter and she is a gran , she was a grandlady  a grandmother. A grandlady ! And erm, they lived in this little cottage and erm  every night erm  the moth , she would always stay up really late and the mother and erm her son would go to bed  and she would always go out of this erm  go out of the house  every night and she would go, cos she had these three fingers which were blades Oh! you know like Freddy Kruger  three fingers that looked like blades  and every night she would go to erm  the fields  and erm  she would go into sheep fields and cow fields and she would kill three sheep and a cow every night  except for a Sunday night! Every morning farmers would come and they would see this claw mark  on the neck of these  of their sheep and their cows and they were, they were quite worried cos all their sheep and cows were like dying every night! They were quite worried about it. And so they went to report to the, to the police  but and th I mean they didn't believe them, they thought it was just like birds. And erm  and  she kept doing this for ages  and erm  she was, she was sta starting to get worried because people might believe, find out that it was her  and so after she killed a cow, she took out all of i , all it's insides and hid in it and no one ever found her! Oh dear! Terrible! And then, she  Ooh! Ooh! she was It's horrible isn't it? And then she hid inside this cow! Mm! And she killed it! ? Right! I think  we'd  Ha. better leave it at that hadn't we? Will you  before you come to me next time Mhm. finish down to  number twenty eight? And learn those spellings? Right? So that's going to be page twenty eight and twenty nine. Okay, learn your spellings! Now, I'll have to talk to your mums but it may well be  that  I shan't be here in a fortnight's time so we may  Oh! have to put things back a week. Okay. But we'll  we'll think about that  nearer the time. Alright? Okay. Okey-doke And you'll leave your compositions with me and I will look up, and if I can get the marks before then as I probably will  I'll let you have them back. Okay? Okay. Right! So, one more week to go and then you've got a holiday. Yes ! Ha hum! At last! Yeah, that's right. Right? Bye bye girls! Bye bye! Ballet now. Cor you got ballet now have you? Yes we Hello Adrian! Alright? Yes thanks. So  all set for a break tomorrow? Yeah. Thank you. Have I got to give your mummy change this time? Er  yeah. It looks like it  Oh yeah. doesn't it? I'll go and get some. I know, right. That's alright. That's fine. Erm  right! What book are we on? Four A. It's alright, this is erm, yours. Yeah, I know I was looking for the erm  oops! Now  right! So how have we got on with that? Er ah, I did some at home but we haven't done any booklet work this week. You haven't done any booklet work? Okay. Because we've been doing Pythagoras theorem. Oh have you? Yeah. I'll just show you what we've been doing. Yeah. Show us what you've been doing. You understand it? Yeah  well sort of! We're erm  that's the booklet I'm on at the moment. What's this one? I haven't seen this one. Oh! It's  it's er   ? Yeah. Did that yu , yesterday. Not all that. Is that from here? Yeah. Yeah. Work from that. And an an the the sheets. And now  I've just started  this. I'm gonna finish the end of C six for homework, and I'm on C six A. And that's what we've been doing, all about it. Right. Okay? Yeah. So do you wanna finish that now? Yeah please. Right, okay. I I knew that erm  I uns , I sa understand some of it but some of it I find a bit hard to understand  like  this bit, it says  be careful, sometimes the unknown side is  is the longest side and sometimes it is not. But I thi , I I can't, I know that you have to take it away. Yes but  the thing is this  in a right angle triangle Mm. the longest side is called what? Cos it  The hypotenuse. The hypotenuse, right! So the longer side is always the hypotenuse. Yeah. Right? Now, what is the formula  for your Pythagoras theorem? The sum of the erm I do I don't, I know, my dad's taught me a different one to Miss , she  she taught me that erm  i the, oh hang on! It's back here. I got a new book today so  but  she taught that is was  ha! Erm, if I can find it! The right angle triangle. The areas and squares on the  two short sides  add together to equal the area on the square of the hypotenuse. Right! The square on the hypotenuse Yeah. equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Yeah. The square on the hypotenuse  equals the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Okay. Alright? Yeah. And the squ hypotenuse is always the longest side. It's the side opposite the right angle. Mhm. So  there's your right angle  that is the hypotenuse and the square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares, that's the su , the area of that square and the area of that square add together the sum of the squares on the other two sides. Okay. Alright? The square on the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares on the other two sides. So  what they're saying is this  that  the square on that side Mm. is thirty six, so what's the length of that side? Erm  that must be  nine. No! Sorry! Aha. What then? The square root of thirty six. What two numbers amount to   Six. That's right. So the  that side must be six centimetres Yeah. The square is six times six which is thirty six. That is four square centimetres. Mm. It's four centimetres and the square is sixteen  so, what must be the area of that square? Twenty. Twenty. Right! So you've got to find what number multiplied together makes twenty. Mm. So it's going to, the length of that side is going to be the  So you square the root of twenty. Find the square root of twenty  don't you? You find the square root of twenty. That's right. And how do you find the square root of twenty? Just  use that. You'll use that yes! Mm mm. Aren't you lucky? Mm. Because I  we never had sa we never had erm  calculators. Wha what did you have to do then? So you had to find the square root of by  ar either  arithmetic  by  Mm. doing in an arithmetic way or you had to use a sca , a log table. You had to use log tables. You had to use this sort of thing  like find it   up in a mess hasn't it? Erm  I had to go to a table like that  which said square roots  and I had to look up  twenty It's got on the back actually. Back of this book. Square roots  twe  Oh yeah. square root is twenty  and it's four point four seven two one. Yeah, square root. That's right. But, as you say you can use this Which one do you push now? That one. That's right. Four point four seven two. Yeah. So, you know, that's  well the way you do it. So th that's how you find that. So now when you got these  three here I've done these. You've done those have you? Yeah, look. Here are. Well let's see that you got them right shall we? Six five A. So, this one  you've got twenty five  equals  nine  plus some number. Right? Mhm. So, that is going to be  sixteen isn't it? Yeah. No it isn't. Yes it is! Yes it is, sixteen. So, what's that gonna be? Sixteen to erm, square root of sixteen  Sixteen  is four. Four. So that's  gonna be four. So, C five A, have you got four? Yeah. Yes you have. Right. Now, B  again, that  the square root of that  is going to equal the square root of that  plus the square root of that. So you've got sixteen Mm. Or rather, sixty four  e eighty one  equals  sixty four  plus some number. So, sixty four from eighty one Gives you  six which is erm, seventeen so it's  Gives you  er seventeen. Gives you seventeen. So now, for the answer to that one  The square root of seventeen. you want the square root of seventeen  which is four point one two. Right! Mm. So C  again, you've got eleven elevens, what are eleven elevens? Er  a hundred and twenty one. A hundred and twenty one  equals thirty six, plus some number. Mm. So what is a hundred and twenty one less thirty six? Erm  er  is it  six erm  erm si  Eighty five. eighty five, sorry. Have you got eighty five? The square root of eighty five? Yes, you have! Er, the square root of eighty five, that sounds reasonable so I would assume that's right. D  you've got sixty four  equals  Mhm. twenty five plus some number, so what's that? Thirty nine? Yeah. The square root of thirty nine which is  obviously reasonable so that's alright. Right! So how's  Mm. C six? And you can't do C six? So that, those are alright? Yes, you can mar , well yes you can do. They're wrong, aren't they? I'll mark them right. Why don't you tick it neatly? I do! As I've said before! You don't. Okay then. No, it's alright! Leave  Yeah. it now but erm Oh that's alright? that's , you know, you should erm  Okay! So you're going to do C six. I will do them while you do them. Okay. Cos I Is that the hypotenuse? Yes? Which is the hypotenuse? That one? Which one? The opposite one to the right angle. Right. So it's that one. Right! So, so it must be  it is  erm can I write it down on here? I'll tell you what  write it down on paper and then you can copy it into your book when you know you've got it right. How about that? Hang on a sec ! Five point three nine. Right! I'll settle for that. Is that right, the way I've done it? By the way, I I did that so I did  area of square along the side. Well I mean you've got the right answer so erm Shall I just write  shall I copy it in? Yes, what have you done? Erm  five  equals twenty five  mm? Five doesn't equal twenty five. Five fives are twenty five! You haven't got five times, you've got five equals twenty five. Five square equals twenty five! That's what I've been doing  I meant  I mean that! Yahhh But if you write that  look! Five equals twenty five  is not true! Five squared equals twenty five  yes! Okay then. Right? Yeah. Be very precise. But you shouldn't ever write five equals twenty five cos it doesn't! Okay then. You mean five squared, you mean five times five equals twenty five  you're looking for five squared, so that's the right thing to write! Alright? Okay. That is the hypotenuse isn't it? That there? Yes. Mhm. C  Do you do ninety nine take twenty five? Which one are we doing? B. Erm  I'm gonna do  What have you got? Er  You've got  you've got nine nines are eighty one, nine squared equals eighty, nine squared equals  Ah so  what? Eighty one equals  nine ! Ah pa cha cha cha cha cha Right. Five squared equals twenty five  right  now what have you got to do? Nine into ninety  erm eight in  eighty one take  twenty five. That's right. So   erm   that'll be se fifty five  fifty, fifty six. Right. So then you square root it? That's right. Seven point four eight. Right. Is it a hundred take nine? That's right."
DEM DEM-KE2-007 15.95 "Which page? Eighty two. Found that quickly didn't you? Er  percentages is it? Yeah. Right. E one. Have you looked at this? Let's have a look at it. B's height is sixty percent of A side. There's B  and it's sixty percent of A  C's height  is a hundred and twenty percent of A's height. There's a hundred percent  so a hundred and twenty it means it's more  than A's height. If C's height was a hundred percent of A's height  it means it was exactly the same. If it's less than a hundred it's smaller  if it's more than a hundred  it's greater. Now the decimal equivalent of hundred and twenty  is one point two  and there you've got nought and nought  a hundred and one  so ninety percent is point nine, eighty percent is point eight  and a hundred and ten percent is one point one, and a hundred and twenty percent is one point two. So what you're doing, in fact  is to  if you've got a hundred and twenty  percent  if you divide that by  of a hundred  in other words, you move your decimal point two places  that's a decimal. So a hundred and twenty percent  as a decimal fraction is one  point two. All you do  is to  move that decimal point two places. Alright? So  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of amount  to calculate a hundred and twenty percent of an amount you multiply  by  one point two. If you wanted to calculate  eighty percent of an amount  you would multiply by point eight. A hundred and twenty percent you are multiplying by the decimal equivalent which is one point two. So write down  decimal equivalent of a hundred and forty percent. That's right. Now calculate a hundred and forty percent  of seven point five  kilogrammes. Have you got a, you've got a calculator haven't you? Haven't got it with you? No. But you've got your own? Scientific one? No? No. You could do with one. Alright? It's one of those things that you could do with really. If you've got a birthday or something coming up and if somebody wants to know what to buy you  that's what you want! You want one of these scientific ones. So, you want a hundred and forty percent of seven point five. Let's have a look. What is it? A hundred and forty percent, so it's one  point four  times  seven point five. Try it. Use that one. Yes you use your finger . One  point four times Oh it's . Ten point five, that's right. Okay. Ten point five killogrammes. Right! Put it on the, on the er  on that desk which probably will be better. So, alright calculate  a hundred and thirty percent of sixty seven pounds. That's right,a , what is that? Eighty seven point nine. Yeah, so it's eighty seven pounds  ten isn't it? That's right. Right, B  a hundred and twenty percent off thirty two metres? Oops! No . Start again. Right, one point two metres  times  thirty two. Yeah? What is it? Thirty eight point four. That's right! Now, a hundred and eighty percent of seventy four metres? One three three eight two. That's right. Right! E three A. What are the decimal equivalents of  a hundred and sixty percent? That's right. A hundred and sixty three percent? Six six four. Yeah, point six three. Good! You move that decimal point you see, in two places and it's one point three. A hundred and six percent? One point nought six. That's right! One point nought six. Again,yo you, the figure staying the same, all you do is to move a decimal point two places. So D is One point three nine . One point three nine. Alright. And E? One point nine . One point nine   or one point nine, yes. Right! A factory plans to increase it's output by fifty percent next year. So if this stands for this year's output  at a hundred percent  fifty percent of it has to be added on to give next year's . So there's your hundred percent and you add fifty percent. So next year's output is  to be a hundred and fifty percent  of this year's . Because you add fifty percent to the hundred percent  and a hundred plus fifty is  a hundred and fifty. So the output is going to be a hundred and fifty percent of what is was last year. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and fifty percent is one point five O  or one point five. Next year's output is to be one point five times this year's. So you multiply this year's output  by one point five  and it'll give you next year's output. Alright? You add on that fifty percent  or whatever it happens to be  to the hundred percent  which gives you the new figure. You change that into a decimal  that is what you multiply by. So, let's have a look. If something is increased by fifty percent  it is multiplied by one point five. A new town plans to increase it's population by fifty percent during the next five years. If the present population is eighty three percent  calculate the planned population in five years time . So what are you gonna multiply that by? One point five. Right! So it's eighty three thousand  and what do you get? One two four five O O. That's right. One hundred and twenty four thousand five hundred. Now, calculate the new populations when these populations are increased by fifty percent ? Now, you can give the answer in this form  you needn't write it out in full. So, what you're gonna do is to multiply  sixty four point eight by Haven't got anything. one point five  and that'll give you an answer which you will write down  followed by the word million. Alright? So, sixty four point eight  multiplied by one point five Ninety seven point two. Right! Ninety seven point two. Good! Now this one. That's fifty eight point eight. A fifty eight point eight million. And C? Eighty nine point seven million. That's right! Okay. An airline  is to increase all it's fares by seventeen percent . Now this erm illustrates the increase. There's your hundred percent  it's got to go up by  one point seven to a hundred and seventeen percent. One hundred and seventeen is one point one seven. So you multiply your hundred by one point one seven and you get one hundred and seventeen. The new fare is one hundred and seventeen percent of the old fare. The decimal equivalent of a hundred and seventeen percent is one point one seven. Move two decimal  yo decimal points down those two places, alright? So to get the new fare you multiply the old fare by one point one seven. The old fare multiplied by one point one seven gives you the new fare. That represents a seventeen percent increase. So at three,before the seventeen the percent increase the fare from London to Feraccas was five hundred and fifty pounds  calculate the new fare  after the increase . Six O three point five. Right! So that's six hundred and forty three pounds  fifty pence  Fifty. isn't it? Right! F four. If you want to increase something by forty five percent  what do you multiply it by? Four point five. One  if you're increasing it by forty five percent  if it was a hundred percent  and you increase it by forty five  hundred percent  Oh it'll be nought point No. A hundred percent plus forty five percent will be what? A hundred and forty A hundred and  forty five. five percent. Right? Now what's that of a decimal equivalent? One point four five. Right! Alright? So, if you want to increase something by forty five percent what do you multiply it by? One point  erm  four five. Think in terms of putting a one in front of that  and then moving a decimal point two places and it's one point four five. So okay, F four A is  one point four five. Alright? That's the first, that's your answer to that first question. F four A  was one point four five. Now  it says  No! Just one point four five. Oh yeah. A hundred and forty five percent is one point four five, alright? So now it says increase twenty eighty pounds by forty five percent. So you're gonna multiply the twenty eight by? One point four five. Right! Forty point six. Forty pounds sixty, right. Right! Right! F five, now all of these  you've got to increase e something by something there so you've got to change each of those percentages  you've got to think of it as added to a hundred  and then the decimal equivalent. So what are you gonna multiply the sixty seven by? One point six two. One point six two. Right! Good! One O eight point five four. That's right, one O eight point five four  and it is in killogrammes. That's right. Right. Right! So F six  A. If you want to increase something by seven percent  what do you multiply it by? Er nought  point seven. Sorry? Say it again. Nought seven, one point nought seven. Yeah, one point nought seven, that's right! So  your ar answer to A is one point nought seven. Good! So now you increase sixty five pounds by seven percent. Sixty nine  point thirty five. Sixty nine pound thirty five pence. Right! Good! Okay, now F seven's gonna be the same. Increase ninety two pounds by three percent. That's right. Nine pound four seventy six. Good! Right. That's right. Good! Right! Alfred's salary  is eighty thousand four hundred and twenty pounds and Alberta's is seven thousand a hundred and eighty four  Alfred has a twenty two percent increase  and Alberta a thirty eighty percent increase  who earns more after all this ? So what you've got to do is to put down Alfred's  Alfred  and put his new salary down  and then you have to Alberta and her new salary and see which is  which is the most. So you're going to look for Oh, tell me again ! Alright. So  Oh . so right, eighty four two nought  multiplied by Erm eight  that's right. So what's that, ten  two seven two forty? Yeah. Put a, put the forty down cos it's forty pence. Right! Yep! That's good! Now, Alberta's. Right! So, earns more afterwards? Alfred. Right! So Alfred is the answer. Right! Oh, we're coming to negative numbers. Have we done negative numbers? No. No. Right. Positive, negative numbers can be marked on a number line which extends  in both directions. You can do some simple calc calculations by thinking of a number line, for example, two, minus two, plus five  means start at minus two  then go up five  so you'll finish at  three. So minus two, plus five  equals Three. plus three . Right? Minus three, minus two means start at minus three  then go down minus two, so minus three and minus two is  minus five . Alright? Now, before you right them down just tell me what they are and then we can go back and write them down. Here you've got, minus four and plus three. That's minus one. Good! Minus four and plus six? Two. Plus two, right. Yes, two, yeah okay. So write them down cos yo you obviously can do those alright. It's plus two minus  one   Minus one , yeah. Minus It's two. Yeah, two. Now two minus five? Minus three. Minus three. Minus one minus three? Minus four. Right! Minus six plus two. Minus four. Right. And three minus eight? Minus five. Right! The number line method works when you have to add or subtract and ordinary positive number  plus three means go up three, minus three means go down three. But it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three  or seven minus, minus three, for example but it does not tell you how to do four  plus minus three, or seven minus minus three  where you have to add or subtract a negative number. Adding a negative number. Think what happens if you start with four  and add on different numbers. Four plus three, as the number you add on goes down  so the answer goes down. Four plus three equals seven  four plus two equals six, four plus one five, four plus nothing equals four, four plus minus one  is three  cos you're coming down here, three two, one, nought, minus one, minus two, minus three, minus four, minus five. So as the numbers that you add on get one less  so the answers get one less. So, four  plus minus one is three, four  plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nothing, four plus minus five is minus one. What is important  is that you realise that  that number  is minus one  that number is one  plus one if you like but you don't need to say it but if th any, if the sign isn't there it's assumed that it's plus. But that number and that number are two different numbers. They're as different as one is from three. That is a different number from that, that is a different number from that. And that number is minus one. Don't think of it as taking away one  thinking of it, think of it as  minus one, a number. That is minus two  that is minus three  that is minus four, that is minus five. You've done some algebra haven't you? Found out the value of X  well you can X  equals minus five. And that is a value for X, it equals minus five  and minus five is a number. So, try and remember that, that that is a number in it's own right. Now when you start thinking of what to do  you've got plus four and you've got minus three  if you take the smaller digit, now that digit is four, that digit is three  if you take the smaller digit from the larger digit, you take the three from the four you get one and the answer is whatever sign that larger number is. When you've got two numbers that are both, all pluses, four and two is six, four and one is five, four and nothing is four, four and minus one means you got  plus four minus one, is one less than four, it's three. You've got four plus numbers, you got two minus numbers  which leaves you with two plus numbers. Let's go on and see whether you can pick it up. Write down the next two lines of a pattern of the bottom of the opposite page . Notice that four plus minus one  has the same answer as four minus one. Four plus minus two has the same answer as four minus two and so on because the plus and minus gives you a minus. So we've got four  plus minus one is three, four plus minus two is two, four plus minus three is one, four plus minus four is nought, four plus minus five is minus one  what's going to be the next one? Four plus Minus six Equals? makes minus two. Right! So write that down in your book now safely. A is A two, write down the next two lines. So you got four plus minus six is minus two, then you'll have four plus  minus seven is gonna be? Minus three. Right! Okay? So  let's go on. Adding minus N is the same as subtracting N   adding the minus number  is the same as subtracting it. So copy and complete these . So write down A three A. Five plus minus three  equals five minus three  equals? Two. Two. Right! Two plus minus six is the same as two minus six  which is going to be? You got plus two minus six Four. Mm? Four. You take the smaller digit from the larger digit  so you take the two  Eight. from the six and it gives you four but then you give the sign of a larger  so it's minus four. Alright? Now this is minus three plus minus four  which is the same as minus three minus four. Now you can, those are both the same sides so you're gonna en add them together  and give it the sign that is common to both. Minus six. Minus? Six? Three and four? Seven, sorry! So , alright? Minus seven, yeah? Happy? Right, so A four,work these out . Now if you can do them then just put the answer down. Six  plus minus three is the same as six  plus and a minus give you a minus, so it's the same as six minus three  which is? What's six minus three? Three. Three! Right! You take the smaller digit from the larger digit, so you take three from six gives you three  you give the sign of the bigger number which is a plus. Now this time  you've got two  minus five. Yeah. You take the two, the smaller digit from the larger digit  but you give the answer the sign of a larger digit. So it's? Minus Minus three! Alright? Yeah? Okay, you got minus one  and a minus four. Minus four. No, you got a minus one  and a minus four  they're both the same signs, cos it's minus one, minus four  they're both the same signs  so you put them together  four and one make? Five? And you've got Minus one. minus , so they're minus five. Let's just have a look at  if we've got  six and four  we can have six plus four  or you can have six minus four  we can have minus six, minus four  or you can have minus six  plus four. Now  that's a plus six and a plus four  what's the answer? Ten. Ten. Nice and straightforward. Both the signs are the same. So you add them together and you give it the same sign. This one  what's the answer to that gonna be? You've got a minus six and a minus four. Both the same signs. Ten. Can't be the same as that. They're both minus. Those are both plus  so we call it plus ten  these are both minus so the answer is? Ten. Minus ten. Alright? If the signs are the same you add them together, you give the ssssa the sign that they're both the same as. Now, here you've got six minus four  now what's six minus four? Two. So that equals two. Now here you got minus six  plus four  take the smaller from the larger  and give it the sign of a larger. Minus two. Right! Does that help  a little bit? Let's do another one. Let's do erm  eight plus three  eight minus three  minus eight, minus three, and minus eight plus three. Let's see if we can do those. What's eight and three? Eleven. Right. What's minus eight and minus three? Minus nine. No! Minus eight and minus three? Both the same signs. Minus eleven. Minus eleven. Now this is easy, eight minus three is? Five. Five. But this is a minus eight  That's five, yes. plus three, it's minus five. Alright? Tear that out and keep that by your side because that gives you  all the four possibilities. Alright? When the signs are the same  if they're two pluses you add them and it's plus  if they're both minus you add them and it's minus  here you take the smaller from the larger and give it the sign of a larger. Three from eight is five, that's plus five. Three from eight is five, but that is minus, so it's gonna be minus five. Okay? So keep that by your side  and see how we get on. So we've what were we doing? A  B  D! This one here is it? Minus two plus minus five. Which is minus two  minus five. Minus two  plus the minus gives you a minus, so you got minus two, minus five. Er, minus seven. Minus seven. Right! Now here you've got nought  and a plus minus gives you a minus, so it's nought a minus four? Minus three. Right! Good! Three  minus three? Three Nought. minus three. Nought. Nought, right! Minus five  minus two? Minus three. Erm Minus and a minus. Same as that one, look. Minus two, minus five. You got that one right. What was that? Minus two and minus five. Seven. Is minus seven. Right? So here you got minus five, minus two which is? Minus seven. Minus seven. Now here you got seven  minus nine? Take the smaller from the larger which will give you? Seven  from two, nine is two  and that number is a minus so the answer's going to be a minus, so it's gonna be? Minus two. Minus two. Alright?"
DEM DEM-KE2-098 13.82 "Right, what did you get? Erm twenty five in two seconds. Good. Right so B one   up to now speeds have been in metres per second  we also use miles per hour  M P H or M I H  and kilometres per hour, K M H or K M P H  If the car has a constant speed of fifty miles per hour this means it goes fifty miles in every hour . Right? Yeah. So how far will a lorry go in three hours  at a constant speed of fifty miles per hour? Hundred and fifty miles. Right. Just shut these doors cos otherwise we're gonna get very cold in here. Two people are coming in this week . Gloria and Gavin. Three people. Three people. Who  Alex is coming in isn't   Oh yes! Right well  that's what comes when you have a holiday. Mm. Right, B two   if a train is going at a constant speed of ninety miles per hour  how far will it go in two hours ? Hundred and eighty. Right. Do you like teaching us Terry? Yes it's quite erm  quite a challenge. Oh yes if I've got a skill to impart I don't mind helping people. How far will a plane go in four hours that has a constant speed of five hundred miles per hour ? Oh  one, two thousand miles That's right, good. It's been hot this  like summer today isn't it? It's been lovely hasn't it? Mm. And all the bulbs are coming out now nicely as well. Everything's, everything will start growing with the warmth on it. And loads of people are mowing their lawns like summer today. Mm. I in fact mowed my lawn yesterday. Oh. No it was the day before yesterday. It's been hot all   the car is going along the motorway at a constant speed. It covers a hundred and eighty miles in three hours. How far does it go in one hour ? Sixty miles. That's right. Write down its speed . Sixty miles per hour? Mm. The  's top speed is  two thousand three hundred kilometres per hour  no kilometres er, yeah   how far does it fly in three hours at top speed ? Oh   No, careful. Oh three times That's right. Six thousand nine hundred. That's right   kilometres per hour. Yes. No kil kilometres sorry. Kilometres. Yes. It is one thousand and fifty from  London to   It is  what did you say? It is  one thousand fi and fifty kilometres  One thousand two hundred and fifty  two hundred and fifty kilometres from London to? kilometres from London  to Veneta Vienna. Vienna . Where's Vienna? Don't know. Italy? No. Oh. Venice is in Italy. Oh yeah it is. Vienna is the capital of Austria Oh! and it's right across the other side of Austria from us. Where you went skiing is this side of Austria, but Vienna is about two hundred and  two hundred and fifty miles further on across Austria, very close to  erm  Czechoslovakia and erm Yugoslavia. Right  so  it is twelve hundred and fifty kilometres from London to Vienna, can a Concorde do the trip in half an hour ? How far does it go in an hour? Two hundred and  Right. thirty. So can it go twelve hundred and fifty kilometres in half an hour? No. How far can it go in half an hour? Erm one hundred and  One thousand  one thousand an  one hundred yeah, yeah fifty  and fifty, right, so the answer is no it can only do  eleven hundred and fifty  kilometres in half an hour. Right, average speed  Ha  oh   Terry Mhm? Will you take me letterboxing one day this week if you can? I don't think it's gonna be possible this week but perhaps in the Easter holidays erm Okay  we'll be able to manage it. Yeah. Okay. It is a hundred miles from King's lions King's Lynn. King's Lynn  where's that? Erm  do you know where The Wash is? No   if you think of a map of England  erm  the south coast is there, there's Dover, there's the estuary for London, London is here  erm  then it comes up like this, the east coast of London, the east coast of E England  like that  this is East, called East Anglia, here you've got Norfolk and Norwich and then you've got Ipswich here and then you've got Suffolk there and Essex, right? Can you remember that bulge in the map of England? Well that piece up there is called The Wash  Oh. and King's Lynn is close to the wash, King's Lynn is in this area here. Oh. So from London to King's Lynn is, they say, a hundred miles and I'll take their word for it, London to Ipswich in fact is seventy miles. Oh. But, yeah, that's about a hundred miles you see, that would be about right, yeah. Oh. So that's where it is. North of London. Up by The Wash. Right  it is a hundred miles from King's Lynn to London, the train takes two hours to do the journey  the train does not go at a constant speed, it speeds up sometimes and slows down at other times  it also stops at stations on the way  and on once of course as it, as it's stopping it's going more and more slowly and as it's  er moving off again it starts slowly and starts to go quickly but because it takes two hours in all  the train goes a hundred miles in two hours we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. It says if it was travelling at a constant speed of fifty miles an hour. It doesn't, sometimes it goes more slowly sometimes it goes more quickly, sometimes it stops  but because it takes two hours to do the hundred miles we say its average speed for the journey is fifty miles per hour. Its real speed changes during the journey  sometimes it is more than fifty miles per hour, sometimes less  but in two hours it goes the same distance as it would if its speed was fifty miles per hour all the time. Oh. So we say its average speed is fifty miles per hour. There used to be a train called the Cheltenham Flyer   there it is   it went from Cheltenham to London  a hundred and twenty miles  in two hours  do you know where Cheltenham is? Well if there is  the south coast along here and Devo C Cornwall is there and Devon is here and you get the w the Bristol Channel going up here  and then you c the coast coming down here and there's  Wales is here  right? Bristol is there, right? And if you go up from Bristol on from here you go up the motorway to Bristol and then you go along the M four to London  well north of Bristol, up where the River Severn gets quite narrow and can be bridged is a city called Gloucester  and Cheltenham is just inland from Gloucester. Oh. So Cheltenham is about there, and it's about a hundred and twenty miles from Cheltenham to London. Mm. Right? Okay. So there's Cheltenham. Right so it  went from Cheltenham to London, a hundred and twenty miles, in two hours, what was its average speed? Mm  Well if it, if it  average speed is a hundred and twenty miles in two hours  how far in fact would it go in one hour? Sixty. So what was its average speed? Sixty. Sixty miles per hour. Oh It wasn't its actual speed  there will be sometimes it will be going very slowly, sometimes it will be going much more quickly  but its average speed  was sixty miles an hour because at sixty miles an hour it would cover a hundred and twenty miles, which was the distance, in two hours. Oh Right? This book isn't very big is it? No, none of them are really are they? Well this one's very small isn't it? Yeah cos look   Oh well you're gonna get on aren't you? Great, yeah, you're half way through. Ha! Only got s nine pages Mm. Right so that was C one, C two   it is a hundred and fifty miles from Hereford to London by rail   Hereford is north of Cheltenham, it's going up from Cheltenham is Hereford  the first train in the morning takes three hours for the journey  what's its average speed ? Right  Can we go on the computer today? Well there might be time, we'll see how we get on. Now it says B  what did you do with th the numbers one hundred and fifty  and three to get the answer ? Divided a hundred by three. Right so you write that down, you divided a hundred and fifty  by three. I wonder what my brother's doing now. Well at the present moment it's about, where he is it's about half past five, twenty to six, so he is probably  waiting for his supper I should think  his evening meal. He won't be, he'll have finished skiing now. Mm. Does it get dark over there quick? It probably gets dark about the same time as it does here. It's not dark quicker there now  would it? No it would probably be, you know, no it will be about this, be a little bit darker than this. It gets dark, it'll be dark there before it is dark here Mm. mm because it's further east  so the sun is further away from them  because the sun rises in the east so it gets light earlier  that's why we put the clocks on  when you go to Europe, one hour. Oh. In America it's loads isn't it? Well in America it's the other way, in America i i it is after us because they are further west than we are. Yeah cos it's about six hours different. Mm, that's right. Right C three I've been to Penzance. I know  Yeah. where that is. That's near mile end  no what's it called Land's End. Land's End that's right, yes. Yeah. It's right down at the far south west. It's  it's more than a hundred miles from us. It's about a hundred and thirty miles from us down to Penzance. So you know we're  about two hundred miles from London, so we're about, only about two thirds of the way from London to Penzance. Have you been to L erm Land's End since they've  Yes. done it all up? Oh I don't know since they've done it all up, no probably not. It's good there now. Is it? Yeah they show you this  Mm  erm you go in this place and erm  and it shows you all the boats and things, and you can have a go on, there's this thing where they crawl up . And then you go through this door and it's all old like things  and then you go and see erm and you go into this place and it's like telling you all the erm history and things like that Does it. and it's got like rocks and things and erm statues doing like  erm  digging up gold and things a and it's got  Oh yeah? erm like a ship Working models? Yeah. And it's got a ship and erm there's people on there and it shows you this thing round the ship erm they have a storm and suddenly the sh the erm  what do you call it? The th that big long thing? Mast? Yeah that's it, all fell down and it went  like that   yeah . And there's lots of other things there as well. Right,Penzance  is three hundred and five miles from London by rail  the train leaves Penzance at five eighteen A M Ooh ooh and gets to London at ten eighteen AM . How many hours does the journey take? Five hours. Five hours. And B  what was the average  time  speed of the train? Erm  five into thirty goes  ei si sixty five? No. Oh. What's five into three hundred and  Fives into three hundred and five. Fives into thirty goes six Sixty one. Sixty one. Good. Right  C four  from Carlisle to London  is three hundred miles  gracious me, you see  if you've got a map of England, we haven't  got it on here but  if you imagine England going up here, Carlisle is right   now just think about it  if you go out of your front door My front door and you turn left turn left and you go to a junction  don't you? Yeah  Now if you turn right at that junction  The train station! What? If you turn right at that junction, on which road do you go? The   no the erm  goes to  Yes, which road is that? What's it called? I don't know. You don't know! No. If you go out of your f well go out of the gate here and turn right Mm and go across Church Road  don't go left down Decoy Road, keep straight on Mm past all the new houses that have been built, past the playing fields Yeah? and you don't know the name of that road? No. It is called Coach  Road Ooh! and it is the er it's called Coach Road because that is the road that the coaches used to go along  to Totnes Mm. and from Totnes to Plymouth. And it is the old Coach Road. So a hundred and fifty years ago  you would have the stagecoach going past here. Were these houses there then? No. No? No. What would of been here? That house might well have been here  that big house just there across th in there which has now been turned into flats. Mm. Er I don't know when that was built, it might not have been built but it er it's Victorian so it could have been built like in eighteen thirty soon fa certainly soon after eighteen thirty that would have been built. When were our houses built? About nineteen sixty  nineteen sixty six. How old are our houses? Well if they were built in sixty six, and I think they were, they are now, how old are they now? Sixty six did you say? I said I think they were built in nineteen sixty six. So how old are they? Nineteen th eighty something years. No! Eighty four years old. No! Nineteen sixty six, what are we now? Nineteen ninety two. Right, well how many years is that? I don't know. Fifty seventy eighty ni three  thirty years? Well ninety six it will be thirty years. So twenty   twenty four years? About twenty six years. Yeah! About twenty six years. That's  oh I thought they were very old. No. Where have you lived in? Would you a hou the house  did you live into it when it was new? No. No? No. I don't know ho certainly  I know there had been  at least two peo different lots of people living in ours before we moved in, and I would think there were probably more than that. Cos we moved in in about nineteen  I think we moved in in nineteen eighty  nineteen eighty, nineteen eighty one we moved in. Oh  Mm? in the house that she's lived in that she's in now all her life Who? My nan. Your nan. All her life since she was little. She  Gracious  she, she came  g went to the house  when she came back from hospital and she's still living in it now. Good lord. Right come on me girl let's get on a little bit. D, otherwise we're not gonna have time to go on the computer Oh! D  well yes we can because you can, you can finish it off at home can't you? Yes, right. So D  calculating journey times   Oh  oh look it's got the place. You know there, Poole, is that  Yeah  no it's not is it? I don't know. Is it what? No cos, can you go across there to France from there? I don't know erm Portsmouth more likely. Yeah that's where I'm going to go  Yes. Mm yeah Portsmouth. Oh Portsmouth is here. It's not marked but it's there is Portsmouth. I'm going to France  from there. Are you? How long does it take to get to there from our house? Or from  What Portsmouth? from Newton Abbott? To, to, to Portsmouth? Yeah. Well, three hours, three to four hours. And then it's eight hours on the boat. I like boats even though I haven't even been on one. Oh do you? Good. Yes. Do you like boats? Don't mind them. You've never been on a big boat? Have you not? Haven't been on a boat I don't thi o only like little, you know, Oh. Oh that's gonna be quite an experience then isn't it? You haven't been to France then? Yes you have, you've flown of course. No  haven't been to France. Well you've been to Austria. I've been to Austria, yeah. Yes but you've flown? You haven't done a, been on a boat? Mm. Yeah, no not on a boat, no. Right. It's nicer flying. A motor boat has a speed of four miles per hour   this means it goes four miles in every hour Oh. how many hours does it take to go from Lulworth to Bournemouth ? Twenty four hours? No. Oh erm silly me  It's twenty four miles. Twenty four miles? And how, it takes a minute a mile doesn't it? No. What does it say it goes? Twenty four miles. Yeah but what is the speed of the boat? Oh! Four miles per hour. Right. Six. Right, six hours. Six hours. How long does it take, how many hours does it take to go from Swanage to Ventnor? Ventnor. Where am I? Swanage  Well it tells you how far it is, look Yeah so you can, there's Swanage and there's Ventnor That's in the Isle of Wight. That's on the Isle of Wight. I haven't been there. Have you been there? Yes. Have you been that part there? No Have you been to that part there? No I don't think we landed at Cowes I think we landed over here further. Did you fly? No, went on a hovercraft  well wen went on the hovercraft and came back on a, a ferry  on the boat. What's a hovercraft? Well  it's a very specialized boat in a sense, I mean it goes on the surface of the water and it literally goes on the surface of the water, it's a  hovercraft is a sort of a  it's a vessel which has got a skirt all round it  Is it a rubber one? Yes, heavy thick rubber skirt and that  the engines do two things, they, they drive  propellers in the air  and they  pump air from under the vessel onto the surface of the water  and the skirt round the boat  Keeps dry  keeps a cushion of air under the vessel so that really it hovers on top of the water and the air propellers drive it like an aeroplane Oh but it skims across the surface of the water and it's very quick, it only takes half an hour to go from Ramsgate to Dover. Mm! Right  er from Swanage to Ventnor is thirty two miles so how long would a motor boat take? Eight hours. Eight hours, right. Colin's dad's got a boat. Has he? And how long would it take to go round the Isle of Wight, which is sixty miles round the Isle of Wight? Er  erm  fifteen? Fifteen hours, right. Right D two  how long does it take to go from Ventnor to Swanage in a launch with a speed of eight miles per hour ? Oh  Ventnor, where's Ventnor? Ah  twenty two miles  four Right. four hours. Right, now you get the answer to D two by dividing the distance  by the speed Mm? thirty two's the distance divided by the speed  which is eight, thirty two divided by eight is four  this is the rule for working out a journey time  distance  in miles divided by speed in miles per hour gives you the time in hours. Right. You need a calculator. I need a calculator. Ooh How many hours does it take to go seven hundred and five miles at forty seven miles per hour? Fifteen hours. Right. This is fun I like talking into   This diagram shows the reach or an airline  distances  are in kilometres  the figures for them are only rough  one, a jet flies from Beirut Beirut to to Bombay at four thousand kilometres. Its speed is about eight hundred kilometres per hour Eight hundred and  fifty fifty kilometres per hour  to work out the time it takes we do four thousand divided by three er eight hundred and fifty. The answer on the calculator is four point seven O five double eight two three hours but we do not need that  as that  To be as exact as that  because the distance is  because the d not exactly four thousand miles and the speed is not exactly eight hundred and fifty kilometres per hour . The nearest whole number of hours is good enough. The nearest whole number of hours   Do you take it by that number? The nearest whole number to four point seven  the wh nearest whole number to four point seven nought  five double eight  two three is five because  to the nearest whole number you look at that four, it's either gonna be four or five depending upon what that number is Mm. isn't it? If that's five or more then you pu increase that by one and make it five. So the journey time is about five hours. So D four  work out these journey times to the nearest hour. Bombay to Perth at about eight hundred and fifty kilometres an hour   Bombay to Perth   eight Hours. Mm? Eight hours, right. Rome to Beirut  two hundred and   Pardon? Two thousand two hundred Two thousand two hundred, right. Four hours. Right. London to  London to Geneva Oh. Geneva. Geneva. hundred and fifty. One hour. Right. It only takes half an hour to go to Austria doesn't it? No, it takes an hour  No it takes an hour and a half. Mm, yeah,It takes four hours to get to Lanzarote. Six hours. Good. Right E Now this is quite important, you've got to think about this   calculate as work in decimals . But we usually think of time as hours and minutes and seconds too if we are being very exact. This scale shows both minutes  and decimals as an hour. Thirty minutes  half an hour, nought point five Mm right? Erm fifteen minutes  nought point two five. Forty five minutes  three quarters of an hour, nought point seven five  and all the different calculations in between fifty minutes is about nought point  that's nought eight, that's nought nine so it'd be nought point eight one, two Four three isn't it? Just over three. Mm yeah. Right? So it says  this scale shows both minutes and decimals and now use the scale to change these to minutes . Now what's point three of an hour  in minutes? Ten point No  nought point three's there look Mm now you want to read off the top of the scale for minutes. Fifteen minutes That's ten minutes Yeah. that's twenty minutes  that's fifteen minutes Mm. what's each of those little divisions? One minute. Right so point three  Fifteen minut er fif eighteen minutes. Eighteen minutes, right. B nought point seven five of an hour ? There  forty five minutes. Forty five minutes. C nought point four three hours  nought point four three  Oh! four  Nought point   four three  There That's right, well what's that? Twenty and six minutes  Si twenty six minutes. And nought point nought five of an hour? There Mhm  in minutes. Three. Three minutes. Then  E, change these to decimals of an hour  twenty four minutes  Nought point four. Nought point four. Fifty one minutes? Nought point eight five. Nought point five, good. Five minutes Nought point  nought point nought eight. Right. And thirty five minutes. Nought point five  eight. Right. Right well we'll just do this then you can have a go on the computer. The distance from London to Weymouth is a hundred and forty three miles  the train takes two hours forty two minutes for the journey  Mm? we can find the train's average speed like this  change forty two minutes to a decimal of an hour   what's that? Nought point seven. Right. From the scale above forty two minutes equals nought point seven hours Mm. that means the journey time  is two point seven hours , two hours forty two minutes is two point seven hours Mm. divide the distance by the time  hundred and forty three divided by two point seven equals fifty two point nine  round off to the nearest whole number  that would be? Fifty three. So the average speed is about fifty three miles per hour. Oh. So do the first one here Okay D two, London to Bristol, a hundred and eighteen miles at one hour twenty seven minutes . Nought point f n nought point four five. So one hour p one hour point, point forty five? One point four five Yeah. Nought point   one  nought. So that's the average speed? Yeah  er What did you do wrong? Divided it. Yes, but what did you divide by what? Divided a hundred and eighteen by No you didn't Oh. you divided one point Oh no four five by a hundred and eighteen. Oh. So what have you got to do? Hundred and eighteen Right, divided by by, I've forgotten what it was now. One point four five. Aha! What's that? Eighty one. Right  miles per hour. Yeah. Now just for interest's sake  do what you did before, divide Okay one point four five by one one eight, equals  now that's the wrong way, you've done it the wrong way  haven't you? Mm. So  push that button Oh! Oh!! It's turned it the other way round. It's the reciprocal button Oh and  a half, one over two  the reciprocal of a half  if you turn it the other way round it's two over one Yes. so it's two. Mm. A half is point five  Mm? the reciprocal is gonna be two. Ooh. Right? A quarter"

I'll give you a story to read when I'm fucking fighting okay? Yeah slags! But, and now, and now we're gonna go to the things what  parents have  wrong, like their, like, they spoil their child and everything at home. Or, here's a letter that was sent to me by  Teresa   from Birmingham. Dear Anthony, our five year old son, our five year old daughter is a very bad loser. When we play games with her sh , and she doesn't win she either gets upset  and  cries or gets angry. We've trying showing her that  we don't mind when we lose but it doesn't seem to work  work. Any ideas ? Well yeah, for,we ,what I will say to you is, try giving her a surprise, when you  when you or the father lose again  you should react by getting upset or angry. This is serious suggestions, often children can learn  from seeing themselves as others see them. When you get angry about losing your husband can,yo ha , losing your husband can ask for his wife, from your daughter about how to deal with it? Do this lightly so you can  so she can see  you're  you are acting and doesn't get frightened. Yet, seriously enough so  she hasn't had  she hasn't, so she has an opportunity to put herself  in your shoe. If you feel this  too much to do for you, stick to what you are, are already doing. Don't pay close attention to the detail. What happens, when you do show her you mind losing what do you next, what do you do next? And how can you tell her  you don't want to play any more games or, if you analyse her reactions carefully  you'll see how some encourage  encouraging, that changes your looking, for you, for you're likely to find she begins to, to modify her behaviour . That was from Teresa  from Birmingham. Now I wanna go onto a Dear Anne one, which is very interesting. Hold on. Right. Dear Anne, can I give him up? I'm divorced forty ye , I'm a divorced forty year old woman with two grown up children  and I am in a terrible situation. The thing is that  my  infa , infatuated with my  bo with my daughter's boyfriend who is also my son's best friend. It started when I, when I came home drunk after his, like,. He was  started flirting with me saying how older women turn  on. I was flattered. And one thing led to another. Af , I thought that first time would be the last, but since this, Steve's been dropping in during the day  while my son and daughter are at work. I know this sorried affair is wrong, that I end up breaking my daughter's heart, or upsetting my son, son's ha , but  I don't think I can give up Steve? Am I feeling desperate? Can you help ? Well  one thing is fucking kick him out! In our fucking house! Kick him out your house! Or you move and leave your kids at home really, that's what I'd do. And there's another one. Am I prepared too old? Perhaps I'm too hold, old. I am a twenty seven year old woman who can't swim. I've never enjoyed a beach holidays because  I'm too scared to go in the water. Now my moth , now  my friends at the mother, mother and baby group have joined the water babies class at the local pool, but I feel so nervous I can't go. How can someone my age learn to swim. Summer is coming this year and I really want to learn . Well, what you do is you go to your nearest leisure centre and  ask if you could do the  training classes for the adults who can't sa , who can't swim yet. And then, by about four months performance you should be able to do about ten metres whatever, you can do. Okay? Okay? Bye. Yeah, and here's a little funny picture out of the newspaper.

So, what do you do when you go to a hotel? You stop there don't you? So, what sector is it? Tertiary. Tertiary. Cos it's providing a  service. Service. If you go on holiday and there aren't any hotels, you're gonna be sleeping outside with the stars. You'll be back again. Can you give me an example of  the  electrician. Service. Which sector is the electrician in? Service. Service. Which i , which sector is the house builder in? Secondary. Secondary. Cos he's ma making houses. Which sector is the lawyer in? Tertiary. Tertiary. Which sector is the research assistant in a laboratory. Primary. No. Sectors? Secondary. Tertiary. No. Well, secondary. No. They're in the quaternary sector. Yeah, sir, you know you said the house builders are secondary if they're making something, they're also providing a service though aren't they? But tha , well so is the person who makes shoes. Cos if we didn't have somebody making shoes  we'd all be walking round bare foot. See what I mean? Yep. Yeah? A person who's  make tables, yeah? He's providing a service  but in th the prime role, yeah? Mm. Okay? The person is  who, for example, who makes medicine  yeah? He's in the manufacturing industry but they're providing a service. Yeah? Yeah. The person who sells the house  yeah? So if he sells he's tertiary. Is the tertiary. quaternary sector you do not need to know about. Okay? But quaternary sector is anybody who's into research or  er  high international finance and banking. Yeah? It's a new one that's only just been around  for the last fifty years. Okay? But just for your information. You do not need to know that. But most jobs  all jobs in fact  could be divided into these sectors. Because you could say  international banking  could go into the ser , tertiary sector. Sir? Is this for the key stage three  what we're doing? . No. Oh that's alright then. We're not doing that. You don't come under key stage until you go into  wa er er  year eight I think it is. Okay? Right, so these are the three sectors. Now, there are three  types of country  and these are  types of country. Right. Boy! Now then  the way that you categorize countries  what do I mean categorize? Well catori  Put them in order. Put them them into, not order that's rank, a different Like primary, secondary and Put into  Sir. different categories. Yeah. Yeah. Like , for what they're good at  Well  developing  Okay. or whatever. Now then a country that has  less developed countries  have  this is a graph now, yeah? Less developed countries  sit down quickly boy. Less developed countries have some primary industry. They have  very little secondary industry  but they have  even less  tertiary. Now this  is based on area, for example, d'ya remember  we looked at what's this country? Brazil. Brazil. Which part  is the rich North Brazil. which part is rich? South part. South  South. So here  there is service and there is some Manufacturing. manufacturing. It's changing because of the, what project? Environment. In the north  there isn't. Okay? There is  a lot more  primary. What primary activities are happening in the northern part of Brazil. Mining. The cutting down of trees. The cutting down of trees. What else? Farming. Farming. What else? Coal mining. Mining. Right. They do some man , this  is increasing. But it's only happening in some  less developed countries. Can anybody say why it's happening in so , some countries? You know I said jobs are divided into primary, secondary, tertiary, some, all countries can divide, can divide it up into less developed, developing, and developed. So  tell me then, why do only some less developed countries have primary industries. Cos they ain't got the companies to build up the  No. things. Not the companies. They ain't got the  People. No. I was gonna say they ain't got the things to do it. No. They haven't got any coal. They haven't got any trees. For example, a country that's in the da , in the desert  with no  India. trees. India. No fish. No land to farm. Yeah? And, and no  mines or minerals underneath the ground, can that have a lot of primary industry? No. No. So there's some countries in the desert  around the Gobi desert  that don't have any primary industry. Do you understand that? Yes? Now  they have some secondary  industry. Cos every country has to make some sort of farming tools, has to make some plates, you know you've seen photographs and you've seen pictures, some countries all have some sort of factory. They don't have big factories like they have at Dagenham, but small, what I call  almost  they are called these. Cottage industries. What do you think I mean by cottage industries? A small . Small. You know what a cottage is, it's a small house. These are small industries. Remembering, of course, that there will be some big industries, this is just general, okay? If you think of a less developed country, you might find some big industry, this is just a way to divide the . Now then, developing countries  have much more raw materials  industry, and that is still increasing. They have more  secondary, and they have more  area  but it's still  spatial. Because Brazil  is an example of a developing country. would use that much mining now, it's small . Well because what they do is  what do you think they do with the goods they dig out the ground? They don't use it? It's mostly for Export. export. Same as here, this is for  export. And this, is just  beginning. And it's mostly  multi-national companies that run it. Okay? Finally, a developed country  has much less  primary. Carl. Has a lot more  secondary, but  it is changing. Do we now, for example, make  er  big ships like we used to? Yeah. No. No. We make a lot of computers and things like that don't we? Changing the  what we make or manufacture. What do, gimme an example of a multi-national country, multi-national company in a developing country that makes things? Sanyo. What? Sanyo. Yes. Where are they made? Where are, where are Nike trainers made? Nike. Area, er America. Korea. Yeah. They're made in Korea. Yeah? That is a developing country, but it's a multi-national company. What's a multi- national company Craig? Er Look at the word. It's company that's got  bases in Yeah. All over the Yeah, many different countries. Have you seen the er  what's the advert with the globe? Is it I C I or  B P? Reebok. No. The globe. I C I. Yeah, the one with erm cream on it's face. That one. Erm, where   That's a toothpaste ad though. British Airways sir, is it? No. Mu , British Airways is a multi-national company. I C I is. I C I is. It's I C I. Yeah? You got o , I C I. Er ,. Okay. No it's not. But we have a lot American Express sir? Yeah. American Express! Yeah. Shows you on there. Is a multi- national  company. It is a multi-company. Yeah. You're right. We have a lot of tertiary. Now these  what do you think the E stands for? Everything. Export. Sorry. Engage. No , think! Yeah. We don't export some tertiary services do we? Exchange. Exchange things. Yeah. E equals I don't know. Enterprise. No. I don't know. Employ in that sector. Employee. Okay? So the number of people  in the country employed in that sector. About a hundred, two hundred years ago we had ninety five percent of people  i in this country were employed in farming. Now, these countries have ninety five percent, and they will gro , gradually grow  into a developed country. Do you remember last year  when we had the population graph that went like that? Well yeah, the birth rate. And in nineteen fifty  in U K It started to rise. Yeah? Nineteen fifty in Brazil  was exactly where  it was eighteen fifty for the U K. Do you remember? Compared the two graphs. Okay? So now you understand levels of development. There are three levels of development, what are they Richard? Less developed, developing, and Okay. developed. And e , do you understand this? Yeah? Yeah. Right. Going back to  this. Because when you come to write this up  you need to include this. Yeah. Okay. Physical environment. And there you have your third type coming up. You have, sorry, would you Yeah. okay you have, what's geology please? Geography. No! Otherwise it would have written geography on there! It's like saying what's a Ford? It's actually  Ford Fiesta. Sir. Is it like looking up something? Geology is rocks. You got rocks in there . Sir, some rocks have got hole in it, you know that? You know? Right. Okay? So the first thing in geology, why is geology important? Cos you got  What the rock is like? cos you got materials in it that we need. Yeah. Like tin, or iron, or gold  or even Minerals. Erm  Zinc. oil. Gold. Or zinc, any of those. Right. Climate? Weather. Why is that important please? Which sector really might the climate and weather help? Er Primary. Primary. Why? Cos it's farming. To grow it. Farming. Another sector? Secondary. Why secondary? Tertiary. Secondary could help because what happens if there's a lot of water? You could put a hydro-electric dam up there which could help electricity, which could help your industry. Yeah? And finally, tertiary sector, why is climate and weather useful for tertiary sector? Why is climate, what happens when it's really, really hot? You got fans. People go away . What do you mean you gotta buy fans? No. People go on holiday. People go on holiday there. Okay? Get the fans out. The next section. Animals and plants. Animals and plants, is obviously  to do with Tertiary. Farming. farming, because, for example, you can't keep  er er strawberries  in the cold. Because they'd die. You ought to be a farmer when you grow up. You'd make a fortune. Okay. And the fourth sector. Shops. No. Scenery, landscape. Why is that important please? So like  you're not  Sir. damaging the environment. Pardon? Not,yo , you're not damaging the environment. What? People come No. This is a picture  of a map of Japan. Is it? Yeah. Looks like a gu water pistol. All of Japan inside There's no environment  The brown  there. is mountain. Can you build cities on top of the mountains? No. Can you build factories on top of the mountains? No. Most of the mountains are all volcanoes anyway. There's a lot of earthquakes there. So most of your cities Yeah. There aren't any. Are round the edge of it. Around the edge of it. Sir, where's the wall then? Where's the The wall. The wool? Yeah the wall. What wall? The great wall? They gotta wall. Great wall of China? China's not in Japan. . They got a wall ! Okay. Let's move on. Okay. Yeah, there are flat The building's . Yeah. And soil. Why is soil important? So you can grow more resources. Cos farming involves the crops. What? So you grow more resources. No you can't.  the what? Crops. Farming. Farming. Crops, yeah. Okay. Now then the physical environment leads onto those three types of resources and they are  renewable Aha. , what, what's  mean? What have we been  calling it? Not renewable.  sounds like finish which means that eventually they will Die. run out. Give me an example of a renewable resource please? Trees. Renewable! Paper. No. Sir! Actual resource, come on. Coal. Renewable! Once you burn coal  die, it's dead. Oil. Water. Plastic. Water. Water. Yes,whe when you go to farmers grow plastic trees. In the future, yeah. Coal. Seen it Water, coal. Mm. New word for you aesthetic. Have you ever come across that  in  Yeah. art? Mm. Nah. Aesthetic means, it means, it is very much like the, everybody wants to look at it. Alright sir. Thought it was you three. Okay. Factors needed for life? Residence. Residence. What's that mean? Anthony? for a house where you can live in or  A house or a box. Yes. A house or box. Okay? Food, why do we need food? To keep ourselves alive. To keep us alive. Energy. No. Energy. You don't need it though. Why do we need work? Exercise. No. So we , so we can our bills. Money, to get money. Money, leisure. To have fun and exercise. Yeah. Other goods and services. Plumber. No, factors needed for life. Other goods and services. Subjects. Shops. Extras. Shops. Shops. Shops. Electricity, T V  Bank. station, banks, lawyers, accountants, that sort of thing. Health. Why do we need health? So we don't die. To look after li our bodies. To stay alive . Otherwise you're dead. Yeah. Movement. What does it mean here in terms of movement? They don't mean going dancing. Erm, you   Keep kicking ya. No. Transport. And keeping And   Transport of people. Good. Cathy. And Movements. movements  of  residence. What? What? The same as you do for planting  trees. I can see it now  . Information technology and ideas T V. Oh Computers Computers  Telephone  and  and video telephone and improvement in  Compact disc. technology. What happened if there are improvements in technology in the industry? No more workers. Right. Okay. All these things  provide economic systems. Agricultural, industrial, and service. Are they the same as pra , are, are they the same as primary, secondary, and tertiary. Yeah. No! No. No. Daniel! Er er er er er! Agricultural is not coal mining unless you eat coal! Ah? Industrial. Okay? These are systems. One provides us with food, one provi , puts  bits together  and the other provides us with a service. Okay? Then there is the cycle as you can see. Those three factors there, human, physical, and systems go together into that circle there. Carl, you'll be writing this up and you won't be able to do it! Those are individual, locational decisions. What do we mean by that? Individual locational decisions. Well look back to the factors needed for life first of all. People decide where they're gonna live  and what they're gonna live in. People decide what food they want, what to buy. People decide where they're gonna work, or have no, that sorted out. People decide what leisure facilities they're gonna use. People decide what other systems they're gonna have, for example, people I know still won't buy a television, or a video, or a satellite dish, or a microwave. Right? They won't do it. They don't want to have that. Yes? People decide whether to opt into the health service or Doctors. BUPA. or BUPA. Spit it out. Movement. People decide whether to use public transport, buy a car Go on the bus. Bus. move house, move country, move region. How d'ya move a country ? What? How d'ya move a country? No move from a country from one country to another. Okay? These companies decide whether  where and when to work, where and when to build. Why do you think  Fords decided to build at Dagenham? Cos there's lots of space. It's a city. A lot of space. A city. Spaces. Lots of reasons. They didn't just say  you know, er er er Dagenham Motors. there  we'll build there. Mm. Do you ever  Cos there's  does anybody ever watch the news where they say  Japanese company decide to locate in Manchester, or whatever. Yeah? Mm. No? It should do, Carl  Cos they get a nice profit. You should do Carl! divvy! You know, not just watch bloody Bart Simpson! Do I, do I ever. Right? People, why do people, why do people move to work on the Docklands? Cos they, cos they  Money. live near it. Or they're quicker. It's in the city now. No. when you moved here not to pay rent. Wo oh. There are lots of reasons why people choose. And then when people choose it creates what's there, a spatial pattern. And what are spatial patterns? Areas. Space patterns. A space pattern. A pa , a pattern of industry and ri , locations  Patterns , sort of a pattern, right. provides making goods and service available in all areas. Okay. Turn the page please. Nig gi gi geria,Nig gi gi eria,Nige ,gi gi ria,Niger gi gi ria,Niger gi gi ria . Your work so far has looked at the case studies of three kinds of activities  primary, secondary, and tertiary. They all provide jobs for people. They're all interlinked. How is a farm interlinked please? Let's if we can do Because you're getting wheat. In fact  what we'll do is, we'll stop after we've done this and then your books, I want you to get that diagram down and spirograph down. Now then  here we have  a farm, and it is a farm a mixed  farm. What do we mean by a mixed farm please? You've got er  animals and you grow wheat. Animals and crops. It's alright, I'm watching. Well, as I said before Okay. I'm watching . A mixed farm how is that linked to a  to the primary industry? To coal mining? Cos they're digging. No. But are they? Anthony  unless you can say something intelligent  shut your bloody mouth! Right? Aha. You have to think before you speak. Engage your brain before your mouth. They should work in harmo "
FIC FIC-BMW-008 -0.51 "CHAPTER EIGHT Edward had a car — an ancient but still magnificent-looking Ford Zephyr. When Sally got off the bus he was waiting for her, leaning against the bonnet, smoking a cigarette and looking more than ever the dashing young man-about-town. ‘Well, what do you think?’ he asked her. ‘It's beautiful!’ she gasped, much impressed. ‘I thought we'd go for a drive and put her through her paces,’ he suggested. Sally agreed readily. To go for a drive in a boyfriend's car seemed the height of sophistication. She only wished there was someone who knew her to see her climbing in. The car had a bench seat in the front and smelled of warm leather and old cigarette smoke. Edward took her on a tour of Bath — perhaps he was also hoping to be seen by someone who knew him!— and then headed out into the country. It was a fine warm autumn evening and although the light was already dying out of the sky the trees still looked magnificent, shades of gold and red blending with some still-green foliage. As they bowled along the country roads Sally sat erect on the bench-seat feeling like a queen. After about an hour's driving Edward pulled onto the forecourt of a country pub. ‘This is supposed to be a nice place,’ he said. ‘All the best pubs are out of town.’ The pub was picturesque and cosy with beams laden with gleaming horse-brasses, farm implements on the walls and a huge inglenook fireplace. They found a wooden bench seat in a corner and squeezed into it with their drinks — Edward had a pint of bitter and Sally a Babycham in a pretty glass decorated with a dancing fawn in a blue neck-bow. Edward put his arm around Sally and little prickles of excitement started deep inside her. She sat quite still enjoying them. Why didn't they last when Edward tried to go further, she wondered? When she thought about the things he did they became even sharper, so that it felt as if an electric shock was passing right through the centre of her  body. But the reality was different. All the lovely prickles and twists stopped and she was left with nothing but a feeling of panic, able to think of nothing but how could she stop him without making him angry. And afterwards there was just a feeling of let-down, of wanting him to hold her and kiss her and pet her like a little girl. No —pet was the wrong word. Petting meant doing that so no, she certainly did not want to be petted and much less to pet Edward. Perhaps there was something wrong with her, Sally thought glumly. ‘This is the life?’ Edward said, squeezing her gently. ‘What a day!’ ‘We had some excitement at home yesterday,’ Sally offered. ‘My sister is going to model in a charity show. I told you she was taking classes, didn't I?’ ‘Yes, you said.’ Naturally Sally talked about Paula. For one thing she was very proud of her, for another when she talked about her lovely sister and her exciting life she felt as if some of the glamour rubbed off onto her. But Edward had never met Paula. ‘Sounds as if she's doing well,’ Edward said. ‘I know. She's only done half the course and already she has been picked out for this job. I think she's going to go a long way — which she deserves to.’ Sally speared the cherry which was floating in her Babycham and popped it into her mouth. ‘Where is the show?’ Edward asked. ‘Bristol. Why?’ ‘Don't you think we ought to go along and support her?’ Sally was so surprised she almost choked on her cherry. She did not think men were interested in fashion. ‘Now that I've got the car we can do things like that,’ Edward went on. ‘We could take your sister home afterwards — if she wants a lift, that is.’ ‘So we could,’ Sally said, pleased. The thought that she was the one with a boyfriend with a car made her feel very important — one up on Paula for a change! They finished their drinks and left. It was completely dark by now, a black velvety night sprinkled with stars. Sally sat close to Edward on the bench seat and he drove with one arm around her, somehow managing to change gear with his right hand. When they were almost home Edward pulled into a farm gateway and turned off the engine. He pulled Sally close, kissing her, and she wound her arms round his neck, enjoying the first little prickles of yearning. All too soon however his hands began their usual wandering, slipping inside her blouse to unclip her bra hooks, pushing her skirt well up her thighs and trying to slip her panties off. Sally sat down hard on them, forcing her legs together, but as usual in the end he won and she retrieved the panties from the floor, pushing them behind her on the seat before they were trampled underfoot. ‘Let's get in the back. It would be much more comfortable,’ Edward suggested. ‘No!’ Sally said, realising the dangers of the back seat. ‘We ought to be getting home. Mum will be expecting me to be on the bus, remember.’ Edward ignored her protest, somehow contorting himself so that he could kiss her breasts, bare now, since her bra was around her waist, and still keep his hand between her legs beneath the rucked-up skirt. Something about the feel of his lips tugging at her nipples began to excite Sally and though she still felt nothing but discomfort from his probing finger she relaxed a little, leaning her head back into the corner provided by the bench seat and the window. It really was a rather pleasant sensation. Edward contorted again, biting first at her throat and then kissing her full on the mouth, forcing her lips apart with his tongue. Sally could taste the cigarettes and beer and found that that too was exciting. Then somehow she was spreadeagled along the seat and he was half-kneeling, half -lying on top of her and suddenly she did not think that what was between her legs was his finger. It was less sharp, bigger, hotter and instead of scratching painfully it felt good. Carefully Sally moved against it and felt a sort of yearning begin in the sensitised area between her thighs. She moved again experimentally. It was nice — oooh, really nice. Edward was still kissing her, his tongue circling inside her mouth, but all she could think about was this new sensation between her legs, a little like the way she felt when they danced, but even better. ‘Oh, Sally!’ he whispered, his breath ragged. Then suddenly he lunged and the pleasant sensation was gone, replaced not by pain but by a strange,full feeling and Sally began to feel frightened again. She wanted him to stop yet at the same time wanted him to go on in the hope that the lovely sensations would begin again. She was also dimly aware that they had passed the point of no return — now she had allowed him inside her it seemed wrong to yell at him to stop or begin fighting him. After a few thrusting minutes Edward gave a strangled cry that  seemed to come from deep in his throat and jerked out of her. He sprawled back behind the steering wheel, eyes closed, breathing heavily and clutching a handkerchief to himself. Sally lay without moving, looking at him in the light of the moon. She felt stunned, as if what he had done to her had somehow paralysed not only her limbs but her senses too, leaving her tense. There was no satisfaction, no pleasure, just a kind of aching emptiness. Then suddenly she became aware of how inelegant she must look, sprawled there with her skirt up around her hips and her bra dangling out of her open blouse. She sat up, straightening her clothes just as Edward opened the steamed-up window of the car and dumped the handkerchief out into the hedge. ‘You won't have any hankies left as this rate,’ she said, then giggled with embarrassment. What a stupid thing to have said! ‘Who cares?’ Edward asked grandly. He reached for her to kiss her again and Sally clung to him hoping that somehow the contact would make everything come right. But after a minute he put her away and started the engine. ‘I'd better get you home,’ he said. Sally felt like crying again. There must be something wrong with her. They'd gone all the way and still she didn't feel any of the things one was supposed to feel — elated, contented,together . Now that it was over Edward seemed to have gone a very long way away from her, as if she was no more than a stranger to whom he was giving a lift. For the remainder of the journey she fiddled with her clothes, trying to make sure she would look respectable when she arrived home and arranging the neck of her blouse to cover her throat where she was sure she must have another love bite. ‘See you on Saturday — same place?’ Edward said as he stopped the car outside her house. Sally nodded, the feeling of let-down growing. She had hoped he might arrange to come and collect her now that he had the car — and now that things were, well,seriousbetween them. But she didn't like to suggest it. As she slammed the car door she saw curtains at lighted windows twitching up and down the road. Well, at least he'd brought her home. At least the neighbours would know she had a boyfriend with a car. Walking up the path to the front door on legs that felt slightly wobbly Sally realised she would have to be satisfied with that. Sally and Edward sat in the very front row of the audience at the Fashion Show on canvas hospital-style chairs. Two feet in front of them was the catwalk, a bare narrow wooden platform angling away from a curtained entrance. Sally stared at the curtains wondering what was going on behind them. Chaos, probably. Paula had told her there were twelve models in the show and each of them had to wear at least ten outfits. One hundred and twenty outfits, not to mention all the shoes and hats and gloves. How on earth did they keep track of them all? When she was dressing to go out Sally was invariably unable to find the belt she wanted, one shoe had gone missing or one stocking developed a ladder. But one hundred and twenty outfits — what a nightmare! She glanced around at the audience who were appearing in twos and threes. Mostly they were very smart women in suits and soft draped dresses. Sally had agonised over what to wear — she was so afraid of letting Paula down — but eventually she had settled on a neat shirt-waister blouse and pencil skirt and Paula had loaned her a poplin duster coat in duck-egg blue with a thick soft grey Lucca Lamb collar. Sally felt good in it — the fur was gorgeously soft when she buried her chin in it and she thought that at least she could hold her own in the midst of all this elegance. The background music stopped and was replaced by an expectant hum, then that too ceased as the curtains parted and a man in a dinner jacket and black bow tie stepped out onto the catwalk. ‘Ladies and gentlemen — welcome!’ he boomed. His microphone whistled a little and Sally winced in embarrassment. The first model appeared on the catwalk, looking so glamorous, so unbelievably chic, that Sally could scarcely believe that her very own sister could be a part of this glittering performance. But a few moments later there she was — tall and beautiful in a little green bouclé dress with matching jacket. ‘It's her — it's Paula!’ Sally hissed, almost falling off her chair in excitement. ‘That is?’ Edward whispered back, stunned. ‘Yes, doesn't she look marvellous?’ Someone behind them coughed pointedly and they went quiet but Sally was wishing she could shout to the whole room: ‘That's my  sister!’ She was so proud she thought she would burst. And so happy and excited that it did not occur to her to worry about the devastating effect Paula was having on Edward. Behind the scenes Paula slipped out of one outfit, letting it fall to the floor, and reached for the next, hanging in the correct order on her clothes rail. The girl who was dressing her pulled up the zipper while Paula kicked off a pair of black suede shoes and eased her feet into crocodile ones. A quick flick of a comb through her hair — there was no hat to accessorise this dress — she reached for the crocodile clutch bag and moved towards the doorway for Arlene to give her a quick check before she stepped out onto the catwalk again. She felt alive as never before, and her eyes were glittering with excitement. Her initial nerves had all gone now although it still felt strange to be on a catwalk rather than the carpeted floor of the room at the Grand Hotel. Arlene gave her a small push to indicate it was time and she moved out. She couldn't wait to be back under the lights again with all eyes on her. As she sashayed down the catwalk she caught sight of Sally and Edward. The first time out she had seen nothing but a sea of faces, so hard had she been concentrating on what she was doing. Now she let her eyes dwell on them for a moment — Sally glowing with pride, Edward with a slightly dazed expression on his handsome face. Not bad! Paula thought. Not bad at all. You have quite a catch there, little sister. She did not dare look at them for too long for fear of missing her footing or forgetting a move but the look on Edward's face added another notch to her enjoyment. She twirled slowly, feeling his eyes on her so that it was as though she was receiving an injection of adrenalin. Oh how she was enjoying herself! She wanted it to go on for ever and ever! She was back at the curtains again. Time to turn, hold one last pose, then move out. But there were still eight outfits to go. Paula intended to make the most of every one of them. ‘Well, did you enjoy it?’ ‘Oh yes! Paula, you were wonderful!’ The show was over, the audience had drifted away to a reception room where they would be further wooed with a glass of champagne and a selection of canapes and nibbles and Paula, dressed now in one of her own suits, smart black barathea, had emerged from the dressing  rooms to meet the waiting Sally and Edward. She was still on a ‘high’, the potent adrenalin pumping through her veins, eyes sparkling, cheeks glowing with a becoming flush that owed nothing to the skilfully applied make-up. ‘Did you see anything you'd like to buy?’ ‘Oh yes — everything! But you know very well I can't. And anyway, it was you we came to see.’ ‘You weren't supposed to be looking at me. You were supposed to be looking at the clothes,’ Paula said artlessly. She was watching Edward out of the corner of her eye. Yes, he was every bit as good looking as she had thought he was when she had glimpsed him from the catwalk. And he owned a car! Not bad at all. He was only an office worker, of course, a clerk of sorts, Sally had said, not quite in the class that Paula intended to aim at, but very presentable for all that. And to think he was going out with Sally! The fact was somehow offensive to Paula's ego. In that moment she made up her mind. She didn't really want him, of course but she simply had to prove to herself that he would prefer her to Sally, given the choice. She smiled at him and felt his quickening interest. It was so easy, so incredibly easy. What was the expression? ‘Taking candy from a baby.’ It summed up the situation perfectly. ‘Did Sally say you might be able to squeeze me into your car?’ she asked, fluttering her eyelashes. ‘Hardly squeeze,’ Sally began, embarrassed, then broke off. Edward was not listening. Neither of them were. Edward was staring at Paula and Sally did not like the expression on his face. She felt the pit of her stomach fall away. ‘It's a big car,’ she finished lamely. ‘Are you sure I'm not making a nuisance of myself?’ Paula gushed. ‘Of course not. I have to drive Sally home anyway.’ The way he said it made Sally feel like a parcel for delivery. ‘I won't be long. I'll just get my things…’ Paula disappeared through the swing doors. Edward gazed after her. There was a glow about him that all men had when they were around Paula. Sally felt sick. ‘What are we going to do on Saturday?’ she asked, catching at his arm, desperate for reassurance. ‘Hmm? Oh… I don't know. Where does your sister go? Perhaps we could make up a party. That would be fun.’ For you, maybe, not for me! Sally thought. Paula reappeared, carrying the little modelling case she had had to buy and equip with cosmetics, shoes and spare tights. ‘I was just saying to Sally, why don't you come out with us on Saturday?’ Edward suggested. ‘We could go as a crowd.’ ‘Oh what a shame! I've already made arrangements for this week.’ But her eyes were flashing — nice try, Edward. Ask again sometime. Who knows? ‘Are you ready?’ Sally asked. All the shine had gone out of the evening. Suddenly all she wanted to do was get home and bury her head under her pillow. On Saturday Edward was late. Sally was frantic. He had never let her down before. Suppose something had happened to him? She waited and waited, the feeling of living a nightmare that had been with her ever since Thursday intensifying. At last just as she was contemplating getting the next bus home he arrived. She ran to meet him, weak with relief, but he was very vague as to why he was late and there was a remoteness about him that she could not penetrate. Something was wrong she knew though she could not have said what it was and she was not in the least surprised when he made some excuse about being a bit busy next week and unable to see her. When he stopped the car on the way home Sally threw herself at him. Tonight she would have been quite willing to let him do anything he wanted just as long as things would go back to being the way they had been. But Edward just didn't seem interested. ‘When will I see you again?’ she asked desperately. ‘I'll be in touch,’ he said vaguely and though it was a long time before she would admit it to herself Sally knew it was all over. That night she cried herself to sleep wondering where she had gone wrong and thinking she could not bear it if she never saw Edward again. It was probably because she was always so reluctant to let him make love to her, she decided. Everyone knew it was what boys wanted. If only she had been a bit more accommodating, a bit more enthusiastic. As it was he had obviously grown tired of the regular struggles and gone off to find someone who gave in more readily. But in spite of what had happened at the fashion show she did not think Paula had any hand in it until next day at breakfast. Paula, nibbling an Energen roll spread with reduced-calorie marmalade, said airily: ‘Oh, who do you think came into the store yesterday? Your friend  Edward! And I think you should know he wanted me to go out with him.’ Sally began to tremble. ‘What did you say?’ she asked. ‘That I couldn't possibly two-time you, of course,’ Paula said, watching Sally slyly. ‘I told him that whilst he was dating my own sister it was quite out of the question. He argued, of course— said that there was nothing serious between the two of you and you knew that. But I was adamant all the same.’ Her eyes narrowed. ‘You are still going out with him, aren't you?’ ‘I don't know,’ Sally said miserably. ‘Well the rat!’ Paula said, but she looked pleased. ‘You…you wouldn't go out with him, would you, Paula?’ Sally asked, hating herself for still wanting him. ‘Oh Sally, what do you think I am?’ Sally did not answer. She did not think Paula would have liked what she had to say. Edward never did get in touch with Sally again. She was sick with wretchedness, convinced she had only herself to blame — and of course the devastating effect Paula had on men — but still puzzled that it could have ended so suddenly without a word of explanation on his part. Besides being heart-broken she felt foolish and a failure. But she never did find out if he was successful in persuading Paula to go out with him now that he was free. She did not want to know. Once, months later, when she went to the Regency on a Saturday night with some girlfriends she practically bumped into him on the stairs. But he merely looked embarrassed and said: ‘Oh — hi!’ as he passed as if she was just a casual acquaintance. During the evening she caught sight of him a few times, always dancing, holding his partners very close, and managing to avoid her eyes. After that night Sally never saw him again."
FIC FIC-BPA-009 -1.34 "They searched for over an hour, following at first some vague footprints in the smudged, dark liquid. But they petered out in the maze of corridors. There was no trace of Silk. No response from his two-way radio. ‘Dead or alive, he's got to be somewhere.’ Forster was restless, not unlike a caged tiger, as he crossed and re-crossed the wheelhouse. ‘He can't have just disappeared,’ Nell said. ‘He must be in one of the containers down there.’ Delaney turned from the rain trickling down the window. ‘We'll do what we can, but let's not forget we are here to secure the ship, and the best place to do that is from here. We can't afford to get cut off and pinned down in the hold.’ When nobody spoke he broke the accusing silence. ‘Gene, let's go and find that lost radio room. Maybe we can beat the interference; get more information on what's been going on out here.’ ‘If they wouldn't tell us the first time, why should they do so now?’ Nell said, looking drawn, tired, with dark rings forming under her eyes. Delaney remembered again that look in Connors' eye; and knew Nell was right. But he said nothing, and as he led the way, Forster followed him. It was slow work, moving all the time with extreme caution, just the two of them, their beams of light, the ever-present blackness, and the half-seen outlines just beyond the light. They checked every door and cupboard in the superstructure. It was only when they came out of the rearmost door and found a temporary hut facing them with Radio Room marked on the door, that they realised why they hadn't found it the first time. At a nod from Delaney, Forster gently turned the handle. Then Delaney rushed forward, shoulder first, bursting the door open as he rolled in, with Forster's light beam sweeping way ahead of him. The room was empty. They stared around them in disbelief. Although Grant was the expert of the group, they both knew enough to realise that the equipment stacked around was sophisticated, and far too much for Titron if she had been but an ordinary container ship. And by now they knew she was not. A red light above the panel showed the equipment was on, supplied by automatic power, probably from batteries. Forster moved further into the room. ‘Looks more like the communications centre of a nuclear sub.’ They searched carefully until they were satisfied that the sensitive area was not armed for self-destruction, as many were. Delaney finally thumbed the button on the speaker set. The static roared out from the earphones, stronger than ever. He held the headset away from him, using only one ear as they tried several wavelengths. It was hopeless. Delaney gave up, shutting it off and swivelling out of the chair. ‘Something else is running on emergency power and producing that interference. Let's go and find out what it is.’ Forster held up his transceiver. ‘We could try tracking it with this.’ They went outside, Forster turning around with the set switched on, and finding the direction where the static was the strongest. ‘It's coming from the stern.’ They worked their way past the starboard lifeboat, and down another short ladder. Against the lighter foaming sea was just visible a large windowless domed structure. They paused, weighing it up. ‘Radar?’ Forster questioned. ‘Or some sort of electronic counter measure?’ Delaney nodded. ‘It wasn't obvious on the photograph they showed me.’ As they drew nearer they became conscious of a high pitched humming noise. Forster tried the transceiver. The interference was total. They walked around the outside. There was no visible way in. Forster scratched at a riveted panel without success. ‘Must be reached from another deck level. Underneath.’ Delaney nodded, sinking to his haunches. From one of his pouches he took what looked like a package of grey plasticine. Removing the wrapping he began pressing the plastic explosive tightly around the rivet line. Forster grinned. ‘Going to blow it up?’ Delaney didn't look up, but carried on with his preparations. ‘Those people at the MOD haven't played fair with us, so I owe them nothing.’ Forster chuckled. ‘You're probably going to set the taxpayer  back a couple of million, unless these things are made of plate steel.’ Delaney inserted the detonator pin attached to the timer, primed the circuit, and set ten seconds of fuse. Legging it, they got down behind cover just as the last second ran out. The night was split by an orange flash that lit the stem of the ship. It was followed by a hammer blow that echoed like thunder through the steel hulk. Dense, acrid smoke swirled unseen in the night wind, a choking mixture of burning chemical and insulation material that forced them to re-don their respirators. They moved back nearer, getting to windward. The domed structure was wrecked, smashed open at one side like an eggshell. Inside, the blaze was already fierce, fanned by the high wind, the heat building up so that they could see the metal beginning to glow. Forster's grotesque rubber mask nodded at the inferno. ‘Aluminium.’ Delaney agreed. ‘Now let's give this a try.’ He pulled off his mask and used his transceiver to call the bridge. Nell answered loud and clear. ‘What the hell is happening back there?’ ‘We're having a firework party,’ Delaney drawled, ‘with a bit of suspicious equipment. No contact — human or otherwise.’ His attempt at a joke misfired. ‘We're going back to the wireless room. See if you can raise Silk on his radio. He may still be alive.’ It seemed foolish, such a suggestion. There had been so much blood, but… Forster pointed at the fire. ‘What about that?’ ‘Nothing we can do but check it now and then,’ Delaney said, shrugging. ‘If the worst happens and it spreads I reckon help should have arrived before it gets serious.’ They turned back into the swirling smoke, and up the ladder to the superstructure, regaining the door to the wireless hut. Delaney went in, and pulled up as if he had been hit with a magnum at close range. Facing him was a man — white, shaking and terrified. Forster crouched in. ‘Jesus!’ The man screamed, leapt back, smashing over a chair. It was then that they saw the grenade in his hand. Gradually, Delaney opened his arms, finally holding his Uzi wide from his body. ‘Easy,’ he said quietly, ‘we're here to help you.’ Forster straightened up slowly, moving gently aside so that they were not a grouped target. Whimpering, the man cringed, hands shaking as he raised the grenade in front of him, one hand on the pin. Delaney's eyes never left those of the man as cautiously he tried again. ‘We're friends. Sent from London. There's nothing to worry about. Whatever happened here is over now. We can take you away.’ Forster, still inching aside, murmured sympathetically. ‘What's been going on? Pretty rough, was it?’ The man was sweating profusely, and suddenly a dark stain spread on the front of his trousers. Delaney and Forster exchanged quick, worried glances, for the man seemed to be on the verge of total derangement. Delaney realised that their respirators were dehumanising and frightening, thus preventing his facial expressions from communicating confidence. He began to move his hand towards his mask. ‘We're men from the Navy. You'll be  all right now. I'm going to take my respirator off. You'll see.’ As his hand closed on the rubber border, the man appeared to steady, staring fixedly as if fascinated by the spectacle. Delaney did nothing suddenly. He pulled the mask forward slowly, relying for his protection on Forster while he was temporarily blinded. Hair ruffled, his face came clear. Delaney smiled encouragingly. ‘There…’ The man screamed, yanked out the pin and threw the grenade. The brown egg struck the wall behind Delaney's head with a clang and whirled back to bounce on the top of the radio bench. As Delaney and Forster hit the deck they caught a fleeting glimpse of the crazed man going for it again. Still rolling, Forster shot from the hip. Instantly, the reaching figure became a puppet, jerking backwards in a pirouette that suddenly collapsed with the abrupt finality of cut strings. The brown egg spun on its own axis, became a bead of intense brilliant yellow that immediately filled the room. The explosion blew out the windows and door, and shattered the banks of units, sucking  up a whirling storm of glass and wires that whiplashed their arm-covered heads. It took seconds for the last bit to drop. The silence was deafening. They got cautiously to their feet, surveying the wreckage and carnage. Delaney looked bitterly at the shambles. ‘It's ripped the guts out of the radio.’ ‘And him,’ Forster nodded, looking down at the shattered, eviscerated remains of the man. Nell Anderson, Grant and Lawton listened while events were recounted. Delaney appealed to her. ‘Honestly, Nell, we did nothing sudden. It was as if he was utterly mad. Frightened beyond any recall.’ Forster nodded. ‘Maybe we should have jumped him, then perhaps you could have injected him with something.’ She shrugged non-commitally. ‘What could do that,’ Delaney wanted to know, ‘to drive a man so insane?’ His voice trailed off helplessly. Nell looked thoughtful. ‘Before we came aboard this ship I was thinking of the possibilities.’ Delaney eyed her speculatively. ‘Ergot poisoning. It would explain why the crew were not present…had possibly jumped overboard as mental disintegration deepened.’ ‘You're saying that this crazed man fitted the picture?’ ‘He would, indeed,’ Nell confirmed. ‘It is one of the reasons advanced for the solution to the Marie Celeste mystery, that the flour might have been contaminated with ergot. It produces weird hallucinations. Several so-called religious visions of the Middle Ages have since been attributed to it.’ Her face became troubled. ‘Only…’ Delaney grimaced. ‘Only what, Nell?’ She shook her head slowly, just the once. ‘It doesn't explain our mysterious man in the hold.’ There was a depressing silence. ‘An hallucination didn't kill Barry Silk, did it? Theo saw an exceptionally tall figure. And we haven't drunk or eaten anything from on board.’ Lawton shuffled uneasily, but didn't try and contradict her or go back on his description. ‘The gas?’ asked Grant. Nell shook her head. ‘Nobody else experience any ill-effects.’ ‘What she didn't say and was too embarrassed to talk about was an uncanny feeling that she had only recently become aware of, but now realised had been growing in her ever since she had set foot on Titron. It was as if a crumbling away of the carefully built-up layers of education, technical training, so-called civilisation, was taking place, leaving her stripped of all her carefully acquired adult assurance. Deep inside her had been awakened a nameless, primitive fear that at first had ached away in the background, but slowly had grown more evident, more pronounced, like a stared-at, half-perceived figure in the shadowy corner of a bedroom. The same feeling when, as a girl, she had woken from a nightmare, and sat in the dark, not sure if she was really awake; really alone. Titron she knew, with female, celtic instinct, was truly evil. And the nightmare was only just beginning."
FIC FIC-BPA-016 -1.5 "John Delaney knew now that all along it had been hunting them, that it was still hunting them, waiting for the right moment to pick them off at will, one at a time. One at a time! ‘Oh God! Nell.’ He sprang upright, ran, not caring if Lawton was with him or not. Lawton was struggling to get out of his pack the receiver that would pick up the radio signals from the miniature transceiver Forster said was attached to his slayer. Switched on it remained silent, until they reached the deck. There the bleeping came through loud and clear. ‘John.’ Delaney had already got one leg over the door frame that led below, and would have stopped for no one, except that his glance took in the  obvious truth. The main signal strength was coming in the direction of the deck cargo. ‘Nell's all right,’ Lawton said, adding: ‘It's over here and moving away. Delaney paused, then came to stand beside Lawton, watching as the latter swung the radio direction finder in a small arc. The stronger signal came from the port side. ‘No heroics,’ Delaney ordered. ‘We stick together.’ ‘What are we going to do when we make contact?’ Lawton asked. Delaney took out the remainder of his plastic explosives. ‘Give me yours. We'll try and get it with this. Failing that, it'll be phosphorus grenades.’ Lawton handed over his plastic, then found the two phosphorus grenades they each carried. They were among the most abhorrent of all weapons. Exploding phosphoruslanding on a body continued to burn in the tissue, inflicting indescribable damage. Lawton had seen the effect on friend and foe alike. Phosphorusand napalm . They'd kept him awake for many an hour prior to an op. Delaney fixed the detonating pins into the plastic, using the remaining length of wire to bind it to the timer, making a DIY bomb. Sweating profusely, he set the fuse to just  less than two seconds. They both knew that no timer could be relied upon to be that sensitive, that when he activated it, the chances were reasonable that it would detonate instantly — before he could throw it. They moved into the first, pitch black canyon, faintly lit by a Poacher's Moon, their passage marked by the persistent bleeping of the detector. In the sheltered darkness, out of the wind, it seemed to grow louder and more piercing. At every corner they paused, checked the signal strength, held it at arm's length to see if they could detect a greater strength around the other side. Grimly, Delaney looked up at the sky. Half an hour had passed. as if to set the final scene, the moon now rode majestically clear of the clouds, forming a hard, bright discus in the star-pitted blackness of the night. A blue column of light reflected off the calm sea. ‘It's on the move again,’ Lawton whispered. ‘Gone to the left.’ They followed, deep now among the containers, every muscle paining from their constant alertness. Twice before it had stopped, allowing them  to get close, only to move away again as their senses had reached a fever pitch of readiness. Nagging unease began to seep into Delaney's weary bones. What was it up to? ‘It's stopped again,’ Lawton breathed. ‘It strikes me it's searching for something.’ ‘Searching?’ Delaney thought about it, and decided it didn't make sense, unless it was looking for something that it badly needed. He half sensed, never really thought it though, that whatever it was it was looking for, was essential to its very existence. as if to confirm his train of thought there came a great crashing and a screeching of metal. ‘Sounds as if it's trying to break into one of the containers.’ Lawton's voice was tense, the signal bleeper at its loudest. ‘It's just around the next corner. And it's stationary.’ Delaney, excited, gripped Lawton's arm. ‘That's it. What do you reckon they hold up there on deck?’ Lawton shrugged. ‘Supplies for the rest of the ship?’ ‘In particular?’ Delaney prompted. ‘Of course. All the stuff that lab needs would be housed up here. Easier for stocking up at sea.’ ‘And that creature needs something. If we  time it right we'll catch it with its pants down.’ They waited, listening, as the salty night air with the sound of softly hissing waves was split by more shearing, protesting metal, and deep unearthly growls. There was a final crash, then silence. The bleeper kept up its steady, plaintive tone. ‘It's torn a door off,’ Delaney whispered. ‘And gone inside.’ ‘Yes,’ Lawton nodded in agreement. Delaney swallowed. ‘Ready?’ ‘When you are. Torches?’ He had already decided ‘yes’, otherwise it would be impossible to throw the bomb and grenades with any accuracy. He knew he would only get one chance with the plastic. They pulled the chunky torches from their holsters, and primed them for high output. They would burn like arc lamps for a very short duration. Delaney took hold of Lawton's shoulder and squeezed in time as he counted down. ‘Three. Two. One. Go !’ They leapt up screaming, zig-zagging forward in the classic battle charge of the British Army. Lawton took the left side. Delaney the right. The brilliant beams of their torches were like searchlights, swinging wildly for a second, until they finally converged at the back of a container with its door ripped open and lying at a crazy angle. And inside, where the beams of the torchlights met, was…nothing. It was empty! Delaney had a split second to realise that all along it had been setting up a trap for them. Then it struck, and all hell broke loose. Nell got to her feet and finally found her voice. ‘Who are you?’ The massive head, still with the marks at the side of the throat where the gills would have been, sighed. The voice was tiny, forced out with grunts of air, a whistle that was formed into words that were as incomplete and ill-defined as its body. Nell was reminded of the shrill talk-whistles of dolphins. ‘I…am… Piphros.’ It sounded mechanical, not unlike a well-trained parrot. ‘Thank you for saving my life,’ Nell heard herself saying. ‘What was that out there?’ The weird, ill-formed mouth moved again, and ignoring her question, countered with its own. ‘I…do…not…know…you.’ Was it thinking independently, or just mouthing another phrase? Nell decided to push her medical status. ‘I am Doctor Nell Anderson. Some of us were airlifted — that is, sent — to see what had gone wrong. To help you.’ Nell's fears grew that this living creature that was neither one thing or truly the other, would never understand her. It suddenly moved, walking in an uncoordinated and jerking movement, straight towards her. Nell flinched, but stood her ground. At the last moment, it veered away and came to halt by a vent. She realised that the creature needed heat. Doing nothing to disturb it, she moved deliberately to the door, and looked through the spy hole. There was nothing to see, only wreckage. She turned back, and only then remembered that someone had started the engines. If it had been Piphros, it was encouraging. ‘Are you on your own?’ ‘All…alone.’ The tiny child-like squeak sounded  wistful and sad. ‘Why did they all go away?’ Nell probed further. ‘It…was…the…madness.’ Nell shivered.: Having said it like that, even though she had suspected it all along, brought a terrible picture to the mind. ‘Do you know why the madness came?’ The creature avoided her question. ‘I…was…often…here. They…called…me… Pip.’ Nell digested the startling fact and tried to come to terms with the idea of this creature ever being a ship's mascot. Then she relented. In a strange way, if you forgot what it really was, perhaps never knew, here was a kind of trusting innocence that would have found favour with the non-scientific crew of Titron. The better side of humanity. Piphros seemed unable to speak for long, needed to rest its chest, which wheezed and bubbled. ‘Madness…came…with…accident.’ Piphros said quite suddenly. ‘What accident? Where?’ Perhaps it was her over-active imagination, or maybe she was getting used to that strange bland face and the enormous overhanging whale-like brow, but she felt she saw fear  flit across it, momentarily. ‘Mahon…operation…wrong.’ Startled, Nell remembered the operating theatre they had seen. She could only guess at the operation . Sickened, she knew that they were more likely vivisections of human tissue, experimental procedures with the toxic chemical and biological substances carried on board. ‘Who is Mahon?’ Piphros' head began to move from side to side, the entire body shaking, and oozing moisture. The creature was, Nell realised, terrified and sweating. Tears rolled out of the eyes. ‘Was that Mahon who came after me?’ ‘Yes. He…is…evil.’ Nell swallowed, slowly held out her hand, forcing herself to touch the obscene body before her, instinctively aware that a gesture of contact would be the most effective way to calm the creature. The skin, on contact, was surprisingly cold, the tissue blubbery, like a hard boiled egg. ‘You are safe now.’ The large head shook. ‘You…do…not…understand. Mahon…is…not…like…us.’ Nell flinched as the whistly words came faster  and higher, as Piphros grew more agitated. ‘Mahon…destroys.’ Nell still did not know the details, doubted now if anyone would. But it didn't matter. The essence was there in all its hideous implication. Nerve gas tests with human tissue. Embryological distortions. And God alone knew what other sorts of mutations and genetical mutilations. And then there was Mahon, and some disastrous accident that had spread a batch of nerve gas through the ship before it could be dealt with, leaving Piphros the only other creature alive. All because of Mahon. And Mahon was not like them — like Piphros. What grotesque outlandish possibility was it that made Piphros so certain, so frightened about it? Uneasily, Nell realised there was just one more mystery to solve on Titron. And it promised to be the most weird — was definitely the most lethal."
FIC FIC-C8T-001 -1.38 "Friday 16 September to Tuesday 20 September Once free of the knotted tentacles of the eastern suburbs, Dalgliesh made good time and by three he was driving through Lydsett village. Here a right turn took him off the coastal road on to what was little more than a smoothly macadamed track bordered by water-filled ditches and fringed by a golden haze of reeds, their lumbered heads straining in the wind. And now, for the first time, he thought that he could smell the North Sea, that potent but half-illusory tang evoking nostalgic memories of childhood holidays, of solitary adolescent walks as he struggled with his first poems, of his aunt's tall figure at his side, binoculars round her neck, striding towards the haunts of her beloved birds. And here, barring the road, was the familiar old farm gate still in place. Its continued presence always surprised him since it served no purpose that he could see except symbolically to cut off the headland and to give travellers pause to consider whether they really wanted to continue. It swung open at his touch but closing it, as always, was more difficult and he lugged and half lifted it into place and slipped the circle of wire over the gatepost with a familiar sensation of having turned his back on the workaday world and entered country which, no matter how frequent his visits, would always be alien territory. He was driving now across the open headland towards the fringe of pine trees which bordered the North Sea. The only house to his left was the old Victorian rectory, a square, red-brick building, incongruous behind its struggling hedge of rhododendron and laurel. To his right the ground rose gently towards the southern cliffs and he could see the dark mouth of a concrete pillbox, undemolished since the war, and as seemingly indestructible as the great hulks of wave-battered concrete, remnants of the old fortifications which lay half-submerged in the sand along part of the beach. To the north the broken arches and stumps of the ruined Benedictine abbey gleamed golden in the afternoon sun against the crinkled blue of the sea and, breasting a small ridge, he glimpsed for the first time the topsail of Larksoken Mill and beyond it, against the skyline, the great grey bulk of Larksoken Nuclear power Station. The road he was on, veering left, would lead eventually to the station but was, he knew, seldom used since normal traffic and all heavy vehicles used the new access road to the north. The headland was empty and almost bare, the few straggling trees, distorted by the wind, struggled to keep their precarious hold in the uncompromising soil. And now he was passing a second and more dilapidated pillbox and it struck him that the whole headland had the desolate look of an old battlefield, the corpses long since carted away but the air vibrating still with the gunfire of long-lost battles, while the power station loomed over it like a grandiose modern monument to the unknown dead. On his previous visits to Larksoken he had seen Martyr's Cottage spread out beneath him when he and his aunt had stood surveying the headland from the small top room under the cone of the mill. But he had never been closer to it than the road and now, driving up to it, it struck him again that the description ‘cottage’ was hardly appropriate. It was a substantial, two-storey, L-shaped house standing to the east of the track with walls partly flint and partly rendered, enclosing at the rear a courtyard of York stone which gave an uninterrupted view over fifty yards of scrub to the grassy dunes and the sea. No one appeared as he drew up and, before lifting his hand to the bell, he paused to read the words of a stone plaque embedded in the flints to the right of the door. In a cottage on this site lived Agnes Poley, Protestant martyr, burned at Ipswich, 15th August 1557, aged 32 years. Ecclesiastes chapter 3, verse 15. The plaque was unadorned, the letters deeply carved in an elegant script reminiscent of Eric Gill, and Dalgliesh remembered his aunt telling him that it had been placed there by previous owners in the late twenties, when the cottage was originally extended. One of the advantages of a religious education is the ability to identify at least the better-known texts of scripture and this was one which it needed no effort of memory to recall. As a delinquent nine-year-old at his prep school, he had once been required by the headmaster to write out in his best handwriting the whole of the third chapter of Ecclesiastes, old Gumboil, economical in this as in all matters, believing that writing lines should combine punishment with literary and religious education. The words, in that round childish script, had remained with him. It was, he thought, an interesting choice of text. That which hath been is now; and that which is to be hath already been; and God requireth that which is past. He rang and there was only a short delay before Alice Mair opened the door. He saw a tall, handsome woman dressed with careful and expensive informality in a black cashmere sweater with a silk scarf at the throat and fawn trousers. He would have recognized her from her strong resemblance to her brother, although she looked the elder by some years. She took it for granted that each knew who the other was, and standing aside to motion him in she said: ‘It's good of you to be so accommodating, Mr Dalgliesh. I'm afraid Nora Gurney is implacable. Once she knew you were on your way to Norfolk you were a predestined victim. Perhaps you would bring the proofs through to the kitchen.’ It was a distinguished face with the deep-set, widely spaced eyes beneath straight brows, a well-shaped, rather secretive mouth and strong greying hair swept upwards and curled into a chignon. In her publicity photographs she could, he recalled, look beautiful in a somewhat intimidating, intellectual and very English mould. But seen face to face, even in the informality of her own house, the absence of a spark of sexuality and, he sensed, a deep-seated reserve, made her seem less feminine and more formidable than he had expected, and she held herself stiffly as if repelling invaders of her personal space. The handshake with which she had greeted him had been cool and firm and her brief smile was surprisingly attractive. He knew that he was oversensitive to the timbre of the human voice and hers, although not jarring or unpleasant, sounded a little forced as if she were deliberately speaking at an unnatural pitch. He followed her down the hall to the kitchen at the back of the house. It was, he judged, almost twenty feet long and obviously served the triple purpose of sitting room, working place and office. The right-hand half of the room was a well-equipped kitchen with a large gas stove and an Aga, a butcher's chopping block, a dresser to the right of the door holding an assortment of gleaming pots, and a long working surface with a wooden triangle sheathing her assortment of knives. In the centre of the room was a large wooden table holding a stoneware jar of dried flowers. On the left-hand wall was a working fireplace, the two recesses fitted with wall-to-ceiling bookshelves. To each side of the hearth was a high-backed wicker armchair in an intricate closely woven design fitted with patchwork  cushions. There was an open roll-top desk facing one of the wide windows and, to its right, a stable door, the top half open, gave a view of the paved courtyard. Dalgliesh could glimpse what was obviously her herb garden planted in elegant terracotta pots carefully disposed to catch the sun. The room, which contained nothing superfluous, nothing pretentious, was both pleasing and extraordinarily comforting and, for a moment, he wondered why. Was it the faint smell of herbs and newly baked dough, the soft ticking of the wall-mounted clock which seemed both to mark the passing seconds and yet to hold time in thrall, the rhythmic moaning of the sea through the half-open door, the sense of well-fed ease conveyed by the two cushioned armchairs, the open hearth? Or was it that the kitchen reminded Dalgliesh of that rectory kitchen where the lonely only child had found warmth and undemanding, uncensorious companionship, been given hot dripping toast and small forbidden treats? He placed the proofs on the desk, refused Alice Mair's offer of coffee and followed her back to the front door. She walked out with him to the car and said: ‘I was sorry about your aunt — sorry for you, I mean. I expect that for an ornithologist death ceases to be terrible once sight and hearing begin to go. And to die in one's sleep without distress to oneself or inconvenience to others is an enviable end. But you had known her for so long that she must have seemed immortal.’ Formal condolences, he thought, were never easy to speak or accept and usually sounded either banal or insincere. Hers had been perceptive. Jane Dalgliesh had indeed seemed to him immortal. The very old, he thought, make our past. Once they go it seems for a moment that neither it nor we have any real existence. He said: ‘I don't think death was ever terrible to her. I'm not sure that I really knew her and I'm left wishing I'd tried harder. But I shall miss her.’ Alice Mair said: ‘I didn't know her either. Perhaps I should have tried harder too. She was a very private woman, I suspect one of those fortunate people who find no other company more agreeable than their own. It always seems presumptuous to encroach on that self-sufficiency. Perhaps you share it. But if you can tolerate company, I'm having a few people, mostly colleagues of Alex from the power station, to dinner on Thursday night. Would you care to join us? Seven thirty for eight.’ It sounded, he thought, more like a challenge than an invitation. Somewhat to his surprise, Dalgliesh found himself accepting. But then the whole encounter had been a little surprising. She stood regarding him with a serious intensity as he let in the clutch and turned the car and he had the impression that she was watching critically to see how he handled it. But at least, he thought as he gave a final wave, she hadn't asked him whether he had come to Norfolk to help catch the Whistler. Three minutes later he raised his foot from the accelerator. Ahead of him, trudging along on the left of the path, was a little group of children, the eldest girl wheeling a pushchair with two smaller children, one each side of her, clutching the bars. Hearing the noise of the car she turned and he saw a peaked, delicate face framed with red-gold hair. He recognized the Blaney children, met once before with their mother walking along the beach. Obviously the eldest girl had been shopping: the folding pushchair had a shelf under the seat lumped high with plastic bags. Instinctively he slowed down. They were unlikely to be in real danger, the Whistler stalked at night, not in broad daylight, and no vehicle had passed him since he left the coastal road. But the child looked grossly overburdened and ought not to be so far from home. Though he had never seen their cottage he seemed to remember that his aunt had told him that it lay about two miles to the south. He recalled what he knew about them, that their father earned a precarious living as a painter whose innocuous, prettified watercolours were sold in cafés and tourist shops along the coast and that their mother had been desperately ill with cancer. He wondered whether Mrs Blaney was still alive. His instinct was to pile the children into the car and drive them home but that, he knew, was hardly sensible. Almost certainly the eldest child — Theresa, wasn't it?— had been taught not to accept lifts from strangers, particularly men, and he was virtually a stranger. On an impulse he reversed the Jaguar and drove quickly back to Martyr's Cottage. This time the front door was open and a swathe of sunlight lay across the red-tiled floor. Alice Mair had heard the car and came out to him from the kitchen, wiping her hands. He said: ‘The Blaney children are walking home. Theresa is wheeling a pushchair and trying to cope with the twins. I thought I could offer a lift if I had a woman with me, someone they know.’ She said briefly: ‘They know me.’ Without another word she went back into the kitchen then came out to him, closed the front door after her without locking it and got into the car. Putting it into gear, his arm brushed her knee. He was  aware of an almost imperceptible withdrawing, more emotional than physical, a small delicate gesture of self-containment. Dalgliesh doubted whether that half-imagined recoil had anything to do with him personally, nor did he find her silence disconcerting. Their conversation, when they did speak, was brief. He asked: ‘Is Mrs Blaney still alive?’ ‘No. She died six weeks ago.’ ‘How are they managing?’ ‘Not particularly well, I imagine. But Ryan Blaney doesn't welcome interference. I sympathize. Once he lets down his defences half the social workers in Norfolk, amateur and professional, will move in on him.’ When they drew up beside the little band it was Alice Mair who opened the car door and spoke. ‘Theresa, here is Mr Dalgliesh to give you all a lift. He's Miss Dalgliesh's nephew from Larksoken Mill. One of the twins had better sit on my lap. The rest of you and the pushchair can fit into the back.’ Theresa looked at Dalgliesh without smiling and said a grave thank you. She reminded him of pictures of the young Elizabeth Tudor, the same red-gold hair framing a curiously adult face both secretive and self-composed, the same sharp nose and wary eyes. The faces of the twins, softer editions of her own, turned towards her questioningly then broke into shy smiles. They looked as if they had been dressed in a hurry and not very suitably for a long walk on the headland, even in a warm autumn. One wore a tattered summer dress in pink spotted cotton with double flounces, the other a pinafore over a checked blouse. Their pathetically thin legs were unprotected. Theresa was wearing jeans and a grubby sweat shirt with a map of London's Underground across the front. Dalgliesh found himself wondering if it had been brought back from a school trip to the capital. It was too large for her and the wide sleeves of limp cotton hung from her freckled arms like rags thrown over a stick. In contrast to his sisters, Anthony was over-clad, a bundle of leggings, jumper and a padded jacket topped with a woollen helmet with a bobble pulled well down over his forehead, beneath which he surveyed their busyness, unsmiling, like a stout imperious Caesar. Dalgliesh got out of the Jaguar and tried to extricate him from the pushchair, but the anatomy of the chair momentarily defeated him. There was a bar beneath which the child's rigid legs were obstinately  stuck. The solid uncooperative bundle was surprisingly heavy; it was like trying to manoeuvre a firm and rather smelly poultice. Theresa gave him a brief, pitying smile, dragged the plastic bags from beneath the seat then expertly freed her brother and settled him on her left hip while, with the other hand, she collapsed the pushchair, with a single vigorous shake. Dalgliesh took the baby from her while Theresa helped the children into the Jaguar and commanded with sudden fierceness, ‘Sit still.’ Anthony, recognizing incompetence, grasped Dalgliesh's hair firmly with a sticky hand and he felt the momentary touch of a cheek, so soft that it was like the fall of a petal. Throughout these manoeuvrings Alice Mair sat quietly watching from the car but made no move to help. It was impossible to know what she was thinking. But once the Jaguar had moved away she turned to Theresa and said in a voice of surprising gentleness: ‘Does your father know that you're out alone?’ ‘Daddy has taken the van to Mr Sparks. It's due for its MOT test. Mr Sparks doesn't think it's going to pass. And I found we'd run out of milk for Anthony. We have to have milk. And we wanted some more disposable nappies.’ Alice Mair said: ‘I'm giving a dinner party on Thursday evening. If your father agrees, would you like to come and help with the table like you did last month?’ ‘What are you going to cook, Miss Mair?‘ ‘Put your head close so that I can whisper. Mr Dalgliesh is going to be one of the guests. I want it to be a surprise.‘ The pale golden head leaned forward towards the grey and Miss Mair whispered. Theresa smiled and then nodded with serious satisfaction in a moment of grave feminine conspiracy. It was Alice Mair who directed him to the cottage. After about a mile they turned seaward and the Jaguar lurched and bounced down a narrow track between high, untended hedges of bramble and elderberry. The track led only to Scudder's Cottage, the name crudely painted on a board nailed to the gate. Beyond the cottage it widened to provide a rough, gravelled turning, backed by a forty-foot bank of shingle behind which Dalgliesh could hear the crash and suck of the tide. Scudder's Cottage, small-windowed, picturesque under its tiled, dipping roof, was fronted by a flowering wilderness which had once been a garden. Theresa led the way, between grass almost knee-high bordered by a riot of unpruned roses, to the porch, then reached for a key hung high on a nail, less, Dalgliesh supposed, for security reasons than to ensure that it wasn't lost. With Dalgliesh carrying Anthony they passed into the cottage. It was much lighter than he had expected, largely because of a rear door, now open, which led to a glass extension giving a view of the headland. He was aware of the room's clutter, the central wooden table still covered with the remains of their midday meal, an assortment of plates smeared with tomato sauce, a half-eaten sausage, a large bottle of orangeade uncapped; the children's clothes thrown over the back of a low nursing chair before the fireplace, of the smell of milk and bodies and wood smoke. But what held his attention was a large oil painting propped on a chair and fronting the door. It was a three-quarter portrait in oils of a woman, painted with remarkable power. It dominated the room so that he and Alice Mair stood for a moment, silently regarding it. The painter had avoided caricature, if only just, but the portrait was, he felt, intended less as a physical likeness than an allegory. Behind the wide, full mouth, the arrogant stare of the eyes, the dark, crimped, Pre-Raphaelite hair streaming in the wind, was a careful delineation of the headland, its objects disposed and painted with the meticulous attention to detail of a sixteenth-century primitive; the Victorian rectory, the ruined abbey, the half-demolished pillbox, the crippled trees, the small white mill like a child's toy and, gaunt against a flaming evening sky, the stark outline of the power station. But it was the woman, painted more freely, who dominated the landscape, arms stretched, the palms facing outwards in a parody of blessing. Dalgliesh's private verdict was that it was technically brilliant, but overwrought and painted, he felt, in hatred. Blaney's intention to produce a study of evil was as clear as if the portrait had been labelled. It was so different from the artist's usual work that without the bold signature, the single surname, Dalgliesh might have wondered if it was, in fact, his work. He recalled Blaney's pallid and innocuous watercolours of the better-known beauty spots of Norfolk: Blakeney, St Peter Mancroft and the cathedral at Norwich, which he produced for the local shops. They could have been painted from picture postcards and probably were. And he could recall seeing one or two small oils hung in local restaurants and pubs, slap-dash in technique and economical of paint, but so different from the prettified watercolours that it was hard to believe that they too were by the same hand. But this portrait was different from either; the wonder was that the artist who could  produce this disciplined splurge of colour, this technical artistry and imagination, had been content to churn out meretricious souvenirs for the tourist trade. ‘You didn't know I could do it, did you?’ Absorbed in the painting, their ears hadn't caught his almost silent approach through the open door. He moved round and joined them and stared intently at the portrait as if seeing it for the first time. His daughters, as though obedient to some unspoken command, grouped themselves around him in what in older children could have been a conscious gesture of family solidarity. Dalgliesh had last seen Blaney six months earlier splashing alone along the edge of the beach, painting gear slung over his shoulder, and was shocked by the change in the man. He stood a gaunt six foot three in his torn jeans, the checked, woollen shirt open almost to the waist, his long grubby feet in the open sandals looking like dry, brown bones. His face was a picture of red ferocity, the straggling red hair and beard, the bloodshot eyes, the gaunt-featured face burnt red by wind and sun, which yet showed on the cheekbones and under the eyes the bruising stain of tiredness. Dalgliesh saw Theresa slip her hand into his while one of the twins moved closer to him and clasped both arms firmly round one of his legs. Dalgliesh thought that however ferocious he might appear to the outside world his children had no fear of him. Alice Mair said calmly: ‘Good afternoon, Ryan,’ but did not appear to expect an answer. She nodded towards the portrait and went on: ‘It's remarkable, certainly. What are you proposing to do with it? I can hardly suppose that she sat for you or that it was commissioned.‘ ‘She didn't need to sit. I know that face. I'm showing it at the Norwich Contemporary Arts Exhibition on October the third if I can get it there. The van is out of use.’ Alice Mair said: ‘I'll be driving to London within the next week. I could collect it and deliver it if you let me have the address.’ He said: ‘If you like.’ The response was ungracious but Dalgliesh thought he detected relief. Then he added: ‘I'll leave it packed and labelled to the left of the door in the painting shed. The light is just above it. You can collect it whenever it suits you. No need to knock.’ The last words had the force of a command, almost of a warning. Miss Mair said: ‘I'll telephone you when I know when I'm going. By the way, I don't think you've met Mr Dalgliesh. He saw the children on the road and thought of giving them a lift.’ Blaney didn't say thank you, but after a moment's hesitation held out his hand which Dalgliesh grasped. Then he said gruffly, ‘I liked your aunt. She telephoned offering to help when my wife was ill and when I said there was nothing she or anyone could do, she didn't keep fussing. Some people can't keep away from a deathbed. Like the Whistler, they get their kicks from watching people die.’ ‘No,’ said Dalgliesh, ‘she never fussed. I shall miss her. I'm sorry about your wife.’ Blaney didn't reply, but stared hard at Dalgliesh as if assessing the sincerity of that simple statement, and then said curtly, ‘Thank you for helping the children,’ and lifted his son from Dalgliesh's shoulder. It was a clear gesture of dismissal. Neither of them spoke as Dalgliesh negotiated the track and finally turned on to the higher road. It was as if the cottage had exerted some spell which it was important to throw off before they talked. Then he asked: ‘Who is that woman in the portrait?’ ‘I hadn't realized that you didn't know. Hilary Robarts. She's Acting Administrative Officer at the power station. Actually you'll meet her at dinner on Thursday night. She bought Scudder's Cottage when she first arrived here three years ago. She's been trying to get the Blaneys out for some time. There's been a certain amount of feeling about it locally.’ Dalgliesh asked: ‘Why does she want to gain possession? Does she propose to live there?’ ‘I don't imagine so. I think she bought it as an investment and wants to sell. Even a remote cottage — particularly a remote cottage — has value on this coast. And she has some justice on her side. Blaney did say that his tenancy would be short-term. I think she feels a certain resentment that he used his wife's illness, her death, and now uses the children as an excuse for reneging on his undertaking to leave when she wanted the cottage back.’ Dalgliesh was interested that Alice Mair apparently knew so much about local affairs. He had thought of her as essentially a private woman who would be very little concerned with her neighbours or their problems. And what about himself? In his deliberations whether to sell or keep on the mill as a holiday home he had seen it as a refuge from London, eccentric and remote, providing a temporary escape from the demands of his job and the pressures of success. But how far, even as an occasional visitor, could he isolate himself from the community, from their private tragedies no less than their dinner  parties? It would be simple enough to avoid their hospitality given sufficient ruthlessness and he had never lacked that when it came to safeguarding his privacy. But the less tangible demands of neighbourliness might be less easily shrugged away. It was in London that you could live anonymously, could create your own ambience, could deliberately fabricate the persona which you chose to present to the world. In the country you lived as a social being and at the valuation of others. So he had lived in childhood and adolescence in the same country rectory, taking part each Sunday in a familiar liturgy which reflected, interpreted, and sanctified the changing seasons of the farming year. It was a world he had relinquished with small regret and he had not expected to find it again on Larksoken headland. But some of its obligations were here, deep-rooted even in this arid and unfertile earth. His aunt had lived as privately as any woman he knew, but even she had visited and tried to help the Blaneys. He thought of the man, bereft and incarcerated in that cluttered cottage behind the great dyke of shingle, listening night after night to the never-ceasing moaning of the tide, and brooding on the wrongs, real or imaginary, which could inspire that hate-filled portrait. It could hardly be healthy for him or for his children. Come to that, he thought grimly, it could hardly be healthy for Hilary Robarts. He asked: ‘Does he get much official help with the children? It can't be easy.’ As much as he's prepared to tolerate. The local authority has arranged for the twins to attend some kind of daycare centre. They get collected most days. And Theresa, of course, is at school. She catches the bus at the end of the lane. She and Ryan between them cope with the baby. Meg Dennison — she housekeeps for the Reverend and Mrs Copley at the Old Rectory — thinks we ought to do more for them but it's difficult to see precisely what. As an ex-schoolmistress I should have thought she'd had her fill of children and I make no pretence at understanding them.’ Dalgliesh remembered her whispered confidence to Theresa in the car, the child's intent face and brief transforming smile, and thought that she understood one child at least far better than she would probably claim. But his thoughts returned to the portrait. He said: ‘It must be uncomfortable, particularly in a small community, to be the object of so much malevolence.’ She understood at once what he meant. ‘Hatred rather than malevolence, wouldn't you say? Uncomfortable and rather frightening. Not that Hilary Robarts is easily frightened. But she's becoming something of an obsession with Ryan, particularly since his wife's death. He chooses to believe that Hilary practically badgered her into her grave. It's understandable, I suppose. Human beings need to find someone to blame both for their misery and for their guilt. Hilary Robarts makes a convenient scapegoat.’ It was a disagreeable story and coming as it did after the impact of the portrait it provoked in Dalgliesh a mixture of depression and foreboding which he tried to shake off as irrational. He was glad to let the subject drop and they drove in silence until he left her at the gate of Martyr's Cottage. To his surprise she held out her hand and gave him, once again, that extraordinary, attractive smile. ‘I'm glad you stopped for the children. I'll see you, then, on Thursday night. You will be able to make your own assessment of Hilary Robarts and compare the portrait with the woman.’ As the Jaguar crested the headland Neil Pascoe was dumping rubbish into one of the two dustbins outside the caravan, two plastic bags of empty tins of soup and baby food, soiled disposable napkins, vegetable peelings and squashed cartons, already malodorous despite his careful sealing of the bags. Firmly replacing the lid he marvelled, as he always did, at the difference one girl and an eighteen-month-old baby could make to the volume of household waste. Climbing back into the caravan, he said: ‘A Jag has just passed. It looks as if Miss Dalgliesh's nephew is back.’ Amy, fitting a recalcitrant new ribbon to the ancient typewriter, didn't bother to look up. ‘The detective. Perhaps he's come to help catch the Whistler.‘ ‘That isn't his job. The Whistler is nothing to do with the Met Police. It's probably just a holiday. Or perhaps he's here to decide what to do with the mill. He can hardly live here and work in London.’ ‘So why don't you ask him if we can have it? Rent-free, of course. We could caretake, see that no one squats. You're always saying it's antisocial for people to have second homes or leave property empty. Go on, have a word with him. I dare you. Or I will if you're too scared.‘ It was, he knew, less a suggestion than a half-serious threat. But for a moment, gladdened by her easy assumption that they were a couple, that she wasn't thinking of leaving him, he actually entertained the idea as a feasible solution to all their problems. Well, almost all. But a glance round the caravan restored him to reality. It was becoming difficult to remember how it had looked fifteen months ago, before Amy and Timmy had entered his life; the homemade shelves of orange boxes ranged against the wall which had held his books, the two mugs, two plates and one soup bowl, which had been adequate for his needs, neatly stacked in the cupboard, the excessive cleanliness of the small kitchen and lavatory, his bed smooth under the coverlet of knitted woollen squares, the single hanging cupboard which had been sufficient for his meagre wardrobe, his other possessions boxed and tidily stowed in the chest under the seat. It wasn't that Amy was dirty; she was continually washing herself, her hair, her few clothes. He Spent hours carrying water from the tap outside Cliff Cottage to which they had access. He was continually having to fetch new Calor-gas cylinders from the general store in Lydsett village and steam from the almost constantly boiling kettle made the caravan a damp mist. But she was chronically untidy; her clothes lying where she had dropped them, shoes kicked under the table, knickers and bras stuffed beneath cushions and Timmy's toys littering the floor and table top. The make-up, which seemed to be her sole extravagance, cluttered the single shelf in the cramped shower and he would find half-empty, opened jars and bottles in the food cupboard. He smiled as he pictured Commander Adam Dalgliesh, that no doubt fastidious widower, making his way through the accumulated mess to discuss their suitability as caretakers at Larksoken Mill. And then there were the animals. She was incurably sentimental about wildlife and they were seldom without some maimed, deserted or starving creatures. Seagulls, their wings covered with oil, were cleansed, caged and then let free. There had been a stray mongrel whom they had named Herbert, with a large uncoordinated body and look of lugubrious disapproval who had attached himself to them for a few weeks and whose voracious appetite for dog-meat and biscuits had had a ruinous effect on the housekeeping. Happily Herbert had eventually trotted off and to Amy's distress had been seen no more, although his lead still hung on the caravan door, a limp reminder of her bereavement. And now there were the two black and white kittens found abandoned on the grass verge of the coast road as they came back in the van from Ipswich. Amy had screamed for him to stop and, scooping up the kittens, had thrown back her head and howled obscenities at the cruelty of human beings. They slept on Amy's bed, drank indiscriminately from any saucer of milk or tea put down for them, were remarkably docile under Timmy's boisterous caresses and, happily, seemed content with the cheapest kind of tinned cat food. But he was glad to have them because they too seemed to offer some assurance that Amy would stay. He had found her — and he used the word much as he might of finding a particularly beautiful sea-washed stone — one late June afternoon the previous year. She had been sitting on the shingle  staring out to sea, her arms clasped round her knees, Timmy lying asleep on the small rug beside her. He was wearing a blue fleecy sleeping suit embroidered with ducks from which his round face seemed to have spilled over, still and pink as a porcelain, Painted doll, the delicate lashes brush-tipped on the plump cheeks. And she, too, had something of the precision and contrived charm of a doll with an almost round head poised’ on a long delicate neck, a snub nose with a splatter of freckles, a small mouth with a full upper lip beautifully curved and a bristle of cropped hair, originally fair but with bright orange tips which caught the sun and trembled in the breeze so that the whole head seemed for a moment to have a vivid life separated from the rest of her body and, the image changing, he had seen her as a bright exotic flower. He could remember every detail of that first meeting. She had been wearing blue faded jeans, and a white sweat shirt flattened against the pointed nipples and the upturned breasts; the cotton seeming too thin a protection against the freshening onshore breeze. As he approached tentatively, wanting to seem friendly but not to alarm her, she had turned on him a long and curious glance from remarkable, slanted, violet-blue eyes. Standing over her, he had said: ‘My name's Neil Pascoe. I live in that caravan on the edge of the cliff. I'm just going to make some tea. I wondered if you ‘d like a mug.’ ‘I don't mind, if you're making it.’ She had turned away at once and gazed again out to sea. Five minutes later he had slithered down the sandy cliffs, a mug of tea slopping in each hand. He heard himself say: ‘May I sit down?’ ‘Please yourself. The beach is free.’ So he had lowered himself to sit beside her and together they had stared wordlessly towards the horizon. Looking back on it he was amazed both at his boldness and at the seeming inevitability and naturalness of that first encounter. It was several minutes before he had found the courage to ask her how she had got to the beach. She had shrugged. ‘By bus to the village and then I walked.’ ‘It was a long way carrying the baby.‘ ‘I'm used to walking a long way carrying the baby.’ And then, under his hesitant questioning, the story had come out, told by her without self-pity, almost, it had seemed, without particular interest, as if the events had happened to someone else. It was not, he supposed, an unusual tale. She was living in one of the small  private hotels in Cromer on Social Security. She had been in a squat in London but had thought it would be pleasant to have some sea air for the baby for the summer. Only it wasn't working out. The woman at the hotel didn't really want kids and with summer holidays approaching could get a better rate for her rooms. She didn't think she could be turned out, but she wasn't going to stay, not with that bitch. He asked: ‘Couldn't the baby's father help?’ ‘He hasn't got a father. He did have a father — I mean, he isn't Jesus Christ. But he hasn't got one now.’ ‘Do you mean that he's dead or that he's gone away?’ ‘Could be either, couldn't it? Look, if I knew who he was I might know where he was, OK?’ Then there had been another science during which she took periodical gulps of her tea and the sleeping baby stirred and gave small pig-like grunts. After a few minutes he had spoken again. ‘Look, if you can't find anywhere else in Cromer you can share the caravan for a time.’ He had added hastily: ‘I mean, there is a second bedroom. It's very small, only just room for the bunk, but it would do for a time. I know it's isolated here but it's close to the beach which would be nice for the baby.‘ She had turned on him again that remarkable glance in which for the first time he had detected to his discomfiture a brief flash of intelligence and of calculation. ‘All right,’ she said. ‘If I can't find anywhere else I'll come back And he had lain awake late that night half hoping, half dreading that she would return. And she had returned the following afternoon, carrying Timmy on her hip and the rest of her possessions in a backpack. She had taken over the caravan and his life. He didn't know whether what he felt for her was love, affection or pity, or a mixture of all three. He only knew that in his anxious and over-concerned life his second greatest fear was that she might leave. He had lived in the caravan now for just over two years, supported by a research grant from his northern university to study the effect of the Industrial Revolution on the rural industries of East Anglia. His dissertation was nearly finished but for the last six months he had almost stopped work on it and had devoted himself entirely to his passion, a crusade against nuclear power. From the caravan on the very edge of the sea he could see Larksoken Power Station stark against the skyline, as uncompromising as his own will to oppose it, a symbol and a threat. It was from the caravan that he ran People Against Nuclear Power, with its acronym PANUP, the small organization of which he was both founder and president. The caravan had been a stroke of luck. The owner of Cliff Cottage was a Canadian who, returning to his roots and seduced by nostalgia, had bought it on impulse as a possible holiday home. About fifty years earlier there had been a murder at Cliff Cottage. It had been a fairly commonplace murder, a henpecked husband at the end of his tether who had taken a hatchet to his virago of a wife. But if it had been neither particularly interesting nor mysterious, it had certainly been bloody. After the cottage had been bought the Canadian's wife had heard graphic accounts of spilt brains and blood-spattered walls and had declared that she had no intention of living there in summer or at any other time. Its very isolation, once attractive, now appeared both sinister and repellent. And to compound the problem, the local planning authority had shown themselves unsympathetic to the owner's over-ambitious plans for rebuilding. Disillusioned with the cottage and its problems, he had boarded up the windows and returned to Toronto, meaning eventually to come back and make a final decision about his ill-advised purchase. The previous owner had parked a large, old-fashioned caravan at the back and the Canadian had made no difficulty about letting this to Neil for two pounds a week, seeing it as a useful way of having someone to keep an eye on the property. And it was the caravan, at once his home and his office, from which Neil conducted his campaign. He tried not to think about the time, six months ahead, when his grant would finish and he would need to find work. He knew that he had somehow to stay here on the headland, to keep always in view that monstrous building which dominated his imagination as it did his view. But now, to the uncertainty about his future funding, was added a new and more terrifying threat. About five months earlier he had attended an open day at the power station during which the Acting Administrative Officer, Hilary Robarts, had given a short preliminary talk. He had challenged almost everything she had said and what was meant as an informative introduction to a public relations exercise had developed into something close to a public brawl. In the next issue of his news-sheet he had reported on the incident in terms which he now realized had been unwise. She had sued him for libel. The action was due to be heard in four weeks, time and he knew that, successful or not, he was faced with ruin. Unless she died in the next  few weeks — and why should she die?— it could be the end of his life on the headland, the end of his organization, the end of all he had planned and hoped to do. Amy was typing envelopes, sending out the final copies of the newsletter. A pile was already to hand and he began folding the pamphlets and inserting them into the envelopes. The job wasn't easy. He had tried to economize with the size and quality and the envelopes were in danger of splitting. He now had a mailing list of 250, only a small minority of whom were active supporters of PANUP. Most never paid any dues towards the organization and the majority of the pamphlets went unsolicited to public authorities, local firms and industry in the vicinity of Larksoken and Sizewell. He wondered how many of the 250 were read and thought, with a sudden spasm of anxiety and depression, of the total cost of even this small enterprise. And this month's newsletter wasn't his best. Rereading one before he put it in the envelope, it seemed to him to be ill-organized, to have no coherent theme. The principal aim now was to refute the growing argument that nuclear power could avoid the damage to the environment through the greenhouse effect, but the mixture of suggestions ranging from solar power to replacing light bulbs with those which consumed seventy-five per cent less energy seemed naïve and hardly convincing. His article argued that nuclear-generated electricity couldn't realistically replace oil and fossil fuels unless all nations built sixteen new reactors a week in the five years from 1995, a programme impossible to achieve and one which, if practicable, would add intolerably to the nuclear threat. But the statistics, like all his figures, were culled from a variety of sources and lacked authority. Nothing he produced seemed to him genuinely his own work. And the rest of the newsletter was a jumble of the usual scare stories, most of which he had used before; allegations of safety breaches which had been covered up, doubts about the safety of the ageing Magnox stations, the unsolved problem of storing and transporting nuclear waste. And this issue he had been hard put to it to find a couple of intelligent letters for the correspondence page; sometimes it seemed that every crackbrain in north-east Norfolk read the PANUP newsletter but that no one else did. Amy was picking at the letters of the typewriter which had a persistent tendency to stick. She said: ‘Neil, this is a bloody awful machine. It would be quicker to write the addresses by hand.’ ‘It's better since you cleaned it and the new ribbon looks fine.’ ‘It's still diabolical. Why don't you buy a new one? It would save time in the end.’ ‘I can't afford it.’ ‘You can't afford a new typewriter and you think you're going to save the world.’ ‘You don't need possessions to save the world, Amy. Jesus Christ had nothing; no home, no money, no property.’ ‘I thought you said when I came here that you weren't religious.’ It always surprised him that, apparently taking no account of him, she could yet recall comments he had made months earlier. He said: ‘I don't believe Christ was God. I don't believe there is a God. But I believe in what He taught.‘ ‘If He wasn't a God, I don't see that it matters much what He taught. Anyway, all I can remember is something about turning the other cheek which I don't believe in. I mean, that's daft. If someone slaps your left cheek then you slap his right, only harder. Anyway, I do know they hung Him up on the cross so it didn't do Him a lot of good. That's what turning the other cheek does for you.’ He said: ‘I've got a Bible here somewhere. You could read about Him if you wanted to. Make a start with St Mark's Gospel.’ ‘No thanks. I had enough of that in the home.’ ‘What home?’ ‘Just a home, before the baby was born.’ ‘How long were you there?’ ‘Two weeks. Two weeks too bloody many. Then I ran away and found a squat.’ ‘Where was that, the squat?’ ‘Islington, Camden, King's Cross, Stoke Newington. Does it matter? I'm here now, OK?’ ‘It's OK by me, Amy.’ Lost in his thoughts, he hardly realized that he had given up folding the pamphlets. Amy said: 'Look, if you're not going to help with these envelopes you might as well go and put a new washer on that tap. It's been dripping for weeks and Timmy's always falling about in the mud.’ ‘All right,’ he said, ‘I'll do it now.’ He took down his tool kit from the high cupboard where it was kept well out of Timmy's reach. He was glad to be out of the caravan. It had become increasingly claustrophobic in the last few weeks. Outside he bent to talk to Timmy, caged in his playpen. He and Amy  had collected large stones from the beach, looking for those with holes in them — and he had strung them on to strong cord and tied them along one side of the playpen. Timmy would spend hours happily banging them together or against the bars or, as now, slobbering against one of the stones in an attempt to get it into his mouth. Sometimes he would communicate with individual flints, a continuous admonitory prattle broken by sudden triumphant squeals. Kneeling down Neil clutched the bars, rubbed his nose against Timmy ‘s, and was rewarded by his huge, heart-tugging smile. He looked very like his mother with the same round head on a delicate neck, the same beautifully shaped mouth. Only his eyes, widely spaced, were differently shaped, large blue spheres with, above them, straight bushy eyebrows which reminded Neil of pale and delicate caterpillars. The tenderness he felt for the child was equal to, if different from, the tenderness he felt for his mother. He could not now imagine life on the headland without either of them. But the tap defeated him. Despite his tuggings with the wrench he couldn't get the screw to shift. Even this minor domestic task was apparently beyond his powers. He could hear Amy's derisive voice. ‘You want to change the world and you can't change a washer.’ After a couple of minutes he gave up the attempt, left the tool box by the cottage wall and walked to the edge of the cliff then slithered down to the beach. Crunching over the ridges of stones, he went down to the edge of the sea and almost violently wrenched off his shoes. It was thus, when the weight of anxiety about his failed ambitions, his uncertain future, became too heavy that he would find his peace, standing motionless to watch the veined curve of the poised wave, the tumult of crashing foam breaking over his feet, the wide intersecting arches washing over the smooth sand as the wave retreated to leave its tenuous lip of foam. But today even this wonder, continually repeated, failed to comfort his spirit. He gazed out to the horizon with unseeing eyes and thought about his present life, the hopelessness of the future, about Amy, about his family. Thrusting his hands in his pocket, he felt the crumpled envelope of his mother's last letter. He knew that his parents were disappointed in him, although they never said so openly since oblique hints were just as effective: ‘Mrs Reilly keeps on asking me, what is Neil doing? I don't like to say that you're living in a caravan with no proper job.’ She certainly didn't like to say that he was living there with a girl. He had written to tell  them about Amy since his parents constantly threatened to visit and ‘unlikely as this was actually to happen, the prospect had added an intolerable anxiety to his already anxiety-ridden life. ‘I'm giving a temporary home to an unmarried mother in return for typing help. Don't worry, I shan't suddenly present you with a bastard grandchild.’ After the letter had been posted. he had felt ashamed. The cheap attempt at humour had been too like a treacherous repudiation of Timmy whom he loved. And his mother hadn't found it either funny or reassuring. His letter had produced an almost incoherent farrago of warnings, pained reproaches and veiled references to the possible reaction of Mrs Reilly if she ever got to know. Only his two brothers surreptitiously welcomed his way of life. They hadn't made university and the difference between their comfortable life style — houses on an executive estate, en suite bathrooms, artificial coal fires in what they called the lounge, working wives, a new car every two years and timeshares in Majorca — provided both with agreeable hours of self-satisfied comparisons which he knew would always end with the same conclusion, that he ought to pull himself together, that it wasn't right, not after all the sacrifices Mum and Dad had made to send him to college, and a fine waste of money that had proved. He had told Amy none of this but would have happily confided had she shown the least interest. But she asked no questions about his past life and told him nothing about hers. Her voice, her body, her smell were as familiar to him as his own, but essentially he knew no more about her now than when she had arrived. She refused to collect any welfare benefits, saying that she wasn't going to have DHSS snoopers visiting the caravan to see if she and Neil were sleeping together. He sympathized. He didn't want them either, but he felt that for Timmy's sake she should take what was on offer. He had given her no money but he did feed both of them, and this was difficult enough on his grant. No one visited her and no one telephoned. Occasionally she would receive a postcard, coloured views usually of London with nondescript, meaningless messages, but as far as he knew she never replied. They had so little in common. She helped spasmodically with PANUP but he was never sure how far she was actually committed. And he knew that she found his pacifism stupid. He could recall a conversation only this morning. ‘Look, if I live next door to an enemy and he has a knife, a gun and a machine gun and I've got the same, I'm not going to chuck mine before he chucks his. I'll say, OK, let the knife go, then the gun maybe, then the machine gun. Him and me at the same time. Why should I throw mine away and leave him with his?’ ‘But one of you has to make a start, Amy. There has to be a beginning of trust. Whether it's people or nations, we have to find the faith to open our hearts and hands and say, ‘Look, I've nothing. I've only my humanity. We inhabit the same planet. The world is full of pain but we needn't add to it. There has to be an end of fear. ''’ She had said obstinately: ‘I don't see why he should chuck his weapons once he knows I've got nothing.’ ‘Why should he keep them? He's got nothing to fear from you any more.’ ‘He'd keep them because he liked the feeling of having them and because he might like to use them some day. He'd like the power and he'd like knowing he had me where he wanted me. Honestly, Neil, you're so naïve sometimes. That's how people are.’ ‘But we can't argue like that any more, Amy. We aren't talking about knives and guns and machine guns. We're talking about weapons neither of us could use without destroying ourselves and probably our whole planet. But it's good of you to help with PANUP when you don't sympathize.’ She had said: ‘PANUP's different. And I sympathize all right. I just think that you're wasting your time writing letters, making speeches, sending out all those pamphlets. It won't do any good. You've got to fight people their way.’ ‘But it's done good already. All over the world ordinary people are marching, demonstrating, making their voices heard, letting the people in power know that what they want is a peaceful world for themselves and their children. Ordinary people like you.’ And then she had almost shouted at him: ‘I'm not ordinary! Don't you call me ordinary! If there are ordinary people, I'm not one of them.’ ‘I'm sorry, Amy. I didn't mean it like that.’ ‘Then don't say it.’ The only cause they had in common was a refusal to eat meat. Soon after she arrived at the caravan he had said: ‘I'm vegetarian but I don't expect you to be, or Timmy.’ He had wondered as he spoke  whether Timmy was old enough to eat meat. He had added: ‘You can buy a chop occasionally in Norwich if you feel like it.’ ‘What you have is all right by me. Animals don't eat me, and I don't eat them.’ ‘And Timmy?’ ‘Timmy has what I give him. He's not fussy.’ Nor was he. Neil couldn't imagine a more accommodating child nor, for most of the time, a more contented one. He had found the second-hand playpen advertised on a newsagent's board in Norwich and had brought it back on the top of the van. In it Timmy would crawl for hours or pull himself up and stand precariously balancing, his napkin invariably falling about his knees. When thwarted he would rage, shutting his eyes tight, opening his mouth and holding his breath before letting out a bellow of such terrifying power that Neil half expected the whole of Lydsett to come running to see which of them was tormenting the child. Amy never smacked him but would jerk him on to her hip and dump him on her bed saying: ‘Bloody awful noise.’ ‘Shouldn't you stay with him? Holding his breath like that, he could kill himself.’ ‘You daft? He won't kill himself. They never do.’ And he knew now that he wanted her, wanted her when it was obvious that she didn't want him and would never again risk rejection. On the second night at the caravan she had slid back the partition between his bed and hers and had walked quietly up to his bed and had stood gravely looking down at him. She had been completely naked. He had said: ‘Look, Amy, you don't have to pay me. ‘I never pay for anything, at least not like that. But have it your own way.’ After a pause she had said: ‘You gay or something?’ ‘No, it's just that I don't like casual affairs.’ ‘You mean you don't like them, or you don't think you ought to have them?’ ‘I suppose I mean that I don't think I ought to have them.’ ‘You religious, then?’ ‘No, I'm not religious, not in the ordinary way. It's just that I think sex is too important to be casual about. You see, if we slept together and I — if I disappointed you — we might quarrel and then you'd walk out. You'd feel that you had to. You'd leave, you and Timmy.’ ‘So what, I walk out.’ ‘I wouldn't want you to do that, not because of anything I'd done.’ ‘Or hadn't done. OK, I expect you're right.’ Another pause, and then she had added: ‘You'd mind then, if I walked out?’ ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘I'd mind.’ She had turned away. ‘I always do walk out in the end. No one has ever minded before.’ It was the only sexual advance she had ever made to him and he knew it would be the last. Now they slept with Timmy's cot wedged between the partition and his bed. Sometimes in the night, wakeful because the child had stirred, he would put out his hands and clasp the bars and long to shake this frail barrier that symbolized the unbridgeable gulf between them. She lay there, sleek and curved as a fish or a gull, so close that he could hear the rise and fall of her breath faintly echoing the suspiration of the sea. His body ached for her and he would press his face into the lumpy pillow groaning with the hopelessness of his need. What could she possibly see in him to make her want him, except, as on that one night, out of gratitude, pity, curiosity or boredom? He hated his body, the scrawny legs on which the kneecaps protruded like deformities, the small blinking eyes too closely set, the sparse beard which couldn't disguise the weakness of the mouth and chin. Sometimes, too, he was tormented by jealousy. Without proof, he had convinced himself that there was someone else. She would say that she wanted to walk alone on the headland. And he would watch her go with the certainty that she was meeting a lover. And when she returned he would imagine that he could see the glow of the skin, the satisfied smile of remembered happiness, could almost smell that she had been making love. He had already heard from the university that his research grant would not be extended. The decision wasn't surprising; he had been warned to expect it. He had been saving as much as possible from the grant in the hope of amassing a small sum which would tide him over until he could find a local job. It hardly mattered what. Anything that would pay enough to live and allow him to remain on the headland to carry on the campaign. In theory he supposed he could organize PANUP from anywhere in the UK, but he knew that it was irrevocably bound to Larksoken headland, to the caravan, to that concrete mass five miles to the north which had power, apparently, to dominate his will as it did his imagination. He had already put out feelers with local employers but they hadn't been too keen on employing a well-known agitator; even those who seemed sympathetic to the anti-nuclear  cause didn't actually have work on offer. Perhaps they feared that too many of his energies would be diverted to the campaign. And his small capital was draining away with the extra expense of Amy, Timmy and even the cats. And now there was the threat of this libel action, less of a threat than a certainty. When, ten minutes later, he returned to the caravan Amy, too, had given up working. She was lying on her bed, looking up at the ceiling, Smudge and Whisky curled on her stomach. Looking down at her, he said abruptly: ‘If the Robarts legal action goes ahead I'll need money. We're not going to be able to go on as we are. We've got to make plans.’ She sat up smartly and stared at him. The kittens, affronted, squealed their protest and fled. ‘You mean we might have to leave here?’ The ‘we’ would normally have lifted his heart, now he hardly noticed it. ‘It's possible.’ ‘But why? I mean, you aren't going to find anything cheaper than the caravan. Try getting a single room for two pounds a week. We're bloody lucky to have this place.’ ‘But there's no work here, Amy. If I have huge damages to pay, I'll have to get a job. That means London.’ ‘What sort of a job?‘ ‘Any sort. I've got my degree.’ ‘Well, I can't see the sense of leaving here, even if there isn't any work. You can go to the DHSS. Draw the dole.’ ‘That isn't going to pay damages.’ ‘Well, if you have to go, maybe I'll stay on. I can pay the rent here. After all, what's the difference to the owner? He'll get his two quid whoever pays it.’ ‘You couldn't live here alone.’ ‘Why not? I've lived in worse places.’ ‘On what? What would you do for money?’ ‘Well, with you gone I could go to the DHSS, couldn't I? They could send their snoopers round and it wouldn't matter. They wouldn't be able to say I was having sex with you then, not if you weren't here. Anyway, I've got a bit in my post office account.’ The casual cruelty of the suggestion struck at his heart. He heard with heavy disgust the note of self-pity which he was unable to suppress. He said: ‘Is that what you really want, Amy, for me not to be here?’ ‘Don't be daft, I was only teasing. Honestly Neil, you should see yourself. Talk about misery. Anyway, it might not happen — the libel action, I mean.’ ‘It's bound to happen unless she withdraws it. They've set a date for the hearing.’ ‘She might withdraw it, or else she might die. She might drown on one of those night swims she takes after the headlines on the nine o'clock news, regular as clockwork, right up to December.’ ‘Who told you that? How do you know that she swims at night?’ ‘You did.’ ‘I can't remember telling you.’ ‘Then someone else did, one of the regulars in the Local Hero, maybe. I mean, it's no secret, is it?’ He said: ‘She won't drown. She's a strong swimmer. She wouldn't take foolish risks. And I can't wish her dead. You can't preach love and practise hatred.’ ‘I can — wish her dead, I mean. Maybe the Whistler will get her. Or you might win the action and then she'll have to pay you. That'd be a laugh.’ ‘That's not very likely. I consulted a lawyer at the Citizens Advice Bureau when I was in Norwich last Friday. I could see he thought it was serious, that she did have a case. He said I ought to get myself a lawyer.’ ‘Well, get one.‘ ‘How? Lawyers cost money.’ ‘Get legal aid. Put a note in the newsletter asking for contributions.’ ‘I can't do that. It's difficult enough keeping the newsletter going, what with the cost of paper and postage.’ Amy said, suddenly serious: ‘I'll think of something. There's still four weeks to go. Anything can happen in four weeks. Stop worrying. It's going to be all right. Look, Neil, I promise you that libel action will never come to court.’ And illogically, he was, for the moment, reassured and comforted. It was six o'clock and at Larksoken Power Station, the weekly interdepartmental meeting was drawing to a close. It had lasted thirty minutes longer than usual; Dr Alex Mair took the view, which he could normally enforce by brisk chairmanship, that little original thought was contributed to a discussion after three hours of talking. But it had been a heavy agenda: the revised safety plan still in draft; the rationalization of the internal structure from the present seven departments to three under engineering, production and resources; the report of the district survey laboratory on their monitoring of the environment; the preliminary agenda for the local liaison committee. This annual jamboree was an unwieldy but useful public relations exercise which needed careful preparation, including as it did representatives from the interested government departments, local authorities, police, fire and water authorities, the National Farmers Union and the Country Landowners' Association. Mair sometimes grudged the work and time it involved but he knew its importance. The weekly meeting was held in his office at the conference table set in front of the south window. Darkness was falling and the huge pane of glass was a black rectangle in which he could see their faces reflected, like the gaunt, disembodied heads of night travellers in a lighted railway carriage. He suspected that some of his departmental heads, particularly BH Morgan, the Works Office Engineer, and Stephen Mansell, the Maintenance Superintendent, would have preferred a more relaxed setting in his private sitting room next door, the low, comfortable chairs, a few hours of chat with no set agenda, perhaps a drink together afterwards in a local pub. Well, that was one management style, but it wasn't his. Now he closed the stiff cover of his folder in which his PA had meticulously tagged all the papers and cross-references, and said dismissively: ‘Any other business.‘ But he was not allowed to get away so easily. On his right, as usual, sat Miles Lessingham, the Operations Superintendent, whose reflection, staring back into the room, looked like a hydrocephalic death's head. Glancing from the image to the face, Mair could see  little difference. The stark overhead lights threw deep shadows under the deep-set eyes and the sweat glistened on the wide, rather knobbly forehead with its swathe of fair undisciplined hair. Now he stretched back in his chair and said: ‘This proposed job — rumoured job, I should say — I suppose we're entitled to ask whether it has been formally offered to you yet? Or aren't we?’ Mair said calmly: The answer is that it hasn't; the publicity was premature. The press got hold of it somehow, as they usually do, but there's nothing official yet. One unfortunate result of our present habit of leaking any information of interest is that the people most concerned become the last to know. If and when it is official you seven will be the first to be told.’ Lessingham said: ‘It will have serious implications here, Alex, if you do go. The contract already signed for the new PWR reactor, the internal reorganization which is bound to create disruption, electricity privatization. It's a bad time for a change at the top.’ Maid said: ‘Is there ever a good time? But until it happens, if it does happen, there's little point in discussing it.’ John Standing, the station chemist, said: ‘But the internal reorganization will go ahead presumably?’ ‘I hope so, considering the time and energy we've spent planning it. I should be surprised if a change at the top alters a necessary reorganization which is already under way.’ Lessingham asked: ‘Who will they appoint, a director or a station manager?’ The question was less innocent than it sounded. ‘I imagine a station manager.’ ‘You mean that the research will go?’ Mair said: ‘When I go, now or later, the research will go. You've always known that. I brought it with me and I wouldn't have taken the job if I couldn't have continued it here. I asked for certain research facilities and I got them. But research at Larksoken has always been somewhat of an anomaly. We've done good work, are still doing good work, but logically it should be done elsewhere, at Harwell or Winfrith. Is there any other business?’ But Lessingham was not to be discouraged. He said: ‘Who will you be responsible to? The Secretary of State for Energy directly or the AEA?’ Mair knew the answer but had no intention of giving it. He said quietly: ‘That is still under discussion.’ ‘Along, no doubt, with such minor matters as pay, rations, scope  of your responsibilities and what you are going to be called. Controller of Nuclear Power has a certain cachet. I like it. But what precisely will you control?’ There was a silence. Mair said: ‘If the answer to that question were known, no doubt the appointment would have been made by now. I don't want to stifle discussion, but hadn't we better confine it to matters within the competence of this committee? Right, is there any other business?’ and this time there was no reply. Hilary Robarts, the Acting Administrative Officer, had already closed her file. She hadn't taken part in the questioning but the others, Mair knew, would assume that that was because he had already told her the answers. Even before they had left, his PA, Caroline Amphlett, had come in to take away the tea cups and clear the table. Lessingham made it a habit to leave his agenda behind, a small personal protest against the amount of paper which the formal weekly meeting generated. Dr Martin Goss, head of the medical physics department, had, as always, doodled obsessively. His jotting pad was covered with hot-air balloons, intricately patterned and decorated; part of his mind had obviously been with his private passion. Caroline Amphlett moved, as always, with a quiet, efficient grace. Neither spoke. She had worked for Mair as his PA for the last three years and he knew her now no better than on that morning when she had sat in this same office being interviewed for the job. She was a tall, blonde girl, smooth-skinned with wide-spaced, rather small eyes of an extraordinary deep blue, who would have been thought beautiful if she had shown more animation. Mair suspected that she used her confidential job as his PA to preserve a deliberately intimidating reserve. She was the most efficient secretary he had ever had and it irked him that she had made it clear that, if and when he moved, she would wish to stay at Larksoken. She had told him that her reasons were personal. That, of course, meant Jonathan Reeves, a junior engineer in the workshop. He had been as surprised and chagrined at her choice as he had at the prospect of taking up a new job with an unknown PA, but there had been an additional and more disturbing reaction. Hers was not a type of female beauty which attracted him and he had always assumed that she was physically cold. It was disconcerting to think that an acned nonenity had discovered and perhaps explored depths which he, in their daily intimacy, hadn't even suspected. He had sometimes wondered, although with little  real curiosity, whether she might not be less compliant, more complicated than he had supposed, had occasionally had a disconcerting sense that the façade she presented to the power station of dedicated, humourless efficiency had been carefully constructed to conceal a less accommodating, more complex personality. But if the real Caroline was accessible to Jonathan Reeves, if she really liked and wanted that unprepossessing wimp, then she hardly merited the tribute even of his curiosity. He gave his departmental heads time to get back to their offices before he rang for Hilary Robarts and asked her to come back. It would have been more usual to have asked her with careful casualness to wait behind after the meeting but what he had to say was private and he had been trying for some weeks now to cut down the number of times when they were known to be alone together. He wasn't looking forward to the interview. She would see what he had to say as personal criticism and that was something which in his experience few women could take. He thought: She was my mistress once. I was in love with her, as much in love as I thought I was capable of being. And if it wasn't love, whatever that word means, at least I wanted her. Will that make what I have to say easier or more difficult? He told himself that all men were cowards when it came to a showdown with a woman. That first post-natal subservience, bred of physical dependence, was too ingrained ever to be totally eradicated. He wasn't more cowardly than the rest of his sex. What was it he had overheard that woman in the Lydsett stores saying? ‘George would do anything to avoid a scene.’ Of course he would, poor sod. Women with their womb-smelling warmth, their talcum powder and milky breasts had seen to that in the first four weeks of life. He stood up when she came in and waited until she had taken the chair on the other side of the desk. Then he opened the right-hand drawer and took out a duplicated news-sheet which he slid across the desk towards her. ‘Have you seen this? It's Neil Pascoe's latest news-sheet from PANUP.’ She said: ‘People Against Nuclear Power. That means Pascoe and a few dozen other ill-informed hysterics. Of course I've seen it, I'm on his mailing list. He takes good care that I see it.’ She gave it a brief glance, then pushed it back across the desk. He took it up and read: ‘Many readers will probably have learned by now that I am being sued by Miss Hilary Robarts, the Acting Administrative Officer at Larksoken Power Station, for alleged libel arising from what I wrote in the May issue of the news-sheet. I shall, of course, strenuously defend the action and, as I have no money to pay for a lawyer, will present my own defence. This is just the latest example of the threat to free information and even free speech presented by the nuclear energy lobby. Apparently now even the mildest criticism is to be followed by the threat of legal action. But there is a positive side. This action by Hilary Robarts shows that we, the ordinary people of this county, are making our impact. Would they bother with our small news-sheet if they weren't running scared? And the libel action, if it comes to trial, will give us valuable national publicity if properly handled. We are stronger than we know. Meanwhile I give below the dates of the next open days at Larksoken so that as many of us as possible can attend and strenuously put our case against nuclear power during the question time which normally precedes the actual tour of the station.’ She said: ‘I told you, I've seen it. I don't know why you wasted your time reading it out. He seems determined to aggravate his offence. If he had any sense he'd get himself a good lawyer and keep his mouth shut.’ ‘He can't afford a lawyer. And he won't be able to pay damages.’ He paused, and then said quietly: ‘In the interests of the station I think you should drop it.’ ‘Is that an order?’ ‘I've no power to compel you and you know that. I'm asking you. You'll get nothing out of him, the man's practically penniless, and he isn't worth the trouble.’ ‘He is to me. What he describes as mild criticism was a serious libel and it was widely disseminated. There's no defence. Remember the actual words? ‘A woman whose response to Chernobyl is that only thirty-one people were killed, who can dismiss as unimportant one of the world's greatest nuclear disasters which put thousands in hospital, exposed a hundred thousand or more to dangerous radioactivity, devastated vast areas of land, and may result in deaths from cancer amounting to fifty thousand over the next fifty years, is totally unsuitable to be trusted to work in an atomic power station. While she remains there, in any capacity, we must have the gravest doubts whether safety will ever be taken seriously at Larksoken.'’ That's a clear allegation of professional incompetence. If he's allowed to get away with that, we'll never get rid of him.’ ‘I wasn't aware that we were in the business of getting rid of inconvenient critics. What method had you in mind?’ He paused, detecting in his voice the first trace of that reedy mixture of sarcasm and pomposity which he knew occasionally affected him and to which he was morbidly sensitive. He went on: ‘He's a free citizen living where he chooses. He's entitled to his views. Hilary, he's not a worthy opponent. Bring him to court and he'll attract publicity for his cause and do your own no good at all. We're trying to win over the locals, not antagonize them. Let it go before someone starts a fund to pay for his defence. One martyr on Larksoken headland is enough.’ While he was speaking she got up and began pacing to and fro across the wide office. Then she paused and turned to him. ‘This is what it's all about, isn't it? The reputation of the station, your reputation. What about my reputation? If I drop the action now it will be a clear admission that he was right, that I'm not fit to work here.’ ‘What he wrote hasn't hurt your reputation with anyone who matters. And suing him isn't going to help it. It's unwise to let policy be influenced, let alone jeopardized, by outraged personal pride. The reasonable course is quietly to drop the action. What do feelings matter?’ He found that he couldn't remain seated while she was striding to and fro across the office. He got to his feet and walked over to the window hearing the angry voice but no longer having to face her, watching the reflection of her pacing figure, the swirling hair. He said again: ‘What do feelings matter? It's the work that is important.’ ‘They matter to me. And that's something you've never understood, have you? Life is about feeling. Loving is about feeling. It was the same with the abortion. You forced me to have it. Did you ever ask yourself what I felt then, what I needed?’ Oh God, he thought, not this, not again, not now. He said, still with his back to her: ‘It's ridiculous to say that I forced you. How could I? And I thought you felt as I did, that it was impossible for you to have a child.’ ‘Oh no, it wasn't. If you're so bloody keen on accuracy, let's be accurate about this. It would have been inconvenient, embarrassing, awkward, expensive. But it wasn't impossible. It still isn't impossible. And, for God's sake, turn around. Look at me. I'm talking to you. What I'm saying is important.’ He turned and walked back to the desk. He said calmly: ‘All right, my phrasing was inaccurate. Have a child by all means if that's what you want. I'll be happy for you as long as you don't expect me to father it. But what we're talking about now is Neil Pascoe and  PANUP. We've gone to a lot of trouble here to promote good relations with the local community and I'm not going to have all that good work vitiated by a totally unnecessary legal action, particularly not now when work will soon begin on the new reactor.‘ Then try to prevent it. And since we're talking about public relations, I'm surprised you haven't mentioned Ryan Blaney and Scudder's Cottage. My cottage, in case you've forgotten. What am I expected to do about that? Hand over my property to him and his kids rent-free in the interests of good public relations?’ ‘That's a different matter. It's not my concern as Director. But if you want my opinion, I think you're ill-advised to try and force him out simply because you've got a legal case. He's paying the rent regularly, isn't he? And it isn't as if you want the cottage.’ ‘I do want the cottage. It's mine. I bought it and now I want to sell it.’ She slumped back into the chair and he, too, sat. He made himself stare into the eyes in which, to his discomfort, he saw more pain than anger. He said: ‘Presumably he knows that and he'll get out when he can, but it won't be easy. He's recently widowed and he's got four children. There's a certain amount of local feeling about it, I understand.’ ‘I've no doubt there is, particularly in the Local Hero where Ryan Blaney spends most of his time and money. I'm not prepared to wait. If we're moving to London in the next three months there's not much time to get the question of the cottage settled. I don't want to leave that kind of unfinished business. I want to get it on the market as soon as possible.’ He knew that this was the moment when he should have said firmly: ‘I may be moving to London, but not with you.’ But he found it impossible. He told himself that it was late, the end of a busy day, the worst possible time for rational argument. She was already overwrought. One thing at a time. He had tackled her about Pascoe and, although she had reacted much as he'd expected, perhaps she would think it over and do what he advised. And she was right about Ryan Blaney; it was none of his business. The interview had left him with two clear intentions more firmly fixed than ever in his mind. She wasn't coming to London with him and nor would he recommend her as Administrative Officer at Larksoken. For all her efficiency, her intelligence, her appropriate education, she wasn't the right person for the job. For a moment it crossed his mind that  here was his bargaining card. ‘I'm not offering you marriage but I am offering you the most senior job you could possibly aspire to.’ But he knew there was no real temptation. He wouldn't leave the administration of Larksoken in her hands. Sooner or later she was going to have to realize that there would be no marriage and no promotion. But now was the wrong moment and he found himself wondering wryly when the right moment might be. Instead he said: ‘Look, we're here to run a power station efficiently and safely. We're doing a necessary and important job. Of course we're committed to it, we wouldn't be here otherwise. But we're scientists and technicians, not evangelists. We're not running a religious campaign.’ ‘They are, the other side. He is. You see him as an insignificant twit. He isn't. He's dishonest and he's dangerous. Look how he scrubs around in the records to turn up individual cases of leukaemia which he thinks he can ascribe to nuclear energy. And now he's got the latest Comare report to fuel his spurious concern. And what about last month's newsletter, that emotive nonsense about the midnight trains of death trundling silently through the northern suburbs of London? Anyone would think they were carrying open trucks of radioactive waste. Doesn't he care that nuclear energy has so far saved the world from burning five hundred million tons of coal? Hasn't he heard about the greenhouse effect? I mean, is the fool totally ignorant? Hasn't he any conception of the devastation caused to this planet by burning fossil fuels? Has no one told him about acid rain or the carcinogens in coal waste? And when it comes to danger, what about the fifty-seven miners buried alive in the Borken disaster only this year? Don't their lives matter? Think of the outcry if that had been a nuclear accident.’ He said: ‘He's only one voice and a pathetically uneducated and ignorant one.’ ‘But he's having his effect and you know it. We've got to match passion with passion.’ His mind fastened on the word. We're not, he thought, talking about nuclear energy, we're talking about Passion. Would we be having this conversation if we were still lovers? She's demanding from me a commitment to something more personal than atomic Power. Turning to face her, he was visited suddenly, not by desire, but by a memory, inconveniently intense, of the desire he had once felt for her. And with memory came a sudden vivid picture of them  together in her cottage, the heavy breasts bent over him, her hair falling across his face, her lips, her hands, her thighs. He said roughly: ‘If you want a religion, if you need a religion, then find one. There are plenty to choose from. All right the abbey is in ruins and I doubt whether that impotent old priest up at the Old Rectory has much on offer. But find something or someone; give up fish on Friday, don't eat meat, count beads, put ashes on your head, meditate four times a day, bow down towards your own personal Mecca. But don't, for God's sake, assuming He exists, ever make science into a religion.’ The telephone on his desk rang. Caroline Amphlett had left and it was switched through to an outside line. As he lifted the receiver he saw that Hilary was standing at the door. She gave him a last long look and went out, shutting it with unnecessary firmness behind her. The caller was his sister. She said: ‘I hoped I'd catch you. I forgot to remind you to call at Bollard's farm for the ducks for Thursday. He'll have them ready. We'll be six, incidentally. I've invited Adam Dalgliesh. He's back on the headland.’ He was able to answer her as calmly as she had spoken. ‘Congratulations. He and his aunt have contrived with some skill to avoid their neighbours’ cutlets for the last five years. How did you manage it?’ ‘By the expedient of asking. I imagine he may be thinking of keeping on the mill as a holiday home and feels it's time to acknowledge that he does have neighbours. Or he may be planning to sell, in which case he can risk a dinner party without being trapped into intimacy. But why not give him credit for a simple human weakness; the attraction of eating a good dinner which he hasn't had to cook?’ And it would balance her table, thought Mair, although that was hardly likely to have been a consideration. She despised the Noah's Ark convention which decreed that a superfluous man, however unattractive or stupid, was acceptable; a superfluous woman, however witty and well-informed, a social embarrassment. He said: ‘Am I expected to talk about his poetry?’ ‘I imagine he's come to Larksoken to get away from people who want to talk about his poetry. But it wouldn't hurt you to take a look at it. I've got the most recent volume. And it is poetry, not prose rearranged on the page.’ ‘With modern verse, can one tell the difference?’ ‘Oh yes,’ she said. ‘If it can be read as prose, then it is prose. It's an infallible test.’ ‘But not one, I imagine, that the English faculties would support. I'll be leaving in ten minutes. I won't forget the ducks.’ He smiled as he replaced the receiver. His sister invariably had the power to restore him to good humour. Before leaving he stood for a moment at the door and let his eyes range round the room as if he were seeing it for the first time. He was ambitious for the new job, had cleverly planned and schemed to get it. And now, when it was almost his, he realized how much he would miss Larksoken, its remoteness, its bleak uncompromising strength. Nothing had been done to prettify the site as at Sizewell, on the Suffolk coast, or to produce the pleasantly laid-out grounds of smooth lawn, flowering trees and shrubs which so agreeably impressed him on his periodic visits to Winfrith in Dorset. A low, curving wall faced with flint had been built on the seaward boundary behind whose shelter every spring a bright ribbon of daffodils strained and tossed in the March winds. Little else had been done to harmonize or soften the concrete's grey immensity. But this was what he liked, the wide expanse of turbulent sea, browny-grey, white-laced under a limitless sky, windows which he could open so that, at a touch of his hand, the faint continuous boom like distant thunder would instantaneously pour into his office in a roar of crashing billows. He liked best the stormy winter evenings when, working late, he could see the lights of shipping prinking the horizon as they made their way down the coast to the Yarmouth lanes, and see the flashing lightships and the beam from Happisburgh Lighthouse, which for generations had warned mariners of the treacherous offshore sands. Even on the darkest night, by the light which the sea seemed mysteriously to absorb and reflect, he could make out the splendid fifteenth-century west tower of Happisburgh Church, that embattled symbol of man's precarious defences against this most dangerous of seas. And it was a symbol of more than that. The tower must have been the last sight of land for hundreds of drowning mariners in peace and war. His mind, always tenacious of facts, could recall the details at will. The crew of HMS Peggy , driven ashore on 19 December 1770, the 119 members of HMS Invincible wrecked on the sands on 13 March 1801 when on her way to join Nelson's fleet at Copenhagen, the crew of HMS Hunter , the revenue cutter, lost in 1804, many of their crews buried under the grassy mounds in  Happisburgh Churchyard. Built in an age of faith, the tower had stood as a symbol, too, of that final unquenchable hope that even the sea would yield up her dead and that their God was God of the waters as he was of the land. But now mariners could see, dwarfing the tower, the huge rectangular bulk of Larksoken Power Station. For those who sought symbols in inanimate objects its message was both simple and expedient, that man, by his own intelligence and his own efforts, could understand and master his world, could make his transitory life more agreeable, more comfortable, more free of pain. For him this was challenging enough, and if he had needed a faith to live by it would have been starkly sufficient. But sometimes, on the darkest nights, when the waves pounded the shingle like bursts of distant gunfire, both the science and the symbol would seem to him as transitory as those drowned lives and he would find himself wondering if this great hulk would one day yield to the sea, like the wave-smashed concrete from the last war defences, and like them become a broken symbol of man's long history on this desolate coast. Or would it resist even time and the North Sea and still be standing when the final darkness fell over the planet? In his more pessimistic moments some rogue part of his mind knew this darkness to be inevitable, although he did not expect it to come in his time, maybe not even in his son's. He would sometimes smile wryly, telling himself that he and Neil Pascoe, on different sides, would understand each other well. The only difference was that one of them had hope. Jane Dalgliesh had bought Larksoken Mill five years earlier when she had moved from her previous home on the Suffolk coast. The mill, which was built in 1525, was a picturesque brick tower, four storeys high with an octagonal dome cap and skeleton fantail. It had been converted some years before Miss Dalgliesh had bought it by the addition of a flint-faced, two-storey building with a large sitting room, smaller study and a kitchen on the ground floor and three bedrooms, two of them with their own bathrooms, on the floor above. Dalgliesh had never asked her why she had moved to Norfolk but he guessed that the mill's main attraction had been its remoteness, its closeness to notable bird sanctuaries and the impressive view of headland, sky and sea from the top storey. Perhaps she had intended to restore it to working order but with increasing age hadn't been able to summon the energy or enthusiasm to cope with the disturbance. He had inherited it as an agreeable but mildly onerous responsibility, together with her considerable fortune. The origin of that had only become plain after her death. It had originally been left to her by a noted amateur ornithologist and eccentric with whom she had been friendly for many years. Whether the relationship had gone beyond friendship Dalgliesh would now never know. She had, apparently, spent little of the money on herself, had been a dependable benefactress of the few eccentric charities of which she approved, had remembered them in her will, but without egregious generosity, and had left the residue of her estate to him without explanation, admonition or peculiar protestations of affection, although he had no doubt that the words ‘my dearly beloved nephew’ meant exactly what they said. He had liked her, respected her, had always been at ease in her company, but he had never thought that he really knew her, and now he never would. He was a little surprised how much he minded. The only change she had made to the property was to build a garage, and after he had unloaded and put away the Jaguar he decided to climb to the top chamber of the mill while it was still light. The bottom room, with Its two huge grinding-wheels of burr-granite  propped against the wall and its lingering smell of flour, still held an air of mystery, of time held in abeyance, of a place bereft of its purpose and meaning, so that he never entered it without a slight sense of desolation. There were only ladders between the floors and, as he grasped the rungs, he saw again his aunt's long trousered legs ahead of him disappearing into the chamber above. She had used only the top room of the mill which she had furnished simply with a small writing table and chair facing the North Sea, a telephone and her binoculars. Entering it he could imagine her sitting there in the summer days and evenings, working on the papers which she occasionally contributed to ornithological journals and looking up from time to time to gaze out over the headland to the sea and the far horizon, could see again that carved, weather-browned Aztec face with its hooded eyes under the grey-black hair, drawn back into a bun, could hear again a voice which, for him, had been one of the most beautiful female voices he had ever heard. Now it was late afternoon and the headland lay enriched by the mellow afternoon light, the sea a wide expanse of wrinkled blue with a painter's stroke of purple laid on the horizon. The colours and shapes were intensified by the sun's last strong rays so that the ruins of the abbey looked unreal, a golden fantasy against the blue of the sea, and the dry grass gleamed as richly as a lush water meadow. There was a window at each of the compass points, and, binoculars in hand, he made his slow perambulation. To the west his eyes could travel along the narrow road between the reed beds and the dykes to the flint-walled and Dutch-gabled cottages and the pantiled roofs of Lydsett village and the round tower of St Andrew's Church. To the north the view was dominated by the huge bulk of the power station, the low-roofed administration block with, behind it, the reactor building and the great steel, aluminium-clad building of the turbine house. Four hundred metres out to sea were the rigs and platforms of the intake structures through which the cooling sea water passed to the pump house and the circulating water pumps. He moved again to the eastern window and looked out over the cottages of the headland. Far to the south he could just glimpse the roof of Scudder's Cottage. Directly to his left the flint walls of Martyr's Cottage glistened like marbles in the afternoon sun and less than half a mile to the north, set back among the Californian pines which fringed that part of the coast, was the dull square cottage rented by Hilary Robarts, a neatly proportional suburban villa incongruously set  down on this bleak headland and facing inland as if resolutely ignoring the sea. Further inland, and only just visible from the southern window was the Old Rectory, set like a Victorian dolls' house in its large, overgrown garden which, at this distance, looked as neatly green and formal as a municipal park. The telephone rang. The strident peal was unwelcome. It was to get away from such intrusions that he had come to Larksoken. But the call was not unexpected. It was Terry Rickards saying that he would like to drop in for a chat with Mr Dalgliesh if it wouldn't be too much bother and would nine be convenient? Dalgliesh was unable to think of a single excuse why it shouldn't be. Ten minutes later he left the tower, locking the door after him. This precaution was a small act of piety. His aunt had always kept the door locked, fearing that children might venture into the mill and hurt themselves by tumbling down the ladders. Leaving the tower to its darkness and its solitude, he went into Mill Cottage to unpack and get his supper. The huge sitting room with its York stone floor, rugs and open fireplace was a comfortable and nostalgic mixture of the old and the new. Most of the furniture was familiar to him from boyhood visits to his grandparents, inherited by his aunt as the last of her generation. Only the music centre and the television set were comparatively new. Music had been important to her and the shelves held a catholic collection of records with which he could refresh or console himself during the two weeks' holiday. And next door, the kitchen contained nothing superfluous but everything necessary to a woman who enjoyed food but preferred to cook it with a minimum of fuss. He put a couple of lamb chops under the grill, made a green salad and prepared to enjoy a few hours of solitude before the intrusion of Rickards and his preoccupations. It still surprised him a little that his aunt had finally bought a television set. Had she been seduced into conformity by the excellence of the natural history programmes and then, like other late converts he had known, sat captive to virtually every offering as if making up for lost time? That at least seemed unlikely. He switched on to see if the set was still working. A jerking pop star was wielding his guitar as the credits rolled, his parodic sexual gyrations so grotesque that it was difficult to see that even the besotted young could find them erotic. Switching off, Dalgliesh looked up at the oil portrait of his maternal great-grandfather, the Victorian bishop, robed but unmitred, his arms in their billowing lawn sleeves  confidently resting on the arms of the chair. He had an impulse to say, ‘This is the music of 1988; these are our heroes; that building on the headland is our architecture and I dare not stop my car to help children home because they've been taught with good reason that a strange man might abduct and rape them.’ He could have added, ‘And out there somewhere is a mass murderer who enjoys strangling women and stuffing their mouths with their hair.’ But that aberration, at least, was independent of changing fashions and his great-grandfather would have had his scrupulous but uncompromising answer to it. And with reason. After all, hadn't he been consecrated bishop in 1880, the year of Jack the Ripper? And probably he would have found the Whistler more understandable than the pop star whose gyrations would surely have convinced him that man was in the grip of his final, manic St Vitus's dance. Rickards came promptly on time. It was precisely nine when Dalgliesh heard his car and, opening the door on the darkness of the night, saw his tall figure striding towards him. Dalgliesh hadn't seen him for more than ten years when he had been a newly appointed inspector in the Metropolitan CID and was surprised to see how little he had changed; time, marriage, removal from London, promotion, had left no apparent mark on him. His rangy, graceless figure, over six feet high, still looked as incongruous in a formal suit as it always had. The rugged, weatherbeaten face, with its look of dependable fortitude, would have looked more appropriate above a seaman's guernsey, preferably with RNLI woven across the chest. In profile his face, with the long, slightly hooked nose and jutting eyebrows, was impressive. In full face the nose was revealed as a little too wide and flattened at the base and the dark eyes, which when he was animated took on a fierce, almost manic gleam, in repose were pools of puzzled endurance. Dalgliesh thought of him as a type of police officer less common than formerly but still not rare; the conscientious and incorruptible detective of limited imagination and somewhat greater intelligence who had never supposed that the evil of the world should be condoned because it was frequently inexplicable and its perpetrators unfortunate. He gazed round the sitting room at the long wall of books, the crackling wood fire, the oil of the Victorian prelate above the mantelshelf as if deliberately impressing each item on his mind, then sank into his chair and stretched out his long legs with a small grunt of satisfaction. Dalgliesh remembered that he had always drunk  beer; now he accepted whisky but said he could do with coffee first. One habit at least had changed. He said: ‘I'm sorry that you won't be meeting Susie, my wife, while you're here, Mr Dalgliesh. She's having our first baby in a couple of weeks and she's gone to stay with her mother in York. Ma-in-law didn't like the idea of her being in Norfolk with the Whistler on the prowl, not with me working the hours I do.’ It was said with a kind of embarrassed formality as if he, not Dalgliesh, were the host and he was apologizing for the unexpected absence of the hostess. He added: ‘I suppose it's natural for an only daughter to want to be with her mother at a time like this, particularly with a first baby.’ Dalgliesh's wife hadn't wanted to be with her mother, she had wanted to be with him, had wanted it with such intensity that he had wondered afterwards whether she might have felt a premonition. He could remember that, although he could no longer recall her face. His memory of her, which for years, a traitor to grief and to their love, he had resolutely tried to suppress because the pain had seemed unbearable, had gradually been replaced by a boyish, romantic dream of gentleness and beauty now fixed for ever beyond the depredation of time. His newborn son's face he could still recall vividly and sometimes did in his dreams, that white unsullied look of sweet knowledgeable contentment, as if , in a brief moment of life, he had seen and known all there was to know, seen it and rejected it. He told himself that he was the last man who could reasonably be expected to advise or reassure on the problems of pregnancy and he sensed that Rickards's unhappiness at his wife's absence went deeper than missing her company. He made the usual inquiries about her health and escaped into the kitchen to make the coffee. Whatever mysterious spirit had unlocked the verse, it had freed him for other human satisfactions, for love; or was it the other way around? Had love unlocked the verse? It seemed even to have affected his job. Grinding the coffee beans he pondered life's smaller ambiguities. When the poetry hadn't come, the job too had seemed not only irksome but occasionally repellent. Now he was happy enough to let Rickards impose on his solitude to use him as a sounding board. This new benignity and tolerance a little disconcerted him. Success in moderation was no doubt better for the character than failure but too much of it and he would lose his cutting edge. And five minutes later, carrying in the two mugs and settling  back in his chair, he could relish the contrast between Rickards's preoccupation with psychopathic violence and the peace of the mill. The wood fire, now past its crackling stage, had settled into a comfortable glow and the wind, seldom absent from the headland, moved like a benign, gently hissing spirit through the still and soaring clappers of the mill. He was glad that it wasn't his job to catch the Whistler. Of all murders serial killings were the most frustrating, the most difficult and the chanciest to solve, the investigation carried on under the strain of vociferous public demand that the terrifying unknown devil be caught and exorcized for ever. But this wasn't his case; he could discuss it with the detachment of a man who has a professional interest but no responsibility. And he could understand what Rickards needed; not advice — he knew his job —. but someone he could trust, someone who understood the language, someone who would afterwards be gone, who wouldn't remain as a perpetual reminder of his uncertainties, a fellow professional to whom he could comfortably think aloud. He had his team and he was too punctilious not to share his thinking with them. But he was a man who needed to articulate his theories and here he could put them forward, embroider, reject, explore without the uncomfortable suspicion that his detective sergeant, deferentially listening, his face carefully expressionless, would be thinking, For God's sake, what's the old man dreaming up now? Or, The old man's getting fanciful. Rickards said: ‘We're not using Holmes. The Met say the system is fully committed at present, and anyway we've got our own computer. Not that there's much data to feed in. The press and public know about Holmes, of course. I get that at every press conference. ‘Are you using the Home Office special computer, the one named after Sherlock Holmes?'’ ‘No,'’ I say, ‘‘but we're using our own.'’ Unspoken question: ‘Then why the hell haven't you caught him?'’ They think that you've only got to feed in your data and out pops an Identikit of sonny complete with prints, collar-size and taste in pop music.’ ‘Yes,’ said Dalgliesh, 'we're so sated now with scientific wonders that it's a bit disconcerting when we find that technology can do everything except what we want it to.’ ‘Four women so far and Valerie Mitchell won't be the last if we don't catch him soon. He started fifteen months ago. The first victim was found just after midnight in a shelter at the end of the Easthaven promenade, the local tart, incidentally, although he may not have  known or cared. It was eight months before he struck again. Struck lucky, I suppose he'd say. This time a thirty-year-old schoolteacher cycling home to Hunstanton who had a puncture on a lonely stretch of road. Then another gap, just six months, before he got a barmaid from Ipswich who'd been visiting her granny and was daft enough to wait alone for the late bus. When it arrived there was no one at the stop. A couple of local youths got off. They'd had a skinful so weren't in a particularly noticing mood but they saw and heard nothing, nothing except what they described as a kind of mournful whistling coming from deep in the wood.’ He took a gulp of his coffee, then went on: ‘We've got a personality assessment from the trick-cyclist. I don't know why we bother. I could have written it myself. He tells us to look for a loner, probably from a disturbed family background, may have a dominant mother, doesn't relate easily to people, particularly women, could be impotent, unmarried, separated or divorced, with a resentment and hatred of the opposite sex. Well, we hardly expect him to be a successful, happily married bank manager with four lovely kids just coming up to GCE or whatever they call it now. They're the devil, these serial murders. No motive — no motive that a sane man can understand anyway — and he could come from anywhere, Norwich, Ipswich, even London. It's dangerous to assume that he's necessarily working in his own territory. Looks like it, though. He obviously knows the locality well. And he seems to be sticking now to the same MO. He chooses a road intersection, drives the car or van into the side of one road, cuts across and waits at the other. Then he drags his victim into the bushes or the trees, kills and cuts back to the other road and the car and makes his getaway. With the last three murders it seems to have been pure chance that a suitable victim did, in fact, come along.’ Dalgliesh felt that it was time he contributed something to the speculation. He said: ‘If he doesn't select and stalk his victim, and obviously he didn't in the last three cases, he'd normally have to expect a long wait. That suggests he's routinely out after dark, a night worker, mole-catcher, woodman, gamekeeper, that kind of job. And he goes prepared; on the watch for a quick kill, in more ways than one.’ Rickards said: 'That's how I see it. Four victims so far and three fortuitous, but he's probably been on the prowl for three years or more. That could be part of the thrill. ‘Tonight I could make a strike, tonight I could be lucky. And, by God, he is getting lucky. Two victims in the last six weeks.’ ‘And what about his trademark, the whistle?’ That was heard by the three people who came quickly on the scene after the Easthaven murder. One just heard a whistle, one said it sounded like a hymn and the third, who was a church woman, claimed she could identify it precisely, ‘Now the Day is Over'’. We kept quiet about that. It could be useful when we get the usual clutch of nutters claiming they're the Whistler. But there seems no doubt that he does whistle.‘ Dalgliesh said: ‘‘Now the day is over /Night is drawing nigh/ Shadows of the evening/ Fall across the sky'’. It's a Sunday-school hymn, hardly the kind that gets requested on Songs of Praise , I should have thought.’ He remembered it from childhood, a lugubrious, undistinguished tune which, as a ten-year-old, he could pick out on the drawing-room piano. Did anyone sing that hymn now, he wondered? It had been a favourite choice of Miss Barnett on those long dark afternoons m- winter before the Sunday school was released, when the outside light was fading and the small Adam Dalgliesh was already dreading those last twenty yards of his walk home where the rectory drive curved and the bushes grew thickest. Night was different from bright day, smelt different, sounded different; ordinary things assumed different shapes; an alien and more sinister power ruled the night. Those twenty yards of crunching gravel where the lights of the house were momentarily screened were a weekly horror. Once through the gate to the drive he would walk fast, but not too fast since the power that ruled the night could smell out fear as dogs smell out terror. His mother, he knew, would never have expected him to walk those yards alone had she known that he suffered such atavistic panic, but she hadn't known and he would have died before telling her. And his father? His father would have expected him to be brave, would have told him that God was God of the darkness as He was of the light. There were after all a dozen appropriate texts he could have quoted. ‘Darkness and light are both alike to Thee.’ But they were not alike to a sensitive ten-year-old boy. It was on those lonely walks that he had first had intimations of an essentially adult truth, that it is those who most love us who cause us the most pain. He said: ‘So you're looking for a local man, a Loner, someone who has  a night job, the use of a car or van and a knowledge of Hymns Ancient and Modern . That should make it easier.’ Rickards said: ‘You'd think so, wouldn't you.’ He sat in silence for a minute then said: 'l think I'd like just a small whisky now, Mr Dalgliesh, if it's all the same to you.’ It was after midnight when he finally left. Dalgliesh walked out with him to the car. Looking out across the headland Rickards said: ‘He's out there somewhere, watching, waiting. There's hardly a waking moment when I don't think of him, imagine what he looks like, where he is, what he's thinking. Susie's ma is right. I haven't had much to give her recently. And when he's caught, that'll be the end. It's finished. You move on. He doesn't, but you do. And by the end you know everything, or think you do. Where, when, who, how? You might even know why if you're lucky. And yet, essentially, you know nothing. All that wickedness, and you don't have to explain it or understand it or do a bloody thing about it except put a stop to it. Involvement without responsibility. No responsibility for what he did or for what happens to him afterwards. That's for the judge and the jury. You're involved, and yet you're not involved. Is that what appeals to you about the job, Mr Dalgliesh?’ It was not a question Dalgliesh would have expected, even from a friend, and Rickards was not a friend. He said: ‘Can any of us answer that question?’ ‘You remember why I left the Met, Mr Dalgliesh.’ The two corruption cases? Yes, I remember why you left the Met.’ ‘And you stayed. You didn't like it any more than I did. You wouldn't have touched the pitch. But you stayed. You were detached about it all, weren't you? It interested you.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘It's always interesting when men you thought you knew behave out of character.’ And Rickards had fled from London. In search of what? Dalgliesh wondered. Some romantic dream of country peace, an England which had vanished, a gentler method of policing, total honesty? He wondered whether he had found it."
FIC FIC-C8T-002 -0.71 "Thursday 22 September to Friday 23 September It was ten past seven and the saloon bar of the Duke of Clarence pub was already smoke-filled, the noise level rising and the crowd at the bar three feet deep. Christine Baldwin, the Whistler's fifth victim, had exactly twenty minutes to live. She sat on the banquette against the wall, sipping her second medium sherry of the evening, deliberately making it last, knowing that Colin was impatient to order the next round. Catching Norman's eye, she raised her left wrist and nodded significantly at her watch. Already, it was ten minutes past their deadline and he knew it. Their agreement was that this was to be a pre-supper drink with Colin and Yvonne, the limit both of time and alcohol consumption clearly understood between her and Norman before they left home. The arrangement was typical of their nine-month-old marriage, sustained less by compatible interests than by a carefully negotiated series of concessions. Tonight it had been her turn to give way, but agreeing to spend an hour in the Clarence with Colin and Yvonne didn't extend to any pretence that she actually enjoyed their company. She had disliked Colin since their first meeting; the relationship, at a glance, had been fixed in the stereotyped antagonism between newly acquired fiancée and slightly disreputable old schoolmate and drinking partner. He had been best man at their wedding — a formidable pre-nuptial agreement had been necessary for that capitulation — and had carried out his duties with a mixture of incompetence, vulgarity and irreverence which, as she occasionally enjoyed telling Norman, had spoilt for her the memory of her big day. It was typical of him to choose this pub. God knew, it was vulgar enough. But at least she could be certain of one thing: it wasn't a place where there was a risk of meeting anyone from the power station, at least not anyone who mattered. She disliked everything about the Clarence, the rough scrape of the moquette against her legs, the synthetic velvet which covered the walls, the baskets of ivy spiked with artificial flowers above the bar, the gaudiness of the carpet. Twenty years ago, it had been a cosy Victorian hostelry, seldom visited except by its regulars, with an open fire in winter and horse brasses  polished to whiteness hung against the black beams. The lugubrious publican had seen it as his job to repel strangers and had employed to that end an impressive armoury of taciturnity, malevolent glances, warm beer and poor service. But the old pub had burnt down in the 1960s and been replaced by a more profitable and thrusting enterprise. Nothing of the old building remained and the long extension to the bar, dignified by the name Banqueting Hall, provided for the undiscriminating a venue for weddings and local functions and on other nights served a predictable menu of prawns or soup, steak or chicken, and fruit salad with ice-cream. Well, at least she had put her foot down over dinner. They had worked out their monthly budget to the last pound, and if Norman thought she was going to eat this overpriced muck with a perfectly good cold supper waiting in the refrigerator at home and a decent programme on the telly he could forget it. And they had better uses for their money than to sit here drinking with Colin and his latest tart who had opened her legs to half Norwich, if rumour were to be believed. There were the hire purchase repayments on the sitting-room furniture and the car, not to mention the mortgage. She tried again to meet Norman's eye but he was rather desperately keeping his attention on that slut Yvonne. And that wasn't proving difficult. Colin leaned over to her, his bold treacle-brown eyes half mocking, half inviting, Colin Lomas, who thought every woman would swoon when he beckoned. ‘Relax, darling. Your old man's enjoying himself. It's your round, Norm.’ Ignoring Colin she spoke to Norman: ‘Look, it's time we were going. We agreed we'd leave at seven.’ ‘Oh, come on, Chrissie, give the lad a break. One more round.’ Without meeting her eyes, Norman said: ‘What'll you have, Yvonne? The same again? Medium sherry?’ Colin said: ‘Let's get on to spirits. I'll have a Johnny Walker.’ He was doing it on purpose. She knew that he didn't even like whisky. She said: ‘Look, I've had enough of this bloody place. The noise has given me a head.’ ‘A headache? Nine months married and she's started the headaches. No point in hurrying home tonight, Norm.’ Yvonne giggled. Christine said, her face burning, ‘You were always vulgar, Colin Lomas, but now you're not even funny with it. You three can do what you like. I'm going home. Give me the car keys.’ Colin leaned back and smiled. ‘You heard what your lady wife said. She wants the car keys.’ Without a word, shamefaced, Norman took them out of his pocket and slid them over the table. She snatched them up, pushed back the table, struggled past Yvonne and rushed to the door. She was almost crying with rage. It took her a minute to unlock the car and then she sat shaking behind the wheel, waiting until her hands were steady enough to switch on the ignition. She heard her mother's voice on the day when she had announced her engagement: ‘Well, you're thirty-two and if he's what you want I suppose you know your own mind. But you'll never make anything of him. Weak as water, if you ask me.’ But she had thought that she could make something of him and that small semi-detached house outside Norwich represented nine months of hard work and achievement. Next year he was due for promotion at the insurance office. She would be able to give up her job as secretary in the medical physics department at Larksoken Power Station and start the first of the two children she had planned. She would be thirty-four by then. Everyone knew that you shouldn't wait too long. She had only passed her driving test after her marriage and this was the first time that she had driven unaccompanied by night. She drove slowly and carefully, her anxious eyes peering ahead, glad that at least the route home was familiar. She wondered what Norman would do when he saw that the car had gone. Almost certainly he would expect to find her sitting there, fuming but ready to be driven home. Now he'd have to rely for a lift on Colin who wouldn't be so keen on coming out of his way. And if they thought that she was going to invite Colin and Yvonne in for a drink when they arrived they would get a shock. The thought of Norman's discomfiture at finding her gone cheered her a little and she pressed her foot down on the accelerator, anxious to distance herself from the three of them, to reach the safety of home. But suddenly the car gave a stutter and the engine died. She must have been driving more erratically than she thought for she found herself half skewed across the road. It was a bad place to be stranded, a lonely stretch of country lane with a thin band of trees on either side and it was deserted. And then she remembered. Norman had mentioned that they needed to fill up with petrol and must be sure to call at the all-night garage after they left the Clarence. It was ridiculous to have let the tank get so low but they had had an argument only three days earlier on whose turn  it was to call at the garage and pay for the petrol. All her anger and frustration returned. For a moment she sat there, beating her hands impotently on the wheel, desperately turning the key in the ignition, willing the engine to start. But there was no response. And then irritation began to give way to the first tricklings of fear. The road was deserted and even if a motorist came by and drew up, could she be certain that he wasn't a kidnapper, a rapist, even the Whistler? There had been that horrible murder on the A3 only this year. Nowadays you could trust no one. And she could hardly leave the car where it was, slewed across the road. She tried to recall when she had last passed a house, an AA box, a public telephone, but it seemed to her that she had been driving through deserted countryside for at least ten minutes. Even if she left the dubious sanctuary of the car she had no clue to the best direction in which to seek help. Suddenly a wave of total panic swept across her like nausea and she had to resist the urge to dash from the car and hide herself among the trees. But what good would that do? He might be lurking even there. An then, miraculously, she heard footsteps and, looking round, saw a woman approaching. She was dressed in trousers and a trenchcoat and had a mane of fair hair beneath a tight-fitting beret. At her side on a leash trotted a small, smooth-haired dog. Immediately all her anxiety vanished. Here was someone who would help her push the car into the side of the road, who would know in which direction lay the nearest house, who would be a companion on her walk. Without even troubling to slam the door of the car she called out happily and ran smiling towards the horror of her death. The dinner had been excellent and the wine, a Château Potensac '78, an interesting choice with the main course. Although Dalgliesh knew of Alice Mair's reputation as a cookery writer he had never read any of her books and had no idea to what culinary school, if any, she belonged. He had hardly feared being presented with the usual artistic creation swimming in a pool of sauce and accompanied by one or two undercooked carrots and mange-tout elegantly arranged on a side plate. But the wild ducks carved by Alex Mair had been recognizably ducks, the piquant sauce, new to him, enhanced rather than dominated the taste of the birds, and the small mounds of creamed turnip and parsnip were an agreeable addition to green peas. Afterwards they had eaten orange sorbet followed by cheese and fruit. It was a conventional menu but one intended, he felt, to please the guests rather than to demonstrate the ingenuity of the cook. The expected fourth guest, Miles Lessingham, had unaccountably failed to arrive, but Alice Mair hadn't rearranged her table and the empty chair and unfilled wineglass were uncomfortably evocative of Banquo's ghost. Dalgliesh was seated opposite Hilary Robarts. The portrait, he thought, must have been even more powerful than he realized if it could so dominate his physical reaction to the living woman. It was the first time they had met although he had known of her existence as he had of all the handful of people who lived, as the Lydsett villagers said, ‘t'other side of the gate’. And it was a little strange that this was their first meeting; her red Golf was a frequent sight on the headland, her cottage had frequently met Iris eyes from the top storey of the mill. Now, physically close for the first time, he found it difficult to keep his eyes off her, living flesh and remembered image seeming to fuse into a presence both potent and disturbing. It was a handsome face, a model's face, he thought, with its high cheekbones, long, slightly concave nose, wide, full lips and dark, angry eyes deeply set under the strong brows. Her crimped, springing hair, held back with two combs, fell over her shoulders. He could imagine her posed, mouth moistly open, hips jutting and  staring at the cameras with that apparently obligatory look of arrogant resentment. As she leaned forward to twitch another grape from the bunch and almost toss it into her mouth he could see the faint freckles which smudged the dark forehead, the glisten of hairs above a carved upper lip. On the other side of their host sat Meg Dennison, delicately but unfussily peeling her grapes with pink-tipped fingers. Hilary Robarts's sultry handsomeness emphasized her own very different look, an old-fashioned, carefully tended but unselfconscious prettiness which reminded him of photographs of the late thirties. Their clothes emphasized the contrast. Hilary wore a shirtwaister dress in multicoloured Indian cotton, three buttons at the neck undone. Meg Dennison was in a long black skirt and a blue patterned silk blouse with a bow at the neck. But it was their hostess who was the most elegant. The long shift in fine dark brown wool worn with a heavy necklace of silver and amber hid her angularity and emphasized the strength and regularity of the strong features. Beside her Meg Dennison's prettiness was diminished almost to insipidity and Hilary Robarts's strong-coloured cotton looked tawdry. The room in which they were dining must, he thought, have been part of the original cottage. From these smoke-blackened beams Agnes Poley had hung her sides of bacon, her bundles of dried herbs. In a pot slung over that huge hearth she had cooked her family's meals and, perhaps, at the end had heard in its roaring flames the crackling faggots of her dreadful martyrdom. Outside the long window had passed the helmets of marching men. But only in the name of the cottage was there a memory of the past. The oval dining table and the chairs were modern as were the Wedgwood dinner service and the elegant glasses. In the drawing room, where they had drunk their pre-dinner sherry, Dalgliesh had a sense of a room which deliberately rejected the past, containing nothing which could violate the owner's essential privacy; no family history in photograph or portrait, no shabby heirlooms given room out of nostalgia, sentimentality or family piety, no antiques collected over the years. Even the few pictures, three recognizably by John Piper, were modern. The furniture was expensive, comfortable, well heart of the cottage wasn't there. It was in that large, warm-smelling and welcoming kitchen. He had only been half listening to the conversation but now he  forced himself to be a more accommodating guest. The talk was general, candlelit faces leaned across the table and the hands which peeled the fruit or fidgeted with the glasses were as individual as the faces. Alice Mair's strong but elegant hands with their short nails, Hilary Robarts's long, knobbled fingers, the delicacy of Meg Dennison's pink-tipped fingers, a little reddened with housework. Alex Mair was saying: ‘All right, let's take a modern dilemma. We know that we can use human tissue from aborted foetuses to treat Parkinson’ s disease and probably Alzheimer's. Presumably you'd find that ethically acceptable if the abortion were natural or legal but not if it were induced for the purpose of providing the tissue. But you can argue that a woman has a right to the use that she makes of her own body. If she's particularly fond of someone who has Alzheimer's and wants to help him by producing a foetus, who has the right to say no? A foetus isn't a child.’ Hilary Robarts said: ‘I notice that you assume the sufferer to be helped is a man. I suppose he'd feel entitled to use a woman's body for this purpose as he would any other. But why the hell should he? I can't imagine that a woman who's actually had an abortion wants to go through that again for any man's convenience.’ The words were spoken with extreme bitterness. There was a pause then Mair said quietly: ‘Alzheimer's is rather more than an inconvenience. But I'm not advocating it. In any case, under present law, it would be illegal.’ ‘Would that worry you?’ He looked into her angry eyes. ‘Naturally it would worry me. Happily it isn't a decision that I shall ever be required to make. But we're not talking about legality, we're talking about morality.’ His sister asked: ‘Are they different?’ ‘That's the question, isn't it? Are they, Adam?’ It was the first time he had used Dalgliesh's Christian name. Dalgliesh said: ‘You're assuming there's an absolute morality independent of time or circumstance.’ ‘Wouldn't you make that assumption?’ ‘Yes, I think I would, but I'm not a moral philosopher.’ Mrs Dennison looked up from her plate a little flushed and said: ‘I'm always suspicious of the excuse that a sin is justified if it's done to benefit someone we love. We may think so, but it's usually to benefit ourselves. I might dread the thought of having to look after an Alzheimer patient. When we advocate euthanasia is it to stop pain  or to prevent our own distress at having to watch it? To conceive a child deliberately in order to kill it to make use of its tissue, the idea is absolutely repugnant.’ Alex Mair said: ‘I could argue that what you are killing isn't a child and that repugnance at an act isn't evidence of its immorality.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘But isn't it? Doesn't Mrs Dennison's natural repugnance tell us something about the morality of the act?’ She gave him a brief, grateful smile and went on: ‘And isn't this use of a foetus particularly dangerous? It could lead to the poor of the world conceiving children and selling the foetuses to help the rich. Already I believe there's a black market in human organs. Do you think a multi-millionaire who needs a heart-lung transplant ever goes without?’ Alex Mair smiled. ‘As long as you aren't arguing that we should deliberately suppress knowledge or reject scientific progress just because the discoveries can be abused. If there are abuses, legislate against them.’ Meg protested: ‘But you make it sound so easy. If all we had to do was to legislate against social evils Mr Dalgliesh for one would be out of work.’ ‘It isn't easy but it has to be attempted. That's what being human means, surely, using our intelligence to make choices.’ Alice Mair got up from the table. She said: ‘Well, it's time to make a choice now on a somewhat different level. Which of you would like coffee and what kind? There's a table and chairs in the courtyard. I thought we could switch on the yard lights and have it outside.’ They moved through to the drawing room and Alice Mair opened the french windows leading to the patio. Immediately the sonorous booming of the sea flowed into and took possession of the room like a vibrating and irresistible force. But once they had stepped out into the cool air, paradoxically, the noise seemed muted, the sea no more than a distant roar. The patio was bounded on the road side by a high flint wall which, to the south and east, curved to little more than four feet to give an unimpeded view across the headland to the sea. The coffee tray was carried out by Alex Mair within minutes and, cups in hand, the little party wandered aimlessly among the terracotta pots like strangers reluctant to be introduced or like actors on a stage set, self-absorbed, pondering their lines, waiting for the rehearsal to begin. They were without coats and the warmth of the night had proved  illusory. They had turned as if by common consent to go back into the cottage when the lights of a car, driven fast, came over the southern rise of the road. As it approached its speed slackened. Mair said: ‘Lessingham's Porsche.’ No one spoke. They watched silently as the car was driven at speed off the road to brake violently on the turf of the headland. as if conforming to some prearranged ceremony they grouped themselves into a semicircle with Alex Mair a little to the front, like a formal welcoming party but one bracing itself for trouble rather than expecting pleasure from the approaching guest. Dalgliesh was aware of the heightening tension: small individual tremors of anxiety which shivered on the still, sea-scented air, unified and focused on the car door and on the tall figure which unwound from the driver's seat, leapt easily over the low stone wall and walked deliberately across the courtyard towards them. Lessingham ignored Mair and moved straight to Alice. He took her hand and gently kissed it, a theatrical gesture which Dalgliesh felt had taken her by surprise and which the others had watched with an unnaturally critical attention. Lessingham said gently: ‘My apologies, Alice. Too late for dinner, I know, but not, I hope, for a drink. And God, do I need one.’ ‘Where have you been? We waited dinner for forty minutes.’ It was Hilary Robarts who asked the obvious question, sounding as accusatory as a peevish wife. Lessingham kept his eye on Alice. He said: ‘I've been considering how best to answer that question for the last twenty minutes. There are a number of interesting and dramatic possibilities. I could say that I've been helping the police with their inquiries. Or that I've been involved in a murder. Or that there was a little unpleasantness on the road. Actually it was all three. The Whistler has killed again. I found the body.’ Hilary Robarts said sharply: ‘How do you mean, ‘found'’? Where?’ Again Lessingham ignored her. He said to Alice Mair: ‘Could I have that drink? Then I'll give you all the gory details. After unsettling your seating plan and delaying dinner for forty minutes that's the least I owe you.’ As they moved back into the drawing room Alex Mair introduced Dalgliesh. Lessingham gave him one sharp glance. They shook hands. The palm which momentarily touched his was moist and very cold. Alex Mair said easily: ‘Why didn't you ring? We would have kept some food for you.’ The question, conventionally domestic, sounded irrelevant, but Lessingham answered it. ‘Do you know, I actually forgot. Not all the time, of course, but it honestly didn't cross my mind until the police had finished questioning me and then the moment didn't seem opportune. They were perfectly civil but I sensed that my private engagements had a pretty low priority. Incidentally, you get absolutely no credit from the police for finding a body for them. Their attitude is rather, ‘'Thank you very much, sir, very nasty, I'm sure. Sorry you've been troubled. But we'll take over now. Just go home and try to forget all about it.'’ I have a feeling that that isn't going to be so easy.’ Back in the drawing room, Alex Mair threw a couple of thin logs on to the glowing embers and went to get the drinks. Lessingham had refused whisky but had asked for wine. ‘But don't waste your best claret on me, Alex. This is purely medicinal.’ Almost imperceptibly they edged their chairs closer. Lessingham began his story deliberately, pausing at times to take gulps of the wine. It seemed to Dalgliesh that he was subtly altered since his arrival, had become charged with a power both mysterious and oddly familiar. He thought: He has acquired the mystique of the story-teller and, glancing at the ring of fire-lit and intent faces, he was suddenly reminded of his first village school, of the children clustered round Miss Douglas at three o'clock on a Friday afternoon for the half hour of story-time, and felt a pang of pain and regret for those lost days of innocence and love. He was surprised that the memory should have come back so keenly and at such a moment. But this was to be a very different story and one unsuited to the ears of children. Lessingham said: ‘I had an appointment with my dentist in Norwich at five o'clock and then briefly visited a friend in the Close. So I drove here from Norwich, not from my cottage. I'd just turned right off the B1 150 at Fairstead when I nearly crashed into the back of this unlit car skewed across the road. I thought it was a damn silly place to park if someone wanted to take a leak in the bushes. Then it crossed my mind that there could have been an accident. And the right-hand door was open, that seemed a bit odd. So I drew into the side and went to take a look. There was no one about. I'm not sure why I walked into the trees. A kind of instinct I suppose. It was too dark to see anything and I wondered whether to call out. Then I felt a  fool and decided to leave it and mind my own business. And it was then that I almost tripped over her.’ He took another gulp of the wine. ‘I still couldn't see anything, of course, but I knelt down and groped about with my hands. And it was then that I touched flesh. I think I touched her thigh, I can't be sure. But flesh, even dead flesh, is unmistakable. So I went back to the car and got my torch. I shone it on her feet and then slowly up her body to her face. And then, of course, I saw. I knew it was the Whistler.’ Meg Dennison asked gently: ‘Was it very terrible?’ He must have heard in her voice what she obviously felt, not prurience but sympathy, an understanding that he needed to talk. He looked at her for a moment as if seeing her for the first time then paused, giving the question serious thought. ‘More shocking than terrible. Looking back my emotions were complicated, a mixture of horror, disbelief and, well, shame. I felt like a voyeur. The dead, after all, are at such a disadvantage. She looked grotesque, a little ridiculous, with thin clumps of hair sticking out of her mouth as if she was munching. Horrible, of course, but silly at the same time. I had an almost irresistible impulse to giggle. I know it was only a reaction to shock but it was hardly admirable. And the whole scene was so, well, banal. If you had asked me to describe one of the Whistler's victims that's exactly how I should have seen her. You expect reality to be different from imaginings.‘ Alice Mair said: ‘Perhaps because the imaginings are usually worse.’ Meg Dennison said gently: ‘You must have been terrified. I know I should have been. Alone and in darkness with such horror.’ He shifted his body towards her and spoke as if it were important that she, of all those present, should understand. ‘No, not terrified, that was the surprising part. I was frightened, of course, but only for a second or two. After all, I didn't imagine he'd wait around. He'd had his kicks. He isn't interested in men anyway. I found myself thinking the ordinary, commonplace thoughts. I mustn't touch anything. I mustn't destroy the evidence. I've got to get the police. Then, walking back to the car, I started rehearsing what I'd say to them, almost as if I were concocting my story. I tried to explain why it was that I went into the bushes, tried to make it sound reasonable.’ Alex Mair said: ‘What was there to justify? You did what you did. It  sounds reasonable enough to me. The car was a danger slewed across the road. It would have been irresponsible just to drive on.’ ‘It seemed to need a lot of explaining, then and later. Perhaps because all the subsequent police sentences began with ‘why'’. You get morbidly sensitive to your own motives. It's almost as if you have to convince yourself that you didn't do it.’ Hilary Robarts said impatiently: ‘But the body, when you first went back for the torch and saw her, you were certain she was dead?’ ‘Oh yes, I knew she was dead.’ ‘How could you have known? It could have been very recent. Why didn't you at least try to resuscitate her, give her the kiss of life? It would have been worth overcoming your natural repugnance.’ Dalgliesh heard Meg Dennison make a small sound between a gasp and a groan. Lessingham looked at Hilary and said coolly: ‘It would have been if there had been the slightest point in it. I knew she was dead, let's leave it at that. But don't worry, if I ever rind you in extremis I'll endeavour to overcome my natural repugnance.’ Hilary relaxed and gave a little self-satisfied smile, as if gratified to have stung him into a cheap retort. Her voice was more natural as she said: ‘I'm surprised you weren't treated as a suspect. After all, you were the first on the scene, and this is the second time you've been, well almost, in at the death. It's becoming a habit.’ The last words were spoken almost under her breath but her eyes were fixed on Lessingham's face. He met her glance and said, with equal quietness: ‘But there's a difference, isn't there? I had to watch Toby die, remember? And this time no one will even try to pretend that it isn't murder.’ The fire gave a sudden crackle and the top log rolled over and fell into the hearth. Mair, his face flushed, kicked it viciously back. Hilary Robarts, perfectly calm, turned to Dalgliesh. ‘But I'm right, aren't I? Don't the police usually suspect the person who finds the body?’ He said quietly: ‘Not necessarily.’ Lessingham had placed the bottle of claret on the hearth. Now he leaned down and carefully refilled his glass. He said: ‘They might have suspected me, I suppose, but for a number of lucky circumstances. I was obviously out on my lawful occasions. I have an alibi for at least two of the previous killings. From their point of view I was depressingly free of blood. I suppose they could see I was in a mild  state of shock. And there was no sign of the ligature which strangled her, nor of the knife.’ Hilary said sharply: ‘What knife? The Whistler's a strangler. Everyone knows that's how he kills.’ ‘Oh, I didn't mention that, did I? She was strangled all right, or I suppose she was. I didn't keep the torchlight on her face longer than was necessary. But he marks his victims, apart from stuffing their mouths with hair. Pubic hair, incidentally. I saw that all right. There was the letter L cut into her forehead. Quite unmistakable. A detective-constable who was talking to me later told me that it's one of the Whistler's trademarks. He thought that the L could stand for Larksoken and that the Whistler might be making some kind of statement about nuclear power, a protest perhaps.’ Alex Mair said sharply: ‘That's nonsense.’ Then added more calmly: ‘There's been nothing on television or in the papers about any cut on the victims’ foreheads. ‘The police are keeping it quiet, or trying to. It's the kind of detail they can use to sort out the false confessions. There have been half a dozen of those already apparently. There's been nothing in the media about the hair either, but that piece of unpleasantness seems to be generally known. After all, I'm not the only one to have found a body. People do talk.’ Hilary Robarts said: ‘Nothing has been written or said, as far as I know, about it being pubic hair.’ ‘No, the police are keeping that quiet too, and it's hardly the sort of detail you print in a family newspaper. Not that it's so very surprising. He isn't a rapist but there was bound to be some sexual element.’ It was one of the details which Rickards had told Dalgliesh the previous evening but one, he felt, which Lessingham could well have kept to himself, particularly at a mixed dinner party. He was a little surprised at his sudden sensitivity. perhaps it was his glance at Meg Dennison's ravaged face. And then his ears caught a faint sound. He looked across to the open door of the dining room and glimpsed the slim figure of Theresa Blaney standing in the shadows. He wondered how much of Lessingham's account she had heard. However little, it would have been too much. He said, hardly aware of the severity in his voice: 'Didn't Chief Inspector Rickards ask you to keep this information confidential?’ There was an embarrassed silence. He thought, They had forgotten for a moment that I'm a policeman. Lessingham turned to him. ‘I intend to keep it confidential. Rickards didn't want it to become public knowledge and it won't. No one here will pass it on.’ But that single question, reminding them of who he was and what he represented, chilled the room and changed their mood from fascinated and horrified interest to a slightly embarrassed unease. And when, a minute later, he got up to say his goodbyes and thank his hostess, there was an almost visible sense of relief. He knew that the embarrassment had nothing to do with the fear that he would question, criticize, move like a spy among them. It wasn't his case and they weren't suspects, and they must have known that he was no cheerful extrovert, flattered to be the centre of attraction while they bombarded him with questions about Chief Inspector Rickards's likely methods, the chance of catching the Whistler, his theories about psychopathic killers, his own experience of serial murder. But merely by being there he increased their awakening fear and repugnance at this latest horror. On each of their minds was imprinted the mental image of that violated face, the half-open mouth stuffed with hair, those staring, sightless eyes, and his presence intensified the picture, brought it into sharper focus. Horror and death were his trade and, like an undertaker, he carried with him the contagion of his craft. He was at the front door when, on impulse, he turned back and said to Meg Dennison: ‘I think you mentioned that you walked from the Old Rectory, Mrs Dennison. Could I walk home with you, that is if it's not too early for you?’ Alex Mair was beginning to say that he, of course, would drive her but Meg extricated herself clumsily from her chair and said, a little too eagerly: ‘I'd be grateful if you would. I would like the walk and it would save Alex getting out the car.’ Alice Mair said: ‘And it's time Theresa was on her way. We should have driven her home an hour ago. I'll give her father a ring. Where is she, by the way?’ Meg said: ‘I think she was next door clearing the table a minute ago. ‘Well, I'll find her and Alex can drive her home.’ The party was breaking up. Hilary Robarts had been slumped back in her chair, her eyes fixed on Lessingham. Now she got to her feet and said: ‘I'll get back to my cottage. There's no need for anyone to  come with me. As Miles has said, the Whistler's had his kicks for tonight.’ Alex Mair said: ‘I'd rather you waited. I'll walk with you once I've taken Theresa home.’ She shrugged and, without looking at him, said: ‘All right, if you insist. I'll wait.’ She moved over to the window, staring out into the darkness. Only Lessingham stayed in his chair, reaching again to fill his glass. Dalgliesh saw that Alex Mair had silently placed another opened bottle in the hearth. He wondered whether Alice Mair would invite Lessingham to stay the night at Martyr's Cottage or whether he would be driven home later by her or her brother. He would certainly be in no state to drive himself. Dalgliesh was helping Meg Dennison into her jacket when the telephone rang, sounding unnaturally strident in the quiet room. He felt her sudden shock of fear and for a moment, almost involuntarily, his hands strengthened on her shoulders. They heard Alex Mair's voice. ‘Yes, we've heard. Miles Lessingham is here and gave us the details. Yes, I see. Yes. Thank you for letting me know.’ Then there was a longer silence, then Mair's voice again. ‘Completely fortuitous, I should say, wouldn't you? After all, we have a staff of five hundred and thirty. But naturally everyone at Larksoken will find the news deeply shocking, the women particularly. Yes, I shall be in my office tomorrow if there's any help I can give. Her family have been told, I suppose? Yes, I see. Good night, Chief Inspector.’ He put down the receiver and said: ‘That was Chief Inspector Rickards. They've identified the victim. Christine Baldwin. She is — she was — a typist at the station. You didn't recognize her then, Miles?’ Lessingham took his time refilling his glass. He said: The police didn't tell me who she was. Even if they had, I wouldn't have remembered the name. And no, Alex, I didn't recognize her. I suppose I must have seen Christine Baldwin at Larksoken, probably in the canteen. But what I saw earlier tonight wasn't Christine Baldwin. And I can assure you that I didn't shine the torch on her longer than I needed to satisfy myself that she was beyond any help that I could give.’ Without looking round from the window Hilary Robarts said: ‘Christine Baldwin. Aged thirty-three. Actually, she's only been  with us for eleven months. Married last year. Just transferred to the medical physics department. I can give you her typing and shorthand speeds if you're interested.’ Then she turned round and looked Alex Mair in the face. ‘It looks as if the Whistler's getting closer, doesn't it, in more ways than one.’ The final goodbyes were said and they stepped out from the smell of wood smoke, food and wine from a room which Dalgliesh was beginning to find uncomfortably warm into the fresh, sea-scented air. It took a few minutes before his eyes had adjusted to semi-darkness and the great sweep of the headland became visible, its shapes and forms mysteriously altered under the high stars. To the north the power station was a glittering galaxy of white lights, its stark geometric bulk subsumed in the blue-black of the sky. They stood for a moment regarding it, then Meg Dennison said: ‘When I first came here from London it almost frightened me, the sheer size of it, the way it dominates the headland. But I'm getting used to it. It's still disturbing but it does have a certain grandeur. Alex tries to demystify it, says its function is just to produce electricity for the National Grid efficiently and cleanly, that the main difference between this and any other power station is that you don't have beside it a huge pyramid of polluting coal dust. But atomic power to my generation always means that mushroom cloud. And now it means Chernobyl. But if it were an ancient castle standing there against the skyline, if what we looked out at tomorrow morning was a row of turrets, we'd probably be saying how magnificent it is.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘If it had a row of turrets it would be a rather different shape. But I know what you mean. I should prefer the headland without it but it's beginning to look as if it had a right to be there.’ They turned simultaneously from contemplating the glittering lights and looked south to the decaying symbol of a very different power. Before them, at the edge of the cliff, crumbling against the skyline like a child's sandcastle rendered amorphous by the advancing tide, was the ruined Benedictine abbey. He could just make out the great empty arch of the east window and beyond it the shimmer of the North Sea while above, seeming to move through and over it like a censer, swung the smudged yellow disc of the moon. Almost without conscious will they took their first steps from the track on to the rough headland towards it. Dalgliesh said: ‘Shall we? Can you spare the time? And what about your shoes?’ ‘Reasonably sensible. Yes, I'd like to, it looks so wonderful at night. And I don't really need to hurry. The Copleys won't have waited up for me. Tomorrow, when I have to tell them how close the Whistler is getting, I may not like to leave them alone after dark. This may be my last free night for some time.’ ‘I don't think they'd be in any real danger as long as you lock up securely. So far all his victims have been young women and he kills out of doors. ‘I tell myself that. And I don't think they'd be seriously frightened. Sometimes the very old seem to have moved beyond that kind of fear. The trivial upsets of daily living assume importance but the big tragedies they take in their stride. But their daughter is constantly ringing up to suggest they go to her in Wiltshire until he's caught. They don't want to but she's a strong-minded woman and very insistent, and if she telephones after dusk and I'm not there it will increase the pressure on them.’ She paused and then said: ‘It was a horrible end to an interesting but rather strange dinner party. I wish Mr Lessingham had kept the details to himself, but I suppose it helped him to talk about it, especially as he lives alone.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘It would have needed superhuman control not to have talked about it. But I wish he'd omitted the more salacious details.’ ‘It will make a difference to Alex, too. Already some of the women staff demand to be escorted home after the evening shifts. Alice has told me that that isn't going to be easy for Alex to organize. They'll only accept a male escort if he has an unbreakable alibi for one of the Whistler murders. People cease to be rational even when they've known and worked with someone for the last ten years.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘Murder does that, particularly this kind of murder. Miles Lessingham mentioned another death: Toby. Was that the young man who killed himself at the station? I seem to remember a paragraph in one of the papers.’ ‘It was an appalling tragedy. Toby Gledhill was one of Alex's most brilliant young scientists. He broke his neck by throwing himself down on top of the reactor.’ ‘So there was no mystery about it?’ ‘Oh no, absolutely none, except why he did it. Mr Lessingham saw it happen. I'm surprised you remember it. There was very little about  it in the national press. Alex tried to minimize the publicity to protect his parents.’ And to protect the power station, thought Dalgliesh. He wondered why Lessingham had described Gledhill's death as murder but he didn't question his companion further. The allegation had been spoken so quietly that he doubted whether she had in fact heard it. Instead he asked: ‘Are you happy living on the headland?’ The question did not appear to surprise her but it did surprise him, as did the very fact that they were walking so companionably together. She was curiously restful to be with. He liked her quiet gentleness with its suggestion of underlying strength. Her voice was pleasant and voices were important to him. But six months ago none of this would have been enough to make him invite her company for longer than was politely necessary. He would have escorted her back to the Old Rectory and then, a minor social obligation performed, turned with relief to walk alone to the abbey, drawing his solitude around him like a cloak. That solitude was still essential to him. He couldn't tolerate twenty-four hours in which the greater part wasn't spent entirely alone. But some change in himself, the inexorable years, success, the return of his poetry, perhaps the tentative beginning of love, seemed to be making him sociable. He wasn't sure whether this was something to be welcomed or resisted. He was aware that she was giving his question careful thought. ‘Yes, I think that I am. Sometimes very happy. I came here to escape from the problems of my life in London and, without really meaning to, I came as far east as I could get.’ ‘And found yourself confronting two different forms of menace, the power station and the Whistler.’ ‘Both frightening because both mysterious, both rooted in a horror of the unknown. But the menace isn't personal, isn't directed specifically against me. But I did run away and, I suppose, all refugees carry with them a small burden of guilt. And I miss the children. Perhaps I should have stayed and fought on. But it was becoming a very public war. I'm not suited to the role of popular heroine of the more reactionary press. All I wanted was to be left alone to get on with the job I'd been trained for and loved. But every book I used, every word I spoke was scrutinized. You can't teach in an atmosphere of rancorous suspicion. In the end I found I couldn't even live in it.’ She was taking it for granted that he knew who she was; but then anyone who had read the papers must know that. He said: ‘It's possible to fight intolerance, stupidity and fanaticism when they come separately. When you get all three together it's probably wiser to get out, if only to preserve one's sanity.’ They were approaching the abbey now and the grass of the headland was becoming more hillocky. She stumbled and he put out his hand to steady her. She said: ‘In the end it came down to just two letters. They insisted that the blackboard should be called the chalkboard. Black or chalk. I didn't believe, I still don't believe that any sensible person, whatever his colour, objects to the word blackboard. It's black and it's a board. The word black in itself can't be offensive. I'd called it that all my life so why should they try to force me to change the way I speak my own language? And yet, at this moment, on this headland, under this sky, this immensity, it all seems so petty. Perhaps all I did was to elevate trivia into a principle. Dalgliesh said: ‘Agnes Poley would have understood. My aunt looked up the records and told me about her. She went to the stake, apparently, for an obstinate adherence to her own uncompromising view of the universe. She couldn't accept that Christ’ s body could be present in the sacrament and at the same time physically in heaven at God's right hand. It was, she said, against common sense. Perhaps Alex Mair should take her as patron of his power station, a quasi-saint of rationality.’ ‘But that was different. She believed her immortal soul was in jeopardy.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘Who knows what she believed? I think she was probably activated by a divine obstinacy. I find that rather admirable.’ Meg said: ‘I think Mr Copley would argue that she was wrong, not the obstinacy, but her earthbound view of the sacrament. I'm not really competent to argue about that. But to die horribly for your own common-sense view of the universe is rather splendid. I never visit Alice without standing and reading that plaque. It's my small act of homage. And yet I don't feel her presence in Martyr's Cottage. Do you?’ ‘Not in the slightest. I suspect that central heating and modern furniture are inimical to ghosts. Did you know Alice Mair before you came here?’ ‘I knew no one. I answered an advertisement by the Copleys in The  Lady . They were offering free accommodation and food to someone who would do what they described as a little gentle housework. It's a euphemism for dusting, but of course it never works out like that. Alice has made a great difference. I hadn't realized how much I was missing female friendship. At school we only had alliances, offensive or defensive. Nothing ever cut across political divisions.’ Dalgliesh said: ‘Agnes Poley would have understood that atmosphere too. It was the one she breathed.’ For a minute they walked in silence hearing the rustle of the long grasses over their shoes. Dalgliesh wondered why it was that, when walking towards the sea, there came a moment when its roar suddenly increased as if a menace, quiescent and benign, had suddenly realized and gathered up its power. Looking up at the sky, at the myriad pinpricks of light, it seemed to him that he could feel the turning earth beneath his feet and that time had mysteriously come to a stop, fusing into one moment the past, the present and the future; the ruined abbey, the obstinately enduring artefacts of the last war, the crumbling cliff defences, the windmill and the power station. And he wondered whether it was in such a disorientating limbo of time, listening to the ever-restless sea, that the previous owners of Martyr's Cottage had chosen their text. Suddenly his companion stopped and said: ‘There’ s a light in the ruins. Two small flashes, like a torch.’ They stood still and watched in silence. Nothing appeared. She said, almost apologetically: ‘I'm sure I saw it. And there was a shadow, something or somebody moving against the eastern window. You didn't see it?’ ‘I was looking at the sky.’ She said, almost with a note of regret: ‘Well, it's gone now. I suppose I could have imagined it.’ And when, five minutes later, they made their way cautiously over the humpy grass into the heart of the ruins there was no one and nothing to be seen. Without speaking they walked through the gap of the east window and on to the edge of the cliff and saw only the moon-bleached beach stretching north and south, the thin fringe of white foam. If anyone had been there, thought Dalgliesh, there was plenty of opportunity for concealment behind the hunks of concrete or in the crevices of the sandy cliff. There was little point and no real justification in attempting to give chase, even if they had known the direction in which he had disappeared. People were entitled to walk  alone at night. Meg said again: ‘I suppose I could have imagined it, but I don't think so. Anyway, she's gone now.’ ‘She?’ ‘Oh yes. Didn't I say? I had the distinct impression it was a woman.’ By four o'clock in the morning, when Alice Mair woke with a small despairing cry from her nightmare, the wind was rising. She stretched out her hand to click on the bedside light, checked her watch, then lay back, panic subsiding, her eyes staring at the ceiling while the terrible immediacy of the dream began to fade, recognized for what it was, an old spectre returning after all these years, conjured up by the events of the night and by the reiteration of the word ‘murder’ which, since the Whistler had begun Iris work, seemed to murmur sonorously on the very air. Gradually she reentered the real world, manifested in the small noises of the night, the moan of the wind in the chimneys, the smoothness of the sheet in her clutching hands, the unnaturally loud ticking of her watch and, above all, in that oblong of pale light, the open casement and the drawn curtains which gave her a view of the faintly luminous star-studded sky. The nightmare needed no interpretation. It was merely a new version of an old horror, less tenable than the dreams of childhood, a more rational, more adult terror. She and Alex were children again, the whole family living with the Copleys at the Old Rectory. That, in a dream, wasn't so surprising. The Old Rectory was only a larger, less pretentious version of Sunnybank — ridiculously named since it had stood on level ground and no sun ever seemed to penetrate its windows. Both were late Victorian, built in solid red brick, both had a strong, curved door under a high, peaked porch, both were isolated, each in its own garden. In the dream she and her father were walking together through the shrubbery. He was carrying his billhook and was dressed as he was on that last dreadful autumn afternoon, a singlet stained with his sweat, the shorts high cut, showing as he walked the bulge of the scrotum, the white legs, matted with black hair from the knees down. She was worried because she knew that the Copleys were waiting for her to cook lunch. Mr Copley, robed in cassock and billowing surplice, was impatiently pacing the back lawn seeming oblivious to their presence. Her father was explaining something to her in that overloud, careful voice which he used to her mother, the voice which said: ‘I know you are too stupid to understand this but I will talk slowly and loudly and hope that you won't try my patience too far.’ He said: ‘Alex won't get the job now. I'll see that he doesn't. They won't appoint a man who's murdered his own father.’ And as he spoke he swung the billhook and she saw that its tip was red with blood. Then suddenly he turned towards her, eyes blazing, lifted it, and she felt its point pierce the skin of her forehead, and the sudden spurt of blood gushing into her eyes. Now wide awake, and breathing as if she had been running, she put her hand up to her brow and knew that the cold wetness she felt was sweat not blood. There was little hope of falling asleep again; there never was when she woke in the early hours. She could get up, put on her dressing gown, go downstairs and make tea, correct her proofs, read, listen to the BBC World Service. Or she could take one of her sleeping tablets. God knew they were powerful enough to knock her into oblivion. But she was trying to wean herself off them and to give in now would be to acknowledge the potency of the nightmare. She would get up and make tea. She had no fear of waking Alex. He slept soundly, even through the winter gales. But first there was a small act of exorcism to be performed. If the dream were to lose its power, if she were somehow to prevent it recurring, she must face again the memory of that afternoon nearly thirty years ago. It had been a warm autumnal day in early October and she, Alex and her father were working in the garden. He was Wearing a thick hedge of brambles and overgrown shrubs at the bottom of the shrubbery and out of sight of the house, slashing at them with a billhook while Alex and she dragged the freed branches clear ready to build a bonfire. Her father was under clad for the time of year but was sweating heavily. She saw the arm lifting and falling, heard the crack of twigs, felt again the thorns cutting her fingers, heard his high commands. And then, suddenly, he gave a cry. Either the branch had been rotten or he had missed his aim. The billhook had sliced into his naked thigh and, turning, she saw the great curve of red blood begin to bubble in the air, saw him slowly sink like a wounded animal, his hands plucking the air. His right hand dropped the billhook and he held it out to her, shaking, palm upward, and looked at her beseechingly, like a child. He tried to speak but she couldn't make out the words. She was moving towards him, fascinated, when suddenly she felt a clutch on her arm  laurels towards the orchard. She cried: ‘Alex, stop! He's bleeding. He's dying. We've got to get help.’ She couldn't remember whether she actually said the words. All she later remembered was the strength of his hands on her shoulders as he forced her back against the bark of an apple tree and held her there, imprisoned. And he spoke a single word. ‘No.’ Shaking with terror, her heart pounding, she couldn't have broken free even if she had wanted. And she knew now that this powerlessness was important to him. It had been his act and his alone. Compelled, absolved, she had been given no choice. Now, thirty years later, lying rigid, her eyes fixed on the sky, she remembered that single word, his eyes looking into hers, his hands on her shoulders, the bark of the tree scraping her back through her Aertex shirt. Time seemed to stop. She couldn't remember now how long he had held her imprisoned, only that it seemed an eternity of immeasurable time. And then, at last, he gave a sigh and said: ‘All right . We can go now.’ And that, too, amazed her, that he should have been thinking so clearly, calculating how long it would take. He dragged her after him until they stood over her father's body. And, looking down at the still-outstretched arm, the glazed and open eyes, the great scarlet pool soaking into the earth, she knew that it was a body, that he had gone for ever, that there was nothing she need fear from him ever again. Alex turned to her and spoke each word loudly and clearly as if she were a subnormal child. ‘Whatever he's been doing to you, he won't do it again. Ever. Listen to me and I'll tell you what happened. We left him and went down to climb the apple trees. Then we decided that we'd better get back. Then we found him. That's all there is, it's as simple as that. You don't need to say anything else. Just leave the talking to me. Look at me, look at me, Alice. You understand?’ Her voice, when it came, sounded like an old woman's voice, cracked and tremulous, and the words strained her throat. ‘Yes, I understand.’ And then he was dragging her by the hands, racing across the lawn, nearly pulling her arm from its socket, crashing through the  kitchen door, crying aloud so that it sounded like a whoop of triumph. She saw her mother's face draining as if she too were bleeding to death, heard his panting voice. ‘It's Father. He's had an accident. Get a doctor quick.’ And then she was alone in the kitchen. It was very cold. There were cold tiles under her feet. The surface of the wooden table on which she rested her head was cold to her cheeks. No one came. She was aware of a voice telephoning from the hall, and other voices, other steps. Someone was crying. Now there were more footsteps and the crunch of car wheels on gravel. And Alex had been right. It had all been very simple. No one had questioned her, no one had been suspicious. Their story had been accepted. She didn't go to the inquest but Alex did, although he never told her what happened there. Afterwards some of the people concerned, their family doctor, the solicitor, a few of her mother's friends, came back and there was a curious tea party with sandwiches and home-made fruitcake. They were kind to her and Alex. Someone actually patted her head. A voice said, ‘It was tragic that there was no one there. Common sense and a rudimentary knowledge of first aid would have saved him.’ But now the memory deliberately evoked had completed its exorcism. The nightmare had been robbed of its terror. With luck it might not return for months. She swung her legs out of bed and reached for her dressing gown. She had just poured the boiling water on the tea and was standing waiting for it to brew when she heard Alex's footsteps on the stairs and, turning, she saw his tall figure blocking the kitchen door. He looked boyish, almost vulnerable, in the familiar corded dressing gown. He pushed both hands through his sleep-tousled hair. Surprised, because he was usually a sound sleeper, she said: ‘Did I disturb you? Sorry.’ ‘No, I woke earlier and couldn't get off again. Holding dinner for Lessingham made it too late for comfortable digestion. Is this fresh?’ ‘About ready to pour.’ He took down a second mug from the dresser and poured tea for them both. She seated herself in a wicker chair and took her mug without speaking. He said: ‘The wind's rising.’ ‘Yes, it has been for the last hour.’ He went over to the door and unbolted the top wooden panel, pushing it open. There was a sensation of rushing white coldness, scentless, but obliterating the faint tang of the tea and she heard the low growling roar of the sea. As she listened it seemed to rise in intensity so that she could imagine, with an agreeable frisson of simulated terror, that the low friable cliffs had finally crumbled and that the white foaming turbulence was rolling towards them across Alex's face. Looking at him as he stared into the night, she felt a surge of affection as pure and as uncomplicated as the flow of cold air against her face. Its fleeting intensity surprised her. He was so much a part of her that she never needed nor wanted to examine too closely the nature of her feeling for him. She knew that she was always quietly satisfied to have him in the cottage, to hear his footfalls on the floor above, to share with him the meal she had cooked for herself at the end of the day. And yet neither made demands of the other. Even his marriage had made no difference. She had been unsurprised at the marriage since she had rather liked Elizabeth, but equally unsurprised when it ended. She thought it unlikely that he would marry again, but nothing between them would change, however many wives entered, or attempted to enter, his life. Sometimes as now she would smile wryly, knowing how outsiders saw their relationship. Those who assumed that the cottage was owned by him, not her, saw her as the unmarried sister, dependent on him for houseroom, companionship, a purpose in life. Others, more perceptive but still nowhere near the truth, were intrigued by their apparent independence of each other, their casual comings and goings, their non-involvement. She remembered Elizabeth saying in the first weeks of her engagement to Alex, ‘Do you know, you're a rather intimidating couple?’ and she had been tempted to reply, ‘Oh, we are, we are.’ She had bought Martyr's Cottage before his appointment as Director of the power station and he had moved in by an unspoken agreement that this was a temporary expedient while he decided what to do, keep on the Barbican flat as his main home or sell the flat and buy a house in Norwich and a smaller pied à terre in London. He was essentially an urban creature; she didn't see him settling permanently other than in a city. If, with the new job, he moved back to London she wouldn't follow him, and nor, she knew, would he expect her to. Here on this sea-scoured coast she had at last found a  place which she was content to call home. That he could walk in and out of it unannounced never made it less than her own. It must, she thought sipping her tea, have been after one o'clock when he returned from seeing Hilary Robarts home. She wondered what had kept him. Sleeping lightly as always in the early hours, she had heard his key in the lock, his foot on the stairs, before drifting again into sleep. Now it was getting on for five o'clock. He couldn't have had more than a few hours’ sleep. Now, as if suddenly aware of the morning chill, he closed the top half of the door, drove home the bolt, then came and stretched himself out in the armchair opposite her. Leaning back, he cradled his mug in his hands. He said: ‘It's a nuisance that Caroline Amphlett doesn't want to leave Larksoken. I don't relish beginning a new job, particularly this job, with an unknown PA. Caroline knows the way I work. I'd rather taken it for granted that she'd come to London with me. It's inconvenient.’ And it was, she suspected, rather more than inconvenient. Pride, even personal prestige, were also at stake. Other senior men took their personal assistants with them when changing jobs. The reluctance of a secretary to be parted from her boss was a flattering affirmation of personal dedication. She could sympathize with his chagrin but it was hardly enough to keep him awake at night. He added: ‘Personal reasons, or so she says. That means Jonathan Reeves, presumably. God knows what she sees in him. The man isn't even a good technician.‘ Alice Mair controlled her smile. She said: 'l doubt whether her interest in him is technical.’ ‘Well, if it's sexual she has less discrimination than I gave her credit for.’ He wasn't, she told herself, a poor judge of men or women. He rarely made fundamental mistakes and never, she suspected, about a man's scientific ability. But he had no understanding of the extraordinary complexities and irrationalities of human motives, human behaviour. He knew that the universe was complex but that it obeyed certain rules, although, she supposed, he wouldn't have used the word ‘obey’ with its implication of conscious choice. This, he would say, is how the physical world behaves. It is open to human reason and, to a limited extent, to human control. People disconcerted him because they could surprise him. Most disconcerting of all was the fact that he occasionally surprised himself. He  would have been at home as a sixteenth-century Elizabethan, categorizing people according to their essential natures; choleric, melancholic, mercurial, saturnine, qualities mirroring the planets that governed their birth. That basic fact established, then you knew where you were. And yet it could still surprise him that a man could be a sensible and reliable scientist in his work and a fool with women, could show judgement in one area of his life and act like an irrational child in another. Now he was peeved because his secretary, whom he had categorized as intelligent, sensible, dedicated, preferred to stay in Norfolk with her lover, a man he despised, rather than follow him to London. She said: ‘I thought you said once that you found Caroline sexually cold.’ ‘Did I? Surely not. That would suggest a degree of personal experience. I think I said I couldn't imagine ever finding her physically attractive. A PA who is personable and highly efficient but not sexually tempting is the ideal.’ She said drily: ‘I imagine that a man's idea of the ideal secretary is a woman who manages to imply that she would like to go to bed with her boss but nobly restrains herself in the interests of office efficiency. What will happen to her?’ ‘Oh, her job's secure. If she wants to stay at Larksoken there will be plenty of competition to get her. She's intelligent as well as tactful and efficient.’ ‘But presumably not ambitious, else why should she be content to remain at Larksoken?’ She added: ‘Caroline may have another reason for wanting to stay in the area. I saw her in Norwich Cathedral about three weeks ago. She met a man in the Lady Chapel. They were very discreet but it looked to me like an assignation.’ He asked, but without real curiosity: ‘What kind of man?’ ‘Middle-aged. Nondescript. Difficult to describe. But he was too old to be Jonathan Reeves.’ She said no more, knowing that he wasn't particularly interested, that his mind had moved elsewhere. And yet, looking back, it had been an odd encounter. Caroline's blonde hair had been bundled under a large beret and she was wearing spectacles. But the disguise, if it were meant as a disguise, had been ineffective. She herself had moved on swiftly, anxious not to be recognized or to seem a spy. A minute later she had seen the girl slowly walking along the aisle, guidebook in hand, the man strolling behind her carefully distanced. They had moved together and had stood in front of a monument, seemingly absorbed. And when, ten minutes later, Alice was leaving the cathedral she had glimpsed him again. This time it was he who was carrying the guidebook. He made no further comment about Caroline but after a minute's silence he said: 'Not a particularly successful dinner party.’ ‘An understatement. Beta-minus, except, of course, for the food. What's the matter with Hilary? Is she actually trying to be disagreeable or is she merely unhappy?’ ‘People usually are when they can't get what they want.’ ‘In her case, you.’ He smiled into the empty fire grate but didn't reply. After a moment she said: ‘Is she likely to be a nuisance?’ ‘Rather more than a nuisance. She's likely to be dangerous.’ ‘Dangerous? How dangerous? You mean dangerous to you personally?’ ‘To rather more than me.’ ‘But nothing you can't cope with?’ ‘Nothing I can't cope with. But not by making her Administrative Officer. She'd be a disaster. I should never have appointed her in an acting capacity.’ ‘When are you making the appointment?’ ‘In ten days’ time. There's a good field.’ ‘So you've got ten days to decide what to do about her.’ ‘Rather less than that. She wants a decision by Sunday.’ A decision about what? she wondered. Her job, a possible promotion, her future life with Alex? But surely the woman could see that she had no future with Alex. She asked, knowing the importance of the question, knowing, too, that only she would dare ask it, ‘Will you be very disappointed if you don't get the job?’ ‘I'll be aggrieved, which is rather more destructive of one's peace of mind. I want it, I need it and I'm the right person for it. I suppose that's what every candidate thinks but in my case it happens to be true. It's an important job, Alice. One of the most important there is. The future lies with nuclear power, if we're going to save this planet, but we've got to manage it better, nationally and internationally.’ ‘I imagine you're the only serious candidate. Surely this is the kind of appointment which they only decide to make when they know they've got the right man available. It’ s a new job. They've managed  perfectly well without a nuclear supremo up to now. I can see that, given the right man, the job has immense possibilities. But in the wrong hands it's just another public relations job, a waste of public money.’ He was too intelligent not to know that she was reassuring him. She was the only person from whom he ever needed reassurance or would ever take it. He said: ‘There's a suspicion that we could be getting into a mess. They want someone to get us out of it. Minor matters like his precise powers, who he'll be responsible to and how much he'll be paid have yet to be decided. That's why they're taking so long over the job specification.’ She said: ‘You don't need a written job specification to know what they're looking for. A respected scientist, a proven administrator and a good public relations expert. They'll probably ask you to take a TV test. Looking good on the box seems to be the prerequisite for anything these days.’ ‘Only for future presidents or prime ministers. I don't think they'll go that far.‘ He glanced at the clock. ‘It's already dawn. I think I'll get a couple of hours’ sleep.’ But it was an hour later before they finally parted and went to their rooms. Dalgliesh waited until Meg had unlocked the front door and stepped inside before saying his final goodnight, and she stood for a moment watching his tall figure striding down the gravel path and into the darkness. Then she passed into the square, tessellated hall with its stone fireplace, the hall which, on winter nights, seemed to echo faintly with the childish voices of Victorian rectors' children and which, for Meg, had always held a faintly ecclesiastical smell. Folding her coat over the ornate wooden newel post at the foot of the stairs, she went through to the kitchen and the last task of the day, setting out the Copleys' early-morning tray. It was a large, square room at the back of the house, archaic when the Copleys had bought the Old Rectory and unaltered since. Against the left-hand wall stood an old-fashioned gas stove so heavy that Meg was unable to move it to clean behind it and preferred not to think of the accumulated grease of decades gumming it to the wall. Under the window was deep porcelain sink stained with the detritus of seventy years' washing-up and impossible to clean adequately. The floor was of ancient stone slabs, hard on the feet, from which in winter there seemed to rise a damp, foot-numbing miasma. The wall opposite the sink and the window was covered with an oak dresser, very old and probably valuable, if it had been possible to remove it from the wall without its collapse, and the original row of bells still hung over the door each with its Gothic script; drawing room, dining room, study, nursery. It was a kitchen to challenge rather than enhance the skills of any cook ambitious beyond the boiling of eggs. But now Meg hardly noticed its deficiencies. Like the rest of the Old Rectory it had become home. After the stridency and aggression of the school, the hate-mail, she was happy to find her temporary asylum in this gentle household where voices were never raised, where no one obsessively analysed her every sentence in the hope of detecting racist, sexist or fascist undertones, where words meant what they had meant for generations, where obscenities were unknown or at least unspoken, where there was the grace of good order symbolized for her in Mr  Copley's reading of the Church's daily offices, Morning Prayer and Evensong. Sometimes she saw the three of them as expatriates, stranded in some remote colony, obstinately adhering to old customs, a lost way of life, as they did to old forms of worship. And she had grown to like both her employers. She would have respected Simon Copley more if he had been less prone to venial selfishness, less preoccupied with his physical comfort, but this she told herself was probably the result of fifty years of spoiling by a devoted wife. And he loved his wife. He relied on her. He respected her judgement. How lucky they were, she thought; secure in each other 's affection and presumably fortified in increasing age by the certainty that if they weren't granted the grace of death on the same day there would be no lasting separation. But did they really believe this? She would like to have asked them, but knew that it would have been impossibly presumptuous. Surely they must have some doubts, made some mental reservations to the creed they so confidently recited morning and night. But perhaps what mattered at eighty was habit, the body no longer interested in sex, the mind no longer interested in speculation, the smaller things in life mattering more than the large and, in the end, the slow realization that nothing really mattered at all. The job wasn't arduous, but she knew that gradually she was taking on much more than the advertisement had suggested and she sensed that the main anxiety of their life was whether she would stay. Their daughter had provided all the labour-saving devices: dishwasher, washing machine, spin-dryer, all housed in a disused still room near the back door, although until she came the Copleys had been reluctant to use them in case they couldn't turn them off, visualizing the machines whirling away all night, overheating, blowing up, the whole rectory pulsating with an uncontrollable power. Their only child lived in a manor house in Wiltshire and rarely visited, although she telephoned frequently, usually at inconvenient times. It was she who had interviewed Meg for the Old Rectory and Meg now found it difficult to connect that confident, tweeded, slightly aggressive woman with the two gentle old people she knew. And she knew, although they would never have dreamt of telling her, perhaps didn't even admit it to themselves, that they were afraid of her. She bullied them, as she would have claimed, for their own good. Their second greatest fear was that they might be forced  to comply with her frequently telephoned suggestion, made purely from a sense of duty, that they should go to stay with her until the Whistler was caught. Unlike their daughter, Meg could understand why, after retirement, they had used all their savings to buy the rectory and had in old age burdened themselves with a mortgage. Mr Copley had in youth been a curate at Larksoken when the Victorian church was still standing. It was in that ugly repository of polished pine, acoustic tiles and garish, sentimental stained glass that he and his wife had been married, and in a flat in the rectory, living above the parish priest, that they had made their first home. The church had been partly demolished by a devastating gale in the 1930s, to the secret relief of the Church Commissioners who had been considering what to do with a building of absolutely no architectural merit serving a congregation at the major festivals of six at the most. So the church had been finally demolished and the Old Rectory, sheltering behind it and proving more durable, had been sold. Rosemary Duncan-Smith had made her views plain when driving Meg back to Norwich station after her interview. ‘It's ridiculous for them to be living there at all, of course . They should have looked for a two-bedded, well-equipped flat in Norwich or in a convenient village close to the shops and post office, and to a church, of course. But Father can be remarkably obstinate when he thinks he knows what he wants and Mother is putty in his hands. I hope you aren't seeing this job as a temporary expedient.‘ Meg had replied: ‘Temporary, but not short-term. I can't promise that I'll stay permanently, but I need time and peace to decide on my future. And I may not suit your parents.’ ‘Time and peace. We'd all be glad of that. Well, I suppose it's better than nothing, but I'd be grateful for a month or two's notice when you do decide to go. And I shouldn't worry about suiting. With an inconvenient house and stuck out on that headland with nothing to look at but a ruined abbey and that atomic power station they'll have to put up with what they can get.’ But that had been sixteen months ago and she was still here. But it was in that beautifully designed and equipped, but comfortable and homely kitchen at Martyr's Cottage that she had found her healing. Early in their friendship, when Alice had to spend a week in London and Alex was away, she had given Meg one of her spare keys to the cottage so that she could go in to collect and forward her  post. On her return, when Meg offered it back, she had said: ‘Better keep it. You may need it again.’ Meg had never again used it. The door was usually open in summer and, when shut, she would always ring. But its possession, the sight and weight of it on her key ring, had come to symbolize for her the certainty and the trust of their friendship. She had been so long without a woman friend. She had forgotten, sometimes she told herself, that she had never before known the comfort of a close, undemanding, asexual companionship with another woman. Before the accidental drowning of her husband four years earlier, she and Martin had needed only the occasional companionship of friendly acquaintances to affirm their self-sufficiency. Theirs had been one of those childless, self-absorbing marriages which unconsciously repel attempts at intimacy. The occasional dinner party was a social duty; they could hardly wait to get back to the seclusion of their own small house. And after his death it seemed to her that she had walked in darkness like an automaton through a deep and narrow canyon of grief in which all her energies, all her physical strength, had been husbanded to get through each day. She thought and worked and grieved only for a day at a time. To allow herself even to think of the days, the weeks, the months or years stretching ahead would have been to precipitate disaster. For two years she had hardly been sane. Even her Christianity was of little help. She didn't reject it, but it had become irrelevant, its comfort only a candle which served fitfully to illumine the dark. But when, after those two years, the valley had almost imperceptibly widened and there was for the first time, not those black enclosing cliffs, but the vista of a normal life, even of happiness, a landscape over which it was possible to believe the sun might shine, she had become unwittingly embroiled in the racial politics of her school. The older members of staff had moved or retired, and the new headmistress, specifically appointed to enforce the fashionable orthodoxies, had moved in with crusading zeal to smell out and eradicate heresy. Meg realized now that she had, from the first, been the obvious, the predestined victim. She had fled to this new life on the headland and to a different solitude. And here she had found Alice Mair. They had met a fortnight after Meg's arrival when Alice had called at the Old Rectory with a suitcase of jumble for the annual sale in aid of St Andrew's Church in Lydsett. There was an unused scullery leading off a passage between the kitchen and the back door which was used as a  collecting point for unwanted items from the headland; clothes, bric-à-brac, books and old magazines. Mr Copley took an occasional service at St Andrew's when Mr Smollett, the vicar, was on holiday, an involvement in church and village life which, Meg suspected, was as important to him as it was to the church. Normally, little jumble could be expected from the few cottages on the headland, but Alex Mair, anxious to associate the power station with the community, had put up a notice on the staff board and the two tea chests were usually fairly full by the time the October sale came round. The back door of the Old Rectory, giving access to the scullery, was normally left open during daylight hours and an inner door to the house locked, but Alice Mair had knocked at the front door and made herself known. The two women, close in age, both reserved, both independent, neither deliberately seeking a friend, had liked each other. The next week Meg had received an invitation to dinner at Martyr's Cottage. And now there was rarely a day when she didn't walk the half mile over the headland to sit in Alice's kitchen and talk and watch while she worked. Her colleagues at school would, she knew, have found their friendship incomprehensible. Friendship there, or what passed for friendship, never crossed the great divide of political allegiance and in the acrimonious clamour of the staffroom could swiftly deteriorate into gossip, rumours, recriminations and betrayal. This peaceable friendship, asking nothing, was as devoid of intensity as it was of anxiety. It was not a demonstrative friendship; they had never kissed, had never indeed touched hands except at that first meeting. Meg wasn't sure what it was that Alice valued in her, but she knew what she valued in Alice. Intelligent, well-read, unsentimental, unshockable, she had become the focus of Meg's life on the headland. She seldom saw Alex Mair. During the day he was at the power station and at weekends, reversing the normal peregrination, he was at his London flat, frequently staying there for Part of the week if he had a meeting in town. She had never felt that Alice had deliberately kept them apart, fearing that her brother would be bored by her friend. In spite of all the traumas of the last four years Meg's inner self was too confidently rooted to be prone to that kind of sexual or social self-abasement. But she had never felt at home with him, perhaps because, with his confident good looks and the air of arrogance in his bearing, he seemed both to represent and to have  absorbed something of the mystery and potency of the power he operated. He was perfectly amiable to her on the few occasions when they did meet; sometimes she even felt that he liked her. But their only common ground was in the kitchen of Martyr's Cottage and even there she was always more at home when he was away. Alice never spoke of him except casually but on the few occasions, like last night's dinner party, when she had seen them together they seemed to have the intuitive mutual awareness, an instinctive response to the other's needs, more typical of a long-standing successful marriage than of an apparently casual fraternal relationship. And for the first time in nearly three years she had been able to talk about Martin. She remembered that July day, the kitchen door open to the patio, the scent of herbs and sea stronger even than the spicy, buttery smell of newly baked biscuits. She and Alice had sat opposite each other, across the kitchen table, the teapot between them. She could remember every word. ‘He didn't get many thanks. Oh, they said how heroic he was and the headmaster said all the right things at the school memorial service. But they thought that the boys shouldn't have been swimming there anyway. The school disclaimed any responsibility for his death. They were more anxious to escape criticism than to honour Martin. And the boy he saved hasn't turned out very well. I suppose I'm silly to worry about that.’ ‘It would be perfectly natural to hope that your husband hadn't died for someone second-rate, but I suppose the boy has a point of view. It could be an awesome responsibility knowing that someone has died for you.’ Meg said: ‘I tried to tell myself that. For a time I was — well, almost obsessed with that boy. I used to hang about the school waiting for him to come out. Sometimes I had the need almost to touch him. It was as if some part of Martin had Passed into him. But he was only embarrassed, of course. He didn't want to see me or talk to me, he or his parents. He wasn't, in fact, a very nice boy, a bully and rather stupid. I don't think Martin even liked him although he never said so. He was spotty, too — oh dear, that wasn't his fault, I don't know why I even mentioned it.’ And she had wondered how it was she was speaking of him at all. for the first time after all these years. And that business about her obsession with him; she had never mentioned that to a living soul. Alice had said: ‘It's a pity your husband didn't leave him to drown  and save himself, but I suppose that on the spur of the moment he didn't weigh up the relative value of a useful teaching career and pimpled stupidity.’ ‘Leave him to drown? Deliberately? Oh Alice, you know you couldn't do that yourself.’ ‘Perhaps not. I'm perfectly capable of irrational folly. I'd probably pull him out if I could do it without too much danger to myself.’ ‘Of course you would. It's human instinct, surely, to save others, particularly a child.’ ‘It's human instinct, and a thoroughly healthy one in my view, to save oneself. That's why, when people don't, we call them heroes and give them medals. We know they're acting against nature. I can't understand how you can have such an extraordinarily benign view of the universe.’ ‘Have I? I suppose I have. Except for the two years after Martin drowned I've always been able to believe that at the heart of the universe there is love.’ ‘At the heart of the universe there is cruelty. We are predators and are preyed upon, every living thing. Did you know that wasps lay their eggs in ladybirds, piercing the weak spot in their armour? Then the grub grows and feeds on the living ladybird and eats its way out, tying the ladybird's legs together. Whoever thought of that has, you have to admit, a peculiar sense of humour. And don't quote Tennyson at me.’ ‘Perhaps it doesn't feel anything, the ladybird.‘ ‘Well, it’ s a comforting thought but I wouldn't bet on it. You must have had an extraordinarily happy childhood.’ ‘Oh, I did, I did! I was lucky. I would have liked brothers and sisters but I don't remember that I was ever lonely. There wasn't much money but there was a great deal of love.’ ‘Love. Is that so very important? You were a teacher, you ought to know. Is it?’ ‘It's vital. If a child has it for the first ten years hardly anything else matters. If he hasn't, then nothing does.’ There had been a moment's silence and then Alice had said: ‘My father died, killed in an accident when I was fifteen.’ ‘How terrible. What kind of accident? Were you there? Did you see it?’ ‘He cut an artery with a billhook. He bled to death. No, we didn't see it, but we were on the scene soon afterwards. Too late, of course.’ ‘Alex too, and he was even younger. How awful for you both.’ ‘It had its effect on our lives undoubtedly, particularly mine. Why don't you try one of those biscuits? It's a new recipe but I'm not sure that it's entirely successful. A little too sweet, and I may have overdone the spice. Tell me what you think.’ Recalled to the present by the cold of the flagstones numbing her feet and automatically aligning the cup handles, she suddenly realized why she had remembered that summer teatime in Martyr's Cottage. The biscuits she would add to the tray next morning were a later batch of the same recipe provided by Alice. But she wouldn't take them from the tin until tomorrow. There was nothing more to do tonight except to fill her hot-water bottle. There was no central heating in the Old Rectory and she seldom switched on the two-bar electric fire in her bedroom, knowing how worried the Copleys were by their her bills. Finally, hugging the bottle's warmth to her chest, she checked on the bolts of the front and back doors and made her way up the uncarpeted stairs to bed. On the landing she met Mrs Copley, dressing-gowned, scurrying furtively to the bathroom. Although there was a cloakroom on the ground floor the Old Rectory had only one bathroom, a defect which necessitated embarrassed, low-voiced inquiries before anyone upset their carefully worked out rota by taking an unexpected bath. Meg waited until she heard the main bedroom door shut before going herself to the bathroom. Fifteen minutes later she was in bed. She knew rather than felt that she was very tired and recognized the symptoms of an overstimulated brain in an exhausted body, the restless limbs and inability to get comfortable. The Old Rectory was too far inland for her to hear the crash of the waves but the smell and the throb of the sea were always present. In summer the headland would vibrate with a gentle rhythmic humming which, on stormy nights or at the spring tides would rise to an angry moan. She slept always with her window open and would drift into sleep soothed by that distant murmur. But tonight it had no power to lull her into unconsciousness. Her bedside book, often reread, was Anthony Trollope's The Small House at Allington but tonight it could no longer translate her to the reassuring, comfortable, nostalgic world of Barsetshire, to croquet on Mrs Dale's lawn and dinner at the squire's table. The memories of the evening were too traumatic, too exciting, too recent to be easily assuaged by sleep. She opened her eyes to the darkness, a darkness too often populated before sleep by those familiar, reproachful, childish faces, brown, black and white, bending over her, asking why she had deserted them when they loved her and thought that she had loved them. Usually it was a relief to be free of those gentle and accusing ghosts, which in the last few months had visited her less often. And sometimes they were replaced by a more traumatic memory. The headmistress had tried to insist that she go on a racial awareness course, she who had taught children of different races for over twenty years. There was one scene which for months she had tried resolutely to put out of her mind, that last meeting in the staffroom, the circle of implacable faces, brown, black and white, the accusing eyes, the insistent questions. And in the end, worn down by bullying, she had found herself helplessly weeping. No nervous breakdown, that useful euphemism, had been more humiliating. But tonight even that shameful memory was replaced by more recent and more disquieting visions. She glimpsed again that girlish figure momentarily outlined against the walls of the abbey only to slip away like a wraith and be lost among the shadows of the beach. She sat again at the dinner table and saw in the candlelight Hilary Robarts's dark, discontented eyes staring intently at Alex Mair; watched the planes of Miles Lessingham's face fitfully lit by the leaping flames of the fire, saw his long-fingered hands reaching down for the bottle of claret, heard again that measured rather high voice speaking the unspeakable. And then, on the verge of sleep, she was crashing with him through the bushes of that dreadful wood, feeling the briars scratching her legs, the low twigs whipping against her cheeks, staring with him as the pool of light from the torch shone down on that grotesque and mutilated face. And in that twilight world between waking and sleeping she saw that it was a face she knew, her own. she jerked back to consciousness with a little cry of began resolutely to read. Half an hour later, the book slipped out of her hand and she fell into the first of the night's uneasy periods of slumber. It took only two minutes of lying stretched and rigid on his bed for Alex Mair to realize that sleep was unlikely to come. To lie in bed wakeful had always been intolerable to him. He could manage with little sleep but that was invariably sound. Now he swung his legs out of bed, reached for his dressing gown and walked over to the window. He would watch the sun rise over the North Sea. He thought back over the last few hours, the acknowledged relief of talking to Alice, the knowledge that nothing shocked her, nothing surprised her, that everything he did, if not right in her eyes, was judged by a different standard from the one she rigorously applied to the rest of her life. The secret that lay between them, those minutes when he had held her shaking body against the tree trunk and stared into her eyes, compelling obedience, had bound them with a cord so strong that it couldn't be frayed, either by the enormity of their shared guilty secret, or by the small rubs of living together. And yet they had never spoken of their father's death. He didn't know whether Alice ever thought of it, or whether the trauma had erased it from her mind so that she now believed the version he had formulated, had taken the lie into her unconscious and made it her truth. When, quite soon after the funeral, seeing how calm she was, he had imagined that possibility he had been surprised at his reluctance to believe it. He didn't want her gratitude. It was degrading even to contemplate that she would feel an obligation towards him. Obligation and gratitude were words they had never needed to use. But he did want her to know and to remember. The deed was to him so monstrous, so surprising, that it would have been intolerable not to have shared it with a living soul. In those early months he had wanted her to know the magnitude of what he had done and that he had done it for her. And then, six weeks after the funeral, he had suddenly found himself able to believe that it hadn't happened, not in that way, and that the whole horror was a childhood fantasy. He would lie awake at night and see his father's crumbling figure, the leap of blood like a scarlet fountain, would hear the harshly whispered words. In this  revised and comforting version there had been a second of delay, no more, and then he had raced for the house shouting for help. And there was a second and even more admirable fantasy in which he had knelt at his father's side, had pressed his clenched fist hard into the groin, quenching the spurting blood, had whispered reassurance into those dying eyes. It had been too late, of course; but he had tried. He had done his best. The coroner had praised him, that precise little man with his half-moon spectacles, his face like a querulous parrot. ‘I congratulate the deceased's son who acted with commendable promptness and courage and did everything possible to try to save his father's life.’ The relief of being able to believe in his innocence was at first so great that temporarily it overwhelmed him. He had lain in bed night after night drifting into sleep on a tide of euphoria. But he had known, even then, that this self-administered absolution was like a drug in the bloodstream. It was comforting and easy, but it wasn't for him. That way lay a danger more destructive even than guilt. He had told himself: ‘I must never believe that a lie is the truth. I may tell lies all my life if it's expedient but I must know them for what they are and I must never tell them to myself. Facts are facts. I have to accept them and face them and then I can learn how to deal with them. I can look for reasons for what I did and call those reasons excuses; what he did to Alice, how he bullied Mother, how I hated him. I can attempt to justify his death at least to myself. But I did what I did and he died as he died.’ And with that acceptance came a kind of peace. After a few years he was able to believe that guilt itself was an indulgence, that he didn't need to suffer it unless he chose. And then there came a time when he felt a pride in the deed, in the courage, the audacity, the resolution which had made it possible. But that, too, he knew was dangerous. And for years afterwards he hardly thought of his father. Neither his mother nor Alice ever spoke of him except in the company of casual acquaintances who felt the need to utter embarrassed condolences from which there was no escape. But in the family only once was his name mentioned. A year after the death his mother had married Edmund Morgan, a widowed church organist of mind-numbing dullness, and had retired with him to Bognor Regis where they lived on his father's insurance money in a spacious bungalow in sight of the sea, in an obsessive mutual devotion which mirrored the meticulous order and  tidiness of their world. His mother always spoke of her new husband as Mr Morgan. ‘If I don't talk to you about your father, Alex, it isn't that I've forgotten him, but Mr Morgan wouldn't like it.’ The phrase had become a catchword between him and Alice. The conjunction of Morgan's job and his instrument offered endless possibilities of adolescent jokes, particularly when he and -their mother were on honeymoon. ‘I expect Mr Morgan is pulling out all Iris stops.’ ‘Do you suppose Mr Morgan is changing his combinations?’ ‘Poor Mr Morgan, labouring away. I hope he doesn't run out of wind.’ They were wary, reticent children, yet this joke would reduce them to screams of helpless laughter. Mr Morgan and his organ releasing them into hysterical laughter had anaesthetized the horror of the past. And then, when he was about eighteen, reality of another kind intruded itself and he said aloud, ‘I didn't do it for Alice, I did it for myself’, and thought how extraordinary it was that it had taken four years to discover that fact. And yet was it a fact, was it the truth, or was it merely a psychological speculation which in certain moods he found it interesting to contemplate? Now, looking out over the heartland to the eastern sky already flushed with the first faint gold of dawn, he said aloud: ‘I let my father die deliberately. That is a fact. All the rest is pointless speculation.’ In fiction, he thought, Alice and I should have been tormented by our joint knowledge, distrustful, guilt-ridden, unable to live apart yet miserable together. Yet since his father's death there had been nothing between him and his sister but companionship, affection, peace. But now, nearly thirty years later, when he thought he had long come to terms with the deed and his own reaction to it, memory had begun to stir again. It had started with the first Whistler murder. The word ‘murder’ itself constantly on someone's lips, like a sonorous curse, seemed to have the power to evoke those half-suppressed images of his father's face which had become as unclear, as devoid of any life, as an old photograph. But in the last six months his father's image had begun to intrude on his consciousness at odd moments, in the middle of a meeting, across a boardroom table, in a gesture, the droop of an eyelid, the tone of a voice, the line of a speaker's mouth, the shape of fingers splayed to an open fire. His father's ghost had returned in the tangle of late-summer foliage, the first fall of the leaves, the tentative autumn smells. He wondered if the same thing  was happening to Alice. For all their mutual sympathy, for all the sense he had of their being irrevocably bound together, this was the one question he knew he would never ask. And there were other questions, one question in particular, which he had no need to fear from her. She wasn't in the least curious about his sexual life. He knew enough psychology to have at least some insight into what those early shaming and terrifying experiences had done to her. Sometimes he thought that she regarded his affairs with a casual, slightly amused indulgence as if , herself immune to a childish weakness, she was nevertheless indisposed to criticize it in others. Once, after his divorce, she had said: 'l find it extraordinary that a straightforward if inelegant device for ensuring the survival of the species should involve human beings in such emotional turmoil. Does sex have to be taken so seriously?’ And now he found himself wondering whether she knew or guessed about Amy. And then, as the flaming ball rose from the sea, the gears of time slipped, went into reverse and he was back only five days ago lying with Amy in the deep hollow of the dunes, smelling again the scent of sand and grasses and the salt tang of the sea as the late afternoon warmth drained out of the autumn air. He could recall every sentence, every gesture, the timbre of her voice, could feel again the hairs rising on his arms at her touch. She turned towards him, her head propped on her hand, and he saw the strong afternoon light shafting with gold the cropped brightly dyed hair. Already the warmth was draining from the air and he knew that it was time they were moving. But lying there beside her, listening to the susurration of the tide and looking up at the sky through a haze of grasses he was filled, not with post-coital sadness, but with an agreeable languor as if the long-committed Sunday afternoon still stretched ahead of them. It was Amy who said: ‘Look, I'd better be getting back. I told Neil I wouldn't be more than an hour and he gets fussy if I'm late because of the Whistler.’ ‘The Whistler kills at night not in daylight. And he'd hardly venture on the heartland. Too little cover. But Pascoe's right to be concerned. There isn't much danger, but you shouldn't be out alone at night. No woman should until he's caught.’ She said: ‘I wish they would catch him. It'd be one thing less for Neil to worry about.’ Making Iris voice carefully casual, he asked: ‘Doesn't he ever ask where you're going when you sneak out on Sunday afternoons leaving him to look after the child?’ ‘No, he doesn't. And the child is called Timmy. And I don't sneak. I say I'm going and I go.’ ‘But he must wonder.’ ‘Oh, he wonders all right. But he thinks people are entitled to their privacy. He'd like to ask but he never will. Sometimes I say to him, ‘OK, I'm off now to fuck my lover in the sand dunes.'’ But he never says a word, just looks miserable because he doesn't like me saying ‘'fuck'’.' ‘Then why do you? I mean, why torment him? He's probably fond of you.’ ‘No, he isn't, not very fond. It's Timmy he likes. And what other word is there? You can't call it going to bed. I've only been in your bed with you once and then you were as jumpy as a cat thinking that  sister of yours might come back unexpectedly. And you can't say we sleep together.’ He said: ‘We make love. Or, if you prefer it, we copulate.’ ‘Honestly, Alex, that's disgusting. I think that word is really disgusting.’ ‘And do you do it with him? Sleep, go to bed, make love, copulate?’ ‘No, I don't. Not that it’ s any business of yours. He thinks it would be wrong. That means he doesn't really want to. If men want to they usually do.’ He said: 'That has been my experience, certainly.’ They lay side by side like effigies, both staring at the sky. She seemed content not to talk. So the question had at last been put and answered. It had been with shame and some irritation that he had recognized in himself for the first time the nagging of jealousy. More shaming had been his reluctance to put it to the test. And there were those other questions he wanted to ask but daren't. ‘What do I mean to you?’, ‘Is this important?’, ‘What do you expect of me?’ And most important of all, but unanswerable, ‘Do you love me?’ With his wife he had known precisely where he was. No marriage had begun with a more definite understanding of what each required of the other. Their unwritten, unspoken, only half-acknowledged pre-nuptial agreement had needed no formal ratification. He would earn most of the money, she would work if and when she chose. She had never been particularly enthusiastic about her job as interior designer. In return his home would be run with efficiency and reasonable economy. They would take separate holidays at least once every two years; they would have at most two children and at a time of her choosing; neither would publicly humiliate the other; the spectrum of marital offences under this heading ranging from spoiling the other's dinner-party stories to a too-public infidelity. It had been a success. They had liked each other, got on with remarkably little rancour and he had been genuinely upset, if principally in his pride, when she had left him. Fortunately marital failure had been mitigated by the public knowledge of her lover's wealth. He realized that to a materialistic society losing a wife to a millionaire hardly counted as failure. In their friends' eyes it would have been unreasonably proprietorial of him not to have released her with a minimum of fuss. But to do her justice, Liz had loved Gregory, would have followed  transformed laughing face, heard her ruefully apologetic voice. ‘It's the real thing this time, darling. I never expected it and I can still hardly believe it. Try not to feel too badly, it isn't your fault. There's nothing to be done.’ The real thing. So there was this mysterious real thing before which everything went down, obligations, habit, responsibility, duty. And now, lying in the dunes, seeing the sky through the rigid stalks of marram grasses, he thought about it almost with terror. Surely he hadn't found it at last and with a girl less than half his age, intelligent but uneducated, promiscuous and burdened with an illegitimate child. And he didn't deceive himself about the nature of her hold on him. No lovemaking had ever been as erotic or as liberating as their half-illicit couplings on unyielding sand within yards of the crashing tide. Sometimes he would find himself indulging in fantasy, would picture them together in London in his new flat. The flat, as yet unsought, no more than a vague possibility among others, would assume dimensions, location, a horribly plausible reality in which he found himself arranging his pictures carefully on a non-existent wall, thinking over the disposal of his household goods, the exact location of his stereo system. The flat overlooked the Thames. He could see the wide windows giving a view over the river as far as Tower Bridge, the huge bed, Amy's curved body striped with bands of sunlight from the slatted wooden blinds. Then the sweet, deluding pictures would dissolve into bleak reality. There was the child. She would want the child with her. Of course she would. Anyway, who else could look after it? He could see the indulgent amusement on the faces of his friends, the pleasure of his enemies, the child lurching, sticky-fingered, about the flat. He could smell in imagination what Liz had never let him know in actuality — the smell of sour milk and dirty nappies, could picture the dreadful lack of peace and privacy. He needed these realities, deliberately emphasized, to bring him back to sanity. He was horrified that even for a few minutes he could seriously have contemplated such destructive stupidity. He thought: I'm obsessed by her. All right, just for these last few weeks I'll enjoy my obsession. This late summer would be brief enough, the warm unseasonable days of mellow sunshine couldn't last. Already the evenings were darkening. Soon he would smell the first sour tang of winter on the sea breezes. There would be no more lying in the warm  sand dunes. She couldn't visit Martyr's Cottage again, that would be recklessly stupid. It was easy to convince himself that with care, when Alice was in London and no visitors expected, they could be together in his bedroom perhaps even for a whole night, but he knew that he would never risk it. Little on the headland was private for long. This was his St Martin's summer, an autumnal madness, nothing that the first cold of winter couldn't wither. But now she said, as if there had been no period of silence between them, ‘Neil's my friend, OK? Why do you want to talk about him ‘I don't. But I wish he'd civilize his living arrangements. That caravan is in direct line of my bedroom windows. It's an eyesore.’ ‘You'd need binoculars to see it from your windows. And so is your bloody great power station an eyesore. That's in everyone's direct line; we all have to look at that.’ He put out his hand to her shoulder, warm under the gritty film of sand and said with mock pomposity. ‘It's generally agreed that, given the constraints imposed by its function and the site, the power station is rather successful architecturally.’ ‘Agreed by whom?’ ‘I think so for one.’ ‘Well, you would, wouldn't you? Anyway, you ought to be grateful to Neil. If he didn't look after Timmy I wouldn't be here.’ He said: ‘That whole thing is primitive. He's got a wood stove in there, hasn't he? If that blows up you won't last a minute, all three of you, particularly if the door jams.’ ‘We don't lock it. Don't be daft. And we let the fire go out at night. And suppose your place blows up. It won't be just the three of us, will it? Bloody hell it won't. Not only humans either. What about Smudge and Whisky? They've got a point of view.’ ‘It won't blow up. You've been listening to his scaremongering nonsense. If you're worried about nuclear power ask me. I'll tell you what you want to know.’ ‘You mean while you're poking me you'll explain all about nuclear power? Oh boy, I'll certainly be able to take it in.’ And then she turned to him again. The pattern of sand on her shoulder glistened and he felt her mouth moving over his upper lip, his nipples, his belly. And then she knelt over him and the round childish face with its bush of bright hair shut out the sky. Five minutes later she rolled apart from him and began shaking the  sand from her shirt and jeans. Tugging the jeans over her thighs, she said: ‘Why don't you do something about that bitch at Larksoken, the one suing Neil? You could stop her. You're the boss.’ The question — or was it a demand — shocked him out of his fantasy as crudely as if, unprovoked, she had suddenly slapped his face. In their four meetings she had never questioned him about his job, had seldom mentioned the power station except, as on this afternoon, to complain half seriously that it spoilt the view. He hadn't made a deliberate decision to keep her out of his private and professional life. When they were together that life hardly entered into his own consciousness. The man who lay with Amy in the dunes had nothing to do with that burdened, ambitious, calculating scientist who ran Larksoken, nothing to do with Alice's brother, with Elizabeth's ex-husband, with Hilary's ex-lover. Now he wondered, with a mixture of irritation and dismay, whether she had deliberately chosen to ignore those invisible keep-out signs. And if he had been unconfiding, then so had she. He knew little more about her now than when they had first encountered each other in the abbey ruins on a blustery August evening less than six weeks earlier, had for a minute stood and gazed and had then moved silently towards each other in a wordless, amazed recognition. Later that evening she had told him that she came from Newcastle, that her widowed father had remarried and that she and her stepmother couldn't get on. She had moved down to London and lived in squats. It had sounded commonplace enough but he hadn't quite believed it and nor, he suspected, did she care whether or not he did. Her accent was more Cockney than Geordie. He had never asked about the child, partly from a kind of delicacy but mainly because he preferred not to think of her as a mother, and she had volunteered no information about Timmy or his father. She said: ‘Well, why don't you? Like I said, you're the boss.’ ‘Not over my staff's private lives. If Hilary Robarts thinks she has been libelled and seeks redress I can't prevent her from going to law.’ ‘You could if you wanted to. And Neil only wrote what was true.’ ‘That is a dangerous defence to a libel action. Pascoe would be ill advised to rely on it.’ ‘She won't get any money. He hasn't got any. And if he has to pay costs it will ruin him.’ ‘He should have thought of that earlier.’ She lay back with a little thud and for a few minutes they were both  silent. Then she said as casually as if the previous conversation had been trivial small talk which was already half forgotten: ‘What about next Sunday? I could get away late afternoon. OK by you?’ So she bore no grudge. It wasn't important to her, or if it was, she had decided to drop it, at least for now. And he could put from him the treacherous suspicion that their first meeting had been contrived, part of a plan devised by her and Pascoe to exploit his influence with Hilary. But that, surely, was ridiculous. He had only to recall the inevitability of their first coming together, her passionate, uncomplicated, animal gusto in their lovemaking to know that the thought was paranoid. He would be here on Sunday afternoon. It might be their last time together. Already he had half decided that it had to be. He would free himself from this enslavement, sweet as it was, as he had freed himself from Hilary. And he knew, with a regret which was almost as strong as grief, that with this parting there would be no protests, no appeals, no desperate clinging to the past. Amy would accept his leaving as calmly as she had accepted his arrival. He said: ‘OK. About four thirty then. Sunday the twenty-fifth.’ And now time, which in the last ten minutes seemed mysteriously to have halted, flowed again and he was standing at his bedroom window five days later watching the great ball of the sun rise out of the sea to stain the horizon and spread over the eastern sky the veins and arteries of the new day. Sunday the twenty-fifth. He had made that appointment five days ago and it was one that he would keep. But lying there in the dunes he hadn't known what he knew now, that he had another and very different appointment to keep on Sunday, September the twenty-fifth. Shortly after lunch Meg walked across the headland to Martyr's Cottage. The Copleys had gone upstairs to take their afternoon rest and for a moment she wondered whether to tell them to lock their bedroom door. But she told herself that the precaution was surely unnecessary and ridiculous. She would bolt the back door and lock the front door after her as she left and she wouldn't be gone for long. And they were perfectly happy to be left. Sometimes it seemed to her that old age reduced anxiety. They could look at the power station without the slightest premonition of disaster and the horror of the Whistler seemed as much beyond their interest as it was their comprehension. The greatest excitement in their lives, which had to be planned with meticulous care and some anxiety, was a drive into Norwich or Ipswich to shop. It was a beautiful afternoon, warmer than most in the past disappointing summer. There was a gentle breeze and from time to time Meg paused and lifted her head to feel the warmth of the sun and the sweet-smelling air moving against her cheeks. The turf was springy beneath her feet and to the south the abbey stones, no longer mysterious or sinister, gleamed golden against the blue untroubled sea. She did not need to ring. The door at Martyr's Cottage stood open as it often did in sunny weather, and she called out to Alice before, in response to her answering voice, moving down the corridor to the kitchen. The cottage was redolent with the zesty smell of lemon overlaying the more familiar tang of polish, wine and wood smoke. It was a smell so keen that it momentarily brought back the holiday she and Martin had spent in Amalfi, the trudge hand-in-hand up the winding road to the mountain-top, the pile of lemons and oranges by the roadside, putting their noses to those golden, pitted skins, the laughter and the happiness. The image experienced in a flash of gold, a flush of warmth to her face, was so vivid that for a second she hesitated at the kitchen door as if disorientated. Then her vision cleared and she saw the familiar objects, the Aga and the gas stove with the nearby working surfaces, the table of polished oak in the  middle of the room with its four elegantly crafted chairs, and at the far end Alice's office with the walls covered with bookshelves and her desk piled with proofs. Alice was standing working at the table, wearing her long fawn smock. She said: ‘As you can see, I'm making lemon curd. Alex and I enjoy it occasionally and I enjoy making it, which I suppose is sufficient justification for the trouble.’ ‘We hardly ever had it — Martin and I , that is. I don't think I've eaten it since childhood. Mother bought it occasionally as a treat for Sunday tea.’ ‘If she bought it, then you don't know what it ought to taste like.’ Meg laughed and settled into the wicker chair to the left of the fireplace. She never asked if she could help in the kitchen since she knew Alice would be irritated by an offer which she knew to be impractical and insincere. Help was neither needed nor welcomed. But Meg loved to sit quietly and watch. Was it perhaps a memory of childhood, she wondered, that made watching a woman cooking in her own kitchen so extraordinarily reassuring and satisfying. If so, modern children were being deprived of yet one more source of comfort in their increasingly disordered and frightening world. She said: ‘Mother didn't make lemon curd but she did enjoy cooking. It was all very simple, though.’ ‘That's the difficult kind. And I suppose you helped her. I can picture you in your pinafore making gingerbread men.’ ‘She used to give me a piece of the dough when she was making pastry. By the time I'd finished pounding it, rolling it and shaping it, it was dun-coloured. And I used to cut out shaped biscuits. And yes, I did make gingerbread men with currants for their eyes, didn't you?’"
FIC FIC-CCW-002 -1.3 "The Maggot was waiting at the airstrip. He gave me a welcoming grin and an ironic bow to acknowledge the exalted company I was keeping, then he ushered the senator on to the starboard wing and so into the aeroplane. It always seemed miraculous that the Maggot could fit himself into a small aircraft, for John Maggovertski was a huge man: six foot five and well over two hundred pounds, and none of those pounds was fat. I sometimes tried to imagine blocking the Maggot during a game of American football and simply could not. It would be like trying to stop a buffalo, because he was nothing but muscle, weight and bone. For exterior decoration he had a thick black beard, dark eyes, a shock of tousled hair, and weight-lifter's arms that were tattooed with snakes, naked ladies and the twin flags of the USA and the Maggot's home state of Arkansas. He put the senator into one of the back seats, first shoving aside a tangle of camera equipment. Another of John Maggovertski's failing businesses was taking aerial photographs of rich folk's houses. He also refilled air-bottles for scuba divers, ran sports-fishing excursions and, despite his slow left knee, was a good enough tennis player to have been hired as a coach at some of the Lucaya hotels, though the Maggot's career as a tennis coach had been somewhat jeopardised by his insistence on helping only the prettier guests to improve their game. He sporadically published a newsletter about rare firearms, collected guns himself, and was the proud owner of a decrepit fishing boat that was called Bronco-Buster in honour of the Giants' Superbowl victory, though the Maggot himself never referred to the beaten team as the Denver Broncos, but always and ever as the Denver Fairies. The Maggot referred to himself as a ‘good old country boy’ which description provoked Ellen, who could not stand the sight of him, to comment that John Maggovertski was to country what the serpent was to Eden. The Maggot, Ellen insisted, was an untoilet-trained redneck jerk whose only expertise was as a player of the most brutal and mindless  sport to be devised since the lions took on the Christians. The Maggot, faced with these scathing judgments, countered by asserting that Ellen's education had ruined what might otherwise have been a useful bimbo, and loudly proclaimed that her extreme aversion to himself was positive psychological proof that she was secretly enamoured of him. On the whole I found it less tiring to keep the two of them apart. The Maggot now ordered me into the right-hand pilot's seat and told me to keep my thieving hands off his knobs. As he fired up the twin engines I wondered just what instruments had once occupied the vacant holes in the dashboard, from which empty holes there now trailed forlorn scraps of wiring. It was best not to wonder, for I faced a long journey in what remained of the Maggot's plane. We were flying first to Nassau where the senator was to be guest of honour at an American Embassy reception for senior officers of the naval units taking part in Exercise Stingray, and after Nassau the Maggot and I would fly on to Grand Bahama where he lived and where Wavebreaker was docked. ‘Are you sure you don't want us boys to keep you company at the reception, senator?’ John asked. ‘I'd be surely delighted to have your company.’ The senator, ever affable, seemed unworried at the thought of taking the Maggot into polite society. ‘Do I have to wear a tie?’ ‘I guess so. I'll be wearing one.’ ‘Reckon I'll leave the embassy girls to you then, senator,’ the Maggot had to shout over the sound of the engines, ‘and me and Nick will just have to play with each other on account of forgetting to bring our ties.’ He laughed, then frowned at the aircraft's controls as if he was not entirely certain what most of them did. One reason why John's air-taxi service was less than successful was his habit of pretending not to know how to fly the plane or, worse, pretending to have forgotten how to land it once he had succeeded in becoming airborne. The performances made his customers understandably nervous, and nervous customers do not pass on glowing  recommendations to their friends. ‘I suppose we should try and get this hot heap of shit off the ground,’ the Maggot growled now. It was indeed as hot as hell inside the aircraft. We taxied away from the palm-thatched hut that was proudly styled as Straker's Cay Airport Terminal Number One. The hut was home to some lizards and to the island's one taxi driver who had sequestered it as his office and gasoline store. The airstrip itself had been built to serve a golf and diving resort that a consortium of Dutch and American businessmen had planned to build on Straker's Cay, but the money had run out before the hotel or marina had been built and all that was left of their grandiose plans was this pinkish runway made of compacted coral and a few abandoned cement mixers which rusted forlornly where the hotel's swimming pool was to have been built. The Maggot, who refused to wear a seat belt, shoved his throttles forward, and I felt the sweat trickling down my belly as the brakes were released and the small plane thundered down the rough surface. ‘It plays hell with the tyres, senator!’ The Maggot yelled over the howling engine noise. ‘What does?’ The senator shouted back. ‘Runways made of crushed coral! As likely as not we'll blow a tyre, slew off, and become three small puddles of melted fat in a blackened and twisted plane wreck!’ The senator blanched and leaned back. I had heard it all before and so was a little more sanguine. The Maggot, pleased to have spoilt someone's day, pulled back the stick and we liked safely off the runway and there was suddenly a wonderful rush of cool air coming from an overhead vent. We banked over Bonefish's house and I waved at Thessy who was standing beside Masquerade . Thessy would follow on the weekend ferry, arriving at Grand Bahama on the same day as the senator's twins. The Maggot's Beechcraft clawed higher, its progress punctuated by the alarm sirens that the Maggot ignored and which the senator had learned not to worry about. Once, when an alarm became peculiarly insistent, the Maggot thumped the  instrument panel until it stopped. ‘I think that goddamn racket means we should all be dead,’ he announced cheerfully, then carried on with an involved story of how he had once won undying glory by intercepting a pass against the Philadelphia Faggots. In the senator the Maggot had found a listener who was only too eager to hear his tales of goal-line stands and blocked punts, concussed running backs and sacked quarterbacks. The one subject we did not talk about was why the senator had flown to Straker's Cay to meet me. I knew the Maggot was dying to hear the senator's business, but even the Maggot had enough delicacy to wait until we had safely delivered the senator to Nassau before asking. But once Crowninshield was gone, and when we had refuelled the Beechcraft and put a crate of beer on to one of her back seats, the Maggot demanded to know everything. I suspected that he was hoping to hear that the senator had been arranging for an illicit love affair on board Wavebreaker . We had embarked two such affairs in the last year; the most memorable being an English lawyer who had arrived with his French mistress, but only after telling his wife that he was attending a legal conference in Brussels and, to preserve the lie, he had been forced to hide every inch of his pallid skin in case a sun-tan betrayed him. The French girl, to Thessy's infinite embarrassment, had strolled stark naked about Wavebreaker 's deck while the lawyer had cowered in the stateroom cloaked like an Ayatollah with impetigo. The Maggot, disappointed that the senator's business offered no such rich pickings of gossip, scowled at me. ‘You mean you're just babysitting two rich junkies?’ ‘You've got it.’ ‘Shee-it.’ We had at last taken off from Nassau and were banking north to where three American warships sliced white water. I opened us each a beer, then idly unfolded the aviation chart that the Maggot had stuck down between our seats. It looked very different to a nautical chart and made little sense to me, but I gradually deciphered some of the meaning from its weird markings. ‘You ain't going to have fun,’ the Maggot said suddenly. ‘I'm sorry?’ ‘You ain't going to have fun with two goddamn cocaine addicts. That stuff is the hardest to kick.’ ‘So the senator told me.’ ‘And there ain't no magic pill that will do it.’ Maggovertski sounded unusually sombre. He lit a cigarette. ‘I hate cocaine,’ he said finally, and he surprised me by saying it for the Maggot had always struck me as one of life's rebels. If he discovered a new rule he would immediately seek a way of breaking it, and I had assumed that he would have some sympathy with those who flouted the laws against drugs, yet there was no denying the genuine anger in his voice when he talked of cocaine. He must have sensed my puzzlement, for he offered a reluctant explanation. ‘I knew a girl who got hooked on cocaine. She taught in a health club; aerobics, that kind of thing, and the next we knew she was wearing hot pants on a street corner in New York and strutting her stuff at the cars. Jesus, if you knew how hard we tried to get her off that damned powder.’ ‘Did you succeed?’ He paused, and finally shook his head. ‘Last time I saw her she was doing a peep-show in Pittsburgh. Hell, Nick, I tried to get her out of that place, but she didn't care. All she wanted to do was shovel that crap up her nose, and if that's how someone wants to pass their time, then there's diddly-squat you can do to stop them.’ He had sounded immensely sad as he spoke, and I wondered if the girl had meant more to him than being merely a casual friend, but I did not like to ask and Maggovertski was clearly disinclined to explain more, so I just stared down at the aerial chart, and I suddenly noticed, in an otherwise empty space beneath an intersection of two air corridors, the tiny island of Murder Cay. The chart, either printed before the government's name change or else blithely ignoring it, noted the existence of a 2500-foot paved airstrip. ‘Is 2500 feet long for a runway?’ I asked Maggot. ‘Two five? Short as a quarterback's dick.’ He was evidently still thinking of the girl, for the obscenity was automatic and his voice was clipped and distant. ‘Have you ever flown into Murder Cay?’ I asked him. The big shaggy head turned to look at me. He frowned and sucked on his cigarette and I somehow got the impression that my question had annoyed him, but when he answered his voice was mild enough. ‘It's a snakepit, Nick. Leave it alone.’ ‘So who are the snakes?’ I insisted. ‘The dickheads who bought the place, of course.’ He paused to pull on his beer bottle which, emptied, he tossed out through the tiny triangular window at his left elbow. ‘I ran a couple of passengers there before the dickheads bought the island. It was a real nice place two years ago; nothing but luxury houses for the super-rich, but then the snakes bought it and they've painted a big yellow cross on their runway. You know what a big yellow cross on a runway means? It means keep away if you want to go on living.’ ‘So who are the new owners?’ I tried again. ‘Never been introduced to them, Nick.’ ‘Drug people?’ ‘Of course!’ The Maggot assumed I had already known that. I looked down at the chart and saw that the island was not so very far off our course, and I knew that the Beechcraft was brim-full with fuel. ‘You fancy having a look at the island?’ The Maggot laughed. ‘What's made you feel suicidal? Did you get bored with waiting for Ellen to drop her panties?’ ‘I'm just curious,’ I said with as much innocence as I could muster, ‘but of course, if you're scared of the place…’ ‘Oh, damn you.’ I had reckoned that an accusation of fear would sting the Maggot, and even before he interrupted me he had banked the plane westwards. He snatched the chart off my lap and worked out a crude course for the remote island. ‘So why do you want to stir the bastards up?’ he grumbled. I told him about Hirondelle and how Deacon Billingsley had lied about the yacht's fate, and I confessed that though  there was nothing I could do about a corrupt policeman, nor about what I strongly suspected had been the murder of a yacht's crew, I was still curious about the island. ‘Billingsley's a bastard.’ The Maggot, who had lived long enough in the Bahamas to learn and relish all the important gossip, growled the verdict. ‘You want to stay upwind of him.’ ‘McIllvanney says that Billingsley owns a house on Murder Cay.’ ‘That figures,’ the Maggot said gloomily. ‘The dickheads know that the best way of keeping the Americans off their backs is by buying themselves a slice of the local law.’ His disgruntled voice made it seem as though the precautions of the drug smugglers formed a personal affront to his patriotism. Yet if anyone's patriotism should have been affronted by what happened in the islands, it was the Bahamians, for they were forced to endure the indignity of having another nation's law-enforcement agencies operating in their waters. The islands had always been a smugglers' paradise, and had proved a perfect place to stockpile cocaine before running it across the narrow Straits of Florida to the waiting American markets. The American government had pressed the Bahamians to clean out the drug lords, but instead the trade had flourished until the Americans finally insisted that their own coastguard be allowed to patrol Bahamian waters. A scintilla of Bahamian pride was preserved by the presence of a native officer on every American boat or helicopter, but no one really believed the polite fiction that the local officer was thus in command. ‘But we ain't in command either,’ the Maggot said sourly. ‘We can stop a boat at sea, but we sure as hell can't put a foot on dry land without Bahamian permission. And you can bet your pretty ass that your policeman friend is making sure that permission to search Murder Cay is never given, or if it is, that the guys on the island are well warned before our boys get anywhere near.’ ‘We?’ It was so incongruous to hear the Maggot aligning  himself with the forces of law that I was forced to ask the question. ‘Our boys?’ ‘I keep thinking of that girl in Pittsburgh,’ he said with a bitter ruefulness, ‘and how the bastards who run the peep-show have to put sawdust on the booth floors every hour. You don't get much lower than that, Nick, and if anyone wants to kick the balls of the people who put her there, then those are my guys.’ He paused to light another cigarette, then nodded through his scratched windscreen. ‘I reckon that's your snakepit, Nick.’ Far ahead, and blurred by the heat haze, there was a bright green dot of an island ringed by coral-fretted water. No other land was visible. The Maggot turned in his seat and rummaged in his camera bag until he found a battered Nikon and a roll of black and white film. ‘Take some pictures for me. You never know, some customer might want a snap of Murder Cay one day.’ By the time I had loaded the camera we were already close to the reefs that formed the Devil's Necklace. The shadow of our plane skipped across the bright sea, then flickered over the outer coral. We were approaching the island from the south-east, coming with the wind at a height of six thousand feet. The island was shaped rather like an anchor. The airstrip, with its unfriendly yellow cross that warned strange aircraft from landing, had been built across the curved flukes of the anchor, which otherwise seemed to be covered in low scrub, slash pine and sea-grape. The surprisingly big houses were all built on the western side of the north-south shank of the anchor that was thick with palm trees and vivid with bright blue swimming pools. The rest of the shank was a long narrow golf course, punctuated with sand traps. I twisted in the seat to see that there were a dozen or so boats moored in the protected crook of the easternmost anchor fluke. The Maggot dipped the starboard wing to let me take a picture of the deep water channel that dog-legged in from the west. We flew above the skeletal radio mast and I stared down at the row of huge houses. No one and nothing stirred there. ‘They spent a fortune developing the place,’ the Maggot said, ‘but the rich folks never came, so they sold it to the rich dickheads instead.’ We flew out across the northern reefs. ‘One more pass?’ I asked John. ‘Why not?’ ‘And a bit lower?’ ‘Yeah, maybe.’ He had turned to fly around the eastern edge of the island's encircling reefs and was now staring intently at the houses, searching for any signs of danger, but it seemed as though Murder Cay was deserted. ‘What the hell,’ the Maggot said, and he wrenched the plane round in a tight turn until we were aimed plumb at the island's southernmost tip, then he dropped the nose ready to make one high speed and low level pass above the Cay. ‘That's friendly!’ he shouted over the engine noise, and he pointed through the windscreen at the concrete airstrip which not only had the yellow cross painted huge at its western end, but also had two trucks parked in its centre line, thus making it impossible for any plane to land. Despite the obstructions it was clear that aircraft did use the runway, for it was marked by the black rubber streaks of fresh tyre marks, but the two trucks, together with the yellow cross, were evidence that the runway could only be used by invitation. We slashed across the shank of the island, then we were over the anchorage and I had a glimpse of a sailing boat's shadow black on the bed of the lagoon before our own winged shadow whipped across a gaggle of powerboats. We were going too fast to see any details of the moored vessels so I just snapped a random photograph and, at the very same instant, the Maggot swore and banked and rammed the throttles hard forward. We were side-slipping, starboard wing down, falling to earth with our engines howling. I flailed for support as the camera flew up to the padded ceiling. The Maggot whooped, dragged the stick back and our earthwards wing lifted and suddenly we were screaming just above the palm trees, close to the tiled roofs and at a speed that seemed to be doubled  because of our proximity to the ground. The camera, re-entering the world of normal gravity, dropped hard beside my shoes. Beer bottles were everywhere. One broke, shattering liquid across the side windows. I had a glimpse of a fair-haired girl staring wide-eyed and terrified from a tennis court, her racket held loose by her side and tennis balls scattered at her feet and, though the trees and buildings and gardens were nothing but a high-speed blur, my mind nevertheless registered with a startling clarity that the girl had been completely naked. The plane's engines were screaming. We whipped over the northernmost house, across the beach, and thus out to sea again. ‘What the hell?’ I managed to ask. ‘They fired at us! goddamn tracer bullets! Jesus!’ The Maggot did not seem scared, but rather stung by the challenge. We were over the lagoon now, racing towards the northern strands of the Devil's Necklace, but low enough so that the wash of our twin propellers was whipping the blue water into a wake of white-hazed foam. ‘Shee-it!’ The Maggot said with inappropriate exultation, then twisted his head to stare back at the island. ‘Let's go see them again!’ ‘Are you sure that's wise?’ I asked, but I might as well have saved my breath because the plane suddenly climbed, banked, then began descending fast towards the island again. The Maggot was growling to himself, relishing the confrontation. Sunlight reflected from a window among the palm trees to lance a sliver of dazzling light at our cockpit, then the reflection was gone and we were at sea level, engines screaming, and I fumbled for the camera, prayed it had not broken when it fell from the ceiling, and took another picture just before Maggot lifted the aircraft's nose so that we swooped up and over the palm trees that edged the beach. He jinked left, then right, throwing the plane into such steep and sudden turns that I was alternately jerked hard against the cockpit's side window and then against his broad shoulder. The Maggot was not taking evasive action but quartering the ground in search of our enemy. ‘There!’ he said abruptly and threw the plane straight again, but this time  dropping the nose, and I saw a jeep churning dust from the dirt road which ran the length of the island's long shank, between the golf course and the houses, and just as I saw the jeep so the red tracer bullets began climbing from a machine-gun mounted in the back of the vehicle. ‘Oh, Jesus wept,’ I said, snapped a last picture, then ducked down in momentary expectation of the windscreen shattering into a million bright scraps. ‘Fuck you,’ the Maggot screamed at whoever fired at him and I looked out of the Beechcraft's side window to see palm trees going past at over 150 miles an hour and above us. Above us. Truly. And I thought it really had been a very good life, a fun life, despite Ellen never having gone to bed with me, and I wondered if my father would even notice my death, then the Maggot whooped with glee, hauled back on the stick, and our plane was screaming up into the wide blue lovely bullet-free sky and the Maggot was laughing and slapping my shoulder. ‘Wasn't that just the best goddamned fun you can have this side of a blanket?’ ‘Was it?’ ‘You missed it?’ He sounded aggrieved and astonished. ‘Missed what?’ ‘I ran that turkey clean off the road! Shit, but I gave that bastard a headache!’ ‘I think you gave me one too,’ I said, then, very gingerly, I straightened up and twisted round to see that Murder Cay was far behind us and well out of machine-gun range. ‘You're mad,’ I courteously informed John Maggovertski. He laughed. ‘You're the one who wanted to see the island.’ We were gently circling northwards now, heading for home. ‘So now you've seen it.’ I tried to relax, letting the cold air from the vent cool the sweat from my face. My right hand shook as I remembered the sudden fear of seeing the crimson tracer flick up from the ground. ‘Hell!’ I protested. ‘They can't just open fire!’ The Maggot grinned through the black tangle of his beard. ‘Nick, they are richer than your wettest dreams, and like all the very rich they think they are above the law.’ He was speaking very casually, but I saw that his right hand, like mine, was shaking. It is not pleasant to be shot at, and even the pleasure of being missed is spoilt by the mind's habit of constructing alternative scenarios; if the machine-gunner had been a bit quicker to react, or had led us with more skill, we would now be nothing but a heap of molten metal somewhere in the sea-grape. The Maggot shook his head. ‘Do you have any idea just how rich these people are?’ ‘Very, I imagine.’ ‘There's an island not far from here that has just two thousand inhabitants, and last year, Nick, according to a banker I sometimes fly to Miami, those two thousand dirt poor and unemployed islanders deposited 24.3 million dollars in the one and only bank on their impoverished little island.’ The Maggot laughed. ‘Not bad, eh? And I do not believe that 24.3 million dollars a year is the average reward for selling coconut milk and conch shells to honky tourists. That money is pure commission, Nick, a mere ten per cent of the value of the cocaine that was stored on their island while it awaited transportation to the good old US of A; and neither you, nor I, nor even the dickheads in the Drug Enforcement Administration will ever know just how much money was not put in the bank, but stored in paper bags under the bed.’ He sounded depressed by the thought, but then cheered himself up by asking me for a beer. I opened two bottles that I retrieved from the sticky mess on the cabin floor. We flew the rest of the way home in silence. It was not till we saw the captive aerostat balloon with its ever watching radar that the Americans had hoisted over Grand Bahama to probe for boats or aircraft smuggling drugs, that the Maggot again spoke, and by then he had recaptured all his old insouciance. ‘At this time, if you'd care to fold up your tray table and extinguish your hopes, we shall land this little sucker. Thank you for flying Maggovertski Airways; please return the stewardess her pantyhose, put her in the  upright position, and kindly pray that the tyres don't blow.’ They did not, and thus I came back to Wavebreaker . I went back to the Maggot's foul house, where he kept his killer dog and astonishing collection of guns, and we sat on his makeshift verandah that overlooked a noxious and polluted creek and shared a few whiskies as he told me an incredibly tedious tale of how he had once sacked the quarterback of the San Francisco Sugar Plums. I retaliated with detailed instructions on how to bowl off-breaks to left-handers on a drying pitch, and we eventually declared a truce as we watched the sun sink across the oil-storage tanks beyond the creek. He offered me his spare bed for the night, but I could not stand the stench of the creek, and I wanted to make an early start on the work I had to do on Wavebreaker , so I caught the bus to McIllvanney's boatyard. Naturally no one was there and the gate was locked and the top of the fence was rimmed with razor-wire so I could not climb it. I had not kept my old key, because I had hoped that my association with Cutwater Charters was done, so I was forced to carry my heavy pack into the tangle of dark alleys that lay behind the straw market and where I planned to find Ellen and borrow her key. A tribe of stray cats scattered as I turned into the yard where Ellen's apartment lay. The archway was bright with the brass plates of the dozens of corporations who were registered at the address to avoid paying tax in their home countries. The courtyard was inhabited by three tethered goats that stared malevolently at me. The open-air stairways were shadowed with creepers and flickering with the eerie lights of televisions that glowed from within the screened windows of the small apartments. I climbed the two flights of stairs and walked down the rickety balcony which led to Ellen's small end room. A child was screaming in one of the flats, while two dogs were snarling as they fought in the wasteland beyond the apartment house. The chorus of televisions was tuned to an American game show in which competing families were leaping up and  down and screaming with apparent incontinence because they had won a trip to Disneyworld. Then, above all those discordant sounds, I heard Ellen's voice rise in sudden indignation. ‘No! No! No!’ I stopped outside her open window. Her room was lit by a single naked bulb which hung from the ceiling and shone harshly on Ellen who was standing in the doorway of her tiny bathroom. She was facing the window, but did not see me beyond its screen because she was staring at Matthew McIllvanney who seemed to fill the whole room with his malevolence. ‘I'm just asking you to think about it,’ I heard him say in a calm voice. ‘I've thought’— I could see Ellen was trying hard to recover her composure —‘and the answer is no.’ ‘Six hundred.’ McIllvanney's persistence in the face of any refusal was monotonous and relentless. ‘And I won't even take my usual commission on that, so you'll get to keep it all, and remember the agreed price is just a guaranteed minimum and there's always a tip. Isn't there always a tip, Bellybutton?’ ‘This one's a big tipper, Miss Ellen.’ Bellybutton laughed suggestively. He was standing just inside the front door and was thus hidden from me. ‘Shut up, you black bastard,’ McIllvanney snapped, then paused to light a cigarette. A small battery-powered fan whirled the smoke away and generally tried to stir up the humid air which played such havoc with Ellen's precious books in their orange-crate shelves. The Ulsterman blew smoke towards her. ‘Breakspear won't do the senator's cruise,’ he said, ‘so you'll lose that money, but if you work one night a week for me then you'll earn just as much anyway. And you're wanting to save money, isn't that right? So you can keep yourself while you write your book? So I'm offering you a good wage, girl! And this client's a good-looking fellow, isn't that right, Bellybutton? And he's already seen you, he likes you, and he's willing to pay you a professional's fee even though he knows you're an amateur, and —‘ ‘No!’ Ellen shouted again. ‘He might go to seven-fifty,’ McIllvanney said dubiously, as though the price was the only possible objection Ellen might have to whoring herself. That was as far as the conversation went, for I decided to end it by pushing open the screen door. All three stared in astonishment as I tossed my kit bag on to the floor. ‘I didn't have a key to the boatyard,’ I introduced myself, ‘so I thought I'd borrow Ellen's. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?’ ‘You are not, Nick, no!’ Ellen almost flew across the small room and, to my astonishment and probably to everyone else's, greeted me with a warm kiss. ‘What the hell are you doing here?’ McIllvanney asked sourly, while Bellybutton just grinned maliciously at me. ‘You sent the senator to see me? So he came, he saw, and he conquered me, which means I've agreed to do his charter. The Maggot flew me back, because if we want to leave on Sunday morning then we've got a heap of work to do first. God, I'm hungry.’ Ellen still clung to my arm. ‘We'll go out and eat,’ she said quickly, ‘I'll get ready,’and she twisted away to the bathroom, which also served as her wardrobe, and slammed the door to leave me alone with McIllvanney and Bellybutton. ‘If the suggestion I heard just now,’ I said to McIllvanney, ‘was what I thought it was, then don't make it again. Not to Ellen.’ McIllvanney found my defiance wonderfully amusing. ‘Who's to stop me.’ ‘Just me.’ He came and stood very close to me, trying to intimidate me as Billingsley had done. He blew cigarette smoke to sting my eyes. ‘Just because you were a poxy marine, your Holiness, doesn't make you tough.’ ‘Piss off.’ That also amused him. ‘Is there something going on between you and Ellen, now? Got your boots under her table, have you?’ ‘No,’ I said firmly, ‘so get out.’ ‘Did you know she's a Catholic?’ he asked me as though it really mattered, and he gestured with his cigarette at a crucifix that hung over the narrow bed, which I knew was there solely for sentimental purposes because it had belonged to Ellen's dead father, but to McIllvanney it was a challenge. ‘If I'd realised she was a taig I'd never have hired her.’ He used the Ulster slang, knowing I would have learned it during my tours of duty on attachment in Belfast. ‘Is it the papist meat that gets you going, Breakspear, is that it?’ McIllvanney laughed, then stepped quickly back as he sensed I might bring my knee up into his balls. Then, as if counter-attacking, he jabbed the cigarette towards my face. ‘I'll do business how I like, with whom I like, and when I like, and I don't need your focking permission to do it, Nicholas Breakspear. Nor does the girl have to agree to anything I ask. I'm not forcing her, I'm merely making a business proposition. Do you understand me?’ ‘Get out of here,’ I said. McIllvanney continued to stare into my eyes, but he spoke to Bellybutton who was cackling behind me. ‘He should have put on a pair of tights and joined his daddy in front of the fairy-lights.’ The Ulsterman's scorn was like a blowtorch, then he turned away, clicked his fingers at Bellybutton, and the two of them were gone. Ellen and I did not go out to eat. She was too shocked by McIllvanney's offer and, at the same time, she was paradoxically surprised at herself for being so shocked. ‘I really thought I could handle something like that! I really did! I knew I wasn't in danger, because they weren't going to rape me, but it really, really upset me!’ ‘It upset me,’ I said. ‘Shit!’ Ellen was too angry with herself to be assuaged by or even interested in my sympathy. She paced up and down the tiny room while I sat on her bed, and she explained to me that McIllvanney had been approached by a client who had apparently seen Ellen and authorised McIllvanney to offer her the money. McIllvanney had made the offer very dispassionately, but that businesslike approach only seemed to add to  Ellen's fury. ‘What kind of a jerk pays that money?’ she asked me. ‘A rich and randy jerk?’ I suggested, and decided not to tell her that for most of McIllvanney's girls six or seven hundred dollars a night was small change. ‘And get this.’ She whirled on me. ‘This jerk has got something about redheads! Rut before he'd pay any money he had to be satisfied that I was red-haired all over! I mean, Jesus! How nauseating can you get?’ ‘Who was he?’ ‘McIllvanney wouldn't say.’ She shuddered, then plucked some typed sheets of paper from the small table under the window and stuffed them into a folder. The floor was crowded with cardboard boxes that were filled with leaflets for the Literacy Project that Ellen helped in her spare time. I idly picked up one of the leaflets which had two pictures on its cover; the first illustration showed a happy black family, all neatly dressed and reading books around a table that was filled with platefuls of food and with jugs labelled ‘milk’. The second picture, clearly designed to demonstrate the rewards of illiteracy, showed a scabby-looking native dressed in a threadbare loincloth who crouched in the mud outside a grass hut and who seemed to be sharing his lunch bowl with a baboon. Ellen caught my eye, looked down at the ridiculous leaflet, and suddenly we both began to laugh helplessly. ‘I know they're absurd.’ She had tears in her eyes as she tried to recover from the laughter. ‘They were printed for Africa sometime in the 1950s and the United Nations sent them to our project, God knows why. There are too many to throw away all at once, so I take a handful out every day and hide them in someone's garbage can. They make rotten toilet paper, and I don't know what else to do with them, and, oh Nick’— she suddenly sat heavily beside me on the bed —‘you're a good man and sometimes I think how nice it would be to have a good man in my life again.’ ‘I'm available.’ She kissed me on the nose, but then, as though rejecting her  idea of adopting a good man, stood up briskly. ‘You reek of cheap whisky. I suppose you've been with that awful Mug-govertski?’ ‘He sends his most fervent and undying love.’ She mocked that assertion with a grimace. ‘If you want a sandwich there's some margarine and foul cheese in the cupboard and some not very fresh bread in the bin.’ ‘You're sure you don't want to go out to eat?’ She shook her head. ‘I want to write up my notes.’ ‘About what happened tonight?’ I sounded surprised. ‘Sure, why not? But I need a shower first.’ She went into the bathroom and I made my own supper by slicing some of the foul cheese and shoving it between two slices of greased plastic bread. Then I ate the sandwich as I walked back to Wavebreaker . Alone. Ellen was perversely unhappy about the Crowninshield charter. She had nagged me to accept it, but now she behaved as though I had done her a disservice by doing so. ‘The senator obviously just wants us to drown his children so they can't embarrass him when the time comes to run for President,’ she told me next morning. ‘I accused him of that,’ I said, proud of having anticipated Ellen's diagnosis, ‘and he told me he'd rather lose the election than lose his children.’ Ellen put down her cup of coffee and stared at me as though I had gone completely mad. ‘He's a politician, Nick,’ she said at last, and in a voice she might have used to reason with a three-year-old, ‘and politicians would sell their mothers, let alone their kids, to win an election. He's just using us!’ I shrugged, but said nothing. Ellen had bought some melon and coffee on her way to the boatyard and we were eating a late breakfast in Wavebreaker 's cockpit. Bellybutton was pressure-hosing a hull across the yard, while McIllvanney was evidently taking another day off. I hoped that he was avoiding us because he felt ashamed of his offer to Ellen, but I doubted whether Matthew McIllvanney had ever felt ashamed of anything. ‘God!’ Ellen said in a tone which implied that I had entirely misunderstood the senator's motives, which she would now have to explain to me by the application of sound feminist arguments. Sound feminist argument usually means making the nearest male look like an idiot, which in Ellen's case was not a very demanding task. ‘We are talking about a man's image, Nicholas. If he runs for President next year then he's got to be clean, and that means that the issue of his drug-sodden kids will have to be defused. And above all, he's got to keep Rickie out of prison, and that's clearly our job. We have to clean the boy up so the judge will merely tap his wrist.’ ‘Is that so bad?’ I demanded. ‘I just don't like being used by rich politicians,’ Ellen said angrily, though I silently noted she had no objections to taking their money. ‘At least we'll be taking two kids off drugs,’ I said warmly, ‘and that's something to be proud of.’ ‘Jesus wept’'she said in disgust. ‘I do hate goddamn junkies, and I especially hate rich goddamn junkies. They don't even have the excuse of poverty for their addiction.’ ‘I'm sorry,’ I said. I don't know why I apologised because it was not my fault that the Crowninshield twins were cocaine freaks, nor that their father wanted to charter Wavebreaker , but I sympathised with Ellen's distaste for cocaine and was foolish enough to say as much. ‘Don't be so downright stupid, Nick,’ Ellen witheringly rejected my sympathy. ‘Of course I don't disapprove of cocaine. You forget that I was an academic.’ I tried to work out an obvious connection between scholarship and cocaine and could not, but knew better than to ask. ‘But you can't possibly approve of drugs,’ I said instead. ‘I neither approve nor disapprove. Cocaine is merely a recreational drug and, taken to excess, like alcohol or nicotine, it is undoubtedly dangerous, but judiciously used it can be a source of harmless pleasure, and even of intellectual stimulation. Eat your melon, it's good for you.’ ‘I don't believe this.’ I stared in genuine horror at her. I  was trying to imagine a girl in a Pittsburgh peep-show, put there by cocaine. ‘Did you feed that kind of intellectual garbage to your students?’ I asked Ellen. She stared defiantly across the cockpit table at me. ‘Nicholas Breakspear,’ she said at last, ‘there are times when you can be excessively tedious. You are a turkey —’ she cast about for an even worse insult, ‘a puritan!’ ‘Rickie Crowninshield,’ I said stiffly, ‘has already lost the sight of one eye because of cocaine, and if he doesn't stop using the drug then he will almost certainly go to jail or even kill himself with an overdose.’ ‘So Rickie Crowninshield is an irresponsible idiot,’ Ellen said coldly, ‘but you can't run society on the assumption that everyone is a retard, and you have to accept that there will be casualties in a free society. If you're so intent on keeping the young alive then why don't you ban rock climbing? Or surfing? Or motorcycles? Or alcohol? Or have you forgotten that America did once try to ban alcohol, and look what happened!’ Her voice was scathing. ‘The vaunted land of the free became the last best hope of organised crime, and it has never recovered. The clear and obvious course for America is to legalise cocaine so the trade can be controlled, but there is no way that we shall ever persuade the airheads in Congress of that most obvious piece of wisdom. If you don't want the melon, I do.’ ‘But you do believe the trade should be controlled?’ I was seeking a scrap of common ground on which we could mutually back away from the argument. ‘I naturally believe that the financial profits of the drug-suppliers are offensive,’ Ellen said, ‘which is why I've only used cocaine on a handful of occasions. I can't say I liked it much.’ She poured out the last of the coffee, then looked up into my horrified eyes. ‘Oh, come on, Nick! Don't be so innocent! And stop worrying, I won't reveal my views on the drug to the twins. The poor dim little creatures doubtless need all the help they can get, and I promise not to confuse them with anything so threatening as an idea.’ ‘Robin-Anne's not dim,’ I said. ‘She passed her degree!’ ‘My dear Nicholas, a mentally retarded slug could get a degree in Liberal Arts! For God's sake, the silly little twinkle might as well have majored in handwriting or media studies!’ Ellen gave me a dismissive glance. ‘Still, I suppose to the uneducated even a degree in Liberal Arts is impressive.’ Cocaine thus became another of the subjects which Ellen and I decorously avoided, like the existence of God, the wisdom of my having been a marine, feminism and the cartoons in the New Yorker . Ellen was adamantly opposed to the first two and a noisy supporter of the last two, while my position was more or less the opposite. God alone knew why we wanted to sail to New Zealand together, except that in a strange way we were friends. But for the moment we were friends who had to prepare Wavebreaker for a possible Atlantic crossing. Thessy and I would have a chance to strengthen the rigging during our two-week trial period with the twins, but some jobs simply could not be done at sea. Thus I stripped out all Wavebreaker 's unnecessary furniture and equipment, and I installed extra fresh-water tanks and fuel bunkers. I made storm shields for the big cabin windows and skylights. They were a delight for the charterers in the Bahamian lagoons, but in an Atlantic storm such wide windows could be our death warrants for if Wavebreaker fell off a big wave the glass could be driven out of the windows and the boat be filling with water in seconds, and so I cut and shaped sheet steel shutters that could be bolted over the boat's glass at the first sign of bad weather. The shutters' anchor points had to be welded to the hull and, especially at the stern where the windows wrapped round Wavebreaker 's counter, the bolts looked intrusive and ugly, but better that than to be a good-looking boat fifty fathoms down and still sinking. Ellen and I worked hard that week and, on the Saturday, as though to commiserate with ourselves on this being our last day alone together, we stopped work at midday and took a bus to Mama Sipcott's Café on the beach where we ate lobster and  drank too much of Mama's sticky-sweet white wine. Ellen proposed a toast to the prospect of her first Atlantic crossing under sail. I drank to the toast, though I was not at all sure that we would actually make the crossing in Wavebreaker . The best season for an eastwards voyage was already past, though it was just possible that we might run far north and cross in the high latitudes where, even in summer, we could expect fog, rain and cold. I knew Ellen hated the cold, and I tried to warn her of the conditions we might expect in those latitudes. I told her of the big green seas, all crinkled and slow, heaving up astern as the icy wind scoured their tops into freezing spume. Ellen smiled at my enthusiastic description. ‘My poetic and romantic Nick.’ She cocked her head on one side and gave me a long scrutiny, almost as though she had never seen me before. ‘You did inherit a lot from your father.’ ‘You'll find that northern seas are oddly more threatening’— I ignored her insult —‘because sunlight on water always makes it seem less formidable. But if we travel the northern route we probably won't see the sun for weeks, and the daylight is grey and the sea is green and grey, while at night you just see the cold white wavetops hissing out of blackness. It seemed curious to be describing such ice-cold seas while sitting in a palm-thatched Bahamian beach café that looked on to a shoreline where pelicans perched under the diamond-hard sun. ‘You'll need long johns,’ I went on gleefully, ‘and thermal underwear and layers of greasy-wool sweaters and good oilies and a woolly hat and a towelling scarf to stop the seas slopping down your neck and good sea-boots and as many pairs of gloves as you can find, because gloves never stay dry and —‘ ‘Shut up,’ Ellen said firmly. ‘I thought you wanted to go.’ ‘I do, and I shall go. But I also want to enjoy the anticipation of going.’ I smiled. ‘Just pray we don't get a North Atlantic fog, because in those latitudes we could roll in the swells for days, with the moisture beading the shrouds and the air as cold as charity, and always being terrified that a super-tanker will barrel out of the muck at full speed to thump you under her bows without even knowing you were ever there.’ Ellen borrowed the adjustable spanner that Mama Sipcott provided as a lobster-claw cracker. ‘Don't come the Ancient Mariner with me, Nicholas Breakspear.’ She opened a claw and pulled out a sliver of succulent flesh. ‘If we encounter fog over the North Atlantic we will turn on the radar, switch on the Satnav, and start the engines. These are the 1980s, not the twelfth century when your namesake was Pope. He wasn't even a very good Pope.’ ‘He was excellent!’ I protested. ‘Authoritative, unimaginative, anti-Irish, and a lousy politician,’ Ellen commented, then she smiled and pushed the lobster meat into my mouth. ‘God knows why I like you, Nicholas Breakspear.’ ‘Because of my sexy legs,’ I assured her. She laughed. Mama Sipcott's butter sauce was gleaming on her chin and she looked very beautiful. Beauty, I thought, was something to do with the way a face betrayed character. She seemed oblivious to my scrutiny. ‘I suppose I like you,’ she said after a moment's thought, ‘because you lack guile. You remind me of a cocker spaniel I once owned.’ ‘Oh, woof-woof. Thanks a million.’ She made a face at me. ‘You'd prefer to be villainous?’ I nodded. ‘I've always wanted to be mysterious and a little bit sinister and have girls swoon when they see me.’ Like my father, I realised, and tried to reject the thought. To Ellen, my wish to be mysterious was a hoot. ‘Forget it. You have an open face, Nick, and you smile too easily, and you're much too honest, and you really can't resist helping people; and frankly, you're about as subtle as a Mack truck. As a villain, Nick, you just don't measure up.’ I turned and looked at myself in the cracked Cutty Sark Whisky mirror behind Mama Sipcott's bar. Hamlet, not Macbeth or Richard III, stared back. I turned again to Ellen, pretty  freckled Ellen with her high cheekbones and clever green eyes and flaming hair and mocking smile, and I suddenly wondered whether McIllvanney had spoken to her again in the last week. ‘Did McIllvanney —’ I began tentatively. ‘Oh, yes,’ Ellen cut in smoothly, and without any disgust in her voice. ‘In fact he increased the fee to a thousand dollars.’ She sounded perversely proud of her increased value, and again I thought it best not to inform her that a bubblehead like Donna could earn twice that fee in a single night. ‘I told him to go jump in a lake,’ Ellen said very calmly, ‘and then I told him that just as soon as I've finished with the Crowninshield twins I shall be sailing away —’she clinked her glass on mine, ‘with you.’ It was the first time she had actually said for certain that she would sail with me and I could not hide my joy, and Ellen, seeing that pleasure, laughed at it. ‘Of course I'm coming with you, Nick! I was always planning to sail with you! Do you think I'd pass up an adventure like that?’ So who cared about having a too-honest face? I was lucky Nick and she was pretty Ellen, and so I ordered another bottle of the sticky white wine and we let our dreams take wings. For we were going to sea."
FIC FIC-CDB-004 -0.93 "The wonderful thing about the human mind, Adam thought, is the way it copes when the worst happens. Beyond that worst happening you think there can be nothing, the unimaginable has taken place, and on the other side is death, destruction, the end. But the worst happens and you reel from it, you stagger, the shock is enormous, and then you begin to recover. You rally, you stand up and face it. You get used to it . An hour maybe and you are making contingency plans. For what had happened was not the worst, you realized that. The worst was yet to come, was perhaps always yet to come, never would actually come, because if it did you would know it, that would be reality, and there would be nothing then but to kill yourself. Quickly. Now that he was able to, he assembled what had happened and laid the facts before himself. They had dug up those bones at Wyvis Hall and had decided it was murder they were investigating. Bones, skeletons, bodies, do not bury themselves. Those were the facts, as far as he knew them up to this moment. He would know more, much more, in the days to come. What was certain was that he could no longer use the escape key. It was defunct. The passages it cancelled had, in any case, as in certain programmes, not been lost but stored on some limbo disc from whence they must now be retrieved. Adam sat in his parents' house, drinking tea. There must be a total retrieval now, the one good thing about which was that it might banish his dreams. He was aware of a slight feeling of sickness and of cold, an absence of hunger, though he had been feeling quite hungry when he got off the plane. Anne sat next to him on his mother's cretonne-covered settee and Abigail lay on a plaid rug on the floor, kicking with her legs and punching with her arms. His mother kept poking toys which she did not want at her. A passage from a novel by John O'Hara came back to Adam. He had memorized it years  ago in the Ecalpemos epoch: ‘The safest way to live is first, inherit money, second, be born without taste for liquor, third, have a legitimate job that keeps you busy, fourth, marry a wife who will cooperate in your sexual peculiarities, fifth, join some big church, sixth, don't live too long.’ Apart from the last one which he hadn't got to yet and the penultimate one which seemed to apply in America more than here (here he had joined the golf club) he had complied with all the rest. Or his nature and luck had complied for him. Nemesis had still come down like the wolf on the fold. He had not wanted to come back here. But there had been no spirit in him, the shock of what his father told him had been too great. ‘Something that will interest you, Adam, something to make you sit up. They've dug up a lot of human bones at my old uncle's house…‘ By the time he had rallied and got himself together and was thinking of things to say to the police it was too late and they were heading north. Anne was furious. When Lewis said to come back with him and eat there Adam had got a kick on the ankle from Anne and another kick when he hadn't replied. He had turned on her and said with cold savagery, ‘For fuck's sake, stop kicking me, will you?’ He expected his father to rise and say something about that being no way to speak to one's wife or not in front of the child, he was capable of that. But he had said nothing, only looked subdued, and Adam realized why. His own terrible fear and anger had communicated itself to his father and shown him what the better part of valour was: keeping silent. Having put the cat among the pigeons, made mischief in his special way, he was lying low now and waiting. The old bastard. Adam only wished Uncle Hilbert had left him Wyvis Hall and then there would have been no Ecalpemos, no Zosie, and no deaths. And Adam couldn't see he would have been much worse off. He and Anne would be living in a house like this one, rather than that neo-Georgian palace. Children, after all, he thought, looking at Abigail, were happy wherever they were, so long as they were loved… His parents had not asked him what sort of holiday he had had or how the flight had been. The conversation was exclusively on the subject of the discovery at Wyvis Hall. Adam did not know whether to be glad or sorry he had not obtained an English newspaper while away. If he had done the shock would have been less but on the other hand, his holiday would have been spoilt. He would have liked very much to be alone. Of course he knew there was no possibility of this, now or when he returned home, for when you were married you never could be alone. Presumably that was the point. What was he going to tell Anne? How much was he going to tell her? He didn't know. None of it, if he could help it. They sat at the table in the dining area to eat an absurdly early high tea. Lewis asked him if he could remember the day when he heard he had inherited Wyvis Hall and had walked in here and astounded them with his news. ‘He had a beard then, Anne.’ Lewis's subdued air had changed to one of high good humour. ‘You wouldn't have recognized him, he looked like John the Baptist.’ Adam could remember very well but he wasn't going to say so. ‘What a funny thing,’ said Lewis. ‘We had ham salad that day too. What a coincidence! Oh, yes, I've been meaning to ask you, who was it looked after Wyvis Hall while you were in Greece?’ Adam could eat nothing. The other time, he remembered, it was his father who hadn't been able to eat. He didn't know what Lewis meant about someone looking after the house but no doubt he, Adam, had at the time concocted some tale to keep his father quiet, to keep him away even. ‘Someone from the village, you said,’ Lewis persisted. ‘How can I remember that far back?’ ‘The police will want to know. It may be of vital importance.’ ‘Aren't you going to eat your meat, dear?’ said Beryl. Abigail, who had been put upstairs in one of the bedrooms to sleep, set up a wailing sound. Adam was on his feet at once. ‘I think we should go.’ They had to wait until his father was ready. Adam would have preferred to phone for a hire car but Lewis wouldn't hear of it. Anne sat in the front in the passenger seat while Adam was in the back with Abigail. If his father could have found out what flight they were coming on, the police certainly could. It was possible they might be waiting for him. They would wish to interview every former owner or occupant of Wyvis Hall. He looked again at the newspaper account of the adjourned inquest that his father had saved for him. It would be owners and occupants of Wyvis Hall between nine and twelve years before that they would wish to interview, and those were Great-Uncle Hilbert, who was dead, himself and Ivan Langan to whom he had sold the house. As for other occupants, how would they know who else had lived there? It was ironical that ten days before he had seen Shiva at Heathrow. The encounter he now saw as an omen, a shadow cast by a coming event. What would that event be? Adam did not want at this point to speculate, it made hi– feel sick. He turned the newspaper over so that he could not see that headline and those paragraphs. In high spirits, his father was talking about the immense advances made in forensic science in recent years. As soon as they got home, Anne started getting Abigail to bed. Their cases humped upstairs and put into the bedroom, Adam looked Rufus Fletcher up in the phone book. He was in there twice, at a Wimpole Street number and again at an address in Mill Hill: Rufus H. Fletcher, MB, MRCP. All these years then, or for some of them, Rufus had been living three or four miles from him. He couldn't look Shiva up because he couldn't remember his surname. Women marry and change their names, he thought, there was no point in pursuing that one. Of course he could look up Robin Tatian but where, really, would that get him? He was reaching-for the blue directory when Anne came back with Abigail in her arms, so Adam took her and carried her back to bed himself and tucked her in and kissed her. She was almost asleep. He wondered if Rufus had children and if so did he worry about them coming to terrible harm the way  Adam worried? Was his whole life affected by what had happened at Ecalpemos? Adam might have escaped the file memories for years, suppressed them and jerked violently away from them, but he had never been able to pretend he was unscathed by those events. Sometimes he felt that he was the person he was because of them and acted the way he did because of their effects. He sat by Abigail's cot, not wanting to remember, but knowing that now he must. There was nothing in his house to remind him of Ecalpemos. Everything that was left, everything he and Rufus hadn't sold, had gone to Ivan Langan with the house. For a song, too, because he had not been able to bear the thought of going back, meeting a valuer, walking about the house, picking things off shelves and out of cupboards. Only once had he returned after they all left and that had been bad enough, like a dream — no, like stepping into the set and scenario of some frightening film, a Hitchcock movie perhaps. He asked the taxi he had taken to put him down at the top of the drift and he had walked to the house. It was almost a year since he had been there and in that time nothing had been done, nothing had been touched. From the pine wood he simply averted his eyes — till later. The drift was thickly overgrown, a dank tunnel out of whose bushy sides the tendrils of brambles and briar roses caught at his clothes. One of these whipped back at him and as he caught at it a thorn drove into the fleshy pad of his finger. That thorn had been there, festering, for months. A dull cool summer it had been, as different as could be from the year before. No golden light bathed the red brick of the house. It no longer looked mellow. Beautiful, yes, but severe somehow and, to Adam's heightened awareness, reproachful. He found himself encouraging, fostering, the scenario illusion. Only thus, only by pretending unreality, pretending this was a part he acted, could he go on, cross the wild, shaggy grass, go past the black-branched cedar tree, arrive at the porch set in its four Doric columns and insert his key in the lock. In the film there would have been something terrible  awaiting him. A dead thing hanging in a noose over the stairs. There was nothing of course, only a & int smell compounded of dust and dry mould. Ecalpemos. He no longer called it that. It was Wyvis Hall once more, his house, but bringing him no pleasure, no deep, excited, almost sick joy. He breathed deeply, walked through the rooms, went upstairs, being the actor in the film. In a few moments the other participant in the sequence they were shooting would come, the estate agent from Sudbury. While they had been there the previous year there had been hardly any visitors. It was as if the magic house in the wood had had an invisible fence set around it or — what did they call it?— a shutting spell. The clear air, Constable's unique Suffolk light, had in fact been impenetrable, a barrier that held off intruders as a sheet of glass might have. This was all fantasy, of course, for one or two people had come, Evans or Owens from Hadleigh, the coypu man, a meter reader, the man who wanted to do the garden and whom he had turned away with a lie. But for the most part they had been undisturbed in their magic island or resort that was closed to others but which they could leave when they pleased. Coming and going — there had been too much of that. Things would have been very different if they had stayed put. The doorbell rang. It made him jump — inevitably. But it was just a bell that rang, it did not buzz or chime. He let in the estate agent and took him over the house, into the drawing room and the dining room, upstairs to the Pincushion Room, the Centaur Room, the Room of Astonishment, the Deathbed Room, the Room Without a Name, and then back down the back stairs to that jumble of kitchens and scullery and washhouse and coal-store, most of it a nineteenth century addition. What a lot of this sort of thing the Victorians had needed! It was all quite tidy and clean, as Vivien had left it. But he could not say Vivien's name then, he could not even think it, only look about him fearfully, clenching his hands. He opened the door to the gun-room and showed the estate agent the interior. There was a table in there and a  Windsor chair. The floor was of black and red quarry tiles and there were racks on the walls for the guns but these, of course, had gone, Hilbert's two shot-guns had gone, one buried in the Little Wood, the other in his bedroom at home in Edgware, zipped up in an old golf-bag under the bed. The estate agent suggested an asking price and took some measurements and then a photograph, standing on the edge of the lawn that had become a meadow, where Rufus had stood and taken photographs a year before. It was windy and the cedar, which he had likened to a galleon and Zosie to a witch, danced witch-like, its branches arms and leaping legs and flying skirts. The car went off up the drift as many times Goblander had gone. Adam had given his only key to the estate agent. He closed the front door behind him and started to walk. He had forgotten all about arranging for a taxi to pick him up or looking up bus times or anything like that. Presumably, the estate agent would have given him a lift somewhere. It was too late now. Cold water drops fell on his head from the leafy roof of the tunnel. In the deciduous wood a pheasant uttered its rattling call. He emptied his mind, he walked like an automaton up on to the green ride, seeing at the end of it the cameo of stacked meadows, segments of wood, a church tower. He was holding his breath. His head he was keeping averted, looking in the direction of the drift, at the wall of cluster pines with their black needles and their green cones. He knew the distance from the ride, thirty paces. When he turned his head he kept his eyes closed, let out his breath, opened his eyes, looked and heard himself give a little whimpering sigh. It was the sound a man might make when in physical pain but trying not to show it, suppressing complaint. There was nothing to see, nothing to show. The place was as it had always been, a downland in miniature, a terrain of small green hills on which little dolmens had been raised, pink granite, white marble, a slab or two of grey stone. Wooden crosses. ‘By what eternal streams, Pinto… ’ Each in their narrow  cells for ever laid were Alexander, Sal, Monty, Ranger, Blaze. And to the right of Blaze the green turf lay undisturbed, very slightly irregular, as the whole area was, a reticulation of tiny-leaved plants, minuscule flowers, netted into the grass, a small pit here filled with pine needles, a shallow rut there with a sandy bottom. Rabbits had mown the lawn here more effectively than any piece of machinery. Their droppings lay about like scattered handfuls of raisins. Adam found he was holding both hands clamped over his mouth. He turned and ran, along the ride, up the drift, not looking back. Anne, waiting downstairs for him with coffee and sandwiches on a tray, wanted to talk about the find at Wyvis Hall. He found himself unexpectedly touched by her simple assumption, the way she absolutely took it for granted, that he was innocent. Adam didn't want anything to eat. He was thinking of Hilbert's shot-gun that he still had but which he should perhaps not keep much longer. ‘You've never told me any of this,’ Anne began. ‘When you got the solicitor's letter saying you'd inherited the place it must have come as a terrific shock. I mean, didn't you have a clue?’ ‘I thought my father would come in for it. Everyone did.’ ‘Why do you think he left it to you like that?’ ‘Not because he liked me. He hardly took any notice of me. He didn't like children and when I got older I stopped going. I hadn't been near the place for four years. My parents went.’ ‘Then I just don't understand.’ ‘Look, he was an unpleasant old man.’ Adam looked hard at her. ‘My father is an unpleasant old man and I daresay I shall be. Verne-Smiths are.’ She didn't say anything. ‘I think it happened this way. He saw through the toadying, of course he did. My father was just a blatant sycophant. He thought to himself, right, you've called the boy Hilbert to please me, to make me like him, so I damn well will like him, I'll like him more than you and leave him the place over your head.’ ‘Do people really behave like that?’ ‘Some do.’ Adam thought. ‘Frankly, if it were me, I would. I might.’ ‘Do you want some more coffee? No? I suppose you whizzed straight down there and had a look at your property?’ ‘No, I didn't as a matter of fact. I hadn't time, I had to go back to university. Anyway, I was going to sell it, I wasn't all starry-eyed about my lovely house, you know.’ That was just what he had been. Once, that is, he had seen it again after a four-year absence. But he had not guessed he would be and had postponed his visit till term ended in June. All that term his father had been planning ways and means, trying to overturn the will, looking for compromises, plotting for all Adam knew a frontal assault. What he did not know he had got from his sister, his ally against their parents if in nothing else. ‘You'd been there for your holidays as a little boy? Did you love it then?’ ‘I don't think so.l can't remember. I think I'd have preferred the seaside. Kids do.’ ‘And did they show you the animal cemetery when you were a child?’ Anne persisted. ‘I suppose so.l can't remember. Do we have to talk about it?’ In fact, he couldn't remember ever having heard of it until the day Shiva came in and told them what he had found. Vivien thought it was children buried there. Adam shivered as he remembered that. Well, with her bent towards Indian mysticism she wouldn't be able to understand the way they went on about animals. Adam had a sudden awful vision of the spade going through that green turf and coming up with a skull on it. Something like that, it must have been like that. Was the shot still there, among the bones? Later he lay in bed beside Anne, trying to think of a satisfactory yet thoroughly non-committal story to tell the police. Like most middle-class English people who have never had anything to do with them, Adam thought the police were fools. Anne had fallen asleep almost immediately. She had a habit, when she slept on her back, of making soft sounds in her throat. This was not snoring but a kind of clicking, irregular and sporadic — that was what made it irritating — and liable to start when least expected. Adam had only heard one other make these sounds and when he first heard Anne make them his memory escape failed and those two nights were startlingly evoked, so disturbingly in fact that he had the terrible delusion that Anne was doing it to mock him. Of course that was nonsense. She had never heard of Catherine Ryemark and never would if he had his way. Several minutes might pass without a click and then one would come and another would come and another one fifteen seconds after that. It drove Adam mad. Once, in a fit of temper, he had told her she only started doing it after they were married. If he had heard her do that in their single days he would never have married her. But now, the soft clicks coming with typical irregularity, he listened to them painfully and let his mind slide back ten years to what he must remember, to the truth he must recall if he were going to be able to tell lies. He lay still with his eyes open, staring into the darkness that was only half-darkness because this was London and not Suffolk, where on moonless nights the small hours were black as velvet. Click, pause, click, a long silence. At last it had been cold enough to need a blanket and a quilt, to hold Zosie in his arms without the sweat pouring off them both. For a long time that night too he had not slept, had lain thinking, wondering what to do, listening to the delicate sounds like tiny bubbles breaking — and then hearing them no more. Adam closed his eyes and turned his head away from Anne. A down-stuffed duvet in a printed-cotton cover lay over them. It had been a quilt at Ecalpemos, faded yellow satin, brought in by Vivien from the terrace when the rain began. Quilts were what you lay on to sunbathe that summer, not for warmth on beds, but slung for lounging comfort as it might be on some Damascus rooftop. Night after night they had lain out there in the soft, scented warmth, looking at the stars, or lighting candles stuck in Rufus's wine bottles, eating and drinking, talking, hoping and happy. That summer — there had never been another like it, before or since. It was the hottest, driest summer any of them had ever known. The previous one, 1975, had been very good, especially the latter part, but that one, the summer of Hilbert's death and of Ecalpemos, had been glorious from April till September. If it had been grey and raining and chilly he might have taken one look at Wyvis Hall and turned tail and fled to Crete or Delos or somewhere. Certainly he would have gone down there alone to spy out the land and check on his property. Rufus wouldn't have wanted to go and he would have had to go down on his own by train. There were so many ifs and conditions, so many other eventualities that easily might have happened. In the first place he had only approached Rufus because Rufus had a car. If his father hadn't been so bloody-minded and had let him use the family car, he would no doubt have gone down alone and come back next day, having called on some estate agent in Hadleigh or Sudbury and asked them to sell the house for him, the very one probably that he had gone to in the following year. But things had not gone that way. It had been a glorious sunny day and he had wakened up in the morning rather early for him in those days. About nine. His other was on holiday, though he and his mother were not going away anywhere, in spite of what the doctor had advised, but staying at home and ‘going out for days’. Or that was what they said. They hadn't been out for any days since Adam had been at home. 18 June it was, a Friday. The date was stamped indelibly on his memory calendar, more than just stamped, etched in. He thought he would get up and go to Suffolk and take a look at his house. His generation — perhaps all generations at that age — hated making plans, making arrangements ahead. Adam had viewed with near-incredulity his mother's preparations in the past for going on holiday, the way everything in the house seemed to get washed, the way she and his father wore their worst clothes for days beforehand because the best ones were  packed, the phone calls she made, the notes she left for tradesmen. He liked to do things spontaneously, be up and off on the spur of the moment. His other wouldn't let him have the car. It might be needed if they went out for the day. Adam said all right, not to worry, he would manage without, but this didn't seem to please Lewis either. He would have liked, Adam knew, to have lived in a time when a father could forbid his son to do things and the son would obey. Or rather, to have the rules of that former period prevailing now. Adam didn't say where he planned to go, though he thought his father guessed, but got on his bicycle and cycled over to Rufus's. He couldn't remember what he had done with his bike when he got to the Fletchers', left it there and collected it next day perhaps, but he could remember most of the rest of it. What he had worn, for instance. Jeans cut off thigh-high to make shorts and a T-shirt he had made out of an old man's vest he had bought for 20p in a sale under the arches at Charing Cross Station and dyed green and yellow. His hair was tied back with a piece of tinsel string he had found in the Christmas decorations box. Those were the days before people dyed their hair bright colours, the days of henna. Adam had put henna on his hair and that and the sun had turned it reddish-gold. His beard, though, was black and rather curly. He must have looked a sight but he didn't think so then. His legs were bare and he was wearing Indian leather sandals, the kind you had to soak in water before you first put them on. It showed what the weather was and how they had started taking daily sunshine for granted that he hadn't got any sort of jacket or sweater with him even though he expected to be away overnight. The Fletchers had a swimming pool. It was supposed to be a teardrop shape or shaped like a comma. This summer was the first anyone had made much use of the pool. Rufus was sitting on the blue-tiled rim of it with his feet dangling in the water. He was three years older than Adam and though they had been at the same school, Highgate, they had not been friends then. It was Rufus's younger brother Julius who had been in the same  form as Adam, a rather dull, pompous boy, a sort of phoney intellectual, and they had never had much to do with one another. Adam and Rufus had met as members of the same squash club. That was what they seemed to have in common, that and Rufus's brother and Adam knowing each other already, but after a while Adam got to see things he admired in Rufus, his toughness, the way he'd got himself organized and in hand, the way he knew where he was going and yet still could be amusing and casual. Of course he had got to know him a good deal better at Ecalpemos… Rufus was very laid-back and Adam liked that. He also liked Rufus's occasional sensitivity, which didn't seem to go with the other aspects of his personality. And Rufus was wild too, the way medical students had a reputation for being. Adam thought of himself and Rufus as being wild and laid-back at the same time, equally like that, young adventurers with all the world before them and all the time they wanted to do what they liked with. Rufus said, Hi, and come for a swim, so Adam took off his shorts and went into the water in his black nylon underpants. They would has/e swum naked only Rufus's father had discovered them doing this and made a fuss out of all proportion to the offence, if offence it was. ‘I reckoned I might go and take a look at my inheritance,’ Adam said, checking that the key to Wyvis Hall was safe in the pocket of his shorts. ‘Now, d'you mean?’ ‘Yes. I guess so. Why not?’ ‘Want me to drive you?’ Rufus had an old Morris Minor van that he had bought third- or fourth hand, but it went all right. It got you from A to B in one piece, as Adam's father remarked sneeringly of it. That had been well before the motorway, the M25, was built. You went to Suffolk by the A12 through Chelmsford or took the country route. This was what Lewis had always called the route that went by narrower, winding roads through Ongar  and Dunmow, Braintree and Halstead to Sudbury, and that was the way he had driven them when they all went out to visit old Hilbert. Adam did for Rufus what Lewis would have called ‘navigating’. It maddened Adam, his misuse of this word, which couldn't of course be applied to guiding anyone on land, coming as it did from the Latin navigare and thence from navis , feminine, a ship, and agere , to drive or guide. Adam loved words, was fascinated by them, their meanings and what you could do with them, with anagrams and palindromes and rhetorical terms and etymology. One of the subjects in the mixed B A course he was doing at university was linguistics… ‘Directing’ Rufus was what he was doing, he told himself. They had talked about words during that drive, well, place-names really, with particular reference to the villages that were called Roding after the river: High Roding, Berners Roding, Margaret Roding, and Rufus told him they were pronounced Roothing from the old Danish, which Adam hadn't known before. It was a beautiful drive and the countryside looked wonderful, a kind of sparkling shimmering green in the heat and sunshine. The sky was huge, a pale, bright, cloudless blue, and the white surface of the road ahead rippled in the heat mirages that made it look like little waves. The farmers were haymaking, cutting the tall feathery grass and its dense admixture of wild flowers. The windows of the van were wide open and they had the radio on, not playing rock, which they both hated, but Mozart, one of the better known of the piano concertos. In spite of all the times he had been there Adam missed the turn-off that was the drift leading down to Wyvis Hall. It was somewhere along the lane between Nunes and Hadleigh but so much vegetation had grown up that spring that everything looked different. They drove about a mile further, right up to the group of buildings called the Mill in the Pytle, and Rufus, turning the van round, asked what a pytle was. Adam said he would look it up. He told Rufus to drive a bit more slowly and this time he spotted the six-foot-wide gap in the hedge with, on the right-hand side, almost hidden by cow parsley growing up and elderflowers hanging down, the wooden box on legs with  its hinged lid into which Hilbert's-mail and newspapers and milk had been delivered. As a little boy, Adam had sometimes been sent up here in the morning to fetch the letters and the paper, carrying with him a wicker bottle-basket for the milk. There was no other sign that this was Wyvis Hall. ‘Why's it called a drift?’ said Rufus, lighting another cigarette. He had chain-smoked all the way down and Adam had had one or two to keep him company, though he didn't really like putting something lighted in his mouth. That was the trouble for him with dope. He liked the effects of it but didn't like having to smoke it. ‘I don't know,’ he said. ‘I don't know why it's called a drift.’ ‘You can look it up when you look up ‘pytle’,’ said Rufus. On either side the drift was thick with cow parsley, its powdery white heads coming to an end of their long blooming. It had a sweetish scent, like icing sugar, like childhood birthday cakes, that mingled with the winey perfume of the elders. All the trees were in full leaf but the oaks and beeches had not long so been, so that their foliage was still a fresh, bright colour and the lime trees were hung with pale, yellow-green, dangling flowers. The pine wood looked just the same as ever, it always did, it was always dark and dense with very narrow passages through it that would surely allow nothing bigger than a fox to weave its way through. Imperceptibly the trees must have grown, yet they seemed to Adam no different from when he was a child coming up to fetch the milk and when, on sunless mornings, he had felt a kind of menace from the wood. Even then he had not liked to look into it too much but had kept his eyes on the ground or straight ahead of him because the wood was the kind of place you saw in story-book illustrations or even in your dreams and out of which things were liable to come creeping. At the foot of the slope, through the thinning trees, a field maple, alders with their feet in the stream, a late-blooming chestnut, that dramatic lawn-adornment, the cedar, the house  came into view. Things, buildings, stretches of land, are said to look smaller when we grow up. And this seems only natural, just what one would expect. After all, the top of the table that was once on a line with our chin now reaches only to our thighs. Wyvis Hall, logically, should have looked smaller to Adam but it did not, it looked much larger. This must have been because it-was his now, he owned it. It was his and it seemed a palace. On the stable block, in which nothing had ever been stabled in Adam's memory, was a little tower with a running fox weathervane on it and below the small pitched roof a blue clock with hands of gold. The hands had stopped at five to four. Between the block and the house you could just see the walls of the walled garden, flint-built, crossed and coped with brick-work. A mass of flowers covered the house, a pink climbing rose and a creamy clematis. Adam had not known these names, but later on Mary Gage had told him. Because the sun shone so brightly the slate roof blazed like a slab of silver. Rufus pulled up in front of the porch. The whole area out here was paved and small stonecrops and sedums with white and yellow starry flowers grew up between the stones. In a couple of narrow-mouthed stone vessels grew a conifer and a bay tree. The rose which mantled the house must have put out a thousand flowers and these were at the peak of their blooming, not a petal yet shed, each blossom the pink of a shell within and the pink of coral on its outer side. Adam got out of the van and felt in the pocket of his shorts for the key. He was aware of a profoundly warm, placid, peaceful silence as if the house were a happy animal asleep in the sun. ‘And this is all yours?’ said Rufus. ‘All mine.’ Adam was equally cool. ‘I should be so lucky in my avuncular arrangements.’ Adam unlocked the front door and they went inside. The windows had been closed for nearly three months and the place had a dusty smell that got into your throat and made your eyes smart. It was also very hot, for the drawing room faced due south and the hot sun beat on the glass. Adam went about  opening windows. The furniture was all his too, those cabinets with bulging fronts and curved legs, chairs with buttoned backs, a velvet-covered love seat, a big oval table supported on a wooden base shaped like a vase, mirrors framed in gilt, pale mauve and green watercolours and dark portraits in oils. He could not remember noticing any of this before. It had been there but he had not seen it. Nor noticed the pillars of rosy marble that supported the window embrasure, nor the alcoves, glass-fronted, that were filled with china. Only the overall impression was familiar, not the individual pieces. He felt a little sick, engorged with possessions and the pride of ownership. In each room a chandelier hung from the ceiling, of tarnished brass in the dining room, a cascade of prisms in the drawing room, in hall and study Italianate glass tubes twisted snake-like amid false candles. And everywhere the sun streamed or lay in golden pools or rainbow spots or squares made by windows patterned with the shadows of leaves. Rufus was among the bookcases in Hilbert's study. Adam took down Edward Moor's Suffolk Words and Phrases , couldn't find ‘drift’ but here was ‘pytle’or ‘pightle’,a small meadow . He went back into the drawing room where he unbolted, unlocked and threw open the french windows. The sun came to him in a warm gust or like a warm veil enveloping him. It whitened the terrace beyond with a clear, unbroken glare. All along the terrace, on the low wall that bounded it, stood the statuary his father had once told him had been placed there by whoever inhabited the place before Hilbert and Lilian came. They represented, in some kind of fine-grained grey stone, the loves of Zeus. He remembered them all right. As a child he had studied them with fascination, enquiring what the bull was doing to the lady, and receiving from his parents no very satisfying answer. Hilbert he had been too much in awe of to ask. They had come from Italy. Some cousin of Lilian's two or three times removed had found them in Florence while there on her honeymoon and had had them shipped home. There was Zeus as Amphitryon with Alcmene; Zeus coming to Danae in a shower of gold (difficult in stone, this one); snatching Europa; swan-shaped, wooing Leda; standing before the hapless Semele in all his destructive glory, and in half a dozen other metamorphoses. Someone had been looking after the garden, you could see that. Flower beds had been weeded, dead heads removed, the borders of the willow-fringed lake shorn and trimmed, the lawns recently mown. As they walked along one of the stone-flagged paths and came to the gate in the flint wall they saw a neat pile of mowings waiting, apparently, to be composted. The walled garden too had been carefully maintained. Inside the netted fruit cage Adam saw the bright, ripe, vermilion gleam of strawberries nestling among their triform leaves, raspberries yet green on the canes. All along the facing wall espaliered trees, their trunks dark and shiny and twisted and knobbed, bore among a rough, dull foliage fruit turning gold. Nectarines, Adam remembered, and peaches too. Weren't there greengages somewhere that scarcely ever fruited but when they did were splendid? Red and white currants here in rows, berries like glass beads, gooseberries with a ripeness the colour of rust on their green cheeks. They each took a handful of strawberries. They walked to the lake where there were two pairs of ducks, mallards with feathers as if painted in iridescent green, and from which a heron rose on gaunt wings, its legs dangling. Adam looked back at the house, at the honeysuckle that curtained the back of it in yellow and pink, at the martins, sharp-pinioned, that wheeled in and out from the eaves. He was in a state of tremulous excitement. He seemed only to be able to breathe shallowly. It was curiously sexual this feeling, exactly the way he had once or twice felt with a girl he was mad to make love to and who he thought would let him but was not quite sure, not absolutely sure. The slightest thing would turn his fortune, snatch it, send him home frustrated, bitter, in a sick rage. He felt like that now. If only he could breathe properly! And here was the finest country air, transparent sparkling sun, the distant low hills and soft basking meadows half-hidden by the blue haze of noon. ‘You're actually going to sell this place?’ Rufus lit a cigarette, offered him one. Adam shook his head. ‘What else can I do?’ What choice did he have? He couldn't live there, he couldn't keep it up. Adam lay in bed beside Anne, his mind repeating what he had said to Rufus on that wonderful day in June. ‘What else can I do?’ Of course he should have said I don't have a choice. Come on, I'm hungry, let's go get some lunch and then we'll find an estate agent. But they had bought food on their way coming through Halstead, the 1976 version of takeaway, a couple of meat pies, apples, Coke, and they had had lunch lying in the grass by the lake. The magical quality of the place crept on them there like a spell, the warmth and the sunshine and the scents of the garden and the tranquil silence. But it was more than that. There was an indefinable ingredient, a kind of excitement. It had something to do with history and the past, that excitement, and something to do with potential as well, with what Orwell or somebody had said, that every man really knew in his heart the finest place to be was the countryside on a summer's day. I was happy, Adam thought, that's what it was. The Garden of Eden. Shiva had called it that, but in his mouth it had not been the hackneyed expression it would have been if an English person had so referred to it. He was drawing an interesting image from the mythology of another culture and it had seemed to him fresh and new. Adam had merely shrugged. The Garden of Eden was the way certain people would describe any charming landscape. Yet the phrase had remained with him, particularly in its darker aspect, the way it appears to most of those who are bound by the puritan ethic, not as a haven to live in and enjoy but as a paradise to be expelled from. It was almost as if a necessary condition of being in this paradise was the commission of some frightful sin or crime that must result in expulsion from it. On the day they had gone, when the summer was over and the skies grey and a wind blowing, he had thought of that image. Their departure had  something in it of the bowed and wretched mien of Adam and Eve in the many ‘expulsion’ paintings he had later seen, and by then the Garden itself had a ruined look, paradise destroyed. He got out of bed to have a pee. He and Anne had a bathroom opening out of their bedroom but Adam, when he got up in the night, usually went to the other one that was on the far side of the landing. This was because his reason for getting up at all was to see if Abigail was all right. But he had used their bathroom and was back in bed again before he realized that he had forgotten to look at his daughter. His anxiety for her had been displaced by a greater worry — was that possible? Ever since her birth he had been ultra-anxious without expressing, even to himself alone, his reasons for this. Of course he knew what those reasons were but he had never faced them. Now he did and they did not seem absurd, they seemed like good reasons. He got up again and padded across to Abigail's room. Suppose, after all, that he had not gone to look and in the morning they had found her stiff and cold in her cot, her eyes glazed and unfocused, her lips blue? He shivered, gooseflesh standing on his face and arms. Abigail lay on her side, well tucked in, the teddy bear she was too young for sitting in the corner by her feet. Adam stood watching her, listening to her silent sleep."
FIC FIC-CDB-005 -1.67 "With the specialist's contempt for the layman's ignorance, Rufus read accounts of the inquest in two newspapers. More prominence was given to the evidence of Alec Chipstead than to that of the Home Office Pathologist, Dr Aubrey Helier. The stuff Rufus wanted to know would be beyond the average reader's comprehension. He should really have gone to that inquest. That could be remedied, he could acquire a transcript of the proceedings or simply a copy of the pathologist's findings, but he did not dare, he was not prepared to show his hand to that extent. Instead he tried to guess what might have been said. He put himself into the pathologist's shoes and stood in the witness box. He spoke of how he had established the sex of the larger skeleton. A fragment of the uterus remaining perhaps? It was this soft part that often persisted longest. ‘Having established that the larger skeleton was that of a female, I set about making an estimate of the subject's age at the time of her death. It should be explained that between the ages of twelve and thirty the union of the epiphyses of most of the long bones with the shafts takes place, and by the age of twenty-four most of the epiphyses have united. In the case of the subject I shall henceforward designate as Subject A I found that the medial end of the clavicle had not yet fused, though fusion had taken place at the acromion and verical border scapula. The bones of the arm had for the most part fused but fusion had not yet taken place between the radius and ulna, which would be expected to have occurred by the age of twenty-one. The heads of the metatarsals were fused, which one would expect to be accomplished by nineteen years, but fusion had not taken place in the secondary pelvic centres. The sutures of the skull remained open on their inner aspects…‘ Something like that it must have been. He would not have been able to put a precise age on the skeleton. Between seventeen and twenty-one, say. And the cause of death? Rufus had another look at the paper. The pathologist had said it was at this stage impossible to give an opinion but the report also said the police were treating the case as murder. There was nothing about how the pathologist had reached the conclusion that death had taken place some time between 1974 and 1977. Rufus guessed again. ‘Certain highly technical factors, intelligible only to the expert and with which I will not take up the time of this inquest, have led me to conclude that Subject A had been dead for more than nine years and less than twelve. Suffice it to say that I reached this estimate on the basis of the preservation of a vestige of the uterus and as a result of obtaining a chemical  reaction for blood from periosteum. I should not have expected to obtain such a reaction if more than twelve years had elapsed since death.’ It was only conjecture about that bit of uterus. Rufus wondered if he might have invented that part because he had so much to do with wombs in the course of his own daily life. He knew very little about tests done on blood from bones, only that they could be carried out. Identification of ‘Subject A’ would be a more difficult matter altogether. There was no mention of hair, though Rufus knew hair could persist intact for far more years than those bones had been in the grave, and there was nothing about clothing. Would ten years in the earth have destroyed that cotton shroud? He imagined a policeman with nothing more to go on than a tiny, once brightly embroidered, label, a square inch of bloodstained, earth-stained, half-rotted cloth, hawking it round boutiques in Kilburn and West Hendon, narrowing the field, finally coming to an importers' warehouse… But no, she hadn't been wearing that dress, of course she hadn't. He asked himself how accurate his memory in fact was, how much time and a desire to repudiate the past had blocked off. He ought to try to remember, he must. There were ways of bringing memories to the surface and he must use them to protect himself. It was imperative too to keep cool and not allow things to get out of proportion. Most likely they would proceed no further than they had with the identification of ‘Subject A’, especially since there was no one(apart from themselves) to miss her and she had never been missed. In the case of a person missing ten years before who had never been reported missing, what hope was there now of establishing identity? It might be somewhat different with regard to the other occupant of the grave. Rufus became the pathologist again. ‘Now to the remains of the infant I shall call Subject B. Examination of the pelvis usually allows sex to be determined with great confidence in very young children and even in the foetus. I found in Subject B the greater sciatic notch to be wide and shallow and the ischial tuberosities to be everted, the ilia  inclined to the vertical and the brim of the pelvis almost circular in outline. The sub-pubic angle was rounded and somewhat of the order of 90 degrees. I can therefore state with total confidence that Subject B was of the female sex. ‘The age of Subject B I estimate to have been more than four weeks and less than twelve. The skeleton in toto measured 22.5 inches. The anterior fontanelle was open. There was no appearance of ossification in the humeral head, though the cuboid was ossified…‘ Rufus was getting into unknown terrain here. He had very little idea of how the baby's age could have been estimated. By the fusion of joints, certainly, it need hardly matter to him which ones. How old had the baby been anyway? Very young, without teeth. ‘A primary deciduous dentition had not yet commenced’, was no doubt how the pathologist would have put it. But what of Subject A's teeth? That was primarily how dead bodies were identified, by their teeth. On the other hand, if the particular person had never been missed or reported missing, their existence scarcely recorded in the great reference log of National Insurance and medical cards, passports and driving licences, if the chance of their even being named seemed thin, what obscure dentist was going to rise up suddenly producing the relevant chart? A certain assumption might of course be made. ‘There is considerable danger here of drawing the conclusion that because the two sets of bones were found in conjunction and on the same date, they must have met their deaths at the same time. Although this is probably so, I am able to offer no evidence in proof of it. Nor have I come upon any factor to prove the truth of another assumption which may be made: to wit, that Subject A was the mother of Subject B. Experience and probability point to this being so but that is all. ‘I am unable to state with any certainty the length of time which has elapsed since the death of Subject B or offer any suggestion as to the cause of death.’ That was something which could never be established after this lapse of time. Unfortunate in a way, Rufus thought. It  would be an ironical stroke if investigations into the affair resulted not in the discovery of those happenings in which they had been guilty but only in those where they had been blameless. The inquest had been adjourned. No doubt they were still digging up the little graveyard. Rufus was not squeamish, he had not been one of those medical students who become nauseous at their first sight of surgery, but, curiously enough he did not much like to think of all those odd little bones, so alien to him, so unidentifiable, being dug up and sorted out and sifted through in case there should be a human fibula among them or a vertebra. Rufus did not even know if animal bones shared the same names as those of humans. Did dogs have fibulas? He was surprised to find himself shuddering. If there was no shot in or among the human remains, in the cavities of the skull for instance, would it be possible to find it in the soil, among the sand and gravel and pine needles? Bird shot it would have been or somewhat larger. Rufus had only seen it while eating partridge which had been winged instead of shot in the head and had nearly broken one of his teeth on the tiny ball of lead. He imagined gravel being sifted, all the particles, the minute stones, being picked over by some policeman whose job it was to do that, the tiny flints laid in one tray, the wood fragments in another, and then, in a third, the shot. He could remember so much, he had clear pictures of whole days spent at Ecalpemos, whole conversations recorded that could be rerun in his head. Why was it then that he couldn't remember where she had been shot? In the heart or the head or the spine? His mind blanked over that and there was a complete loss of recall. When he tried and saw the sky covered with rushing clouds, the lawn that had become a hay-field, the cedar's wheeling branches, the gun levelled, there would come an explosion in his memory like the firing of that shot-gun, a redness in front of his eyes with splintered edges, then black-out. The gun he could remember, both guns. And the gun-room and the first time he went in there with Adam. They had eaten their lunch down by the lake. Two pork pies and a can of Coke each but not the apples which were imported Granny  Smiths and bruised, and anyway they had strawberries. They must have each eaten about a pound of strawberries, for they kept going back to the fruit cage for more. Some time during the afternoon they decided not to go back but to stay overnight. That meant there was no hurry, they could have lain out there in the sun till the pubs opened. But Adam had this idea of phoning his mother to tell her he wouldn't be back that night. Rufus wouldn't have bothered, he came and went as he pleased, and anyway didn't believe parents should be pandered to in this way. Of course it wasn't quite pandering with Adam. He didn't want to get on worse terms with his mother, from whom he hoped to get a loan for his holiday in Greece, nor did he want the kind of thing that might have happened, his mother phoning hospitals or getting the police because they could have had an accident in Goblander. As it turned out he didn't make that phone call until the evening and they found a call-box outside a pub in one of the villages, for Great-Uncle Hilbert's phone had been disconnected. But once they were indoors again they resumed exploring, found a genuine butler's pantry with a lot of silver in it packed away in canteens and boxes and green baize, and opening the next door, came into the gun-room. Adam, as a child, had been strictly forbidden ever to go in there. Anyway, the door was usually kept locked. Presumably, in pre-Hilbert days, during Bereland squirearchy, it had contained an armoury of weapons, for all four walls were hung with gun racks. However, only two types of firearms remained, both shot-guns. There was a row of hooks for hanging up jackets and waterproofs and one of these hung there still, Hilbert's old shooting-jacket, tweed, with leather pads on the elbows. A glass case on the windowsill contained a fat stuffed trout, another, on the circular table, a turtle — this certainly not of English provenance. The front half of a fox, paws and all, its rear end replaced by a shield-shaped slab of polished wood, appeared to be leaping out of the wall just below the picture rail, in the manner of a circus dog emerging from a paper hoop. ‘Those aren't the sort of things you shoot, though, are they?’ Rufus had asked. ‘You most definitely don't shoot foxes.’ Adam said this in such a snooty, lord-of-the-manor way that Rufus yelled with laughter. He took one of the guns, the twelve bore, from the wall and Adam had another go at him, this time for pointing it in his direction. ‘It's not loaded, for God's sake.’ ‘Never mind. You don't point guns at people.’ It appeared then that Adam had actually been out shooting the last time he was here. He had only been fifteen and had been given the four-ten, the so-called lady's gun, which Rufus gathered had rather gone against the grain. Since then he had often recalled what Adam said next, had taken the gun from him and remarked that it was a pump-action shot-gun. ‘What does that mean?’ ‘You don't have to keep reloading. It's got a repeating action. You don't have to put a cartridge in each time before you fire.’ And Rufus, who didn't mind appearing ingenuous in this area, said, ‘I thought all firearms worked like that.’ One of the drawers in the pine cabinet was stocked with cartridges, red ones and blue ones which Adam said indicated the size of the shot they contained. ‘That's amazing, me inheriting a couple of guns as well. We might even get some shooting.’ ‘Not in June, squire. Even I know that.’ Was that the first hint, no more than a joke really, that they might stay at Wyvis Hall, that they might live there? And Adam had said: ‘I didn't mean now.’ ‘I thought –you were going to sell the place.’ Adam didn't say any more. They went back down the garden and after that out to a couple of pubs where they drank a lot and Rufus had to drive back to Wyvis Hall with one eye closed on account of getting double vision. They slept it off, not  getting up till around eleven next morning, Rufus in the principal guest room, Adam at the other end of the house in what he christened the Pincushion Room because it had a picture on the wall of St Sebastian stuck full of arrows. Rufus looked out of the window and saw a man trimming the grass round one of the rose beds with a pair of long-handled shears. He was elderly, bald, very thin, wearing a striped shirt of the kind that have detachable collars. It was the sound of his clipping which had woken Rufus up. The sun was blazing down and there wasn't a spot of shade anywhere till you came to the wood below the lake. Rufus, who hadn't much appreciation of nature usually, nevertheless found himself gazing in something like wonderment at all the roses, yellow and pink and apricot and dark red, a hedge of white ones, a cascade of peach-red that covered a pergola. The man with the shears laid them down on the grass, took a handkerchief from his pocket, made a knot in each of its four corners and placed this improvised sun-hat on his head. Rufus had never seen anyone do that before, though he had seen it in pictures on seaside postcards. He.was entranced. He put on his shorts and his sandals and went down. By the time he got outside Adam was already there, telling the man in the handkerchief hat that he didn't want him to come any more, he was going to sell the house. ‘This old garden'll go to rack and ruin then. I been coming down here watering most nights.’ ‘That's not my problem,’ said Adam. ‘The people who buy it will have to handle that.’ ‘It do seem a wicked shame.’ The gardener opened his shears and wiped the grass clippings off the blades with his forefinger. ‘But it's not my place to argue. Mr Verne-Smith paid me up till the end of April, so that's seven weeks you owe me — let's say six and a half to be fair.’ Adam looked rather shattered. ‘I didn't actually ask you to come.’ ‘True, but I come, didn't I? I done the work and I'll want paying. Fair's fair. Look at the place. You can't deny I done the work.’ Adam couldn't. He didn't try. In the cagey, suspicious way he sometimes spoke he said: ‘How much in fact would it be?’ ‘I come twice a week at a pound a time, so that's thirteen, say, and then there's all the times I've come with me cans. Fifteen I reckon would cover it.’ It was ludicrously less than Rufus had expected. For all that labour it was ridiculous. But this was the country, this was horticulture, and they ordered things differently there. He and Adam went into the house where they managed to scrounge up fifteen quid between the two of them, leaving them with just enough to cover the petrol for Goblander to get home on. Adam paid the man and he went off on a bicycle, still wearing the knotted handkerchief on his head. It was only after he had gone that they realized they had never asked his name or where he lived. ‘You could have kept him on for two quid a week. It's nothing.’ ‘I haven't got two quid a week. I'm skint.’ And it was lack of money that stopped them going away. He, Rufus, could have got just about enough together for the petrol en route and maybe his own food. If Adam had had an equal amount they would have managed. In another year, at almost any other time, Adam would have touched his father or more probably his mother for a loan, but in June 1976 his father was barely speaking to him, and his mother would have been scared to go against her husband. Of course if Adam had invited his parents to make themselves at home at Wyvis Hall, use it as a hotel, while he was away, they would have lent him any amount, but that was the last thing Adam would have done. He did ask his sister for money. Bridget had been one of those teenagers who work all through their school holidays in restaurants or in shops or cleaning houses and she always had cash. But she would not lend him any. She was saving up to go skiing the next January and she knew there wasn't much chance of Adam repaying a loan by then. It was ironical that Adam, who was the owner of that big  house and all that land and the contents of the house, nevertheless went down to Nunes the second time with less than a fiver in his pocket. And that was everything he had. Instead of Greece they went to Wyvis Hall because Adam was broke and Mary was close to broke because that first time it had been so beautiful and peaceful and private there that you could hardly see what advantages Greece would have had over it. They had intended to stay a week. Rufus had suggested to Adam that he sell something out of the house, a piece of china or some silver. There were almost more antique and second-hand shops in some of those villages than there were houses. He had counted six in the place where they had gone to the pub. They talked about it on the way down in Goblander. It was funny how good Adam had been at naming things, the rooms in the house, the house itself even, or at naming the idea of it, the concept, Ecalpemos. Goblander was not just an anagram on old banger, it really expressed the way that decrepit old van had of gobbling up petrol as it chugged through the countryside making awful noises because it needed a new silencer. ‘You'll never even get near Greece in this,’ said Mary. ‘It'll just collapse and give up the ghost somewhere in France. I'm warning you.’ Her father was a life peer who had held some sort of office under a Labour government. It must have been the boarding-school she had been to which determined her voice, affected, sharp, shrill. She found fault a lot. The car was wrong, Rufus's clothes were wrong or funny or somehow unsuitable, he smoked too much, he was too fond of wine and his whole lifestyle left much to be desired. She started on Adam for taking up that shameful suggestion about selling what she called the family silver. How dreadful! What a desecration! He ought to have a feeling of reverence for the beautiful things his great-uncle had entrusted to him. ‘He's not coming back,’ said Adam, ‘to see how I've discharged my duties.’ ‘He'll turn in his grave.’ ‘No, there'll just be a small upheaval in his ashes.’ He told her Great-Uncle Hilbert's ashes were the contents of an urn-shaped Crown Derby sweets-jar that stood on the drawing-room mantelpiece. Maybe she believed him, for Rufus had once caught her lifting the lid and looking into the jar at the wood ash Adam had scraped up from the site of the handkerchief man's last bonfire. Mary was rather difficult but she was also just about the most beautiful girl Rufus had ever come across. It gratified him to be seen in her company. He had always been a bit that way had Rufus, manifestly to be seen to be doing all right for himself, successful, forging ahead, accompanied by the best-looking girl possible. Mary was spectacular to look at and her own knowledge that she was made her capricious and difficult, expecting the best of everything. All that was her due because she looked like the young Elizabeth Taylor, had dark brown curly hair nearly to her waist, large, dark blue eyes, creamy velvet skin and a wonderful figure. It was 20 June when they went back, all Goblander's windows open, the weather being perfect the way you expected it to be that summer, as if it were southern Europe where you woke up each morning to sunshine and unclouded skies. By that time, as Adam said, you would actually have been shocked if the temperature had dropped or a shower of rain fallen. ‘It makes you think there mightn't be an awful lot of point in going to Greece,’ he said. ‘I mean, this could be the best summer ever and we'd miss it. It's always like this in Greece.’ They'd brought food with them, quite a lot of food. Adam said the first thing would be to get old Hilbert's fridge going. Of course it was his own fridge but he was still in the habit of speaking as if , as Mary had inferred, his great-uncle might return. It must have been a strange experience for him, Rufus had thought, knowing he owned all sorts of things but not knowing quite what or where they were. They were the sort of things too which the parent generation owned, those old people that Adam, until Rufus laughed at him, had inadvertently called the grown-ups: sheets and blankets and knives and forks and pots  and pans and more complicated appurtenances of living that if one ever thought about at all one supposed one would have to get together for oneself eventually. Someone else had got it together for Adam and there it all was. They found some sheets in a walk-in cupboard, linen ones with LVS embroidered on them. The sheets felt a bit damp so Mary spread them out on the terrace in the sun to dry. They ate out there too and drank one of the bottles of wine they had brought. It was an amazing amount of wine they got through down at Wyvis Hall, and not only wine. But that first day they had only been able to afford two bottles of Anjou rosè. Later on they went all over the house, assessing what they might be able to sell, finding out just what Adam's inheritance amounted to. Rufus had been astonished by the quantities of junk in that house, the ornaments and knick-knacks and stuff like vases and candlesticks and ashtrays and glass and brass that Hilbert Verne-Smith and his wife had accumulated over the years. Mary got stroppy about it and said it was wrong what they were doing, it was a desecration. But Adam had retorted quite.reasonably that it was his now, didn't she understand that? It was as much his to do as he liked with as the sandals on his feet and the change from that fiver he had in his pocket after buying the rose. And then Mary said she felt as if Hilbert were there with them as they rifled through chests and drawers and cupboards, she could feel his presence standing behind them, looking over her shoulder. By then it was dark, it was night time. And at Wyvis Hall, below the woods and above the river, with the nearest road half a mile away and the nearest house twice as far as that, total silence prevailed. The sky was clear, the colour of a very dark blue jewel, and on the surface of the lake the stars were mirrored. The house was full of moths because they had left the doors and windows open after they put the lights on. Mary screamed when a bat flew close to her, she said bats got in your hair, a bat had got into the hair of some relative of hers and bitten her scalp. Mary's scream sounded particularly loud in that dark silence. There was a loud echo in the grounds of Wyvis Hall, Mary's scream ringing back from off the wood and walls and  starry waters, and Rufus, a town dweller who had never spent much time in the countryside, expected alarmed or annoyed people to arrive or the disconnected phone to start shrilling with complaints. Of course nothing happened. They could all have screamed the place down, Mary could have been bitten to death by bats, and no one would have come. That was part of the trouble, that was how it was that events were set in motion. If Wyvis Hall had been less isolated, less silent… Rufus had come a long way since the Goblander days and the car he got into to drive himself to the hospital he attended two mornings a week was a Mercedes, not yet a year old. At the garage where he bought petrol they offered him a complimentary sherry glass because he had bought more than thirty litres. Rufus refused. He already had two of the things clinking about on the back seat. But the sight of the glass took him back into the past again, the past which he believed he had exorcised but was now fetched back in fragments and longer scenarios by every possible association. He had sat in that locked room talking, therapist and patient both, had talked it over and over. To the site of his trauma he had returned and re-lived it. He might just as well not have bothered, for it was there still, it would be there for ever, unless one day they found how to cut memory out of the brain with a scalpel. On the back seat the two sherry glasses clinked as Rufus took a left turn rather too sharply. What they had eventually decided to sell before they went to bed that night (or the following morning really) were Great-Uncle Hilbert's do–en Waterford sherry glasses. As Adam said, none of them drank sherry and he didn't know anyone under fifty who did. Having wandered about all over the house, they had ended up in the dining room where the cabinet full of glass was. In another cupboard they found half a bottle of whisky and a dribble of brandy in the bottom of a Courvoisier bottle. There had been something extraordinarily delightful and exhilarating about sitting at that big oval mahogany table drinking whisky at two  o'clock in the morning. The moon had come up and laid a greenish iridescence on the surface of the lake. It was so bright it made the stars disappear. They had to close the window because of the insects. Then they turned out the lights, the great brass chandelier with its false candles, and the moon's lemony radiance lay as still as cloths draped over the shining wood. Adam set the twelve sherry glasses that were cut in a greek key pattern round their rims in the middle of the moonlight and said he would put them in a box tomorrow and try to sell them in Sudbury to the man who had the antique shop in Gainsborough Street that they had passed. There had been a kind of innocence about them at that stage, Rufus thought. On one level they were just marking time, spending a few days in the country at a friend's house. On another they felt (as Mary put it) like burglars, prowling about the house, discovering treasures, half-expecting the true owner to return and surprise them. ‘Suppose old Hilbert's face were to appear at the window now,’ Adam had said as they went up the bask stairs to bed. There was a window at the top, on the landing, but outside there was only the blue jewel night. They had all slept heavily, the sleep if not of the just, of the innocent and artless. None of them doubted that they would eventually get to Greece. In those early days, that last week of June, it was merely a matter of raising enough money. Not that this had been easy. The Sudbury man was not forthcoming, he had been suspicious, wanting all sorts of information about them and the glasses. ‘He thinks you've nicked them, doesn't he?’ said Mary, who hadn't come in but stayed outside in Goblander. ‘And of course he would . I mean just look at you!’ Adam's cut-off jeans with the fringed hems, she meant, and his yellow and red headband that he insisted on calling a fillet as if it were a bit of fish. And their long hair and bare feet. ‘You reckon I should put on one of Hilbert's suits, do you?’ Adam said. He never did that. Instead they drove into Hadleigh and found an antique shop man who offered to drive to Wyvis Hall  and give Adam a valuation for some of the furniture, the chandeliers and the ornaments. Two days later he actually came, an oldish man, at least sixty, and valued two of the cabinets as worth £500 apiece. When Adam heard that, he didn't want to sell, he was sure they must therefore be worth far more. The man bought a brass lantern and two little tables with the surfaces carved with flowers and fruit and the sherry glasses, giving Adam £150 for the lot. Rufus could not remember the man's name, only that he had been the second visitor to Wyvis Hall, the gardener being the first. Would he remember? If still alive, he would be in his seventies by now. He had a confused impression of coming into the dining room while the man was there and hearing him rather grudgingly assess the value of the glass cabinet. The man had said good morning and Rufus had said hallo and had returned to the task he and Mary were embarked on, covering the flagstones of the terrace with quilts from the bedrooms. The terrace faced south and got the full sun, so it was too hot to be out there by day, but in the evenings and at night it was wonderful. They fetched a lightly padded patchwork quilt from the Centaur Room, a pink candlewick from the Room Without a Name, two of white cotton from the Room of Astonishment and a counterpane of heavy yellow satin they found in a cupboard in the Pincushion Room. Mary arranged some pillows out there and cushions from the drawing room and by the time they were finished the antiques man had gone. Leaving them with £150. So that evening they went out to spend some of it. Had they been noticed and noted as they drove through the village of Nunes? Rufus had always heard that nothing can go on in a village without the gossips knowing. Perhaps this would apply if they had walked along that village street or sat on the green or drunk in the local, but they had not. For some reason they had not much liked the look of this pub, called the Fir Tree, and though he had slowed a bit as they came to it, they had not stopped. He had seldom been to the village and only once on foot but he could remember the layout of it with surprising clarity. A church that stood upon a grassy hill and to which you mounted by a flight of steep stone stairs. An avenue of yew trees. Behind it one of those screens of elms, all dead even by then of Dutch elm disease. A village street of houses and cottages, a garage, a grocer, but not a single antique shop. The green an isosceles triangle without a tree to it, but trees around the pub, the same kind as in Adam's pine wood, Rufus supposed, or very like, which the licensee or the brewery had probably thought its name required. There was the inevitable council estate, the houses painted pale green, blue, pink, as in some child's drawing, and then, round a bend in the lane where you might have expected open fields, half a dozen houses of 1950s or '60s provenance, lavishly appointed, glamorously gardened, with big garages and big cars outside them. ‘Hampstead Garden Suburb comes to Suffolk,’ Adam had said. Later on they had seen the coypu man's van parked on the front driveway of one of those houses. And they had had a discussion about it, speculating as to whether he actually lived there or was there to kill something, rats, moles, any sort of infestation. Snobbish Rufus had not thought it possible for someone like that to live there, but why not, after all? There was money to be made out of the destruction of pests in a country place. Rufus had an out-patients' clinic and then a ward round, in the afternoon a very frightened woman to see in Wimpole Street, a woman who needed his kind reassurance, his urbane ways, the proffered cigarette, the support. His first cigarette of the day he smoked while he waited, extinguishing it two minutes before she was shown in and he had to tell her that her cervical smear had shown pre-cancerous signs. Who would reassure him ? Comfort him ? No one, he thought, and despised himself for what was to him an unnatural need. The police would not necessarily assume that the bones in the graveyard were of people who had lived at Wyvis Hall, nor that those who had brought about their deaths had lived there. But it was likely . It was most probable. The existence of the cemetery was not generally known and on the lane side of the pine wood the trees were separated from the grass verge by a dose-boarded fence. They would ask a lot of questions in the village. They would make enquiries at Pytle Farm and the house called the Mill in the Pytle. By some means they would discover all the people who were likely to have called at Wyvis Hall in the capacity of tradesmen or service operatives: dustmen, meter readers, gardeners, antique dealers, perhaps — why not?— the coypu man. Adam would be questioned, was possibly being questioned at this moment. Unless he had changed a lot he would not make a good impression. Had the time come to forget the promise they had made each other, the guarantee they had given never to meet or speak? Rufus reached for the blue phone directory and turned to the V's, to Verne-Smith-Duchini, and had actually begun to dial when his patient was announced. He put the receiver back and created, forcing his lips to perform, a wide smile."
FIC FIC-G01-003 -0.75 "42 You could have been forgiven for imagining, that Peter Nicholson had undergone surgery to replace his vocal chords with a megaphone. His words boomed out, spoken with clarity and in a tone that suggested that he was keeping his words simple for the less intelligent inmates of the prison. On either side of him the warders  looked down onto the other landings, watching for any signs of unrest amongst those below. Warders on each of the individual landings also ensured that silence prevailed as he spoke. ‘As you may have heard,’ the Governor said, smoothing his hair back with one hand, ‘Whitely has been in the news lately. The media are obviously hard up for stories because they seem interested in what they refer to as our overcrowding problems here. Also, the local MP has taken it upon himself to look personally into what goes on in this prison.’ Robinson looked at Porter and raised his eyebrows quizzically. ‘To that end,’ Nicholson continued, ‘a Home Office delegation will be visiting this prison tomorrow to see how it runs and to see how well you're all cared for.’ He smiled sardonically. A murmur rose that was quickly silenced. Nicholson paused for a moment theatrically. ‘The members of this delegation will be speaking to a number of prisoners. Asking about conditions, etcetera.’ He looked around the upturned faces. ‘You may speak to them if you wish. Help them with their questions. You may have some questions for them . If you have any problems or grievances, you're quite free to tell them.’ ‘Yeah,’ murmured Porter. ‘And get our fucking heads busted by the screws when they've gone.’ Swain took a step towards him, shooting him a warning glance. ‘If any of you have any problems, at any time, you know you are free to speak to the officers in charge of your landing or to me personally,’ Nicholson continued. There was another babble of chatter, and this time it took longer to quieten. Nicholson looked around once more. His green eyes, like chips of emerald, caught the light and reflected it coldly. He brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve as he waited for the silence he required. Finally satisfied, he continued. ‘I want this prison running perfectly for these visitors,’ he said. ‘I want co-operation between you and the officers. I want the cells spotless. I want them to be impressed by what they see. I don't like people meddling in the way I run this prison and that's what they're doing. Meddling. I want them to leave here, knowing that this prison is well run and that its inmates are being adequately dealt with. I don't expect them to leave here with a catalogue of stories about what a terrible place Whitely is. As I said, you may speak to them if you wish. That is your prerogative. But bear in mind that if they hear too many bad reports, they'll disrupt the way I run this prison. And I don't like disruptions. I hope that's understood.’ He looked around him, then smoothed his hair back once more. ‘That's all.’ Nicholson and his officers turned and moved away from the landing rail, out of sight of the other prisoners. On all the landings the inmates were allowed back inside their cells. ‘Breakfast in twenty minutes, get a move on,’ said Warder Swain, slamming the door shut behind Robinson and Porter. ‘Suck this,’ rasped Porter, holding his penis in one fist. ‘Fucking cunt.’ Both men started to dress, taking it in turns to wash as best they could in the small sink perched on the cell wall. ‘I wonder if anyone will be stupid enough to tell this bunch of do-gooders the truth?’ Robinson mused, drying his face. ‘Are you joking?’ Porter muttered, fastening his grey  overall. ‘Even the screws wouldn't tell them anything. They're more frightened of Nicholson than most of the cons in here.’ Robinson nodded in agreement. ‘A tour of the prison, eh?’ he said, smiling. ‘I wonder what they'll make of our humble little home.’ ‘Probably want to move in with us,’ Porter quipped. He crossed to his locker and took out a comb, running it through his short black hair. The inside of the locker was a mosaic of photos: naked women, a team picture of Liverpool FC and a couple of postcards all vied for attention. He blew a kiss to one of the women, then closed the locker again. Robinson was sitting on the edge of the upper bunk. ‘I'll tell you one thing, Rod,’ he said, ‘and I'll bet money on it. There's at least one part of this nick they won't see. Nicholson will make sure of that.’"
FIC FIC-GUU-002 -1.03 "Chapter 6 ‘WEIGHER TAKING A box at the Coliseum tomorrow evening, Georgina Newley announced to Celia Prentisse and William Dougal. ‘Salome. It should be such fun. Now you will come, won't you?’ ‘I only wish I could,’ William said. ‘Unfortunately I've got a meeting with Verrall — he's the man who's fronting the documentary.’ ‘I see. But you can manage it, can't you, Celia?’ Celia smiled and said she could. For an instant she had been tempted to get out of the invitation with a lie. But she had an old-fashioned regard for the truth; and besides it was time that she gave Strauss another chance. ‘Ivor!’ Georgina called across the crowded room. ‘Celia can come tomorrow but William can't.’ Newley pantomimed pleasure and regret. Since Arabella had died, he had been remarkably docile with Georgina. Celia found it unnerving. ‘Poor little Goo-Goo can't come, can he?’ Georgina informed her dachshund. ‘Still, he can guard the house for Mummy and Daddy, can't he?’ The dachshund slunk out of the room. Celia felt slightly sick. She loathed the way some childless people treated their pets as surrogate children. Her loathing was partly due to the suspicion that, in a similar situation, she might do the same. ‘We shall be formal, of course,’ Georgina said reverting to her usual manner. ‘I feel very strongly that someone should set an example. After all, there are occasions and occasions.’ She moved away to talk to Eustace Tolby who had come with his wife, an elegant Asian woman. ‘Do you think,’ William asked, ‘that Salome will be an occasion or an occasion?’ ‘Probably both, if Georgina's got anything to do with it.’ He looked at his watch. ‘Let's go and see the coins.’ The collection was arranged in Newley's study, off the drawing-room. The room contained two hard chairs, a desk and an upright piano. The coins were displayed in locked glass cases. The more valuable pieces were normally kept in a safe, Newley told them. He showed them around personally, introducing the coins as though they were friends. Each exhibit had a neatly typed label. Newley thawed in the face of William's obvious interest. He discussed with mounting enthusiasm the siege coinage of Charles I. ‘There's a fascinating variety of design, even of shape. Look at the Newark half-crown for example: a lozenge. Or that octagonal shilling from Pontefract.’ William bent down to examine it. ‘That's interesting: Charles II, yet the date is 1648.’ ‘That's because —’ The telephone began to ring. ‘Damn.’ Newley picked up the study extension. As he listened, his face went grey with shock. He rang off. ‘That was the police. We've got to clear the house. A gas main's ruptured and they're afraid of an explosion. Will you tell everyone? I want to get the coins.’ He was already unlocking the cases. Celia went into the drawing-room and announced the news. The babble of conversation stopped. Georgina ran from the room, crying ‘Goo-Goo! Goo-Goo!’ Her departure created a subdued panic. People elbowed past each other to the door. Their expressions were drained of personality which gave them the family resemblance possessed by a flock of sheep. Celia tugged at William's hand. He didn't move. She glanced at him, noticing that he was staring back through the partly open door of the study. ‘Come on, William.’ He smiled at her, took her arm and led her to the window. They were the first outside. On the following night Dougal and Lorton decided against taking the car; the distance from Lorton's house to the Newleys' was only a few hundred yards. They would be less conspicuous if they walked. The streets were still sprinkled with people. It was a little after nine o'clock. Lorton was carrying a bag over his shoulder and humming under his breath. Dougal was silent. His nervousness had grown steadily all day. Tonight was the Rubicon; afterwards there would be no going back. He tried to bolster his courage by reciting the reasons for what he was doing: go per cent of them boiled down to a pressing need for money, so pressing that the bank was threatening to foreclose on his mortgage; the other lo per cent was divided between the desire to do Lorton a good turn and the feeling that the Newleys deserved whatever fate could throw at them. His courage refused to be bolstered. It was all very well conceiving these things in the abstract; the problems emerged when you tried to put them into practice. Lorton stopped humming. ‘You've done this sort of thing before, haven't you?’ he said softly. ‘Not quite like this.’ ‘Does Celia know?’ ‘Of course she doesn't,’ Dougal snapped. ‘And I don't want her to.’ The very idea made him cringe inside. He promised himself that this would be the last time he strayed beyond the legally permitted limits in life-he couldn't risk the loss of Celia. He knew her too well to think that she would allow affection to outweigh her sense of right and wrong. Sometimes he thought that her simplistic morality was part of the reason why he loved her. Perhaps alien was a more accurate word than simplistic. The road was a cul-de-sac. Dougal regretted that it was empty of pedestrians and moving cars. He had no excuse for turning back. Even when he was trying to be a criminal, the low moral fibre shone through. As they reached the privet hedge fronting the Newleys' garden, he was fervently grateful to have a last-minute reprieve: the drawing-room curtains weren't thick enough to conceal the light behind them. ‘It's all right,’ Lorton said. ‘I saw them leave, and their car's not back. Gloves.’ The pulled on the rubber gloves. Dougal felt like a surgeon at the start of an operation which was doomed to failure. Lorton opened the gate. Dougal followed him into the little garden. They walked silently along the side wall of the house. The concrete paths had been cleared of snow and ice. There was no need to talk. Both of them knew the layout of the house, and they had planned their movements in exhaustive detail. The dining-room had a Victorian sash window which was loose in its frame. Lorton slid back the catch with a thin-bladed knife and raised the lower half. Dougal heard him sigh softly with relief. There had been a strong possibility that the Newleys would have turned the security locks as well. In that case they would have had to break the glass. Lorton passed the bag to Dougal and balanced himself on the sill, with his legs outside the house. Dougal held on to him. Goo-Goo began to bark; his claws rattled on the dining-room door. Before he joined NCPR Lorton had worked in the personnel department of a firm which marketed burglar alarms. He reached down to the floor and folded back the carpet. Despite the cold, Dougal was sweating under his coat. Lorton hooked a leg over and climbed into the room. He turned back to Dougal. ‘Come in slowly. I'll keep your feet away from the pressure pad.’ According to Lorton, the Newleys' burglar-alarm system was ten or fifteen years old and long overdue for retirement. Dougal wished he could share his confidence. The reflections from the street lamps gave them just enough light to see what they were doing. Dougal took an old newspaper and a bowl from the bag. He laid out the newspaper on the carpet and stripped off the bowl's clingfilm covering. It contained a pound of raw stewing steak, laced with Seconal for good measure. Goo-Goo's greed was legendary, and he was reputed to be a messy eater. Let sleeping dogs lie. Lorton opened the door, and the dachshund rushed in, yapping furiously. Dougal caught his collar and rammed his head into the meat. The transformation from faithful guard-dog to quivering glutton was almost instantaneous. Lorton said: ‘I still think it would have been better to kill him.’ ‘No!’ Dougal hissed. They went through the hall and into the drawing-room. A single standard lamp was alight. The door to the study was ajar. Dougal was in front now. He had used an old trick last night — adapted from Conan Doyle's ‘A Scandal in Bohemia’. Lorton's phone call had succeeded perfectly, rather to Dougal's surprise. It remained to be seen whether Newley, like Irene Adler, had realized the purpose of the hoax. He ignored both the display cases and the safe which was concealed behind a framed eighteenth-century engraving of the City of London. Lorton helped him push the piano away from the wall. Dougal rolled back the carpet. Last night the piano had blocked his view, but he knew roughly where to look. He ran his hand over the parquet flooring until he found the area he wanted. Lorton passed him the knife. Dougal levered up the rectangle of hardwood. The small japanned box was still there. He lifted it out and replaced the block of wood. The box was reassuringly heavy. Lorton, who had been watching anxiously, gave him a nod of approval. They restored the carpet and the piano to their original positions. In the dining-room, Goo-Goo was just finishing his unexpected supper. He was too full to make more than a token protest when Lorton removed the bowl and rolled up the newspaper. A few seconds later, they were walking down the road. The whole operation had taken no more than a few minutes. ‘Who says crime doesn't pay?’ Lorton muttered. Dougal didn't answer. Crime has its expenses too. He was still trembling. Lorton put the box on the kitchen table and attacked the lock with an old chisel. Dougal threw away the newspaper and washed up the bowl. The lock was not designed for rough treatment. The lid flew up. Lorton emptied the contents on to the table. Dougal dried his hands and lit a cigarette. There were about thirty coins arranged in layers on cardboard trays; each tray was encased in a plastic wallet. Beneath the coins were some papers. Dougal bent down for a closer look. ‘We really need Seaby's Standard Catalogue of British Coins for this. I think that's a James I half-angel…that's a William-and-Mary half-guinea… God knows what that is…there's a rarity, an Edward VIII threepence; out of period but who cares?…ah!’ He pointed at a gold coin. ‘Fowler-Troon was right. It's the Jacobite Guinea.’ Lorton looked sharply at him. ‘I knew the bastard was bent.’ Dougal shrugged. At that moment they both heard the bang of the basement's front door. Celia was back from the opera. Lorton swept the coins together and crammed them into the box. ‘Come on,’ he said. ‘We'd better put this away.’ Dougal picked up the papers and followed Lorton upstairs. They went into the spare room and sat on the bed. Dougal unfolded one of the papers and quickly handed it to Lorton. Darling — Just a note to say I love you and I ‘m so glad. Always your Bella. Lorton leafed through the rest of the bundle, wondering if the hurt and humiliation would ever stop. All but one of the letters were in Arabella's handwriting. Most of them were short and crammed with endearments. Phrases leapt up and hit him with a force which was almost physical. I told Rod I was tired last night. I couldn't bear him fumbling over me after yesterday… The test is positive. I'm sure the baby's yours. They say women always know… He picked up the last letter. Dear Ivor, I tried to ring you before the taxi came. I'll try again from the airport, but this note will have to do if I can't get through. I ‘m delighted by your news for your sake, and for Arabella's, of course. But for God's sake don't do anything impulsive. Divorce is complicated enough in normal circumstances. Yours are anything but normal, partly because of the baby and partly because Georgina ‘s the major shareholder in the agency. And I imagine she's not a forgiving woman at the best of times. I ‘ll be back from the Gambia on Monday, and we can talk this through in detail. Until then, I really would advise you to do nothing. Even seeing Arabella might be unwise. We also need to consider Rod's position. All best wishes (to all three of you!) Eustace. He passed the solicitor's letter to Dougal, who glanced through it. ‘That's another thing Newley will want back. Tolby's letter, I mean.’ Lorton dragged his mind away from his private misery. ‘Why? Georgina already knows about the affair.’ ‘But she doesn't know that divorce was in the wind,’ Dougal said. ‘Nor the reason for it. It's a worse kind of betrayal. And she won't like the fact that Tolby's involved.’ ‘Nor do I,’ Lorton snarled. ‘Of course not.’ Dougal paused. ‘But it does give us a little more room for manoeuvre with Newley.’ ‘I don't want to manoeuvre. I want to kill him.’ When Celia got back from the opera, she was pleased to find the flat was empty. As she told herself several times, she was glad that she and William weren't living in one another 's pockets. William had said he might be late. He was meeting Gilbert Verrall, the presenter of a TV series called The Footsteps of Time. They had met originally when Verrall was writing a biography of Cromwell for which William had done much of the research. The projected documentary on the exiled Stuarts was Verrall's idea and he had commissioned William to do the spade-work. It was just as well. William seemed to have no other source of income at present. Celia had met Verrall once. He was a tall, well-groomed man in youthful middle age. He wore outsize glasses and talked excessively, usually about his work. William would be lucky to extricate himself before midnight. She tidied up the sitting-room, promising herself an early night with a book. It was curious how soon you grew used to the presence of another person in your home. The flat seemed empty without William. She kept thinking of things she wanted to tell him. For example, if he had to smoke in her flat, he could at least have the decency to empty the ashtray. The phone rang just as she had climbed into the bath. She wrapped a towel around her and ran to the sitting-room, swearing under her breath. Wet footprints trailed behind her. ‘Celia? Thank God!’ ‘Who is it?’ ‘It's me.’ The voice sounded annoyed by her question, as if instant recognition was no more than its due. ‘Something terrible's happened. Cyril's gone.’ Yorick burst into tears. Celia asked where Cyril had gone. There were goose pimples on her arm. She tried to light the gas fire but dropped the matches all over the hearthrug. ‘I don't know,’ Yorick wailed. ‘And I don't care. He just walked out with my best suitcases and half my wardrobe. I can't bear it, darling. You must come over.’ Celia ignored the last sentence. ‘Did you have a row?’ ‘Cyril was very unkind to me.’ Yorick sniffed. ‘I let him read some of The Journal of a Fallen Angel, as a special treat. No one else has seen a word. And he said some horrid things about it.’ The Journal was one of Yorick's most cherished schemes. After his comeback as a serious musician, he planned to launch a book on the astonished and admiring world. It was to be a mixture of diary, autobiography, drawings and philosophical statement. Celia had spent part of last week trying to find a publisher who was remotely interested in discussing it. ‘I'm sure he didn't mean to hurt you —’ ‘He did. He was a perfect little bitch. He called it a wank.’ Yorick, unmanned by the memory, began to cry again. Celia managed to get a lighted match to the fire. ‘Perhaps he's not capable of appreciating something like that.’ Yorick turned down this attempt at consolation. ‘Oh Celia I'm so unhappy I could kill myself. I wish he was here.’ ‘I'm sure he'll be back.’ ‘Please come round. I've been looking at the knives again. God, they're so tempting. I mean, why not? Nobody wants me. Nobody cares a damn.’ ‘We all care about you,’ Celia said firmly. ‘I think the book's going to be marvellous. Everyone who buys Mishima will want Fallen Angel as well.’ ‘No, they won't,’ Yorick wailed. ‘But I'll show them. I really will kill myself.’ Celia knew she had to take the threat seriously. Yorick had attempted suicide three times in the last four years; and the last attempt had nearly succeeded. She begrudged the sympathy he demanded from her; and she suspected that he was knowingly manipulating her. Still, she couldn't take chances. ‘Now listen, Yorick, I care. I love you very much. I'll drive over right away. Just you hang on and I'll be there.’ ‘Oh Celia, thank God —’ Over the line she heard a door slam in Yorick's flat. Yorick gasped. ‘Cyril! Darling!’ There was a clatter as he dropped the handset. The endearments and other noises which followed made it quite clear that Yorick and Cyril were exploring to the full the dramatic possibilities of a reconciliation scene. Celia hung up the phone. She warmed up the bath water. She lay in the bath, wondering when William would come home."
NWS NWS-A1X-001 -1.56 "Health: Lively young woman seeks normal life: Elaine Heath, who is severely paralysed, tells Cherrill Hicks of the daily constraints she faces By CHERRILL HICKS ELAINE HEATH likes pink eye glitter and a vodka and orange before lunch. She reads Lenin, Lawrence and supports CND. Elaine is also severely disabled by cerebral palsy: she can use neither her arms nor legs, and she can only communicate by making noises, or by operating an electric typewriter with her nose. In spite of her disability, Elaine has in the past led a remarkably active and normal life. She has been through a marriage, a divorce, and a serious love affair; learnt Russian, written regularly for a local paper and taught a young child disabled by a stroke to read again. But Elaine no longer has a close relationship to give her the support she needs. Without it, she has become a virtual prisoner in her own home; she is ruled by the clock and the hours worked by her local authority helpers. Unable to go away for weekends or holidays, she never goes out at night to dinner parties, discos or evening classes. Her life has become intolerable, she says, ever since she became a social services ‘project’. In the mornings Elaine cannot get up before 9am — which is when her care assistant starts work. In the afternoons, she must always be home at 4.30 — so that the carer can take her to the lavatory before leaving for the day. (Even her bladder has to be regulated, she points out.) In the early evening, almost as soon as she finishes her meal, it is time to have her make-up taken off and her nightdress put on — before the nurse leaves. Elaine is excited that a reporter from The Independent is visiting. She laughs, shouts, refuses to give her age and is impatient to explain her problems. It takes time and effort for her to do this: constantly tapping her nose on the typewriter is exhausting, but then so is making her noises understood. We manage, with the help of Sylvia, her care assistant. Elaine gets a lot more help than many disabled people, and some would say she is lucky not to be in residential care. She lives in a large, sunny and specially adapted local authority bungalow in Northampton: the walls of the living room are decorated with her paintings (done when she still had some use of her right hand) and her kitchen cupboard is covered with postcards, love letters from old boyfriends and local newspaper articles. Sylvia comes from nine to five each weekday, and nurses are on duty between six and 10 every evening and for a few hours at the weekend. But Elaine says that despite this help, she might as well be in an institution. Her life is a monotonous routine. As long as she is ‘fed and watered’, she writes, the local authority is satisfied: ‘It has forgotten about the quality of my life.’ Unlike other single women, Elaine cannot stay out late at night: she has to be home in time to be put to bed by a nurse. She can never go out and meet men; and, after two close relationships, the prospect of staying single depresses her. ‘I desperately want to love and be loved,’ she types with her nose. ‘I'm terrified of growing old alone. Life is for sharing.’ Sylvia is one of the few people who has learnt to interpret Elaine's noises. She has never cared for a disabled person before, but there is a natural love and empathy between them: she hugs Elaine a lot and they are very close. ‘My old mum,’ Elaine calls her. ‘I would describe Elaine as beautiful with sexy legs,’ jokes Sylvia. And, more seriously: ‘I try to do things the way she wants. Staff who have worked in the homes become institutionalised; they say this is the way we've always done it. But if you employ someone in your house, you want them to do it your way, not theirs.’ The nurses who come in the evenings and at weekends are from an agency -which can mean, for Elaine, a new face every night of the week. Every new nurse needs detailed instructions about how to care for her — down to details such as pulling her bra on properly and making sure she is dry before getting her dressed. ‘Please treat me normally. I'm not daft. My brain is perfectly unimpaired,’ writes Elaine at the end of her list. The nurses are nice, well-intentioned young girls who do their best. But because they have to leave by 10pm, all they have time for are the basic tasks, such as cooking dinner, feeding Elaine, taking off her make-up and getting her ready for bed. Many of them are not used to disabled people, and, being temporary, they rarely get to know her anyway. ‘Elaine can't talk and that can be very disconcerting for the nurses,’ says Sylvia. Elaine interrupts. She does not need nurses in uniform, she almost shouts: just because she is disabled, it does not mean she is medically ill. There is no conversation with the nurses, she says. ‘My day ends at five. The shutters come down.’ When they leave, Elaine has no professional support until Sylvia comes in the morning. But for the help of a friend who sleeps in the bungalow at night, and who can help her go to the toilet if she needs to, she says she would have to go into a home. Elaine went into a home last week when Sylvia was on holiday. She says she would rather die than do that again. She may not have any speech, but she has no problems in making her feelings clear: she wails at the memory. Sylvia translates her noises: ‘It was hell on earth.’ The home had set times for the toilet: 9am, 3pm, and 9pm. ‘They had their own routine,’ says Sylvia. Life hasn't always been so dull for Elaine: she has managed, in the past, to survive the same upheavals as many able-bodied people. Sent away to boarding school when she was six (she rarely sees her family now), she got three A- levels at college and shortly after got married: a mistake, she now realises, but she was pregnant at the time. She lost the baby and she and her husband divorced three years later. It was then that she met ‘the love of my life’: he answered an ad she placed in the local paper for someone to read to her. ‘He was a middle-aged guy who thought he was coming to read to a sweet old lady,’ she writes. They fell in love; eventually he moved in. ‘My life was a dream.’ The relationship ended after five years: her lover grew too tired to cope with caring for her. He lives in the same town and it still hurts her to see him. For a while Elaine was cared for by young volunteers who used to come and stay with her for a few months at a time. But the volunteers moved on — to college or jobs — and she found the change unsettling. In 1986 she contacted her local authority for help; it was then, she says, that her life changed for the worse. Northampton social services department says the problem is one of finding and hiring the right quality people. ‘Northampton is an expanding area and wages for care assistants cannot match those to be found in industry,’ says Bill Aitken, the department's operations manager. He is clearly doing his best to make Elaine's life more bearable, to create the schemes and find the care assistants with the commitment needed to befriend her, on the funds available. Elaine desperately wants to be free: free to fall in love, work hard and have fun. All she is asking for, she says, is to live the same kind of life as everyone else. This would only be possible if she had intensive 24-hour cover: if she could employ carers both night and day who could be flexible enough to adapt to her needs rather than vice versa. ‘Perhaps I am being selfish,’ she writes. ‘But my life as it is now isn't worth living. It's a living death. I've already experienced a full life and now it's been taken away.’ Elaine is an extraordinary woman: clever, lively and capable of leading a full life. But she is rapidly growing demoralised by her situation and is increasingly disinclined to do very much. She has even given up her beloved Russian, learnt painstakingly with the help of an old Cyrillic typewriter. ‘She laughs a lot. She seems like a very happy person,’ says Sylvia. ‘But it's false — it hides a lot of sadness.’"
NWS NWS-A7Y-002 -1.21 "Everyone's a capitalist The socialist councillor was intent on buying up Sheffield; and the YMCA, reports Geoffrey Beattie, is hoping to make a quick buck for Christmas. HE WAS a socialist all right. You could tell by his Scottish accent and his tie. This may have been a conservative blue colour with an elegant stripe down the middle of it, but it was all skew-whiff. And then there were his eyes, burning with a fervour, an intensity, as if he had his prey in his sights. Hadn't he already described himself as ‘a political animal’—‘and with £19.50p attendance money a day as a Sheffield councillor, on which I'm dependent by the way, I'd need to be a political animal.’ And here he was with his eyes burning bright. ‘Tiger, tiger, burning bright.’ The lines stayed with me. And as I looked at Jimmy Boyce, ex-industrial tiler, ex-foundry worker, ex-redundant foundry worker, I realised that it really was the law of the jungle here tonight. The jungle of the night. My eyes flitted around the table. Here they all were — business, commerce, the big banks. The political animal's eyes were burning again. ‘I want the Midland Bank.’ Nationalise the banks? Outrageous! But he didn't want to nationalise them, he just wanted them — for himself. There was a long gap. His neighbour cleared his throat. His neighbour was the sales manager of the Midland Bank in Sheffield. He looked at Jimmy Boyce, or rather he looked at his tie — all red and blue, almost patriotic, and yet the tie still hung at that curious angle. It reminded him of shop stewards with their sleeves rolled up in those endless conferences when it was said that the country was being held to ransom. It reminded him of the big shots in the trade union movement having sandwiches at Number 10 all those years ago. ‘Never!’ he said as his mind returned to the present. He cleared his throat again. This time it wasn't so much a reflex action, an attempt to remove something nasty somewhere down his windpipe, as a deliberate social signal. It seemed to be saying: ‘You and who else?’, or ‘Do you think that you're really big enough?.’ It acted as both a challenge and a rebuff. It did its job. Jimmy paused momentarily. ‘But I don't want to overstretch myself.’ The man from the Midland Bank looked rather pleased with himself. His throat had stopped tickling, but then again perhaps it never had. Yet this was no place for the faint hearted, and Jimmy knew it. ‘What the hell. It's for the people. I'll go for it. I've been through it all. I was made redundant less than a year after I became a Sheffield city councillor, and I've never believed in those sorts of coincidences. You have to fight and fight again.’ Now, it wasn't just the man from the Midland Bank who was clearing his throat. Everyone in the board room was either clearing his throat, or shifting position in his seat, or doing both at the same time, which is actually rather difficult. Except Jimmy Boyce, that is. Jimmy's audacious move was making everyone feel uncomfortable, except himself. He had finally settled to his fate: socialist entrepreneur of the grand scale. ‘It's early days yet,’ said Colin Appleby from the Midland, ‘early days’. He seemed to be saying it as much to convince himself as to convince all the rest. They were still busy with their ticklish coughs. But it was now Colin Appleby's move. Fate had got him as far as a leading Sheffield estate agents, Blundells. Colin gave that smile of familiarity, that smile of superiority, that certain smile that says it all. ‘Ah, Mike's place. Yes, I am interested in that. I think I will purchase it.’ It was like a red rag to a big, black bull. Or, given that we were in a quasi-political domain, a black flag to a red bull. ‘I want to buy up all of the city,’ said Jimmy. The statement startled no one. ‘I'll be happy with Mike's place for the moment,’ said Colin, again rubbing in that he knew a thing or two about some of Sheffield's leading businesses, and that there is no substitute for that kind of detailed and expert and intimate knowledge. But now it was time for some wheeling and dealing. Shares in the Sheffield Development Corporation were up for sale. Richard Holmes, the sales and marketing officer of the YMCA in Sheffield, had managed to get his hands on some. He needed to raise capital fast. The man from the Midland Bank said he hadn't the kind of money required. He would have liked to help him out, but… All eyes were now on Jimmy Boyce. He had the capital, but did he have the inclination to buy into yet another business in order to help one of the managers out? The minimum bid was established. Richard assumed that it would be doubled. ‘It would be a bargain at twice that price.’ Nobody doubted him, or failed to recognise his temporary financial embarrassment. It's just that they were not inclined to help him out. ‘If you can't stand the heat, Richard, old boy,’ an anonymous voice said. Jimmy, however, did show some interest. ‘I'm always in search of a bargain, sonny — for the people, you understand,’ he added after yet another of those pauses that suggested it might have been an after-thought. He eventually offered Richard £10 more than the asking price. ‘Typical Socialist,’ someone muttered. Jimmy heard the jibe. ‘I'm a Scot, after all. Never forget that, sonny. And I'm not the one with all the money — just look at the pile that Colin Appleby's got. A typical bloody banker, if you ask me. Not a bit of wonder the country's in the state that it's in.’ For readers already familiar with the transmogrification of Sheffield from the Socialist Republic of South Yorkshire to something altogether more ‘pragmatic’, you could be forgiven for believing that the drama unfolding around the boardroom table was just one more step along this route, with committed socialists playing the stock market with the best of them. But this was just a game, and before some one points out that the stock market is itself just a game (for somewhat privileged people), I should add that this was just a family game being marketed in Sheffield for Christmas. It's called Sheffield Shares, a form of Monopoly for the late eighties. Local companies are bought and sold, and the involvement and interest that the game generates, as I discovered, is quite intense. Richard Holmes of the Sheffield YMCA told me about the background to the game. The idea is that Sheffield companies pay real money for the privilege of being squares on the game — for the obvious advertising benefits. The Midland Bank, as the major sponsor, is paying £20,000 for the privilege of being two corners in the game, and having its name and logo on all the notes used in the game. The sponsorship money for the 30 squares amounted to £150,000 and paid all the production and advertising costs for the game. All subsequent profits from sales of the game, which retails at £13.99, go directly to the YMCA for its work in the community in Sheffield. Several other British towns and cities are already committed to developing their own version of this game, with all profits going to the local YMCA. Keith Wells, general secretary of the Sheffield YMCA, and the fourth player that night, explained that the idea originated in Norway, where 95 towns had produced the game to finance their local YMCA. In the United Kingdom, Derry/Londonderry was the first and their game was called The Maiden City, presumably in order not to alienate that half of the community which did not approve of either the name Derry or Londonderry. Keith Wells pointed out that the title Sheffield Shares is deliberately ambiguous — it can be taken to mean Sheffield's shares, as in ‘shares’ which are up for grabs by keen or greedy speculators (my interpretation), but it can also mean Sheffield shares as in ‘shares its wealth’—‘and that's basically what we are trying to initiate here. We're trying to get big, local companies to plough some of their profits back into the community through the work of the YMCA.’ So what kind of advertising do the companies get for their money? On the share cards used in the game, not only the name of the company is printed, but also some succinct message about the firm. Such messages could (at a push) be used by players to help them promote the value of the shares in that company in the interminable rounds of wheeling and dealing. As in ‘How would you like to buy some shares in Stocksbridge Engineering Works —‘Manufacturers of high integrity alloy, stainless and re-melted steels for the aerospace, energy, bearing and automotive industries. The Strength Behind Engineering Progress’.’ Or the more punchy ‘How would you like to buy some shares in Gibbs Building Contractors —‘Don't pick your contractor/ By throwing a dice/ Bring GIBBS into the game/ Ask us for a price’.’ Even if it is not read out in the endless rounds of buying and selling shares, then the message, passive though it might be, should still find its way into the living rooms of a high proportion of homes in the Sheffield region. The plan is to sell 20,000 games in Sheffield over the Christmas period that is, 1 in 20 homes. There are 4,000 advance orders. A lot of families, it is hoped, are going to be hearing or reading about Stocksbridge Engineering Works, Gibbs Building Contractors, and a few other Sheffield firms this Christmas. Colin Appleby, of the Midland Bank, is extremely pleased with the way the game has turned out. He says that as well as being the major sponsor of the game, the Midland is the largest private sector employer in Sheffield, and the game provided another opportunity for the bank to demonstrate that it is prepared to invest in the city. But what sort of person will make a good player at Sheffield Shares? I'd already noted the very different methods of the four who had assembled. It would have taken a blind man, or a very naive one, not to spot some connection between their style of play and the kinds of responsibilities and decisions they have to make in the outside world. I asked Colin Appleby first. ‘I liked Jimmy Boyce's play for his quick decisions. Richard Holmes was something of an expert at the game, but he ended up as a down-and-out by the end. I think the main ingredient for success is that you have to have a good sense of timing. There is nothing wrong with being a bit conservative and building up financial resources, and not just jumping straight in. Jimmy had a lot of flair but it didn't help him win.’ Indeed it did not. Colin's conservativism and steady timing had won him second place. Richard Holmes thought that ‘the best man usually wins,’ despite the fact that he was last. Jimmy Boyce put it down nearly all to luck —‘with negotiation skills being very important.’ Jimmy said he really enjoyed playing, but his slight worry about it was that at £13.99 it might prove expensive for the unemployed. But what did the winner of the game actually think — Keith Wells, the man who had brought the game to England but had never actually played it before? There was a long pause, the kind of pause that winners always display as they create a little time to savour their victory. ‘It's basically a fine balance between being a good steward of what you have already acquired, and being something of a visionary.

NWS NWS-AHC-004 -1.68 "Odd Man Out: The man who carries the can By MARTYN HARRIS AT 1.15 I call the AA to ask can I borrow a patrolman for the afternoon, and at 1.45 he's at the door with sewn-in trouser creases and a shiny van, packed tight as an egg with tools and spares. ‘Mark Roke,’ he says, offering a clean hand. The man who can. The speed may be just because I'm press, of course— Which? magazine said this week the AA is slowest of the big motoring organisations to answer a call. ‘But we always try to get the car going,’ says Mark. ‘A lot of them that works on commission just say there's nothing they can do and call in the tow-truck.’ Not that he will name any names. He's a very nice man. On our first call, from a dreadlocked Rastaman, we are faced with a clapped-out Mini Clubman. Mark says that if it's a fuel leak I can chuck down a lighted match, but I can tell he's only joking. Lots of people with old bangers use the AA instead of basic maintenance, and this is the Rastaman's second call-out of the day for a flat battery. Mark props the rusted bonnet of the Mini with an iron bar, jump-starts it with a pair of wrist-thick wires, and we are away. ‘He won't get far, so if he turns left at these lights we go right,’ says Mark, but it's only his sense of humour showing. As the dash-mounted computer pecks out our next job on its paper roll, Mark runs through his daily routine for me. Commonest call-outs are flat batteries first thing in the morning, flat tyres any time, and at weekends the woman shopper with her keys locked in the car. Effecting an entry, this is called, and a job for Slim Jim, the flexible steel ruler owned by every mechanic and car thief, which, shoved down the side of the driver's door glass, will open anything from a Jeep to a Jaguar. JOB two is a Fiat Panda in Finchley, losing power on hills according to the owner. ‘Frayed clutch cable most likely,’ says Mark before we pull up and I'm profoundly impressed when we find it is. Job three is a scatty old lady with an NS on the computer roll, meaning non-start, and an automatic garage door. ‘Careful you press the right button,’ says Mark. ‘I rang what I thought was the doorbell once and nearly cut this geezer's Mercedes in half with his up-and-over.’ The scatty lady has left her passenger door fractionally open all night and the courtesy light has drained the battery, which takes Mark about two seconds to figure. ‘Always pays to think simple.’ For a soft-shoulder Sunday mechanic like me it would have taken all day, but most of the jobs are incredibly simple to the man who can, who served his time with Ford and spent years at London Transport. People like me are a menace to the AA men, calling them out on Sunday afternoon to rebuild engines that we idly began to dismantle on Sunday morning. ‘Either they hands you a boxful of bits and says ‘These seem to be left over’ or they swear they never touched the car, when you can see all the leads are on back-to-front.’ MEMBERS! They call you out to snowswept motorway verges at four in the morning, talk to you through a quarter-inch crack in the window and drive off when you've finished, without a word. Single women get priority from the AA, so many's the girl will hide her boyfriend behind the hedge to get a faster call-out. Get stuck into an engine without confiscating the car keys, and plenty of drivers will start the motor out of curiosity to see what an AA man looks like without any hands. When you apply to become an AA man they give you six broken cars to get started in half-an-hour. Five minutes per car, but Mark hardly takes more than 15 seconds over our jobs, and nobody waits more than 30 minutes. The only technical challenge of the day is at the home of a lawyer, whose Peugeot 405 has conked out at the bottom of a steep drive. Mark eliminates starter motor, battery, alternator, and ignition coil, and fixes in the end on an obscure switch which isolates the electrics from the gearbox and would have taken me a month to find — but, for the man who can, about three minutes. Last job is an ancient Granada with a jammed starter, driven by another man who has already called the AA once today. Mark frees the starter with a swift smack from the iron bar, which is the only tool I see him use all day, and gently ticks off the driver, who seems lacking in gratitude or humility. ‘You will go and get another motor this time now, won't you?’ And then, as he drives away: ‘We'll see him again soon, don't worry.’ Members!"
NWS NWS-AHC-009 -0.69 "The Grand National: My best chance yet By Peter Scudamore AN OUNCE of luck is always welcome in racing and I have to admit that I feel the most fortunate man around this morning having been asked to ride Docklands Express in the Grand National — a race I have never won. The fact is that if I hadn't taken part in the BBC television previews of the big event I would probably be riding my old friend Bonanza Boy. The whole story is that I was asked to ride Docklands Express, Cool Ground, Auntie Dot and Bonanza Boy in home gallops for the television cameras and then to compare the quartet. Not many other jockeys are so lucky. Even leading up to the filming, there were doubts about Adrian Maguire riding Cool Ground as he had a previous tie to Omerta. Also, Anthony Tory, regular jockey for Docklands Express, had been having trouble with his shoulder for a while, and Mark Perrett, another of the horse's regular riders, had been claimed for Rubika. I can remember vividly the whole episode with Docklands Express. It was our first morning of filming and when I rode the horse I really liked him. He felt great, he worked with class and he had the right attitude. I thought: ‘This is the one.’ When we had finished filming I said to Kim Bailey, the trainer: ‘If you ever need somebody to ride this little horse, I would love to be considered.’ How quickly things change in racing and change they certainly have this week. When I rode Docklands Express in his work, I was thinking I would probably be having my fourth Grand National ride on Bonanza Boy — then there were reports of rain across the country, which made me feel quite satisfied to be on Martin Pipe's runner. He knows his way around the course and, with any luck, I felt the ground would come up soft. However, when I got to Liverpool on Thursday and saw the state of the ground, instead of thinking about such horses as Laura's Beau, Rubika and Cool Ground as the major chances, suddenly it was the good-ground types such as Docklands Express who re-entered calculations. When I sat on Cool Ground I was impressed with him too. He had not been prepared for Cheltenham the same as some horses are, because there had been a last-minute change of plan for him and he would not have been really galloped hard. Racing against other horses is an entirely different thing from riding horses in their work and it is not always the ones who work the best that are necessarily the winners. In fact, Cool Ground worked with Romany King and Sirrah Jay, and they actually worked better than he did. Although, when we came back from one of our canters, Cool Ground was very bright. He really marched in and he pulled 20 lengths ahead of the other two just walking. He is in great form. The other interesting runner I rode was Auntie Dot, particularly as she has the advantage of being schooled over a National-type fence on her trainer John Webber's gallops. With the TV cameras there, Julian Wilson asked Mr Webber if I could pop her over the fence. I joked about a jockey needing a large port and brandy to do that sort of thing cold in the morning — and besides we might be risking the horse suffering a mishap. ‘You let me worry about any injuries my horse might suffer,’ said Mr Webber. I thought to myself: ‘Oh no’ but Auntie Dot went into the fence and was brilliant at it. Originally I thought the ground might be too soft for her, making it a real test of stamina, and we know that she only just gets the trip. But as the ground is a lot quicker now, she must have a bright chance. Bonanza Boy, one of my old favourites, has been a remarkable horse over the years and I am a touch sad in having to desert him for a horse I consider to have a better chance. But Martin Pipe is a realist, and never for a moment did he stand in my way when the Docklands Express ride came up. Bonanza Boy will have blinkers back on and this may assist him. He knows the place so well and is a real hardy customer. I suppose I am in a good position to weigh up the prospects of the major contenders in today's race, at least, and I have no hesitation in declaring my delight at being on Docklands Express. On the Form Book and after riding him, I consider Docklands Express to be a first-class prospect. Twin Oaks looks a great type for the fences and may be the hardest to beat but I also have a healthy respect for Cool Ground and Brown Windsor. This racing game can be funny, can't it? I set off as a television test pilot and have ended up with my best-ever chance of winning the race."
NWS NWS-AL5-004 -1.13 "Friday Matters: Marital strife comes out in the wash By SUZANNE LOWRY FRENCH magazines love telling their women readers that while French lovers may be romantic, French husbands are scruffy, barely domesticated louts who don't clean their teeth, don't shave at weekends and won't use deodorants. The direst accusations always seem to centre on husbandly refusal to wash or change underwear and a tendency to wear socks in bed. If there is any truth in this colourful myth, how do the women stand it? How about their own standards? The French, notoriously obsessed with appearances, are disinclined to wash their dirty linen in public. But sociologist Jean-Claude Kausmann has found out what they are doing with it in private in a major piece of research that takes the lid off the French marital laundry basket. He has definitively discovered what happens to socks and underwear once the wearers have been persuaded to shed them, how co-habiting men and women care for their most intimate garments, and how couples come to joint terms with the washing machine — or fail to. His two-year study of 20 couples reveals that the humble, often smelly male sock is indeed at the centre of a secret linen war being waged up and down the land. ‘The sock is a highly sensitive conjugal object,’ he declares in La Trame Conjugale (a cunning title; la trame means framework, it can also mean linen). Socks are often at the centre of the mini-wars at which couples engage. For instance, one of the bitterest reproaches from a wife to an untidy husband is: ‘You might at least put away your socks.’ Socks smell and get lost. They are also slightly ridiculous and can turn anger and tears to laughter very quickly. But beware, says Kausmann. This laughter may not be a safety valve reducing tension, but a device to conceal an urge to violence. Kausmann is not a fetishist and is much more interested in the couple's relationship than in the efficiency of soap powder. But he believes that linen is the ideal instrument by which to probe the hidden depths of marital life. Linen ‘is everywhere, all the time, stuck to the couple like their skin’, he writes. It is ‘a reminder of the feminine role modified by ideas of equality’. It symbolises the subjugation of the individual to the joint personality. At all times, he claims, linen bears the traces of the war between the partners. Dirty washing makes an equal division of tasks impossible, even for those couples who wish to achieve it. Kausmann shows how far we have come from the 19th century, when a girl's linen box, full of beautifully embroidered monogrammed sheets, was part of her dowry. (Shreds of these hoards can now be picked over in provincial brocante shops, brave remnants of another, more confident age.) Such brides had cared for their treasure. These days laundry should be easier thanks to machines. Even a man can do it. Ironing is another matter. Given that Paris shop windows are piled with ever more beautiful bed and table linen, there must be plenty of that to do. Young bourgeois wives, I am told, solved the problem by heaving the basket home to mother, who is still likely to have a bonne to wash it. Some of Kausmann's female subjects did likewise, others actually liked washing; some even ironed socks. But most others were desperate to avoid it. One was even teaching her husband to do it. Some women in the study were obsessional about cleanliness and tidiness. One insisted on cleanliness but didn't care about tidiness, while her husband didn't care about cleanliness but was fanatical about tidiness. Sabine begins the day by making her husband look at a pile of dirty washing by the bed. Anne-Sophie, on the other hand, lives a life wracked by doubt because she can never decide whether a garment is dirty or not. Each time she tries to judge she suffers ‘a feeling of agitation and indeed anguish’. Her chief horror is to have clothes lying around that are neither one thing nor the other. She inspects the scene, she smells the garment. Eventually she puts it away, deciding not to wash it because she hates ironing. But the malaise persists and all day she feels ‘destabilised’. One of the most vexing problems is when and how to mingle the male and female laundry. Some couples mix it, some don't. One couple, alas, put too much strain on their new relationship by buying a washing machine. But then they couldn't bear the clothes to go in together. They tried having two machines but never had enough laundry to justify running them both. They could reach no sane accommodation about sharing and are, Kausmann reports, no longer together. Other families also experience other territorial difficulties. Elaine cannot bear the thought of her husband using her handkerchief. While Sabine sees no need to wash table napkins after one party: ‘That would be stupid. They are not dirty because people have spat on them once.’ Leon and Madelaine, meanwhile, have chairs on either side of their bed on which to put their respective clothes. They pile up. Madelaine refuses to put Leon's away. This bothers him deep down. He believes it is her job. Out loud, he complains about the pile on her chair. She resents this. When tasks are shared, it can be even worse: Anne and Pat both do the laundry but have waged a nine-year guerrilla war over the temperature of the water in the machine. Anne wants it at 30 degrees, Pat at 60 degrees. The dispute now ‘rules their existence’. Although they rarely speak about it. Pat puts his work clothes aside, so he can wash them at 60 degrees. But Anne then does them at 30 degrees. After she has washed, dried and ironed the clothes, he quietly puts them all back in the machine at 60 degrees. Jean-Claude Kausmann doesn't get involved in laundering in his own home — but he does do all the shopping and cooking. And far from showing that the couple is going out of fashion in France, he feels his research demonstrates that it is still at the centre of people's dreams. It is just more and more complex and difficult to achieve the right water temperature."
NWS NWS-CH3-015 -1.97 "FOR GOD'S SAKE PICK THESE MEN ALF RAMSEY GIVES IT TO YOU STRAIGHT Taylor must go for Wright and Beardo TONY STENSON GRAHAM TAYLOR now has a second chance to get it Wright for England! No one has to tell the England manager he got it terribly wrong with his selection for the European championship matches in Sweden. He was given more than enough encouragement to pick players like Arsenal's 30-goal Ian Wright — but he ignored all the cries. I plead with him to get it right this time for his own sake. Because if his squad selection today for next week's friendly in Spain fails, then by God he will feel the full wrath of his critics — and no one need tell me how that feels. I can assure Graham he will be the loneliest man in football, reviled by people who haven't the first clue about the game, but who will go right along with the bloodsuckers willing him to fail. When he names the most-important squad of his England career — the one that could make or break him — I do hope he includes the names of Wright and Everton's Peter Beardsley. Taylor must bury any recriminations about Beardsley turning his back on England. Surprise You pick your best players and there is little doubt on current form that Beardsley is one of England's finest forwards. Beardsley would be my surprise choice for England's game in Santander next Wednesday, but I also think there should be a place for Wright. I would ignore the claims of Nottingham Forest's Nigel Clough and Southampton's Matthew Le Tissier, but I'll explain why later. Beardsley? I can hear a chuckle in some quarters but I feel he never let England down. He was dropped too early — but instead of sulking he has returned with his old fire. Beardsley and David Platt would provide a very mobile midfield that also has an eye for goals. Wright, a player I've admired since he made a name for himself at Crystal Palace, was strangely ignored for the European championship finals. I say strangely because finishing as the League's top striker surely warrants a travelling place even if only for experience. Everyone knew Gary Lineker was saying farewell to international football and a new dawn was beckoning. Wright could have sat, watched, learned and even been given a short burst to discover again what the international arena is all about. Taylor now has a problem. Does he go for new tactics or again show faith in the squad he took to Sweden? I see Blackburn's £3.6million man Alan Shearer again being part of Graham's thoughts, which at the moment seem to be pointing towards the long ball game. Shearer, an instant hit at Blackburn, has yet to convince me. He's good. Brilliant? I am not yet sure. From what I've seen and heard, Graham seems to be looking to a big man with the ball aimed for the sky. There's nothing wrong in that belief provided you do it properly. There's no half measures to playing this way. It's all or nothing and being strong enough to take the flak if things go wrong. Mobile I was my own man and played the way I believed because we lacked talent in certain areas. Jack Charlton, one of my team of 1966, turns his back to criticism as manager of the Republic of Ireland. He does it his way and that's how a manager, be it at club or international level, should act. Sadly for Graham we haven't got too many players of true international quality to spearhead his attack this way. There aren't too many big, strong, mobile strikers with the skill to hold the ball and allow the midfield to feed off him. Calls for Le Tissier come from some quarters because of his good partnership with Shearer while at Southampton. I don't agree. Le Tissier is a very good club player but he has yet to prove himself. I feel he needs to be in a winning side, one brimming with confidence before he sparkles. At the moment we haven't got an England side to fit his needs. Clough is someone I've long admired, a tremendous club player who no doubt makes his dad Brian very proud. I'm trying not to be unkind but I doubt whether he has the requirements for international football and I wouldn't be surprised if he's missing from next week's squad. To ensure it won't be a pain in Spain I expect Graham to rely on his tested experienced players and sprinkle them with a blend of youth. I'd like to think Beardsley and Wright will get the nod and Graham doesn't get it wrong again. HE'S THE TOPS STRIKER Peter Beardsley has this season rediscovered his best form with Everton after being dropped too early by England. DAVID PLATT would be a hit with Beardsley IAN WRIGHT should have gone to Sweden with England this summer and now deserves a recall for the friendly in Spain. SHEARER: Taylor choice LE TISSIER: Doesn't fit in"
NWS NWS-K4S-102 -1.67 "THE future of Darlington is assured, according to chief scout Barrie Geldart. The former Middlesbrough chief scout came to Feethams in May 1989, during the reign of far-sighted Brian Little, and with no real basis to work on. The transformation has been incredible, with a real flow of talent coming through. Geldart says: ‘When I arrived, there was only one schoolboy on the staff, and six YTS lads with no team to play in. ‘They were virtually left to fend for themselves, and, sadly, they had no chance to make an impact. We had to let them go.’ He hesitates, and waves a hand at the board on the wall behind him. On it are written the details of over 30 schoolboy and YTS players, all signed by the Quakers with a chance of making the grade. ‘We have 17 schoolboys signed on now, and there will be a further intake of 13 YTS lads during the summer. ‘We're always out and about watching games. I've got several people helping me all over the area, and I watch three or four games on a Sunday myself.’ As well as those on the board, Geldart picks up a thick wad of letters from boys who will be invited to the club's Centre of Excellence, which takes place over two sessions every Thursday night. ‘There are 20 kids to a session, with each course lasting four weeks. A lad has a week to settle in, then another three weeks to show us what he can do. ‘Parents and teachers can write to me, and tell me about their kids. We will take a look at them. Whatever happens, they will enjoy themselves. ‘This year, five boys two under 12s and three under 13s are going for training with the County FA regional squad, and for a club this size, it's brilliant. ‘We've got a conveyor belt of talent coming through now. We have an under 16 side in the Yorkshire Conference on a Sunday morning, and I reckon three lads in there are going all the way. ‘They've already played in the Northern Intermediate League for under 19s, and they haven't left school yet. As well as those two teams, we can play friendlies at any level, from under tens onwards. ‘We are on a par with anyone in the North-East. Even though Darlington is a small club, this is still a prolific area for producing talent, and even after the big clubs have had their pick, there is still enough for us. ‘Our Centre of Excellence on Thursday nights for boys from ten to 14 helps us to compete. ‘They get first-class coaching. All the first team players help out on Tuesdays and Thursdays, and we have specialist coaches coming in. ‘The biggest thing we can offer them is early progress. Fifteen-year-olds are playing against lads a year older, the under 16s play in the under 19s, while some of the 17-year-olds have been playing in the Midland League for our reserves. ‘As everyone knows now, lads like Sean Gregan are playing in the first team and will be regulars in the future.’ The club's YTS scheme is impressive. ‘It's not only football,’ says Geldart. ‘They gain job experience at the Dolphin Centre, and have first aid courses with our physio Nigel Carnell. ‘Their education is taken care of at Longlands College one day a week. They can take lessons of their own choosing, and some lads are aiming for degrees. ‘There is a definite path to the first team for these kids. There were three of them in the first team at Peterborough last Saturday, and on Tuesday night young Adam Reed was in the squad. ‘There is no better place to come to than Feethams. Anyone who wants to play football and reach the Football League has an ideal chance here. ‘With our financial position, it's a necessity for the club to have good young players coming through. ‘If they have what it takes, then they will get their chance early. Lads like Gregan, Sunley and Isaacs are all putting themselves in the shop window, and some day a big club will come and get them. ‘The senior dressing room is getting younger, and the average age is down to 21. These kids will save the club a fortune eventually.’ Geldart drools with enthusiasm when he speaks of some of the players who have broken into the first team or are on the verge. ‘Young Gregan can go all the way. He's a midfield player really, because he is very good on the ball, and he can't express himself at centre half. I can see him playing an anchor role in midfield. ‘Mark Sunley is another. I signed him for Middlesbrough, and I jumped at the chance to sign him again here. He loves to attack the ball, and is happier in the centre of defence instead of at full back.’ Those two Darlington fans know about, but there are many, many more. ‘Adam Reed will turn out to be another Gregan. He has come on tremendously, and is still only 16. ‘Jimmy Montgomery comes in one day a week to coach the goalkeepers, and he raves about young Adrian Swan. He says he is the best young goalkeeper by far in all the North-East clubs.’ There are more Matthew Scollett, Richard Cooper and Simon Shaw. All unknowns to the fans, but perhaps not for much longer. ‘People should come and see the progress the club has made at Hundens Lane on Saturdays or at Rothmans on Sundays.’ But apart from a supply of talent, Geldart also needs hard cash. ‘We need a sponsor to help with travel expenses and the like. It would be great to take the lads to international tournaments, because playing against foreign teams brings them on no end. They learn quickly, and they bond together. ‘Anybody who wants to help out that way can come along and see the kids for themselves. They won't be disappointed. Manager Ray Hankin, meanwhile, is prepared to give the youngsters a chance in the first team before the end of the season. With relegation fast becoming a foregone conclusion, Hankin has nothing to lose by giving teenagers an outing. Sean Gregan, Lee Ellison and Anthony Isaacs all products of the youth policy, have all done well in the first team this season. Geldart was mainly responsible for the Boro side that reached the FA Youth Cup final three years ago. ‘Nine players in that side appeared for the first team later. ‘I know I can do the same here, and I've got the feeling that a lot of people want to help me. ‘They travel all over the North-East watching matches, marking pitches and putting nets up, entirely voluntary the only payment they get is a match ticket. ‘Things are really beginning to roll now, and I've never been so happy. And the results are there to see. Lads in the first team, while the kids are drawing at places like Sheffield Wednesday, Leeds and Sunderland. That shouldn't happen, but it is. ‘The youth policy is now firmly on the way, and no matter who comes to take charge, it's all set up for them’"
NWS NWS-K4Y-054 -1.15 "CHRISTOPHER Gable says he did not set out to deliberately shock. Yet he was well aware that tampering with the traditional approach to Swan Lake would ruffle a few feathers. What he wasn't expecting was a Sunday newspaper preview article claiming Northern Ballet Theatre's new staging of Swan Lake was steamy, erotic stuff with a hint of oral sex. More dirty duck than sensual swan was the impression given. The result of this advance publicity not wildly accurate as it turns out spelt potential disaster for NBT which prides itself on making its work more accessible to youngsters. Worried parents fretted that their children would be exposed to X-rated happenings. A Darlington councillor who, of course, hadn't seen the production called for it to be banned. The threat of cancelled bookings hung in the air. Backstage at Leeds Grand Theatre, a few days after Swan Lake's royal premiere elicited a five-minute standing ovation from the audience, Gable talks long and intelligently about the controversial production. You'd expect the unhelpful advance publicity to make him wary of the Press. Not at all. He has operated an ‘open door’ policy since taking over as NBT's artistic director and will continue to do so. If people are going to have their opinions formed by what they read in the tabloids, he feels sorry for them. A relatively simple question like ‘Are you a happy man?’(one assumes he must be in the wake of the successful opening) is followed by a 15 minute answer. Gable replies that to be honest he's surprised, although not by the attitude of ‘the old guard conservative group of three or four London reviewers’. Their reaction was predictable: ‘One expects them to groan, though I don't know quite why we should be seeing a piece as it was performed 50 years ago. That's what they think ballet should be and that's why I think, by and large, ballet is a dying art form.’ What has surprised and pleased him is the public's response. He wasn't sure how they'd take to this rethink of Swan Lake. From the letters he's received and through talking to audiences, he knows the production is a popular one. Just don't use the word ‘crowd-pleaser’. Gable regards this as an insult to the audience handed out by critics who consider themselves on a higher level. That NBT audiences and critics are out of touch would seem to be borne out by the response to NBT's recent touring hit Romeo & Juliet. Worst production of the year, wrote one London critic. Best of the year, voted readers of Dance and Dancers. ‘I was not sure what the general public's reaction would be to Swan Lake. Everyone knows the name and thinks they know the story. I presumed they would be bringing very formed expectations to the theatre. ‘What I've found is a far younger element in the audience. On the evidence this production is speaking far more vividly to this generation than the traditional version.’ Gable hopes his Swan Lake will be viewed not as a version but a theatre event in its own right. ‘Although I don't try to shock I do try to make the moment as vividly alive for the audience as I can and that's a sort of crusade,’ he admits. He's moved the story to Russia, sent the Prince on army manoeuvres where he joins a boys' boozy night out, has the swans massacred by a power-mad crippled usurper and the corpses piled obscenely in a heap. Worst of all, the swans don't wear tutus but rather fetching white corseted little skirts. NBT audiences are ‘not content to look at rows and rows of identical girls doing the same thing,’ he maintains. Gable justifies his changes with talk of Tiananmen Square killings, the murder of the Russian royal family, Auschwitz, Hollywood parties and even Prince Andrew. This may sound extreme in print but Gable considers it ‘legitimate stuff of the theatre.’ He says: ‘I simply tried to do what I observed in my career in the straight theatre with some of the finest directors, particularly Peter Brook. ‘I tried to make the story as individual and as real as I can, and if possible to approach without any preconceptions, which is hard with Swan Lake because I have been associated with the ballet for 14 years. ‘You can't just make a performance of everything you have seen. You have to clear away the debris. I did with this, looking at various segments of the story.’ He's proud that Romeo & Juliet introduced children to both Shakespeare and Prokofiev ‘in a way that makes them think it's not culture and a bit boring and I wish I could go and watch Neighbours.’ Christopher the Crusader is in his stride, the man who reckons this generation of youngsters is deprived. They may have more toys, games and TVs per room than any other generation but lack the stimulation of reading, listening to music and the radio of Gable's youth. ‘It seems to me that what our children have got is a little square box with predominantly soaps and games shows, with fingertip control to get them from one to another as they get bored. There is no stimulus for the imagination and like any other muscle it can atrophy from lack of use.’ Gable is honest enough to acknowledge that there's some truth in the saying that no publicity is bad publicity: ‘The cynical and worldly part of me tells me it's been wonderful because the production must be the most talked about in 20 years of dance. ‘Once the production opened and the showed the allegations were totally groundless we are left with a production that parents know is suitable for children and no one can take that publicity away.’ — Swan Lake plays at Darlington Civic Theatre from March 31-April 4 and Newcastle Theatre Royal in June."
NWS NWS-K5C-030 -1.1 "The ugly truth about being a glamour puss My thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them WHAT IS happening today? Has someone turned the clock back 100 years and forgotten to tell me? Perhaps I have just become too comfortable with the cheering notion that women are far too busy getting on with their careers and their lives to crucify themselves worrying about ragged cuticles or the size of their ankles. Stupidly, I presumed that the ancient axiom that females were put on this planet for purely decorative purposes or that being pretty (or perhaps a spot of procreation) were the pinnacles of achievement had forever died out alongside the bustle and/or the bubble car. But no. We're still talking about Fiona Armstrong's calves and debating fulsomely about the length of hemlines. And how enervating, how disappointing, how absolutely…crushing to realise that nothing has changed — over the last few decades at least— and that for many women, their primary response is still to be beautiful rather than brainy. And why the hell not? The current status quo demands that others remain more interested in the size of one's bust rather than the size of one's IQ. And — good grief — the news that it is successful and powerful females saying this is enough to make strong women weep into their double gins. Or should that be double chins? This latest bulletin is so depressing, I put on 6lbs just thinking about it. And do you know something? I don't care. Really, Fay Weldon of all people should know better. In a volte-face that makes Germaine Greer's change of heart look like a tiny emotional trifle, the former feminists' champion has switched from the red corner to the blue corner without a blush in the process. The author of The Fat Woman's Joke and The Life and Loves of a She Devil has suddenly decided that being one of Britain's highest paid and smartest novelists who can command fees of £200,000 per book simply isn't enough. ‘I used to think that you should always be yourself but now I like to be made up, smile and look like a woman should,’ preens Fay. she added: ‘Looking good on your book jackets means that more people will read you.’ Oh really? I can't recall Alexander Solzhenitsyn, Jeffrey Archer, Frederick Forsyth and Uncle Tom Cobley and all looking luscious on any of their best-selling titles. There is, of course, nothing wrong with trying to look your best, but for the born-again Weldon to refuse to see anyone unless she spent half the day in the hairdressers and then proclaim that she's only doing it to further her career (oh, please) smacks of hypocrisy of the very highest order. What she is really saying, after all this time, is that it is more important for a woman than a man to look good. Sadly, this makes all her high moral stances and her bonny sights of yesteryear come tumbling down like a house of cards. And weep, once more, for Steffi Graf who was hot off the baseline this week with a whingeing moan about her physique. Graf is one of the world's top tennis players whose supreme athleticism and guts have put her at the top of a very tough profession. Is this enough? Of course not. ‘I am no fan of my muscles,’ she bleated to a German magazine. ‘I hate my size.’ What on earth does she think has powered her to the top of her sport and put millions of deutschmarks into her bank account? Her winning smile or her pretty blonde hair? Not that you're interested, but my thighs are so wobbly that each day I thank God that my stomach covers them. If I had a physique as powerful and beautiful as Graf's, I'd use the strength to knock some sense into her daft head. Who does she want to look like? Vanessa Paradis or Michelle Pfeiffer? Sometimes despair is the only option. And what about Body Shop supremo Anita Roddick, the woman who has been feted for the last ten years as some kind of environmentally conscious feminist icon. I have always been deeply suspicious of Roddick and her cliche-ridden slogans and highly-publicised efforts to save the world, while quietly amassing a fortune on the side. I never bought that stuff about her ever-expanding conscience and I certainly never bought any of her beauty products. Life, for me, is certainly not too short to stuff a mushroom. However, it is at least ten million years too short to spend an evening piddling about with peppermint footbaths or rainforest elixir ear-lobe exfoliators. But wait! Anita the fabled feminist has a complaint she want you all to hear. She thinks it is simply awful that being successful and (reading the ill-camouflaged sub-text) gorgeous means that men won't chat her up, admire her breasts or perceive her as a sexual creature. Anita doesn't want to save the planet any more. She wants to save her self-esteem. She has decided that pretty compliments from members of the opposite sex are what, after all, is important in this life. Anyone viewing all this nonsense from another planet — as most men do — can be forgiven for assuming that women are a bunch of mixed up crazies who don't know what they want, but do know that they want it all, both ways and with jam on the top, too. No-one can deny that being pretty helps — no female on breakfast television would have a career otherwise — but I cannot believe that we are turning back to the dark days when it was deemed the most important thing of all."
NWS NWS-K5C-059 -0.89 "No skirting the issue of inequality on high Why is the fairer sex so unfairly represented in the top echelons? PETER WOODIFIELD reports on the assault on the invisible barriers and speaks to one woman who has bypassed them CHANGING attitudes to women in business is like changing course in a giant tanker. Everything happens slowly but eventually change becomes apparent as more business leaders realise the nonsense of wasting the talents of a large chunk of their workforce. The problem has been particularly acute in the top echelons where the blue and grey suits are rarely disturbed by a skirt. Just 0.5 per cent of Britain's company directors are women. In 1991 the Government launched Opportunity 2000 in an attempt to encourage industry and commerce to take the issue seriously and the past two years have seen two of Britain's top 15 companies — BTR and Sainsbury — appoint female finance directors. But the focus on women at the top has tended to focus on entrepreneurs such as Anita Roddick and Scotland's Pat Grant and Ann Gloag. At least that way there is no way you can be held back by the so-called ‘glass ceiling’— the phrase coined in the United States to describe the invisible barriers that allow women to rise only so far in an organisation. On 9 March the Scottish division of the Institute of Directors, with Lothian and Edinburgh Enterprise and supported by The Scotsman, is holding a seminar in Edinburgh to discuss the issue, covering not just the boardroom but also senior levels of management. The IoD's Scottish membership, 68 women of 1,640 members, underlines the point. Donald Hardie, the Scottish director of the IoD, feels the problem stems from the education system, with girls being discouraged from studying the subjects that would get them on to the business ladder. ‘The problem is that they are not there to be promoted.’ That is by and large true, but Hardie is not certain that men have taken it on board and he is keen for plenty of men to attend to get a better understanding of the position. But while there may a shortage of suitable female candidates, it also becoming clear that there are women who have made it precisely because they refuse to be deflected from their chosen career. Indeed, one of the speakers at the IoD seminar is Lesley Bale, the managing director of Aberdeen Airport at the tender age of 33. For her and others like her it is a question of wanting it sufficiently, being prepared to put in the work and not expecting concessions because they are women. The glass ceiling does not exist because they don't let it. But not all women are like that. Too many allow themselves to be steered into what are seen as traditionally female jobs, or suffer discrimination if and when they have children. Women also tend to have a different, more consensual style of management, and often dislike playing by the corporate rules that are invariably laid down by men. Douglas Kinnaird, of PA Consultants and one of the UK's top headhunters, makes the point that quite often women don't realise how hard promotion is to get and that men have worked for it for months, if not years. ‘If they want to get promoted they have got to fight tooth and nail. They have got to find out the rules and then fight by the rules.’ A failure to realise just how tough it is means such women are held back more by their own glass hat than any supposed glass ceiling. One reality that cannot be avoided in the whole discussion is children. There is still an unspoken assumption that it will be the women who make the sacrifices when it comes to childcare and it is perhaps the thickest glass ceiling of all for many women. Government statistics show that 74 per cent of women in managerial and administrative positions have no children, and that is hardly likely to be a coincidence. As it is, women hold barely more than a quarter of all managerial and administrative posts, yet make up nearly half the workforce. In the longer term, that particular barrier is likely to disappear through sheer economic necessity on the part of business. Graduate recruitment in many businesses and industries now tends to be evenly split, and companies will not be able to afford to lose a large chunk of talent in which so much money has been invested, especially as women in any case tend to be less tempted by the ‘grass is greener’ syndrome. But all that being said, there is a real problem right now. Kinnaird, who is chairing the seminar, says he is regularly asked to find a woman for a senior management job ‘all other things being equal’. The trouble is that things are not equal, and he can hardly remember placing a woman in such a job. A headhunter for ten years, Kinnaird has just been commissioned by his first female client, which speaks volumes. It is hardly surprising that he cannot find the people he is looking for when even the largest organisations have so few senior women. The Royal Bank of Scotland has a record in this field to be proud of, being a founder member of Opportunity 2000 and also one of just 150 companies entitled to call themselves Investors in People. It has also just won its second national training award. Now 30 per cent of its junior management are women, although that figure falls away to a paltry 1 per cent at the highest levels. The Royal has committed itself to increase that significantly in the next few years. Dr Mike Mosson, director personnel at the Royal Bank, says the bank has a policy of ‘positive assistance’ and ‘positive encouragement’towards women, although he insists that it falls short of positive discrimination. For some time it has had career breaks to help women (and occasionally men) with family needs and he says it has been successful. But while corporately the bank has adopted a positive approach, Mosson admits this is not always reflected in individual behaviour. He admits to being surprised at the split attitudes of middle-aged men — and even some of the younger ones — who want their daughters to have a proper career structure but then fail to apply that belief at work. ‘We are winning in the sense we are finding it easier for women to make progress in the organisation and they are not the exception any more. I don't think we are moving fast enough, but being realistic we are winning.’ Most organisations are not so far advanced. Perhaps more typical is Scottish & Newcastle, which has a high proportion of female workers. Henry Fairweather, group personnel and services director, acknowledges that most of its female managers are in areas one might expect such as marketing, information services and personnel. ‘We have some in more traditional areas such as production but not as senior as we would like.’ S&N's executive committee has recently approved an initiative to find out what the situation is and is preparing an attitude survey to identify what managers are really thinking and what the problems are perceived to be. At the moment, less than 10 per cent of S&N's senior managers are women, but none of them are directors of any of the subsidiaries, let alone of the main board. Like the Royal Bank it is not setting specific targets. ‘At the end of the day it comes down to individual decisions about individual jobs,’ says Fairweather. ‘What we have to do is create a culture in which appointing women to senior jobs is easier,’ he says. That may not be as difficult as S&N or anyone else fears given that women's more consensus-based approach to management is increasingly seen to be an appropriate style of management. ‘By encouraging people to manage in a certain way you make it seem more appropriate to appoint women.’ That may seem a softly-softly approach, but by making aspiring women managers and executives feel more comfortable with the management culture, it could prove effective in shattering the glass ceiling."
