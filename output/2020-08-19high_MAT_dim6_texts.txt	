HOC HOC-AN 2.79 " To Niall Kennedy of France--how paranoid can you be? The US government is one of the most powerful and intelligent in the world, but it is not invincible--there was no ulterior motive allowing an attack to be carried out on our own civilians, the government simply let it slip by. Also, there are other ways of obtaining a tape of Bin Laden (he has hundreds in circulation!) other than dressing our agents up as Al-Queda and hiding them in caves so they can secretly video tape him. What an absurd theory! Try to exercise common sense rather than forward this unsubstantial nonsense. And remember Arkum's razor: 99 per cent of the time the correct answer is the most obvious one. It is obvious to me Bin Laden is guilty.      Without doubt it proves his guilt. I'm not sure whether it will change the minds of the Bin Laden defenders, who will insist that the tape is the fabricated work of American or Israeli intelligence. Hopefully, the tape will appease the ""show us the proof"" people around the world.      I've seen it and it's pretty damning. The way he crows and practically rubs his hands with glee is particularly repellent. The most sickening thing is how those sat around him keep thanking God for this ""wonderful"" thing that has happened. Guilty.      I know only of the excerpts that I have read in the press, but it certainly appears to be yet another piece of evidence towards proving his guilt. I'm sure the apologists and conspiracy theorists for this ""animal"" will claim the tape was either doctored or a fake, but it is good enough for me. While he is only one piece of the terrorist puzzle, his elimination or imprisonment will bring some small sense of justice. Let's hope he is brought to justice.      The Bin Laden tape showed him laughing when discussing the September 11 attacks. He also speaks in detail about the operation. He knows some of the hijackers were ignorant about their fate and it amuses him. Of course this shows he was behind the plot. Only the stupid would follow his twisted jihad now.      This tape, as far as I'm concerned, is absolute justification for all the military action. Maybe now the pacifists/apologists for terror will be a little more muted. I am of course being wildly over-optimistic, as I'm sure it won't long before some mis-guided individuals start talking about 'CIA' plots! Bin Laden is guilty. from this point on the world needs to face up to it.      I've seen videos of a chihuahua expressing its fast food preferences in TV commercials, so any evidence released on videotape doesn't prove anything. Which is a shame, because the question becomes ""What credible evidence of Bin Laden's involvement could the USA government produce?"" Is there any credible evidence?      The video not only leaves no doubt about his guilt, it presents serious questions about his sanity. The words and expressions were those of someone utterly removed from moral reality.      Bin Laden should be punished for the attacks in the US and others like the ones in Africa (where my uncle was killed). But he shouldn't be sent to the US, England, but to a Muslim country to be punished under Islamic law which from what I understand means they would chop off his head.      I'm not surprised that there are still nay-sayers, but I am relieved to see that there appear to be fewer in light of the video.      I don't know if I'm more disgusted with Bin Laden (who I know is diabolical) or the home-grown America haters like John in San Diego who've found their way into this thread. The idea that the US Government faked the video defies logic. The US has worked too hard to forge a coalition (or at least secure the complicity of Arab states) to put out a faked video. Even if the Bush Administration is were as devious as some suggest, he wouldn't risk the backlash that would result at this stage in the conflict.      Even if Bin Laden shouted from the rooftops that he was behind the September 11 attacks, there would still be a large number of people in Britain and around the world who would try and weasel out of admitting he is guilty. They will still say that it's all about American imperialism, oil, a Zionist plot or other such reasons. Of course this is 100 percent proof of his guilt and I think it will bolster support for the war. Anyway, does it really need bolstering? The supposedly imminent overthrows of Musharraf and the House of Saudi haven't exactly happened, have they? Yet another paper tiger dreamt up by anti-American sections of the media and other groups.      How convenient that the quality of picture and sound in this video are poor. None of the other Bin Laden videos we have seen share this trait. Given the US authorities policy of constantly hiding stories of their own casualties (both in Afghanistan and during the Gulf War) it is not unreasonable to believe this alleged Bin Laden video has been cooked up in some Hollywood studio with lookalikes. Any in any event, it still does not justify bombing an innocent population of ordinary civilians and destroying a whole country.      Boy oh boy, Mr Kelly has a warped view of Americans. Does he honestly believe that this is a video produced by Hollywood, with look-a-likes?! Snap out of it Mr Kelly! We in the ""real world"" would welcome your arrival.      Just because the quality is poor, doesn't mean its a fake, and as for this admission justifying destroying a country, I don't remember that happening- in fact most Afghans have seen this as a liberation.      Paul from the UK, you are dead right! The radical fringe will never accept this, or any other evidence as proof that Bin Laden is guilty. Rob Kelly from the UK, you are displaying the classic behavior of a sociopath's apologist; when faced with over overwhelming evidence, simply deny, deny, deny. Are you sure you weren't on the OJ Simpson jury?      The only thing more shocking than the evil of this man (Bin Laden) is the attitude of half-wits such as Rob Kelly. It is a moot point whether it is wilful stupidity and/or a blind hatred of Americans that prevents his like from accepting the painfully obvious.      Who can see this video and say that he is not guilty? His fate is sealed. Allah will not be seeing him. However, Satan is preparing a place for him.      If this is not enough proof, then its clear that those who support Bin Laden will always support him no what the proof is. Those who do not belive he is behind the attack are those who hate everything that is non-Islamic.      If Hollywood could make Bruce Willis in space on a shuttle or even make Tom Cruise accomplish mission impossible, then I guess the US government could produce any video. The tape is most probably just a fake and a diversion. The US government is just trying to target an entity that they could hold accountable to the American public and veil the failure of their intelligence. It's another distracting attention for the international community to make them believe.      I don't know if I'm more disgusted with Bin Laden (who I know is diabolical) or the home-grown America haters like John in San Diego who've found their way into this thread. The idea that the US Government faked the video defies logic. The US has worked too hard to forge a coalition (or at least secure the complicity of Arab states) to put out a faked video. Even if the Bush Administration is were as devious as some suggest, he wouldn't risk the backlash that would result at this stage in the conflict.      Yes, he certainly appears to be guilty, and his apparent delight is disgusting. At the same time, I am just as disgusted when I hear our military spokesmen brag about how efficient and magnificent our weaponry is. Meanwhile, the death toll of innocent Afgans is rapidly approaching September 11, and Bin Laden appears to have escaped unscathed. Well, at least they got the children of his lead man. Go USA!      What more proof does the world need, photos of Bin Laden taking pilot lessons? Unfortunately, and the US knows this, there always will be supporters of Bin Laden who will refuse to accept any facts them that show his guilt. No amount of evidence will ever convince those who have already made up their mind. However I hope and believe that this will go a long way to convince moderates in both Europe, and the Islamic world, that this in not a man to be revered and emulated as so many have done recently. It is my fervent wish that some of his current followers who see this tape will rethink their allegiance to this man, so that the world will not have to repeat this experience in another ten years.      To those who question the validity of the tape: Why would the US run the risk of faking such a document and having the truth leak out? America's argument is only marginally strengthened by this release. Faking it would ruin the reputation of the US government forever.      If this video is proved to be genuine, and Bin Laden kills himself or is killed by US special forces, then far fewer people will see him as a martyr, but as the psychopathic fanatic (and heretic) that he is. There will be conspiracy theories - it is possible to fake videos like this - but I hope that they're utterly ungrounded.      Rob are you suggesting that we do nothing thereby tacitly saying that we will cower and do nothing when attacked? This would only say to the terrorists that their tactics work! I empathise with the innocent civilians that have suffered, but if I am forced to choose between Afghanistan being bombed or the US, I choose the former.      The US offered proof of Bin Laden's guilt shortly after September 11. The leaders of the democratic nations accepted it as proof positive. The tape is only further proof of Bin Laden's guilt for the murder of more than 3,000 innocent men, women and children in the US. Yet, people will still deny there is proof, just as they are those who still claim the Nazis never murdered Jews during WW11. But the civilised world knows the truth, and is doing something about it right now in Afghanistan, and other countries throughout the world.      Regardless of Bin Laden's guilt, there is no reason not to continue questioning the US government's conduct in this war on terrorism and of the US government's motives in pursuing military action in and against other states. The adage still holds true - the end does not justify the means.      Assuming this video was not fabricated, as a Muslim I am sickened and terrified at his words. He is invoking God and Islamic theology to justify the September 11 massacre. An immoral and evil man. Whatever sympathy this man had, should by now be gone in the Islamic world.      Regardless of this video, it seems there was enough evidence to bring a large number of the Muslim countries in with the allies. I'm sure this only compounds the amount of evidence against Bin Laden.For some who believe in world conspiracy theories the poor quality of the video will be heralded with cries of hoax regardless of the fact it was most probably made on a hand-held camcorder.      I believe that Osama Bin Laden is guilty of many crimes. I also believe that he would have been delighted by the attacks on September the 11th. But let's face it, there isn't a shred of hard evidence that proves he was involved. And if he is just a scapegoat, that means that the real mastermind is still unknown, and is free to wreak more havoc.      For those who cannot commit to the possibility that Bin Laden is guilty of September 11, keep in mind that his organization was linked to other incidents over the past years. What is truly tragic, however, is that the US and the world community at large required such an incident as this to commit to a war on terrorism. It would seem that the US government should hold itself somewhat responsible for the tragedy. Further, this war on terrorism is not an altruistic quest, but merely one of limited public appeal. The Bush administration had to be seen to be doing something to avenge this event, and so they have. A sad comment really, that no world organization or state government had the backbone to commit to such an important struggle earlier.      The video makes Bin Laden absolutely 100% guilty.      Bin Laden's guilt did not need to be established by this video, only the cold-blooded and fanatical nature of the man and his followers. What is more important is the most disturbing portion of the video. He seems to mention another terrorist operation near the end of Ramadan. Interviews with John (the American Taliban/traitor) seem to corroborate this. Also, why does he say the the Sept 11 strikes was a message that was understood by ""Arabs, non-Arabs, and even the Chinese"". Why does he mention the Chinese by name?      This video appears to be proof that Osama Bin Laden orchestrated the September 11 attacks on the US. However, after watching every news channel I receive, and looking at around ten news websites, I can find no information on why the US has this video. Why was it filmed in the first place? Did Bin Laden know he was being filmed? Why would this video be left where the US can get it? Is it really Bin Laden in the video, or is it (as some seem to think) a fake filmed by the US itself? I just hope the world gets some answers soon.      It could have been faked, and it could just as well be genuine. Neither of the sides in this conflict are exactly whiter-than-white. In this case there's a whole pile of other information pointing towards Bin Laden, so I'll go for at genuine, but I am sickened by the Americans who think that anyone who doesn't automatically think that this video is 101 per cent proof are in league with Bin Laden. A plague on both your houses!      There cannot be any doubt that this tape is a fabrication from beginning to end. Are we to believe that the US forces sat back in their chairs and skimmed all the video-tapes they found while in Afghanistan? Why would Bin Laden have allowed himself to be filmed saying what he allegedly said? Why is the quality of this tape so extremely bad? Call me just another lover of conspiracy-theory stories, I still believe in common sense. Common sense says that the Amercians, not having given any proof of Bin Laden's guilt, want to convince the average citizen. Apparently they succeeded.      If the US could concoct some grand conspiracy and fake this tape, couldn't they also conspire to have someone other than the US government release the video? The sad reality is that even if Bin Laden went on live TV and said ""Ok, I confess, I did it"" there would still be people who would say ""Who are you and what have you done with Osama?!?!?""      It amazes me that some will think that this is fake. Whatever the US government has done wrong in the past does not justify killing its civilians. We did not start this conflict but mark my words we will end it.      I think it is an American right to question the government, it is what our country is built upon, but to say that the government would fabricate a tape to garner more worldwide support seems ludicrous! I think though there is little to no doubt of Bin Laden's involvement, the concern I have is that there will be those that still applaud the actions of September 11th. I think those that on the lunatic fringe know the truth, and support it all the same. That is why I believe the US has the right to fight for the safety of our country, and the world from terrorism. I am concerned over the casualties, both of Afghanis as well as US soldiers, but I think it was not the US that destroyed this country, but 20 years of war, and hopefully we will see a rebuilding of this country, its people and culture!      If the US would've wanted to produce a fake video, they would've done it sooner and its images and sound would be much better. I don't know why they taped this meeting as much as I could guess why they committed such atrocious attack. I cannot see how anyone could now doubt Bin Laden did it, and my only hope is that they catch him alive for a much deserved punishment that, unfortunately, will never suffice.      The commentary on the video doesn't even match the lip-movements - they could be discussing holiday snaps for all we know. It doesn't take much to realise that a few guys in a dubbing studio could be providing the Arabic commentary for the video. All sounds far too convenient for me. People should stop acting like sheep and start thinking critically for themselves. Funny how everyone's turned into Arabic linguists overnight.      Guilty or not guilty, Bin Laden has already been condemned by the international public opinion. Would it be possible for this ""lunatic"" to receive tomorrow a fair trial anywhere in the world? If he is killed in combat, his case will become cause celebre-an irrational enigma. He has harm the Arab nations and the Muslim community.      I personally do not trust the US government and/or Bin Laden. Who knows if the tape is a fake or if it is real. There are thousands of people dead over the attacks on the World Trade Towers and the carnage shows no signs of stopping. Who will be brave enough to orchestrate a call for peace?      This proves it all over again. The only crazy person known to the world, right now, who could come up with this sinister plot, is Bin Laden. This tape proves it beyond a doubt.      He did it. To think otherwise is to be a supporter of what he did. Anyone who still protests his guilt or questions the authenticity of this tape is not ever going to support the war on terrorism.      To be blunt, you'd have to be deaf, dumb and blind to believe Bin Laden's innocent.      As a prosecutor, I can say that such a tape,if properly authenticated, would be a most damning piece of evidence against Bin Laden in court.He also stands revealed in the court of public opinion as a heartless fanatic with such little regard for human life that he is amused by the thought of his own followers going unwittingly to their deaths.      Once more we see people rejoicing and celebrating the deaths of September 11. As horrific as the planes crashing was, this obscenity is worse. How dare they invoke the name of Allah to justify this.      Of course it is- however there will always be some professional US haters who will bandy around their conspiracy theories.      Absolutely. Of course, there will be the tiny minority who will claim otherwise, but to hear Bin Laden not only describing the orchestration and the calculated damage of the assaults, but to be gleeful about it, is, I should think, the thin end of the wedge as far as his culpability is concerned. The world wanted proof...here it is, in colour.      There is no doubt that Bin Laden was behind this attack. If any one still has doubt they only refuse to see the truth.      I don't understand why somebody in Jalalabad would have this tape and why the tape would even be viewed in a war zone (i.e. if I was an Anti-Taliban in Jalalabad, why would I pay attention to a tape in a house?) I'd pay more attention to the tape if it was made clear where it came from.      I truly believe this is the proof that the US government needed to show the world Bin Laden was involved in these horrific acts of murder. As I watched this coward speak, his joy, smiles and satisfaction made my stomach turn. The US government did not need any additional support before the release of this tape... now, it has proven, without a doubt, that Bin Laden not only knew of the impending attacks, but is fully responsible for them. May God have mercy on his soul, because I know we will not.      Will we have ""independant verification"" that this video is not a fake?      Of course it's proof. It's proof that, once again, all of the naysayers, doubters and handwringers were wrong. They were wrong about there not being proof Bin Laden was directly responsible. They were wrong that anything but military action was necessary. They were wrong that America would not act in a measured, responsible fashion. They were wrong that the Taleban and the terrorists would fight to the death and that America would meet another Vietnam. And they were wrong that the American people do not have the resolve, unity and determination to see this thing through to absolute victory.      The evil Bin Laden has just signed his life away... this proof is solid and shows how evil the fanatics are.      He is an evil man who sends others to their deaths. To suggest that the killing of people is done in Allah's name is blasphemous and after earthly judgment has removed him from this world, may his god exact judgment on him. Sick, evil, twisted. If this man is your hero, you deserve the same fate.      This is absolute proof from Bin Laden himself. How else could he know so much about the attack. He had calculated casualties, he knew there were more planes after the first one hit the Worl Trade Center, and he even mocked the hijackers who didn't know they were going to die. Only the most idiotic conspiracy theorist could believe that Bin Laden did not plan the massacre of September 11. I'm not sure how much support this tape will bolster, though. People hate so see the USA use its power, even when we are clearly doing the right thing and using force responsibly. Quite frankly, I don't care if people support us. We're doing what we have to do to protect ourselves.      Yes it does. Not everyone will think so. We all have our biases and I am sure there will still be doubt by some.      It's more than enough for me. Let's hope this helps keep people's focus on what this unfortunate conflict is all about - a madman who hoped that his attack on the US -and the US response - would inflame the Muslim world. It hasn't worked.      I was under the impression that in the civilized world we have a judicial system, evidence is heard in court of law and a verdict is delivered. However the US seems intent on a trial by media, it as many of us know likes to make up the rules as it goes along. The US has its own agenda and changes its foreign policy accordingly.     Of course it's strong proof. However damning it is, those who strongly believe in his cause will never believe he was at fault.      What the video will do is swing the opinion of countries and people who were sceptical, and that is key. The video shows beyond a shadow of a doubt the Bin Laden knew what was going to happen. Anyone who denies it after seeing the video will never be convinced. But we need the support of as many Arab nations as possible because many of these enemies seek refuge within their borders. To that point, I think it was a good idea to subtitle the piece and not dub it.       Can we be sure that this video is genuine? It would mean that the US has agents at the heart of Al-Qaeda who were able to film Bin Laden making these remarks - and if they do indeed have these agents, why didn't they warn Bush of the attacks in the first place? The US government is certainly capable of cover-up and fabrication of evidence... I wonder if this is not more of the same. "
HOC HOC-AR 3.79 " During their existence the RUC had to deal with many accusations made against by the Nationalist and Republican communities in Northern Ireland and their supporters elsewhere. Now that the terrorists have got their demand to disband the RUC, the are still not content. I feel that this report is just an ongoing attempt to discredit what was, in my opinion, the most effective policing service in the world. I can only imagine how those RUC officers who were on duty in Omagh on the day of the bombing now feel by the accusations made in this report, after helping to lead the rescue operation and pick of the bodies of the victims that day. It frightens me to think how many more people would have slaughtered by terrorists over the years if it hadn't been for the bravery and efficiency of the RUC during this time. This report is a serious attempt to deflect where the real blame for the Omagh atrocity lies, and that is squarely on the shoulders of the so called 'Real' IRA and their associates in other Republican groups.      As a lawyer specialising in regulatory matters I am deeply disturbed at the Ombudsman's apparent failure to give those whom she wished to criticize adequate time to comment on the facts as she found them and on her conclusions.      Instead of Sinn Fein crowing on the sidelines about the alleged ineptitude of the RUC, perhaps they would assist its successor, or indeed the Garda in helping to bring convictions. The fact that Sinn Fein is on public record in ruling out any cooperation whatsoever makes, in my opinion, that party as complicit in the Omagh tragedy as the main perpetrators.      Surely such a damning report on the conduct of the RUC regarding these events should have been more thoroughly investigated than it appears to have been. It will also do nothing to ease the suffering of the victims of this atrocity. Please, let's not turn the blame on the RUC. It lies firmly at the feet of the murderous scum that planned and executed such an unforgivable act.      Attacks on the Chief Constable and his officers who fought bravely for thirty years against tyrants and murderers in the North show how insensitive and ignorant Mrs O'Loan is, not only to the families of Omagh but also to those individuals who fought in vain to preserve life on that horrific day.      Does anybody really think Omagh was the primary target for this Real IRA outrage? I doubt it, what political gain would there be? After all Omagh is a mainly Nationalist town. I can remember distinctly the day of the Omagh bomb. I was driving the sixteen miles from Dromore Co. Down to Lisburn, Co. Antrim, and was stopped by the security forces on no less than three occasions. There was a very high state of alert. Perhaps the target was changed at the last minute by the murderers due to the high security force presence.     This appears to those outside the divide in Northern Ireland, that Sinn Fein supporters are engaged in political point scoring. It looks biased and unfair. Put a neutral officer in charge and investigate all the circumstances. However if that investigation reveals that Ronnie Flanagan is not culpable, then Nuala O' Lone should be sacked for such blatant misrepresentation. If she is prepared to attack the Chief Constable then she has to be prepared to put her own job on the line. Only in Northern Ireland could the diversionary propaganda be put forward in such a way that suggests the RUC were somehow to blame for letting the bomb through. The Real IRA blew up 29 people, now it appears that they want to finish the job they intended, by causing as much damage as possible to the new PSNI.      As the Real IRA perceives its struggle with the UK as a war, can't we start treating it as such? If we did, known guilty parties could be tried under military law, rather than civilian law, which doesn't really take into consideration the severity of these people's crimes. The Real IRA benefits from waging war on a sleeping country that is obsessed with being politically correct and following civil law to the nth degree. Our government doesn't fight for the rights of the UK civilian because it is obsessed with bending over backwards to give these terrorists what they want.      All such reports should be preceded by information regarding the background of the person compiling the report, who was consulted, who was invited to give an opinion and who actually gave an opinion. This information is important owing to the effect a report of this nature can have on society      This looks like just the kind of news NI does not need. But at least ineptitude and incompetence are not as bad as cold blooded murder. Clearly a lot of work needs to be done in the police service, but I'll wait until the Police have had a chance to reply to the report.      I think the ombudsman's report needs to be thoroughly investigated, perhaps by an outside chief constable. However no matter what the report says one thing must be remembered. The RUC did not plant the Omagh bomb.      What is evident from the Ombudsman's report is not that the Omagh bombing could definitely have been prevented, but that the Chief Constable and special branch attempted to prevent both the Omagh Investigation team and the Ombudsman's investigators from gaining access to the information that special branch had. That the internal RUC Review of the investigation was also ignored is a damning indictment of the power special branch has within what is supposed to be a Police Service. The fact that the Ombudsman has been able to uncover all of these facts is a tribute to the thoroughness of her investigators and to the office she holds. Far from vindicating Sinn Fein's refusal to endorse the new structures the transparency that the Ombudsman has brought to the workings of the PSNI underlines the fact that we are already at a new beginning to Policing here.      Getting the bombers to justice is only part of it. What we need to do is see what lesson this sad and tragic incident has taught us and ensure that the lapses are not committed again. The public first expects prevention and secondly detection. Bringing the individuals involved in this dastardly act of terrorism to justice is not only a must but a duty on every police force.      THE RUC did not bomb Omagh. It wasn't Special Branch who devised the idea of planting a car bomb in a crowded town centre on one of the busiest shopping days of the year. Nor was it Ronnie Flanagan who parked that car that day and gingerly pushed the door to and then walked off down the street past the women and the children, the elderly people and the babies, knowing full well that they and hundreds of other innocents like them were now in the most grievous mortal danger.      It's important to remember these things because in the midst of all the high emotion and anger expressed this week, it has seemed at times as if we lost sight of that one overriding fact - that it was the Real IRA who bombed Omagh. And while it may be difficult for the rest of us to imagine ourselves inside their minds to try to fathom how in God's name they could conceive and perpetrate such evil, it is all too easy to guess how they feel about the row over the ombudsman's report.      They and their counterparts in other republican and loyalist terrorist groups must be gloating and sniggering over every delicious moment of it - at that unlikely turnaround which now sees those who have saved so many lives being tainted with blame for the worst atrocity of the Troubles.      This week, without a trace of obvious irony, Sinn Fein, the political wing of the IRA which planted many a similar car bomb, was calling for an independent inquiry into the police actions over Omagh. It was a bit like the political representatives of the Taliban demanding a public inquiry into the NYPD's inability to prevent the al-Qaeda attack on the Twin Towers.      The relatives of Omagh deserve justice. But the police who lost over 300 officers in the fight against terrorism deserve fair play too. The bitterness and acrimony of the current row should not be allowed to obscure the fact that whatever the failings of the system, the police were trying to save lives - unlike the men who drove that car that day into Omagh.      You can imagine the outrage if someone was to reason that it was due to the ineptitude of the CIA etc that the attacks on the Twin Towers occurred. Surely we must never forget that it was the police themselves who were on the front line and that the information available to them was scant at best. It could equally be argued that if there had been more co-operation from the nationalist community maybe the bomb would not have occurred. However, the reality remains that the motivation for it was with the Real IRA - a group of cold evil inhumane killers who were hell-bent on murder.       No one can dispute the fact that the Real IRA are responsible for setting off the bomb and for murdering and maiming innocent people, they did an evil thing and should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. What is also indisputable is that it is the responsibility of the police ombudsman to investigate the police response to the bombing in light of accusations of wrongdoing. She did her job and found that certain information was not given to the people who could have made a difference and possibly prevented loss of life. If she buried the report or never did the investigation then the same thing could happen again. Hopefully this will improve the ability of the officers in the Police Service to get the information they need to better do their jobs. "
HOC HOC-BD 2.46 " I think that the Japanese royal family should make their own decision. They can leave the whole thing behind them or make their first child the heir to the throne. Too much trouble has been made over the centuries with extended families fighting for power, just because there was no male heir. A woman is more than capable of ruling a country, as we can see from history.      If I were Japanese then I would say yes, however I'm not so it's none of my business. Just because we think it is right and proper doesn't make it any of our business what happens in Japan. Cultural imperialism is very dated since September 11th - and that is what this talking point is.      Most of us are just happy to see a new baby in the Imperial family and don't really care whether if it is a girl or boy honestly. Japan has had eight empresses serving ten periods if I remember correctly. So there is not so much heated debate here in Japan right now. People say let's not spoil this great moment in this family with political debates right now, but we will just do the right thing when things are ready. That's also Prime minister Koizumi implied too.     For the time being, I just hope the Princess and the Prince enjoy what all the parents enjoy - celebrating the birth of new life.      Time has come for Japan to change its rusty constitution. And change, it must. It is not gender's dictation on rule but simply how one is trained in life to accomplish a task or task(s).      The Crown Princess of Sweden has a younger brother, yet no one makes a fuss about this factoid.      They should do whatever they themselves feel is the best way of securing the future of the Imperial family. That might be to change the constitution, or maybe not. I trust the judgement of a household that has survived so long.      It would have mattered much more were women allowed succession in times when the post of emperor had real power. Giving women the right of succession now that the monarch is little more than an ornament may even be counter-productive for the cause of gender equality.      Anyone either male, female, colour of skin is immaterial. If one has the capability to rule or to be in power provided they can do it with peace then they are they leader and others people in and out of the nation should respect they capability.      Most Japanese fall asleep at the mention of the Imperial family, a remote and increasingly ceremonial institution. Debating a question like this is like asking whether the Lord Mayor of London should have two feathers in his hat or three. It is not as if the girl will necessarily have a worse life for not becoming Emperor.      Remember the importance in Japanese culture of history and tradition as the stabilising force behind a fast-moving society. Some things which are plainly obvious to us take generations to change within these circles and are often fraught with difficulty. Be sympathetic and encouraging to the Japanese rather than dismissive!      Of course they should change their constitution. Like all sensible nations dedicated to the ideals of democracy they should remove the monarchy altogether and create a democratically elected head of state.     This is a contentious issue: currently women's rights are a means of demonising entire countries. Japan had female rulers in the past, and much like the British monarchy, currently there is no power associated with it's monarchs. When the Queen is no longer the Queen, and if a man takes her place is that a regression to a less evolved state of political thinking. I don't think so. And to be frank I find other political developments in the world worry me a lot more than this one.      Why not? We had several female emperors before the end of the19th century. However, they had to be virgins as this was the social norm of the time. However, in modern society such an idea does not make sense. I will definitely support changing the Japanese constitution and a possible female emperor should be allowed to get married.      I think Japan must change the constitution because we are in the 21st century and women should have the same rights as men.      The fact that the imperial family is the world's oldest ruling line suggests that the concept works and that perhaps other societies should try to copy their way of life rather than attempt to influence change.      Of course Japan should change its constitution. Cultures are not frozen in time. They evolve and adapt. They always have done - that's what keeps them vibrant. A culture that tries to remain the same for all time is a dead one.      In general I don't really like the idea of a monarchy anywhere. But if there has to be one let the first-born child, no matter whether it's a boy or a girl, inherit the throne.      I do find this sort of patriarchy completely unjustifiable and misogynistic. What exactly are the arguments for passing power down the male line? That women couldn't lead a country at war (say that to Elizabeth I)? That women can't command respect (say that to Victoria)? Or that women can't be ruthless (say that to Thatcher)? When are people going to learn that leadership skills are based on personality not gender?      This reminds me of the 'Should Australia become a republic?' debate. Back then, I said that this was nothing to do with anyone outside of Australia and was a question that only the Australian people could answer.      So now I will give a similar answer - this is a question that only Japan can answer and that has nothing to do with the rest of us.      In response to Graham from London I would pose this question: fundamentally speaking, is there any difference between outsiders making an argument that Afghan women should be given the right to attend school and making one that Japanese women should have rights to the throne?      Let us not pretend that the Japanese constitution has never changed before. Their government structure has undergone two dramatic changes in the last 150 years: the Meiji Constitution, following 1868, and the post-WWII constitution. It is possible to change the constitution and maintain the continuity of the imperial line.      The Japanese royal family claim descent through continuous line for thousands of years. The new princess follows that line and, whilst I agree that it is for Japan to decided and not anyone else, surely this must play an important factor. Despite one or two comments above, I believe that the imperial family is an important part of Japanese life and should continue.      Haven't Western nations interfered enough in the internal affairs of other countries? When will we ever learn? If the Japanese people want to see the Constitution of their country changed it's their decision. We don't have electoral rights there, we shouldn't be going round assuming what's good and what's not for every other country on the planet!      Britain will shortly celebrate (I hope) a Golden Jubilee. With a record such as that as a model, I see no reason why the Japanese cannot see the benefits of a female sovereign.      I applaud the idea. Japan is a notoriously sexist society. I think a change in the law to allow female monarchs would be a powerful symbol, and greatly advance the status of Japanese women in all spheres of life. It might even help change attitudes in other countries.      It's ironic when you consider that the Emperors claim to have received their mandate from a Goddess in the first place.       So much of Japanese society is unfair to women and the banning of women from inheriting the thrown is no different. I believe it would be more meaningful if Japan spent more effort ridding itself of its misogynistic ways...undoubtedly the country would benefit greatly. "
HOC HOC-EM 2.86 " Terrorism and drugs go hand in hand. The terrorist network that sprung up in Afghanistan was heavily tied in with the huge production of heroin there. To stop terrorism you have to stop the drugs trade. The UN estimates that the production of heroin in Afghanistan has been reduced by 3,000 tons since the Taleban prohibited it last year. This annoyed a lot of very rich criminals who had been funding the terrorists. Bush needs to follow this trail if he is serious about wiping them out.      The concept of freezing terrorists' assets should be extended to include government access to the accounts of all criminals. I do not mind in the least if the government looks at my bank account. I have nothing to hide. Swiss bank accounts are the best thing that ever happened to criminals.      I would have to agree that the freezing of assets would have little or no effect on future terrorist operations. In terms of an appropriate response, I believe that a specific, targeted military reply is absolutely required. However, while a widespread assault on Afghanistan may provide a media spectacle that may temporarily appease a grieving American public, it is likely to only exacerbate the situation. This is exactly what the perpetrators of this incident want to see happening. As a global fugitive, it is likely that Bin Laden has transformed his entire identity and appearance and is in hiding where we least expect -perhaps even in the US.      While mapping out a response to these horrific events, the fundamental issues should be analysed. It is clear that this is a major wake-up call for the US government regarding its foreign policy and dependence on foreign oil. At the end of the day, this is the root of the problem that has led to the widespread resentment of the US and the subsequent attacks on the symbols of American prosperity and power. Environmentalists and economists have urged the development of alternative energy sources for decades. I pray that the recent tragic events will provide the impetus for the accelerated development of alternative energy sources, a re-examination of America's foreign policy, and a co-ordinated international covert response that will strike at the heart of this elusive network of terror.      There is about as much of a chance of slowing down terrorist money as there is of stopping the flow of drugs. Cash always rules. I'm sure there will be an impact from this new policy but it's effect won't last very long. This method alone will be ineffective unless it is combined with other tactics. The US government knows this. I believe that every possible resource should be used. I want these groups eliminated, no matter how painful it is on my wallet or lifestyle.      When the United States itself is constantly pouring in money to fund different terrorist-harbouring nations, why should we even pay heed to a policy like ""freezing all terrorist assets"". I wonder why Mr Bush does not come out and say that we actually indirectly fed and funded the Mujahadeen and Osama Bin Laden.      So, have all Islamic-sounding groups' assets been frozen? Mr Bush is failing in his attempts to convince the world that this is not a war against Islam.      Neither the ETA nor the IRA exists to exterminate Americans. Right now, the greatest threats to US citizens and those of other western nations are supporters of the September 11 murderers. Freezing their assets is a non-violent defensive measure that is absolutely necessary.      To those of you who are expressing concerns regarding how this move falls short of fighting all forms of terrorism, let me remind you that the US is working on one focused goal at a time. It would be ridiculous and unwise to spread ourselves thin by going after every terrorist organisation right now. Today, the focus is on the international terrorist groups and their supporters who are responsible for the September 11 atrocities and attacks on US ships and embassies. At the same time, the US is looking at the larger perspective. Terrorism in all forms is evil and the US is fed up with it. Every country in the world has its own internal terrorists, including the US. The WTC disaster has had a major effect on American citizens in terms of how they perceive such atrocities. This war against terrorism is going to go on for a long time. We are currently only seeing the first steps. Be patient.      Freezing terrorist funding will not completely eradicate the problem. The USA is a great country but their foreign policy has been on the wrong side for years. The US must exert pressure on Israel to leave the occupied West Bank and Gaza strip. This move will certainly bring a wider peaceful solution.      Terrorists do not require millions of dollars to conduct their activities. As proven, the means are readily available among ordinary commercial products that are taken for granted. In the wrong hands they can be deadly weapons.      I am as deeply outraged by the attack on the USA as any person, but after years of Noraid funded-IRA terrorist attacks on the UK, I am deeply sceptical of Bush's claim to rid the world of all forms of terrorism. Why is the IRA not included on the list? I strongly back President Bush's call to rid the world of terrorism but while he's at it he should include all terrorist groups.      I personally believe that if the US wanted to wipe out terrorism in the name of Bin Laden they would have done so in 1998 after the bombings in Nairobi and Dar-es-Salaam. Maybe they should consider where these people get their arms and weapons from. Secondly terrorists' bank accounts will not bear their names.      If the world's wealth was more equally shared these concerns would not arise. Many nations throughout the world including the Middle East have a surplus while nations nearby struggle. People throughout the world need to look at their own governments and religions and ask if their rules are in place simply to keep them in power or to assist the people. All terrorists are one and the same and the IRA or similar groups in Europe belong on the list. After thousands of years of recorded history we should understand that killing others does not solve the problem.      Freezing assets is not the solution but every little bit helps. This step shows that Bush is willing to take a number of different approaches to combating this problem, and is not just going with a knee-jerk all out military response.      I think we're mostly after terrorists who target America. We are finally asking for the support of the world in this cause after decades of assisting dozens of other countries with their problems, whether they were humanitarian or military. This may be the reason we are not going after, say, the IRA. We ask all other countries to look at what America has done to help everybody else in their time of need. Now is the time to return the favour.      It's a good idea to freeze these organisations' assets, but what about the arms trade? Afghanistan doesn't manufacture its own weapons. By stopping or significantly reducing arms trading we can stop fuelling the terrorist ideology.      What about the many dictators in the world with their numbered Swiss accounts? Will Dubya target them ?      Well, even if we wanted to stop the money flow and freeze assets...how successful can we be when the media is publishing it three days before it is actually implemented? Wouldn't take a rocket scientist to figure out to move the money now would it?      President Bush didn't even thank Canada for helping them out. This makes me so mad. I'm Canadian and I think that we should get recognised. We're usually the first ones there to help out in a crisis.      If the United States can stop arms laundering the world will be a much safer place to live in. Please note that most of the weapons used by terrorists are made in the United States.      It's ridiculous to assume that terrorists are dependent upon significant financial resources. The WTC attack was low-budget in the extreme yet caused absolute devastation. The sort of terrorism that has emerged does not require much money. We must recognise Islamic extremism as the fascist movement it is and refuse its adherents entry to Western countries.      I agree that the Bush administration needs to address other terrorist groups, such as the IRA, in the very near future, especially if this is to be a global retaliation against terrorism. I think that right now his mind is set on one task - eliminating the Osama Bin Laden network, which will take a lot more than just freezing the assets of his associates.      It is not possible to trace terrorists' assets without assuming that everyone on planet earth is a terrorist, with or without a bank account. Some people do not observe the Highway Code and kill innocent people - terrorism is another method with a different cause and scale.      Not all criminals use banks and many contributors do not wire their funds. Freezing US assets and military actions are a must to ameliorate or delay other terrorist actions. But only acknowledging and reacting to the causes of terrorism would end it.      In response to Thierry de Poerck, please keep in mind that the US only has the authority to freeze US assets. The EU must act to protect its own interests, including local terrorism. The US will surely follow your lead and support any such actions. This country can't do everything.      Personally, I find it insulting that there isn't a single European terrorist group named on this list. The US Administration has once again demonstrated how hypocritical it is, saying on the one hand it would go after all terrorist groups, while it does nothing to fight ETA, IRA and others as they see it as a ""European"" problem. Well, frankly, I'm beginning to understand why some people hate them so much.      We have to work on this issue on all fronts and with all of our allies and resources. There may be banks that hide the accounts of these organisations and people but they reside in countries that are members of the UN and someone insures these banks.     Though preventing terrorist access to funding is an extremely daunting task I believe it is an important step that President Bush has considered. Remember a journey of a thousand miles begins with one step.      Presumably this action is being taken on the premise that money is the root of all evil. This may slow the terrorists down a little but what about stopping the arms trade? Perhaps the US should look at revoking its citizens' ""right to bear arms"" as another way of reducing the number of innocent Americans killed on home soil.      I wonder if President Bush is going to freeze investment in viral and other massive weapons...     Conflict, war and crime generates large sums of money for some people. It's good for business. It's always been that way and will always be. After 30 years of Angola, the Somoza regime in Nicaragua and Suharto in Indonesia it's clear to me that one person's terrorist is another person's best mate.      Opening up Swiss bank accounts is relatively easy compared to other countries. Liechtenstein has much stricter laws than even Switzerland and it may prove too much for the US to gain access to those accounts despite threat of financial isolation.      The Bush administration should define what a terrorist is and what a terrorist group is. By being biased towards some Islamic groups, the Bush administration seems to have forgotten or ignored other European and Israeli terrorist groups. These so-called terrorists have a huge intelligence network. They know how to get money from their sources. So, it is not easy to freeze these assets.      This policy sounds remarkably similar to the freezing of drug barons' assets - and we all know how successful that was. Have you ever heard of a poor or underfunded drugs cartel? Why are we so convinced that the same policy will work this time?      One of the best ways to trace terrorists is to ""follow the money"". A blanket freezing of assets may be counter-productive if it prevents the FBI from finding the real beneficiaries.      A banking system that can take 40 years to find accounts and pay out money to the Jewish people who suffered under the Nazis is both unlikely and unable to find accounts used by terrorist organisations. I have no doubt that many wealthy people hide monies from their government to avoid paying tax, these will mask the terrorist accounts. Organised crime already launders money. Governments have tried for years to stamp out such accounts with little success.      Does this mean that every multi-millionaire with money in offshore accounts will be treated as a possible terrorist? There are probably thousands of such accounts here on the Isle of Man alone, never mind the Channel Islands, Bermuda, Caymans etc where there are undoubtedly many more. I cannot see how it can be policed - no matter what barriers you put up, someone will find a way over them.      Talk about closing the stable door after the horse has bolted...      I am glad to see that the US is taking mild steps at this early stage of its war against terrorism. It is rather encouraging to see that the gung-ho attitude that many thought President Bush would adopt has been left at the very least, on the back burner. However, speculating on how effective the move will be is another matter. Only time will tell. I fear that Bin Laden has money scattered in every conceivable location yet it remains outside the reach of everyone, bar the man himself. And let us not forget, in the case of Bin Laden, we are not only dealing with a radical terrorist, we are also dealing with an incredibly intelligent man.      I definitely believe that no matter how time consuming tracking down these bank accounts is, it MUST be done. I also believe that this is a moment where the US should also be reflecting on how they have helped the actual situation so it won't happen again. Terrorism must be eradicated.      This is blood money and should be stopped. Banks are making huge profits and they should take it upon themselves to take care where they get their money. As with the ID card debate, a little inconvenience could be a huge benefit to law-abiding society. Isn't it about time the burden of proof rested with the depositor as to the legality of the funds rather than the system to prove that it is 'dirty money'      I hope this new legislation includes stopping funding to the IRA by East coast Irish Americans - somehow I doubt that it will be implemented against the USA's own citizens. But it would be a great step towards uniting the UK and USA if President Bush showed that ALL terrorism must be wiped out and not just terrorism that affects the USA.      If President Bush says that they have bank account details on groups associated with the attacks then the big question is: If they believe they can freeze the accounts now, why didn't they do this a long time ago? These groups have been suspect for a long time. It sounds like shutting the stable door after the horse has bolted to me!      Even if Mr Bush is successful in freezing terrorist assets, can he freeze their spirit or determination?      Even if they only stop one source of funding, it will be a help and will be worth it!      Mark [Belgium] suggests destroying the Taliban's poppy fields. This sounded like a good idea until I realised that it would cause a supply problem in the West. This in turn would drive prices up and crime figures would surely follow suit as addicts committed more crime to meet the higher prices demanded by dealers.      Rather than hit them in their pockets let's attack the poppy fields and wipe out the heroin trade they are so reliant on. We could do this with a viral agent or literally fire bomb the field. We ought to be looking at other areas such as the diamond and precious stones trade. Attack and regulate the commodities they deal and that will stop the flow of cash to the terrorists.      Well the only way to stop funding is to do it globally as the terrorist network is global as well. The USA is more focussed on organisations that are related directly or indirectly to Osama Bin Laden only. They are ignoring the point that money can come from other organisations, e.g. the fundamentalist organisations that are active in Kashmir in India or Pakistan.      Surely the terrorists have a lot of money stashed away in Swiss and Austrian banks that are beyond the reach of even the Swiss/Austrian authorities. Freezing their assets in America or elsewhere will do little to prevent the terrorists accessing funds.      One thing that should be considered is pressure on countries that hide dirty money under a cloak of refined respectability. Switzerland, Liechtenstein and many others should face condemnation for their actions as passive bystanders, profiting from and providing despots and terrorists alike with the opportunity to fund and continue their deeds without fear of economic loss.      I wonder if President Bush will be freezing the assets of Noraid which provides the IRA terrorists with their funds. Or are they classed as ""freedom fighters""?      The money supply to these terrorists won't be fully stopped but the bulk of it can. Major donations given to the Taleban regime have come from rich people in Saudi Arabia. Surely the US and the UK have enough influence in that region to lean on those governments to adopt a tougher policy. Funds have been raised within the UK itself for a jihad against Indian forces in Kashmir. There is a tendency in both the UK and USA to regard these activities with a benign eye until the west is personally affected. Now that it has been it is willing to act. Better late then never.      One thing I know for sure as an American is that the only way to really hurt someone is to leave them penniless. The attacks on this country only cost around $10,000 to carry out. Leave them with nothing so that they cannot function at all. Without money they will not be able to afford to fund training camps or purchase weapons. As a liberal I feel our conservative president is on the right track.      Freezing these organisations' assets is just the first step. The US realises it may only harm the terrorists a little but any harm done to terrorists is good. Europeans were so worried that Bush would jump into this conflict with immediate strikes. Give the man some credit. He is approaching the problem with intelligence. He will use forces in small quantities to capture Bin Laden and ensure that the Taleban's days are numbered. Bush is working on helping the Northern Alliance defeat the Taleban and bring Afghanistan and its unfortunate people into the 21st century.       I believe that what Bush is trying to achieve is justified and necessary if not a little ambitious. I agree with earlier comments that every little will help in an all out war against terrorism. Over time all these separate ventures may just make a dent. But I must say that if Bush is committing himself to the eradication of global terrorism then he really needs to lead from the front. He is aware of the fact that America is the largest contributor of funds, arms and training tools to terrorist groups in Northern Ireland. Yet there is no mention of severing these ties. What America cannot afford to do at the moment is to appear to be judging the differences between terrorists and freedom fighters. We all know where that attitude could lead us if the situation escalates in areas with large Muslim communities. "
HOC HOC-FB 3.57 " Shocked, disgusted, angry... there simply aren't enough words to describe how I'm feeling. Perhaps the worst part of it is that I just can't understand it, it's too difficult to comprehend. I was physically sick when I watched the pictures on TV, such was my shock. And I did something I haven't done in a long time - I prayed to God. Perhaps in such times, when our frail human minds struggle to cope with tragedies of this magnitude, we seek comfort elsewhere. I know I'll be praying for the City of New York again tonight.      I must send out my condolences to those who have been hurt and the loved ones of those who have been lost. These events have been an attack on humanity and have shaken the whole world. I am shaken by the events that have occurred in the past few days! I myself am a Muslim, and I fear that the world will strike out at Muslims. Although this attack may have been by Islamic extremists, it was not by each and every Muslim person alive today. Therefore, lashing out at a whole religion because of one group will only make matters worse. However, I do agree that these terrorists must be brought to justice... but it must be done in a reasonable and respectable manner.      I must once again send out my condolences to those who have been affected by this attack. It is a tragic loss and a disgrace to the whole of the human race.      I came to BBC Online to see how the world was reacting to what has happened so close to my own home. As a former New Yorker I am comforted by the sentiments I have read here online and feel secure that the world is behind us.      I am a young Muslim girl, and I see myself to be very European. These tragedies effected me so deeply and I fear that the fight against the terrorism will turn out into a fight against the Islam. Since Tuesday I feel very insecure in both senses, in life and in religion. Hope the modern societies can defend their values.      I am sickened and horrified by what has happened like everyone else. It too will take time for this all to sink in. However, let us not accept what has happened and yet let us not jump into war. Lets gather our strengths and deal with this in an appropriate manner. For America to act like cowboys and start waltzing in there would be a mistake. Lets gather our thoughts, calm down and work together to make sense of these last few days.      I can do nothing from here. I can only write here. I've been thinking about those who died since Tuesday. I've been thinking about this shame for days now. I'll be waiting for Justice until the end.      I could not believe my ears when I heard the news here at the office. I was petrified, literally petrified. I was numb from the feeling of terror and sadness in me. Four years ago I lived by New York area and was walking nearby the towers very often. All this left me very empty and sad, they have destroyed lives and symbols the way maybe Hitler only had done before, and I'm afraid it's not finished. This catastrophe had such impact on me to make me feel even smaller and weaker than what I already am as a human being. Life is absolutely precious, and we can be gone in a minute.      It's unbelievable. I'm stunned and unable to function properly. I can't comprehend that humans are capable of such acts. My heart goes out to all those devastated families and all those brave selfless people helping.      Shocked, grieved, and immensely scared. Retaliatory strikes meaning the loss of thousands more of innocent lives, an increase in deadly racism, the escalating situation in Israel. I fervently hope that those advocating reason and calmness will succeed and that my fears will be unfounded. Please do not forget that we need to address the underlying reasons, not fight terror with terror.      I find it hard to come to terms with what has happened. I am also horrified both at the act itself and by thought of how those people must have suffered. I sincerely hope that the US thinks very carefully before taking retaliatory action. As it already seems to be coming to light, there are more than one nationality of perpetrator and they have lived in and most likely planned this action from many friendly countries, (friendly to the US). The US finds itself between a rock and a hard place. By all means track down the culprits, bring them to justice. I recommend defiance in the face of those who would see the free world collapse. I suggest re-building the World Trade Center, showing them that they cannot win.      To all the people who have lost family or friends I would like to express my feelings of sympathy. I hope that a small number of fanatics will not be able to drive a wedge between the people of the world. Regardless of our religions we should all be able to live together peacefully! We have more in common than we are different. And why can we not respect our differences? Let's all make that effort!      I work in the City and was in NY in the WTC towers only last week. Several of my colleagues died last Tuesday, some who like myself go to do a days job in order to financially support parents who are dependent. I can only say that I hope that we catch those responsible and show them the number of lives they have wrecked.      Quite simply, I'm scared. I can see this blowing out of proportion. I also find it hard to reconcile my own fear with my anger and my sadness with the tragedy that occurred in New York, and those future tragedies that will occur in England in America in Afghanistan - everywhere.      As an American in London, I have watched the events of the past two and a half days unfold with a growing sense of disbelief and horror. Worries about friends and family added to the general sense of paralysis I felt on Tuesday afternoon. Now that the full enormity of what has happened is beginning to sink in, I find it difficult to read about the aftermath or watch the news without crying. I think I speak for all my fellow ex-pats when I say that I wish I was there so that I could help in some small way, and to be with my friends and family.      Fortunately for me I haven't lost anybody, but even so the attack on the US has made me numb. I've been walking around like a zombie the last few days in shock and sometimes I find tears in my eyes that spring up from no-where. It's impossible to describe, words seem almost meaningless.      With so many people travelling everyday, and very easy immigration rules in European countries it will soon happen here in Europe too. With Europe being an almost atheist continent where money is the new religion, we will have no chance to defend us properly. God bless the Free World and help us beat those fanatic idiots out there!      Tuesday's attacks to the US was terribly choking not only to US citizens but also to the rest of the world. I was always sceptical of the American reactions to world politics, but now I think that the world should unify and punish the ones that are responsible for these murders. The world as we know as changed for ever...      I feel very, very sorry for all those who died and for those who have lost their dearest people.      I am finding it very hard to believe that there is a God or any form of higher authority to look up to. Ashamed to be a part of this life on earth.      Much of your coverage concentrates on the US, but please do not forget this attack was an attack on the free world not just America. Of those who died in the buildings, there were Europeans, Asians, Americans, Africans ... and of course they were a mixture of religions including no doubt Muslims. The people who seem to be suggesting the US somehow deserved this attack are missing the point - people of many nations have been targeted, not just Americans.      Three years ago, my wife and I visited New York. We fell in love with the buzz, the electricity, the pure scent of capitalism one feels in that wonderful city. So to see this happen in such a wonderful place, the heart of the global economy - it's simply earth-shattering, devastating. We cannot even start to imagine what it would be like to have lost a friend in that carnage.      The above has not affected me in the way of knowing people lost in the devastation but all I can imagine is what everyone is going through. There really are some wicked people in this world. My sincere heart really does go out to everyone in America. I feel so sad, I am sure whatever England can do to help we will. Do not give up hope ever, these people will get caught and punished. I am thinking of you all.      I have been in a state of shock since the tragedy - it is still unbelievable but we know it happened. It has made me realise that pressure and strees at work pale into insignificance in the light of this tragedy. My partner and I send our sympathy and support to anyone touched by this event. We wish we could do something constructive to help.      Myself and work colleagues will be observing the 3 minutes silence tomorrow.      I am shocked by what has happened in New York. It is a tragedy and the terrorists need to be caught and punished for this despicable crime. However at the same time I am concerned that the many people are going to attack innocent Muslim people. I am a Hindu and today someone mistook me for a Muslim on the train. A man screamed a whole load of abuse at me. 99.9% of Muslims condemn what has happened. I was shaken by his threats and I feel that people should not get involved in anti-Muslim attacks. A terrorist is a terrorist - regardless of where they come from.      I mourn the loss of the security that my children will not have. I am uplifted by the bravery of all those working so hard to save lives, counsel and support those who have lost loved ones. The whole world has lost its freedom this week and we must all be vigilant to protect and build our mutual security and freedom once again. This is an attack on humanity!      The effect has been just awful. Luckily I have checked on all my 'close' NYC friends and they are fine. However I worked for American companies for 6 years and waiting for numbers and lists of names is just awful. You know that some of the names will be colleagues of yours. Also I have a friend who has just transferred from the Morgan Stanley office in NYC. I can't even begin to imagine her grief.      We are here for you.      This whole thing can be laid at the feet of the airlines and airport operators. Who gets hijacked in this day and age? How can passengers get access to the cockpit? AA and United should be punished for criminal negligence and so should the owners of Logan airport. They are as responsible as the hijackers.      Total shock and disbelief. The pictures on TV and in the newspapers are harrowing, especially seeing desperate people throwing themselves out of windows. My heart goes out to the world, the losses of all countries. I am also filled with fear of a reprisal and fear that people will be persecuted now for their religion. Every time I hear a police siren go past our office my heart freezes because it is all too real that it could happen here (we are very near the American embassy). There is a huge sense of vulnerability and confusion - it is incomprehensible how this happened and the loss of life is heartbreaking.      One must remember the fact that many Muslims work in the WTC. The current whipped-up hatred towards Muslims is not justified as the terrorists seem to have fought for the rights of their people and not religion.      The working class is a worldwide group, so we have ALL lost friends in these attacks. The majority of those killed were office workers, fire fighters, policemen and other 'ordinary' employees. This is what is so appalling. Capitalism created the poverty, suffering and anger that enabled young men to be brainwashed into carrying out mass murder.      Numb, absolute horror, I can't stop crying. What bothers me is that no one else around me seems to have been slightly affected by this horrendous event or its implications other than to worry that they might lose their jobs in the imminent recession. What put it all in perspective for me was watching the survivors of the plane crashes hanging out of the windows, thinking they'd be OK, that surely someone could pull them out of the buildings ... then watching the offices collapse and knowing that those people suffered horrific injuries and terror before they died. I'm crying as I write this. How could ANYONE do this to innocent people???      As a security officer at Brisbane airport we are all constantly on the alert for any suspect people. I feel that we are doing a good job.      What type of society do we live in that allowed such a horrific crime to be committed. It is frightening to think what the future holds not just for us but for future generations. Is there going to be a future?      As a Scot living far from New York and Washington, I find it hard to comprehend why I personally feel so badly and emotionally affected by Tuesday's events. I have visited the States many times and have always found the American people to be genuinely warm and friendly and in no way did they deserve any of this appalling suffering. I am married and have two young children and I pray for their sakes that the U.S. - and the rest of the world - takes the right course of action to achieve justice against those responsible and that a lasting solution can be found so that people of all religions can live in harmony.      Terrible-Shocking- Disbelief-      After several attempts I managed to get a connection to my brother in NY and confirmed he was OK. I sat watching the 24-hour news in total stunned disbelief. Only a year ago I stood at the foot of the Twin Towers and admired their beauty - a part of me still expects to wake up and find it was all a dream. I sincerely hope Muslims in general are not ostracised for this atrocity as it is clearly only a relatively small group of people who have perpetrated it. Working in the City myself I find myself more aware of the vulnerability of our infrastructure. My heart goes out to those who are still waiting for news from their loved ones, and especially to those who will ultimately hear the worst.      Once more all the terrorists have proved is that their cause is not just. No cause can be worth such devastation. My heart goes out to all the families of those that died. My loathing goes out to all those that were a part of this. "
HOC HOC-FC 2.88 " I think our ultimate retaliation against these people will be if we as Americans can look at ourselves as a society and draw strength and build a sense of cohesiveness from this. We need to see how very precious our freedoms are and appreciate them and work together to safeguard them. Perhaps we will be able to rise above the terror and to purge our own society of much of the violence which plagues us from within.      Violence causes violence. Every action causes a reaction. Now, US leaders have to maintain calm and not give in to the people's anger and pain. It's incredible to know so few terrorist acts happen in a place like the United States, but perhaps this is the high price to be paid for the luxury and ""isolated"" way of life of the American people. I really hope they focus on changing US policy (reason of attack) rather than focusing on just punishing the terrorists. As long as there will be life on Earth, there will be terrorists and an attack to innocent people will only justify not only this but future attacks.  I am very angry about the evil that has been done to my nation on this day. Today will be remembered, as is Dec 7th. While I want revenge with all my heart, I do not want the US to lash out and kill innocent people. However, once the ones responsible are found our retribution should be horrendous and without mercy. Yes, we got lax, but today marks a new day in the way we will view the world. The ones who did this cannot understand that this has not frightened us, it has enraged us!  Should be retaliation???????? God! Haven't we learnt anything? Retaliation against who? The Palestinian civilians back in the Middle East or every one that has an Arabic surname?  Eventual retaliation is a given, justice only a possibility. Wider and protracted conflict is likely, the only real question being the extent to which all free and open societies will join together in facing that conflict. Mr Blair's remarks in that regard will find a receptive audience here.  I was shocked to watch George Bush speaking at Barksdale Air Force Base in Louisiana. I saw the speech he made on television and he claimed that he would ""hunt down and punish"" the people responsible for the attacks. I understand that this could mean bringing them to justice, i.e. life imprisonment or in the US, capital punishment, but the way Mr Bush spoke all the people I was watching the story unfold with immediately thought by his tone that he meant to take military action against the country whose citizens had carried out this attack. This would be an extremely foolish path to take, although I would not put such stupidity past Bush.  As an American citizen, I am horrified and outraged at the assault on my country. My gut reaction is frankly to destroy whoever did this terrible thing. This having been said, as a citizen of the world and as a Catholic Christian, I desperately hope that the administration will think long and hard before it takes any retaliatory action which will add to number of innocent people who are dead. Furthermore, if our reaction is rash, we will only add to the anti-American sentiments that are so prevalent in many parts of the world.      The country with the greatest heart has been hit in its soul. This infamous day will serve as a historic lesson to all freedom loving nations. While we thrive on freedom those who are brought up with hatred abuse these freedoms to destroy us. Only a sick society could rejoice when such a calamity befalls others. Yet, we see in the Arab world street celebrations.      Most merciful at war and most gracious in peace, the United States will respond with fair power to all those who mistook its benevolence as weakness. Those who created a culture of death around them will pay for their actions. The US will not yield till the gullible idiots who commit suicide missions will no longer find anyone to incite and finance them. This dark day will mark our lives forever. Let us use this lesson and act to make the world a better place.      Terrorism has not, so far, been treated as a serious enough concern for the affected countries in the world to mount a joint offence against it. Instead, it has always been considered a domestic problem. It is essential from now on that countries like the US, Israel and India pool their forces to combat terrorist organizations and the nations that harbour them.      We are often accused of being naive, which may be true. We are blamed for the world's ills, and sometimes agree. We wish for others to prosper, and are saddened when they don't. We often are quick to react, but slow to truly anger. We are now angry. A cold fury that hasn't existed here for generations. We don't intend to rely on friends. We will accept diplomacy backed up with actions (actively rooting out those responsible), but are resigned to a protracted reckoning.      Innocent neutral people paid the price of their govt's policies (be they right or wrong). Now some other country's innocent people may pay the price. Can't we just create a 4th World of neutral innocent people where all of us can live in peace without dirty global politics??     Airplane cockpits, controls and pilots should be in a secure inaccessible vault-like area in future, (food, beverages and toilets within such area). By adopting these simple alterations on commercial planes we would effectively disallow takeover of flight controls and limit the damage of these kamikaze style hijackings, regardless of any damage that could be inflicted on passengers or cabin crew.     Perhaps it is time to reconsider our foreign policy towards the Middle East and the Third World. Not everyone shares our vision of the world. We and the US like to dominate the world, now the worm has turned, and maybe we should not think about revenge, but reconsider the results of our policies and support of Israel, and be afraid.     My spirits, even just as a UK citizen who last December stood on top of the WTC, have been raised by the idea that the twin towers may be rebuilt. In the years that it takes to do this (if given the go ahead), the US, Britain and other democracies of the world can search out those behind Tuesday's events. Then, as an opening ceremony, I suggest the vermin responsible are taken to the top of the new WTC and thrown off.      I am an Afghan American, who was brought up here in the States my whole life. We have family who worked at the World Trade Centre and the surrounding buildings who we have still not heard from yet. However, I will tell you as a practising Muslim, we believe that the act that occurred on Tuesday is not a part of Islamic faith, law, or right. We believe in peace and harmony. But please understand that we Muslims who have family here in the States are concerned about our well-being and our name. There have been many threats aimed at our communities in the past 48 hours. Unfortunately, we do not have any leader from a Muslim's point of view to help clarify where we stand. We have nothing but respect for the Constitution of America and acts the government proceeds with. Yesterday, was a day of sorrow for all of us Americans here and around the world. However this will only make us stronger and better. And it will make us unite together as one to stop terrorism!      We will not be frightened into submission. Those who seek to intimidate should realize that it is futile. God Bless America and all of our wonderful international allies!      I am a Muslim and join with the rest of the world in condemning the atrocities carried out in US in the name of Islam. I feel it is important that people do not judge a religion by the acts of extremists who claim to use it as their justification for acts of terror. If indeed Osama Bin-Laden is proven to be behind the attacks, then he should swiftly be brought to justice.      It is time America's allies stand by her side. Australia and Australians will give our close friends and allies whatever assistance she may ask for. Otherwise which target will be next, The Sydney Opera House, Big Ben?      First of all, I want to send my condolences to the American people. We, in Israel, know what it's like living in the fear of terror. We know what the Arab-Islamic hate is capable of, and we are so sorry to see these terrible sights of so many people murdered on their way to work, in their offices, and on the streets of NYC.      In reply to Shane below, I am also ashamed at his parochial attitude that clearly indicates that he does not consider this Britain's problem. If this tragedy had happened here, we would have expected help from our allies, including America, this is the meaning of being an ally. Or perhaps we should we just wait until a similar tragedy happens here before we become involved. This problem requires global co-operation to defeat it.      First of all I would like to express my condolences to those affected by this overwhelming tragedy. However I am writing this in response to our own PM's speech and quite frankly I am worried. While I sympathise with the US at this time of grief, I feel that he said very little in his speech, but by doing so, spoke volumes. I fear we are being dragged into a potentially volatile conflict against the British people's wishes. Whilst most British people would be shocked as I am at the atrocities, I am sure most share my worries at being taken into a possible war of choice rather than being at war.      I'm 15 and I think the people who did this to America should pay for what they have done! I hope Britain and America pull together and find these people who did this to innocent American people      Why is it so simple to get from the cabin of a passenger aircraft to the cockpit. Travelling on a suburban train into London this morning it would have been almost impossible for me to get to the driver and the controls of the train.      I think that it is absolutely PATHETIC that so many of the people from other countries leaving their commentary feel so free to condemn the US, and our President for his speech and its inherent undertones of retaliation. If we stand down and do nothing - the comment would be that we are afraid, if we immediately react with military force, we are bullies. I hope we are thoughtful in our actions, not reactive alone. But we have been injured and cannot reasonably be expected to simply wait it out. For those of you who call us bullies, check you history book folks. Some of you would be very hard-pressed without us.      Our action should first be to declare ourselves free from terror. We should not let those who perpetrated this cowardly act see us on our knees. We must stand tall. We must also take action. We must band together and attack terrorism at its rotten core, not just these perpetrators, but all. If they are on the run forever, they can't committ any terrorist attacks. We owe action and resolve to the fallen, not just as citizens of the civilized world, but as human beings in general. If we don't demonstrate resolve and our might, it may be London, or Brussels or any other city in any country.      This is an easy one. How should the US react? Once we know for sure who did this, hit them as hard as we can. How should the rest of the world (who we saved during WWI AND WWII, and who we rebuilt during the late 1940's and 50's, and who now want to turn their collective backs on us) react? Just sit down and shut up. In case you don't know, in this instance most of us don't really care what the rest of the world has to say. Just don't get in the way. That's all you have to do.      This is a ridiculous and barbaric act of terrorists. All countries should join hands to fight against terrorism. All terrorist outfits should be banned immediately and cross border terrorism should be stopped at any cost. I feel America should punish those culprits and those who supported them in a very hard way without affecting innocent civilians.      The US nation and its leaders need to think very long and hard on what reaction to take, and against whom. I only hope that what was done in response to the bombing here in Tanzania, and in Kenya is not done again. It accomplished very little, if anything at all. The US has to rethink its foreign policies in areas such as the Mid-East. With such hatred growing against the United States there must be some reasons. I think the US has blindly backed Israel and so put itself against the predominantly Muslim Arab neighbors. I want to let your American readers know that I am completely and utterly shocked with, and absolutely cannot fathom the evil that went into this attack. But the US has finally got to realize that its foreign policies make other nations and people angry. I am just so sorry that innocent civilians had to pay the price.      We can't forgive, forget or undo.We can only cry and fear for more remembering that more blood won't bring the heat back in our hearts. I'm still hoping that hate and revenge won't be our final mistakes.      It still seems like the worst nightmare ever to us! Whoever is responsible for this cowardly attack has to be found and punished for each and every victim and its suffering relatives and friends! Don't let them put the world's peace in danger! Our thoughts are with everybody affected by this tragedy.     If you surf on the internet, you will notice, that lots of sites have gone offline! We don't think that is a good solution! In a situation like this, with such terrible things happening, people have to speak to each other, exchange opinions, but not shut up!! We have to stand together! Only if people say what they think, and stick together can we avoid crazy minorities growing, not even knowing what terrible things they do!!! May God bless America and its citizens!      The American disaster is so hard to describe, apart from atrocious. I would hope that the world reacts in an objective manner. As for America they should also try and retaliate in an objective manner although this will be very hard. America does have a history of jumping in feet first and the last thing I think the world wants is World War III.      How should the world react? War. Hit the terrorists and their base countries hard. Political and economic targets. An international effort.      What those people did was pure evil there is no other way of putting it.The people behind it should be punished at all costs,to make sure nothing like this ever happens again.      Nobody of sound mind could possibly fail to be totally outraged and disgusted by the occurances in the US yesterday. If, as early investigations suggest, Middle Eastern factions are involved,then the more moderate Muslim nations should show their support for humanity, rout out the perpetrators of these crimes and their allies and work with the west to bring them to justice. Hell will surely engulf the earth, should this not be so.The thoughts and sympathies of all decent humankind is with the victims and their families at this difficult time.      A terrible tragedy, a huge loss of life... Let's hope that the Bush administration does not turn this tragedy into an unnecessary war. As shocking as the destruction of the World Trade Centre was - and I'm still struggling to believe it - if America wants to prove itself as the 'good' in the world that it so confidently boasts about, then life should continue as normal to show that the country has not been affected. What Bush seems to be planning is not justice - it is revenge.      My first initial reactions to the tragedy that unfolded yeasterday was first disbelief and then great sadness and anger, my thoughts and prayers are with our fellow citizens. The perpetrators must be brought to justice and be dealt with accordingly. Whatever it takes!!      As the true horror of this atrocity unfolds over the coming days and even weeks, we must be very delicate in our response. Of course it is necessary for any democratic freedom-loving country to act, we must do so prudently. We cannot allow ourselves to act solely on our passions without clearly understanding the impact. We must remember that if we fail to consider the lives of many innocent people in our actions, we fail to differentiate ourselves from those factions and people we aim to target.      While this is a tragedy, a measured response is worth waiting for. These terrorists took a long time planning this and so should we. The country harboring them should be given a chance to turn them over for trial. Any country giving them refuge hopefully will feel differently after seeing their actions. If they do not, they are also culpable.      It's hard to believe so many people root for retaliation. What would that solve? As in the horrible tragedy here, more innocent civilians will die. How will that make anyone feel better? It's better to stay calm, find the people responsible for this reprehensible act and prosecute them.      While it is undeniable that the events of yesterday were both horrendous and indefensible we must transform this crisis into something positive and create a legacy that in no way encourages acts like those witnessed by the world yesterday. To retaliate with barbarism and violence would only serve to escalate antagonisms, make more innocent civillians suffer and encourage more attacks from terrorist groups on the 'free' world. It is undeniable that terrorist attacks perpetrated against the US are largely the product of the US' own making. Inconsistent, selfish and bullish, US foreign policy inescapably creates a legacy of bitterness and injustice. Rather than seeking retribution, the US should take a long hard look at their own policies and seek understanding and self-enlightenment rather than scapegoats.      Our heart goes out to everyone involved in these terrible acts of evil. We in the UK will stand side by side with the U.S. to ensure that these people are punished. Britain and America have always been allies and they should unite further to stand together against this new evil. We watched the terror unfold on TV and once again our hearts go out to our friends in America. I have been to New York and Pittsburgh. I have been to the top of the World Trade Centre and I am hurting for those people.      This is devastating for America and the whole world. I don't like war or hearing people getting killed. But some action needs to take place on people who commit these kinds of violent terrorist crimes - it is just uncalled for. As the bibles say there's a time for everything under heaven - there's a time to cry, time to mourn, time for war, time for peace and so on.... Please pray for God to rain his love down on the people who lost loved ones.      Surely we have seen time and again that dialogue at least gives us the opportunity to make progress, and often results in at least some temporary decrease in violence. Military or physical response (against who?) will only increase bitterness and envy and delay any reasonable solution. The world leaders must sit down together and act as one. And let us hope that the lunatic demonstrators let them get on with it. How do they go about it?      It was a British statesman who said... ""The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing"" - Edmund Burke.      This is fuelling the already anti-Muslim feeling in the world. I hope that people have the sense to know that the actions of a few insane people aren't necessarily condoned by the many peace-loving Muslims around the world today. I know as a Muslim that after this day I will always feel uneasy, even being in a society tolerant to my faith but suspicious of my intentions. Justice should be done but America has repeatedly made mistakes in the past with retribution. I can only pray that more innocents are not killed in revenge.      I am shocked by some of the comments on this site. Many people seem to think that it is okay to attack ""the country that these terrorists belong to"", whatever that means. However, I am sure this would not be the sentiment if said country were the UK, or Norway, or Australia. Lurking beneath these calls for retaliation is a notion that civilians in some countries in the world are expendable, whilst inhabitants of other countries are possessed of a more worthy existence. A group of people committed these terrible acts, not an entire population, so how can the value of innocent civilians' lives be brushed aside just because the US does not attach as much value to the lives of some countries' peoples as it does to others?      I personally sympathise with the Americans for the unbelievable and barbaric acts incurred upon them. But I think the time has come for America to incorporate we Africans to help in battling against terrorism and supporters of terrorist acts.      The fact that Bush's reaction appears as though it will not be hasty does not preclude it from being ill considered. Maybe such horrors as the events of yesterday should make the CIA think twice before adding to a list of their former allies which already includes Bin Laden, Saddam Hussein and Manuel Noriega.      My heart is going out to all of the American People. I wish President Bush the best there is. May Peace come back for the Amercan people. I feel with you all.      All states sponsoring terrorism in any part of the world should be dealt with firmly whether they were involved in this attack or not! We should understand that terror cannot be tolerated in today's world. I think this is an attack on freedom and liberty as much as on our civilization. Being in a country like India, where terrorists acts are so common, I can really feel the pain our brothers and sisters in America are going through. Let the world join in countering terrorism and I think it is time for us to hold an international conference on terrorism.      Those of you in the UK calling for a retaliation - just remember this - if the USA strikes their enemy then one of the first targets in response will be Menwith Hill, 3 miles out of Harrogate. How many innocent British citizens will die as a result of the US imposing their military bases in our country? Yesterday we sat in terror wondering if we would be the next target, how much worse will this fear be if the USA start bombing suspected countries?      The terrorist threat NEEDS to be wiped out. It has finally pushed countries past their limit of tolerance. Kosovo, Macedonia, Israel and Palestinians, Northern Ireland, Russia and Chechnya, and now in America. It is spreading. There needs to be a special international force set up to counter terrorism and terrorist forces, eg: IRA, KLA etc. The force should be able to attack terrorist organisations at their very foundations regardless of where they are. It means that international co-operation needs to be improved and Intelligence shared.      People who supply the Terrorists with the means to wage their vendettas must also be targeted. There is no doubt now that Terrorism is a huge threat to society and people's lives. It could possibly lead to war at the minute, this needs to be averted at all costs or it will be disastrous for the world.      I express my heartfelt sympathy to the people, who had lost their near and dear ones in this barbaric and cowardly attack. But, if you go through the credentials of these terrorists, many of them were groomed by leaders of countries, who were not far-sighted enough to perceive that these terrorists may one day turn against them. I don't know when will the leaders start opposing terrorism honestly than just extending lip service.      The question that should be asked and is not is: ""Why does this happen only to the US? Why not to Sweden, Norway, Switzerland, Holland, Italy or others? The other nations should be urging the U.S. to change their anti-Islamic foreign policies which are giving us unneeded enemies.      More bombs and destruction won't do any good to anyone, only the innocent will suffer. US government should work out all the possible solutions but should also know that there are always more innocent people than the guilty ones. Bombs never hurt the guilty.      There is no doubt that this senseless murdering of innocent civilians cannot be justified under any terms, save those of barbarism. But once again the flawed argument of security through military might has been put into question.      When America finds out who are responsible for this cowardly disgusting attack they should use whatever actions they deem necessary to make sure that future terrorists and countries that support them pay dearly for their actions. The feeling in Australia is of shock and disbelief and one of support for the American people.      There is no question as to the inhumanness and barbarism of the terrorist attacks in the U.S. that killed innocent civilians. But why target the U.S.? American leaders must evaluate their policy and stance in the Middle East crisis. They say they are a powerful nation, then use this power to restore peace in the region, a peace that will reverberate throughout the world.      The attack on New York and Washington DC is not just an attack against the US, but against the whole human race and it saddens me that this could happen to a big and powerful country like the US. All the peoples of the world must be vigilant against the increasing terrorism globally, but not to the extent that we immediately form conclusions out of speculations.      We have to retaliate and put a stop to whoever is responsible. We have to make them an example to all the rest of the terrorists out there who want to cause destruction.      I agree entirely with what the likes of James Rubin and Ehud Barak said on the BBC's ""Newsnight"" programme last night. Before any kind of military reprisals are taken, international consensus must be sought. By this, I mean Russia and especially China. Otherwise, the fight against these terrorists will never succeed. I know most Arab and Islamic states condemn this attack and sympathise with the US on an official level, but that isn't the way many of their citizens feel. In that case, those governments must expend every effort to repress further terrorism within their countries.      This is a tragedy of enormous proportions! My heart goes out to all those families who have lost loved ones. America must react fast to show the terrorists that they will not tolerate the death of innocent people! They can't get away with this carnage! These people are brainwashed into thinking they will die as martyrs, and there will be plenty more of them willing to give up their lives for the cause!      This is a big loss of, and for, human lives. This should be countered throughout the world. so that nobody else ever dare to commit such an act. How unsecure we are even at our own places? and we claim to live in 21st Century.      The truth is that terrorism is very hard to defend against. In the UK we have had to live with the threat of bombings from the IRA for the last 30 years (funded in part by the US with their Noraid scheme it should be said). It also goes to show what a pointless waste of money the proposed missile defence scheme will be. It is merely simple posturing to try to reassure the American people. In reality the terrorist groups and rogue states will always find low-tech attacks much easier to carry out.      I offer my sincere condolences to the American people but please realise that these actions were cleverly designed to encourage a poorly thought-out response. Don't allow the terrorists a further victory by playing into their hands.      The world should react by sending their thoughts and prayers to the American people. If any good can come of this immense tragedy, it can be the realisation that people of all nations, all races and religions were in the World Trade Center. What we all share is a common humanity - this act was not terrorism, but murder on a mass scale. Let us pray no more innocents die as a result of this, and that the perpetrators are bought to swift justice.      Bush has been seen to make more enemies than friends in his short term in office. America should not only look for who is responsible but what has driven these people to commit such a horrific act. I fear though that we have learnt little from many years of wars and conflicts and that America along with other western countries believe that more aggression will some how resolve the situation.      Living in an age of technological and intellectual advancement it is inconceivable that we should be witness to such horrendous acts. What ignorance and what hatred must run through the minds of the perpetrators of this inhumane, barbarism. It goes without saying that the eyes of the world will look to the Middle East and the fingers of blame would be pointed at so-called terrorists like bin Laden, Kadafi, and Saddam Hussein; let us remain patient in the face of adversary and suspend all judgement until there is verification. It may be that we accuse a people unjustly out of ignorance and then become regretful of our actions. May God's succour and mercy fill the hearts of those who have lost their loved ones.      This country will pull together and weather this disaster as it has for all others before this. Killing more innocent people is not the answer to this mass-murder. There is a supernatural force that will eventually decide the fate of all of us - and ultimately justice WILL be handed out in fair measure.      What concerns me is that the President and other officials will jump to conclusions about who was responsible for this attack. This is a tragedy, but let's not compound this tragedy by acting in the heat of the moment. A violent reaction isn't always the best way to deal with this type of tragedy.      I have read many are writing US should act with patience. I would support it, if doing that STOPS the destruction. But I don't believe it would. Offence turns out to be the best way of defence sometimes. First the effort should be on knowing the responsible parties.      My heart felt sympathy to the American people for the untold tragedy that has befallen them. Nonetheless, President Bush ought to review his expressed policy on the so-called missile defence shield. The money for such a project can be better spent on internal security of the American people. Rogue nations can strike with or without missile defence shield.      Those who committed these acts using innocent plane passengers as unwilling weapons - and any who are found to be duplicitous in planning and funding these acts - should be brought before The Hague to stand trial for crimes against humanity. Any country found to be harbouring those responsible should also receive the severest international sanctions until the fugitives are brought to justice. It's as simple as that. My prayers go out to the victims and their families.      My country should react with reason and caution. However, when the responsible parties are identified, retaliation should occur on as large a scale as is necessary. If you disagree, please explain your logic. I will listen, but for the life of me, I see no other action any more reasonable or compassionate.      Even on a day like this I knew I could count on our usual critics: the Brits. This is particularly sad to me as just last night I read a bit of WWII history, and of how close the Brits and the US once where. But I guess those days are over. That's too bad because we are in many ways on the brink of war again... How could this NOT be the case when probably no less than 20,000 Americans were killed today? As usual, we will go it alone, with the Brits and the Europeans criticizing us every step of the way. Our response should be wise and not knee-jerk (and protect Arab-Americans here). But by God it should be so totally devastating to those responsible that they never again will commit such an act. The US is far from perfect... but don't tell me WE deserve this.      People in the U.S. are comparing this event to Pearl Harbor. If the number of killed and wounded gets above 10,000, most Americans will call for all out war. At this point, retaliation is inevitable. The terrorists should be identified and turned over for trial.      I am sixteen, and although deeply horrified and upset by the tragedies seen today, I think that a general retaliation at this point in time would be foolish. Why risk starting yet another world war when we are still not entirely sure who caused this? I believe that careful investigational work would be a good place to start in order to give people a firm place to point the finger. Then and only then should we consider how to go about finding a way to punish those involved.      I do hope that my interpretation of Tony Blair's speech is wrong. surely by declaring that ""we the democracies will come together to fight to rid the world of this evil"" he is already signing a verbal declaration of war. I hope that this isn't the case because it would be an even bigger tragedy to start the process that lead to the deaths of so many back in WW1 & WW2 yet again. We all thought that we had learnt from our ancestors' mistakes, but a retaliation would only prove that to be wrong.      Were terrorists from some other nation responsible or are they from our own shores? When the Oklahoma bombing occurred many people, in a rush to judgement, were blaming all Arabs - sometimes those in our own Arabic communities. But I do not believe that the Palestinians rejoicing about today's tragedy are representative of all Arabs any more than I believe that Timothy McVeigh represents all Americans. Let us urge our government intelligence communities - worldwide - to assist us in naming and finding those responsible. Only then, should we retaliate.      First and foremost we offer our support and prayers to all those innocent people caught in this cruel tragedy. Now the policy makers in the US are forced to know what terrorism means when countries like India, Israel have long been crying for counter measures. It's the time to make a network of anti-terrorism and wipe it out from its roots.      With all due respect to Mr Shah of Pakistan, Israel is the Middle Eastern country that has shown constant support for the United States. Why on earth should this cowardly deed encourage the U.S. to abandon our ally, and support the factions that are constantly denouncing the United States and have repeatedly engaged in terrorist attacks against our citizens?      We are shocked but I think the USA should leave its undue sport of Israel.      Yes there will be retaliation and so there should be. However it must be done in a measured way after due deliberation. This will help ensure that the will of the whole domocratic world will be behind the action.      However horrible, inhuman, and cowardly these atacks might be, I truly believe we are at a turning point. I hope the world will realise that violence, and a violent retaliation, will not solve the underlying human, social, economic, racist problems which fertilise and motivate radical groups and persons. The USA must guard against falling for the same methods as the terrorists when responding to this horror.      Don't kid yourself that this terrorist act is a response to any specific political event(s) or situation. It is a direct and vicious attack on core Western values of freedom, human dignity, and the sanctity of life. If Israel didn't exist, the terrorism would not abate one iota. The perpetrators and their collaborators must be brought to justice.      It is really terrible to kill and torture the civilians. The torture attacks on the World Trade Center, and the Pentagon is really a cowardly act. All the nations should work together to stop all types of torture all over the world      As an American, I'm suddenly found weaker than I was just a day ago. Today not just us Americans, but the world was shown that terror has many faces. Now is the time to bring all of our resources together to bring peace and security to people around the world. When will the countries of the world understand that violent acts never resound. Today America was darkened, tomorrow we will shine again and move forward. Today I ask that the world take a moment and pray for the thousands of people alive and dead who have been touched and changed forever in history by what has happened today. The human race will go on....for if we give in now, we'll never reach our goals of greater existence in life.      We need to take our time, run down every lead, and then, and only then, strike. Rash acts tend to create catastrophes. Time is on our side, and when we are sure of who is responsible (including those who gave the required support) strike with all of the power and fury that the American people are capable of.      I think America should now reform by changing its aggressive foreign policy which is an opening call to people it is repressing.      Retaliation should be forthcoming. But it will not change the victim mentality of many nations who blame the US for all of their woes. After all, blaming the US is a lot easier than creating a better life for themselves.      But there are some very fundamental things which we need to count on, such as people's feelings and their religious belief. There are people from the US and other parts of the world contributing economically to the Terrorist groups in Pakistan, Afghanistan. We need to figure out the root cause and change the attitude of such people, and it means a long way to go.      I would like to thank the British people for their selfless attitude in offering help to my country in this time. I hope that my country finds those responsible and handles them accordingly.      What has happened is tragic and inhuman, but using this as a means of attacking people we hate because they do not believe in our ways is equally inhuman and unjust. what the powerful nations should do to prevent such horrific events is to promote equal rights and justice, people go to such extremes when they are oppressed, ask yourself why is America always the target.      Yes, the rest of the World must loudly pronounce their disgust with these violent acts and that they will help bring the perpetrators to justice. Clearly these terrorists do not value human life. Maybe now the West can better understand the Israeli reaction to the Palestinian violence and the Palestinian suicide bombers!      There will be retaliation, I'm sure. We can just pray that it won't be in the shape of all-out war against a country suspected of protecting those responsible. We are on the verge of World War III here, and we must be careful.      Air strikes should be proposed by Nato. These airstrikes should be done on the country where these terrorist groups belong to, if it is not possible to neutralise them. No mercy should be shown.      If America is not showing off, as usual, and if they are a bit clever, they should tie up Pakistan, which provides logistic and assistance to Islamic terrorist groups and which supposedly has the nuclear bomb. In order to do so, they will probably need a ""little"" help from other superpowers, India and China. That means the USA should start talking with them on fair basis.      Yes, the developed world leaders should: Retaliate by working effectively to solve major crises in Africa, Palestine, Sri Lanka etc. Retaliate by bringing in some of the isolated countries into the mainstream. Retaliate by not selling small arms and landmines to countries or firms that channel them to areas of conflict. Retaliate by cancelling debt to the world's poorest countries. Retaliate they should. It is better to avoid a fire than fight it.      If it is proven that the attack is from a Middle Eastern terrorist group, the British government should stop meddling in the internal affairs of these countries. Give them enough weapons and let them kill each other! I work in the Canary Wharf and certainly do not want to die for our country's stance in another country which has no strategic interest to us.      Should there be retaliation or will that lead to greater conflict throughout the world? Very premature. If I were asked now, I would say yes, massive retaliation. But when things come down... Lets be patient, find who's responsible and bring them to proper justice. A full trial, unlike these ""people"" we are human beings, we are better than they are.      If caught I would not recommend the death penalty. Let them live, the world can see how shallow and pathetic they really are. "
HOC HOC-FD 2.32 " I think that Muslims are not responsible for the horrible event because this kind of action is against the sacred rules of Islam. We do not like terrorism. Now the super power will have to think to the sorrow and horror if someone destroys your homes in Kashmir, in Palestine,and in every where when you take action against Islam, the peaceful religion..      The recent terrorist attack on USA is a shock to us as much as anyone else. Anyone who commits such horrendous acts against humanity and innocent civilians does not work for any religion, but only for destruction. No religion in the world, especially Islam allows killing innocent people in the name of holy war.  We need this moment to mourn our dead. My prayers are for those who have lost friends and relatives. Our spirit, however, will never submit to the craven and debased fantasies of those responsible. This was an act of war, and we will respond at the time and place of our choosing. We will never give in to terror.  Although I live 2000 miles from New York City, this is a sad shock. I've spent most of my day staring at the horror on my television. But through all of this it's wonderful how so much of the world has offered aid and condolences to the US and as a citizen of the United States I want to thank the world for all the help that they've been offering. I'm just so excited to see so many countries working together amidst all of the chaos!  The shocks are even felt half way around the world as the busy morning traffic is just a trickle as every TV set has an audience and everyone is asking questions. Our daily lives and the worries we think we have in them pale in comparison today.  I am a 13-year-old boy and when I got home and saw the news I was in shock. How could people be so evil, do some thing that horrible for what? I am asking the people who are doing this to stop you are hurting many lives even people who live miles away. I know how it feels to lose people in your life and I don't like it at all. I want the world to live in peace, but I know that this will never happen. The question that every one asks is Why? There are many reasons but only pure evil people would kill others  I was watching the incidents on the television. The whole sky filled with ashes seemed to me as a miniature version of the atom bomb explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War. History repeats itself! But at the cost of innumerable human lives, every time. The group of persons who committed this condemnable act must know that, they are not going to achieve anything great by slamming down the two towers of WTC.  Our office is empty. Everyone has felt the impact of this disgusting act. I'm leaving now to go and hug my nine-year-old daughter and try and explain to her what makes certain people so evil.... but of course I don't have the answer to that question. To the victims... please tell the world what we can do to help you in your time of crisis.  The worst has been seeing pictures of Palestinians and Arabs dancing with joy in the streets. Do they think this is what we do when they are bombed? The problems in these regions existed for centuries before the US was even founded. It's not our fault these countries can't get along, but it is somehow our fault that we don't have the solution to their problems. This is the worst thing, knowing that somewhere out there people are watching the horrible pictures on CNN with glee. If you these acts will get you to heaven, you have another think coming.  I heard the tragedy as it happened over the BBC World Service this morning, then viewed the images on the web site. That this was not done by aliens, a la 'Mars Attacks' but by people you could have next to on a bus; human beings as yourself is the most terrifying part of this event.  It's a sad day for the World. I find it difficult to imagine how people could be so cruel. How does one cause gain from killing innocent people - not just here in the USA but anywhere in the World? It is time for ALL countries to band together to rid the World of dangerous terrorists.  Cowards. Only cowards would target innocent people. I realize that many people and countries have problems with the US and the focus of our government, but to commit such an act is beyond the scope of any civilized country or person. Whoever has masterminded this act of terror will pay, if not in a court of law then by God himself. Thank you to all the people sending their sympathy for those killed or maimed in by these disgusting individuals.      I heard that a man in California, evidently overcome with grief, left his vehicle on the freeway, climbed onto the overpass and displayed an American flag. No signs, no words, just the flag. The terrorists will not win.  I have a friend who lives and works in Long Island. She has family who work in the Trade Center towers (no news yet on them), and her fianc? works in Jersey and had a eye witness view of the second plane attack on the towers. He was shocked. She is shocked. Everyone is shocked over there. They're just to numb to react...  The border has been closed, our downtown has been evacuated as a precaution, all flights have been cancelled. I just pray there are no more attacks to come.  I was watching the coverage of the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Centre this morning on MSNBC Television. Then, I watched with horror, as I'm sure millions of Americans did, as the second plane crashed into the second tower. It appears that the plane was going full throttle. What a horrific event in our world history. The information that I'm hearing on television states that as many as 10,000 people are usually at work in the World Trade Centre during that time of the day. Add to that number, the vast numbers of police and fire rescue personnel who were on the scene when the towers collapsed, I fear the death toll may be in the many 1000's. I am stunned.  I am in the middle of the US. Everyone is watching the television, courts and government buildings have all been closed. All airports have been closed and planes forced to land in the middle of nowhere. I just heard that all major league baseball, America's past-time, have also been cancelled. Everyone is very scared and can hardly believe this has happened.  I see the stock markets around the world are collapsing as well. This is not just a collateral attack but also an economic one. Oil and gold prices are increasing. So well done to Gordon Brown for selling all our gold to buy worthless euro currency... Blair hasn't got a clue what to do, is holding ""meetings"". Meanwhile aircraft are still flying over central London. The pair should resign immediately, due to their useless handling of this outrage.  When I came to work my colleagues told me what happened in the US, I couldn't believe. My first comment was - this must be some kind of hacker's joke playing Orson Welles by the internet... My deep condolences to the American people.  I'd just finished my day at boarding school, came into the house where we sleep, went into the TV room and just burst into tears and went straight back out - those poor people. Again everyone in the board house is generally shocked by this whole episode and as a group we are going to raise some money for the families of the people that have died. I just hope the people that did this get what they deserve and hope this doesn't happen again.  Oh, What a terrible shock. The world should stand together strongly to stop the enemies of peace and love of human nature. Allah bless the people of all times.  I pray for those lost and for their families. The whole thing is so unbelievable.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the US and in particular with those who have lost loved ones in this disaster. I just hope that those in power show the restraint of the wise.      It is absolutly asinine to suggest that ""It is undeniable that terrorist attacks perpetuated against the US are largely the product of the US' own making."". It seems to me that people have been fighting and dying over Israel for thousands of years. It may be ineffective, but US leaders have been trying to mediate in this conflict for many years. I find this callous and ignorant pontification an insult to our innocent dead.  I am deeply shocked to learn that two of the jets held passengers as well. It is awful just thinking of the terror they must have felt as they realised their fate. Deepest condolences to the families of those passengers.  We are shocked and terrified by this event. Those innocent people had died because of some fanatic and crazy individuals. We send our condolences to their families.  Since I fist heard the reports when the first plane crashed into the West Tower, I have been watching/ and listening in shock, horror and incredible sadness and pain for all the millions of people this will affect both directly and indirectly. My heart goes out to all the people and their families injured and lost in the multiple tragedies that have already occurred within a matter of a few short hours. Please know you are not alone in your pain and loss, and fear.  Our heartfelt condolences to the family members of those who have perished in this dastardly inhuman act. Those involved should be severely punished.  I watched the TV coverage and realised this is war. No matter which way it goes we lose. My condolences and sympathy go out to the American people. I will pray for you.  Whoever did this inhuman act should not be allow to go free. America should prove that the lives of her people can be protected. My deepest sympathy.  I feel numb. My best friend lives on Mile Square Rd - I need to know if he's ok.  In every lifetime there are 'where were you when...' moments. Unfortunately this is one of them. After today's horrors take a minute to remember how lucky you are to be here at all.  Words utterly fail me! This is the most horrible, heinous, evil crime! Those poor, poor innocent people who died and who were injured...and their relatives! My heart goes out to them. Shocking news!  Physically shocked. I feel like crying. My heart goes out to the people of America.      I feel that this act was an act of cowardice by those that have done it and also want to pay my condolences to all the Americans that were there. I felt very hurt when I saw the lady on CNN telling about her son who was on the plane. I am very sorry and hope that this doesn't happen again as whoever does these things is a coward.  All of North America is reeling. I am very anxious that we may see more violence. After all nobody has claimed responsibility yet...there may be more to this horrific plan. I truly hope that no ethnic group is demonised because of this.  Obviously, there was no political agenda behind this terror attack. The ""activists"" behind this act have one goal; to kill as many Americans as possible. There is a war going on against the West. I pray that Americans awaken to this fact. May the victims of this attack rest in peace, and may their deaths be avenged before long.  I do feel sorry for the innocent but remember that Nelson Mandela was jailed for terrorism. The only difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist is whose side you are on. How far would go if your homeland was occupied by force?  I pray for all the families involved. I pray also that people don't do stupid things and we find who is responsible. Now's not the time to panic and shoot willy-nilly. To the countries where this originated (if not in the US) please I beg of you to extricate those that helped.  It is incomprehensible to realise that a relatively small number of terrorists can pose such a threat to a whole nation. This is an event with far-reaching effects on the whole world for who knows how long? I am not being disrespectful but I hope that George Bush does not go mad and seek revenge. Emotions are running high and the time is not right.  My sympathy goes to all those who will have suffered loss as a result of this terrible act of terrorism. With the grace of God those responsible will be brought to account for their actions.  I pray to God for everyone...this is an act of evil which shocked me.  There is NO, repeat NO excuse for these unspeakable events. I don't care from whose perspective. I pray for the helpless victims.  I work at New York University and was in a meeting when the first plane hit. We have watched in horror and disbelief as the buildings have fallen killing our friends and neighbours. Religion has been the cause of more death and destruction than any plague on this planet. When will enough be enough?  I live in Los Angeles. Our entire city is being evacuated. Our freeways are being shut down so the military can land to defend our Federal buildings. Despite the fear, sadness and anger that we're experiencing, most of L.A. is calm. Unfortunately, in my building we have nowhere to go. We have all the Federal buildings surrounding us, but the streets are packed with people trying to get out. So, for now we're stuck.      It has brought fresh tears to my eyes reading everyone's comments. As I stepped out of the office block in the commercial La Defense area of Paris where I work, and I looked up at the other tall buildings, I was scared. There but for the grace of God....We are all so vulnerable. Life is a balance and we are all responsible for maintaining that delicate state. When someone decides to act against that balance it is frightening to see the mayhem caused. My thoughts go to those people who are waiting to hear about a loved one and to those who have endured loss and pain through this senseless act.  I was on a bus heading into the city from New Jersey when I heard the report on the radio. I was actually listening to shock jock Howard Stern and thought it was a joke. But looking out the window of the bus I saw debris falling from the Trade Center and knew the bitter truth. My mother works in World Trade Tower 2 and I spent the next hour and a half thinking she was dead. Thankfully she is okay.  People were jumping out of the windows of the WTC - then the buildings just collapsed into dust  I saw live pictures on BBC TV and it shocked me to think this could happen. It's an attack not just on the USA but all of us in the Free Western World. I hope the Americans get tough with whoever did this. My thoughts are with the USA people.  This is the most unfortunate and unwarranted incident I ever witnessed.  My condolences to the American people over this shocking attack.  One should find out the root cause of what makes mankind so violent to attack others even at the cost of their own life.  I want to express my condolence to all people in US. It's the most terrible thing I have ever heard. God will help us to live through all these stupid acts.  A planned attack of this size has shocked the world not just the USA... countless numbers of innocent lives have been lost... No excuses, freedom, religious, civil rights, NOTHING can justify this.  I am deeply shocked. I hope our government will do everything possible to help the US recover from the tragedy and find the murderers responsible.  Absolutely disgusted, sickened, shocked and frightened. Why people have to harm innocent people for their beliefs I will never understand. I hope the American government can find whoever is responsible for the planning of this attack, although no amount of punishment can ever match the damage they have caused to so many people. We can't even begin to understand what the e people affected by this can be feeling right now. I just hope that we can salvage some good from it and rid our planet of extremist terrorists. No cause is worth the death of innocent people.      Being in New York at this time I was amazed by the strength and resilience of the people who live here. Almost everyone knows someone in the city at the time, but no one broke down, everyone in fact rallied a strength and a feeling of a common bond I have never before seen in my country.  Can we, as humans, not invest our time, money and efforts in building brotherhood all over world rather than the multilateral race to gain supremacy over others purely for selfish motives?  Absolutely unbelievable. While my heart at the moment goes out to those directly affected by the tragedy, I also shudder to think of the long-term repercussions of this disgraceful act.  Physically shocked. I feel like crying, my heart goes out to the people of America.  My condolence for the Americans.  I was watching BBC to see any new news on the situation in Afghanistan, when this news broke. The attack is senseless for all it did was kill innocent people, but I believe we shouldn't rush to conclusions as to who did this attack - we should all pray for the innocents who died in this shameful and cowardly attack.  I was told of this news by my friend when we chatted at 8pm local time - I thought he was joking. It is impossible to think the USA could be attacked in this manner.  Many of the buildings here in Los Angeles have been evacuated. America is shocked and in lock-down at the moment. This is the Pearl Harbor of our generation.  I just heard the news and I'm shocked. This is no military attack against a nation, this is an attack against people. Innocent people. I feel very sad for all families involved. Heads up, everyone...  What possesses somebody to carry out this sort of devastation. It can never be justified!  Shocked... what's wrong with mankind!      I would just like to pass on my deepest sympathy to America and hope that through all this death and destruction, America will find the strength and courage to bring the sick people responsible for this terrible tragedy to justice. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones.  I've seen the pictures on BBC site and I say that it's a devil action, people who lives with the devil on mind, cause a normal person don't do things like this... my God, how things like this can happen... My condolences to the American people.  I was shocked when I heard this. Why they do this. My condolences for the American people.      I want to thank those from abroad that share their deepest sympathies of the tragedies that have happened in New York City. Your kindness is well exhibited as I read the letters you have written. As citizens, we will overcome. As friends and allies, we will prevail. Thank you again for your warm letters of comfort in our country's time of need.      This is the day after and I feel numb. I fear that yesterday was the end of American innocence. It will be remembered as a pivotal day in the history of democracy.      As each day will pass, the individual stories of those who died and the families and friends who survive them will be told. It will be painful and emotionally draining to hear. But certainly, those who are directly affected by this trajedy are suffering more than I am. How they will live with this memory is beyond comprehension. My heart aches for them.      I watched in horror as the events unfolded this morning. It is almost beyond belief that anyone could have carried out such an act of unparallel terrorism. The world needs to hunt these people down and bring them to justice. Those who carried out such attacks must be made to feel the pain of what they have wrought on so many innocent people, and they must know that no civilized people will ever stand for such an act of barbarism.I don't think anyone can ever feel completely safe again until these people are caught and brought to justice.      I sat at my desk and heard a fighter jet zoom past the high rise I work in and my entire being shook.      My colleagues, friends, and family have all been touched by this tragedy throughout our entire country. The comfort that I find is in the outpour of love and support from neighbors on US soil and from around the world, reaching out with kindness and kinship.      The aftermath of this tragedy is likely to change the world as we have known it, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is no untouchable place on this planet for evil. Yesterday helped remind us all of that.      I have spent the past days in horror at the events that occured on Tuesday morning. The sense that America was no longer ""isolated"" from the dangers of the world became all to real. However that thought made me feel very much alone. When I read the sentiments of our good friends the British people I was reminded of the common bonds we share, love of freedom and love of country. It's good to know we are not alone.      Many people have rightly condemned those who participate in, and sponsor terrorism. Let us not forget that in the past, the USA has sponsored terrorism in countries such as Cuba and Vietnam. Bin Laden may well be responsible, but he was trained in terrorist combat by the CIA! In the wake of this terrible tragedy, the USA needs to examine its own foreign policy and prevent its president from taking sides in the Middle East. Walking out of the Durban talks and rejecting the Kyoto agreement are two acts which have angered terrorist AND humanitarian agencies across the world. Now the USA knows that, unfortunately, it is not immune to extremists and should act accordingly.      This has impacted all of America. This horrible event is simply unbelievable. I recently moved from New York City to Boston, and many of my friends were involved in this act of terrorism. I am surprised and overwhelmed by the amount of concerned individuals around the world. It comforts me to know that the world cares so much. Thank you all for your blessings, prayers, and thoughts. Thank you.      I am scared by the rage welling inside of me due to this. Sometimes I feel like I cannot speak. If there be anyone who can see the pictures of humans choosing to jump from 100 storeys up so as to not burn alive, and not feel as if the most horrendous travesty has taken place, let that person be the first to be punished.      This is the one of the most deplorable acts committed by humans against humans in the modern history of the world. What can be the motive so strong as to drive a person to this extent? Whatever the motive, the price paid for it was is way too much for humanity to bear. I'd still like to believe what I saw on TV last night was a part of a Hollywood movie rather than reality. My condolence to the families of those victims of the barbaric act. But please act with patience, and not with the feeling of vengeance. What is lost can't be undone by drawing more blood.      I have been in shock since 10:11 yesterday morning when I found out. My students and I watched the events unfold, unbelieving, as we watched the replay of the WTC collapsing. Retribution must be swift, sure, and unforgiving, but we must temper our anger with wisdom. We must never stoop to hate crimes, such as these the terrorists have dealt out.      One simple thing crossing my mind that could have prevented the whole disaster: Why is it possible to access the flight deck on any aircraft for literally anyone? This is obviously a major weakness in aircraft design enabling hijackers to easily take over control of the aircraft - has it never been considered re-designing the access to the flight decks of the commercial airliners?      It hurts to be an American. To know that there are people out there, with so much hatred in their hearts for people they don't know just devastates me.      I was in complete shock yesterday at the terrible events that took place. As a Muslim and an American, I am very upset at the loss of innocent lives. My sincerest condolences to all affected families. May Allah, the Almighty Creator, help all of us deal and cope with this horrible tragedy. Killing of innocents is not a teaching of Islam, nor the display of such cruelty.      This is really an unacceptable act of crime against US and the peace loving people of the world. All the culprits must be brought to book but care and emotions must be exercised not to kill innocent souls.      When there is so little that one can do, to bring back the dead, to turn back the clock, to strike out in revenge, how important it is to hear the common expressions of sorrow and sympathy from around the world - from Arab countries as well as Europe, Africa and Asia. The expression of feelings that are all so similar should remind us that there is something that we can all do right now to fight back. That is for the millions of us each to look around in our lives and find the opportunities to do the right thing, to help others in need and to reach out and build relationships with those around us. These acts can cut off the oxygen on which such evil feeds and heal its wounds in ways that little else can.      As an expat living here for the past year it has felt like the past 24 hrs has been like living on a movie set. Nothing can prepare you for the feeling of seeing the WTC in smoke and thinking there has been an ""accident"" and the next finding out it was an act of terrorism. Our hearts go out to those fearless firemen, police and all involved in the rescue effort as they put their lives on the line. Also those families who have missing loved ones. Violence has never solved issues and unfortunately I'm not sure that retaliation will be the answer as the casualties tend to be innocent women and children. There has to be an answer that this is the last time we see such an atrocity.      This is an abomination that my generation hoped it would never see. Those who lived through WW2 wished that they would never see the like again. We are closer to WW3 now than even the Cuban missile crisis. There will be many calls of retribution and annihilation, but I pray that those in charge see sense and use stealth and intelligence rather than all out aggression. There may be problems on our planet, but it is the only planet and the only environment we have to live in, and I don't want to see it destroyed or plunged into a nuclear devastation.      The 'reaction' should be swift, decisive and without mercy. A complete and utter destruction and obliteration of the country or countries (when proved beyond reasonable doubt), where these terrorists were harboured, trained, and sponsored. The only language these people understand is terror and violence so lets speak their language.      The ruins of New York have an uncanny resemblance to the embattled streets of Beirut. Civilian Americans have never really seen Beirut, and they don't have to. They can look at New York now.      I have been speaking to many people today and there seems to be a worrying tide of racism growing as a result of these attacks. Yes, they were terrible, and yes those responsible should be dealt with in an appropriate and if possible, diplomatic manner. However, I hope, even if this is proved to be the work of Bin Laden and his associates, that this does not lead to the persecution of Muslim groups within and outside Western countries. More violence is not the way forward. We should not sink to the level of those involved in this horrific attack. If we want to show ourselves to indeed be civilised nations we should stop this ridiculous talk of 'nuking the east'.      I am completely in shock. I've been watching the news since 7 this morning. My mother and I were talking on the phone remembering our trip to NY last year. We were on the observation deck looking over the wide expanse of twinkling lights, slick buildings, the Hudson. It's gone. It's just gone. I'm in complete shock thinking of all the dead. We are dealing with terrorists who may or may not be foreign. But they are ""foreign"" to our way of life, our culture, because this is inexplicable. I cannot understand this. God bless the families and the victims.      We are all stunned by this act of terrorism, the atmosphere at work is subdued and one of disbelief. Our hearts go out to all those who have lost loved ones, and to the rescue workers and hospital staff trying to help under extreme circumstances.      I really appreciate the kind thoughts and words expressed here - it helps to know that not all the world views us as an evil force that must be destroyed at any cost. Our thoughts and sorrow also go out to those innocent victims who were guests in our country.      The most cruel and cowardly act. I am really sorry for the suffering of the innocent people, who woke up to make the daily bread for their families. I am really feeling sorrow deep in my heart, I am sending my condolence to the families of victims and all Americans.      It is surely terrible loss of humanity; worse second to war. I would like to see this act of terrorism being punished so as to wipe terrorism from world. Death of so many innocent people must not be lost just in tears.      While the events that took place in New York City and Washington D.C. were unacceptable and completely reprehensible, we should consider that perhaps this is a reaction to our rather selfish, isolationist attitude toward the rest of the world that has filtered into our foreign policy. It seems that, in the collective consciousness of America, we have allowed the proliferation of this idea that we are immune to problems that concern the rest of the world, and therefore can treat other peoples as we please without fear of retaliation. Maybe now it is time that we realize our place in the global community and act in cooperation with its peoples, rather than force our will upon them.      This is the most awful act against civilization since WW2. My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. These terrorists and murderers have attacked freedom, democracy and our way of life. The civilized world must overcome the countries and dictators who give these devils money, support and - most importantly - a safe haven to live. It's a sad time for humanity.      My only hope is that when these people who commit horrendous acts in the name of religion - whether it be Allah or Christ or whatever - arrive at the ""gates of infinity"", they find that their God banishes them to hell and all of a sudden, it becomes blindingly clear that all human life is sacrosanct no matter what. My thoughts are not only with the Americans, but with anyone who has been touched by terrorism in any form. President Bush, please think before you react.      In the name of God of the peace... I can't believe what happened in USA. I live in Iran and I'm 18 years old and I'm far away from USA and I'm so angry because I can't do anything for the people there. I'm alive with the USA dream - I didn't go to USA yet but I do my best to get there one day. I wanted to be an engineer for USA - now I want to be a security agent for USA. If the people in USA are in terrible disaster, I'm in terrible disaster. If USA was changed since yesterday, I was changed since yesterday. Please accept my deep sympathy and I'm sharing in your pain. With love of USA people and peace... and with HATE of terrorist....      I can't believe people are even asking if there should be retaliation. As a survivor of the Admiral Duncan bomb in London and someone who has spent a lot of time in New York, I can only ponder a guess at the true horror of what is unfolding around us. This attack was NOT a terrorist one it was an all-out act of WAR. The people in the Trade Centre were non-governmental civilians who were lucky enough to afford office space in such a premier site - they did not deserve to die.     Today we are in shock, but it won't be long before the clamour for revenge starts in earnest. Before we demand vengeance, we need to consider who or what it is we are fighting. The true enemy will most likely be a corrupt ideology rather than a particular group. The perpetrators of acts of terrorism are often indoctrinated with their ideals either by fanatical hatred or personal tragic experiences. None of this excuses their actions, but considering they like nothing better than to become martyrs to a cause, any violent retribution would play into their hands.      Retribution? Unlike Lockerbie, the protagonists are already martyrs. Punishing the identified faction would be very difficult without further innocent killing. I must admit I have found the internal US flight system very lax indeed. Last year, I had my boarding passes on an onward flight cancelled and the seats reassigned. Trouble was, my baggage was already on the plane from a connecting flight. Nice security hole there!      Liberal thinking and attitudes have created this and other similar problems and made the world a more dangerous place. If you give people with a grievance a sense that you will give into demands if they make your life uncomfortable then they will act accordingly, and this action will inevitably escalate.      Hatred and revenge cannot prevail - we MUST show we can rise above this death and destruction.      The First World War started with a single bullet and one death. It ended in the death of millions and the destruction of half a continent. Please don't let history repeat itself, let us not be at its mercy.      In the aftermath of the Bloody Tuesday terrorist attacks, people will inevitably ask how four commercial airliners could be hijacked, seemingly at will. My wife and I were two of the top managers for Northwest security at Metro Airport in Detroit during the early nineties, and the answer is very simple; real security would interfere with passenger convenience. Lord knows, we don't want to be inconvenienced.      The most effective form of security is a profile system, provided by ICTS and other security companies, in use throughout Europe, Israel and the Far East. But that would mean people couldn't board the plane if they weren't there an hour before boarding, and we certainly wouldn't want to inconvenience people who are too stupid and selfish to get to the airport early. The number of bags physically searched would increase by three to four times. Certainly a few terrorist attacks are nothing compared to the indignity of having our baggage searched.      Shock - horror and indescribable sorrow that man could behave like this and in the name of so-called religion. My heart goes out to all the people in the world that this tragedy has touched. America - we are all with you in your hour of need!      I am an emergency services worker and I watched the events in the USA unfold on television Sept 11th. This is a situation we all hope in our profession, that we would never have to deal with - the carnage; the senseless loss of lives of innocent people and the emergency services personnel doing their duty to rescue them. My heart and blessings go out to all those affected by this horrid tragedy. This is truly a day of infamy.      The eloquence of your Prime Minister moved me and many other Americans to tears. It is comforting to us to know that our British friends stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with us in this time of tragedy.      There is nothing but sorrow; nothing but sadness. I remember the opening day of TWC, I was in NYC, and remember the talks about the lasting age of the twins; and now in less than 30 years I saw them collapse and I consider it ""the last day of an era"". And the era ends when the image of NYC vanishes forever and the remaining is a cloudy picture on the mind of my generation. As usual the common people pay the highest price; the least is that never-seeing-sight of twins.      How can people dance and celebrate at the streets just after thousands of innocent people have been murdered. That's sick!      Whilst I am horrified at the destruction of human life and the misery it will cause those who have lost loved ones, I hope that the US will show restraint in its response to the terrorist attacks. The US government must really look at its foreign policy, because it has taken them down this road with these terrible and terrifying results. Nothing can excuse these killings, but surely now is the time for the US to look at its relationship with much of the world.      I have lived in the UK for 13 years. I came from New York. Words have till now, failed me, as have done for so many other ex-pats and those who have followed these nightmares as they have unfolded. I'm sure the full depth of the emotional shock has not yet been realised by most of us.      This is indeed a tragedy. However, we should focus not only on what we should do from here, but on the conditions that allowed such a thing to happen. The actions of these terrorists were not unprovoked, as much as US citizens would like to believe they are. These atrocities were commited by people with extreme conviction to their beliefs. The world has to come to an understanding of what pushed them to this point.      I had checked in with my family who live North of the city while the events unfolded all are well although I have yet to hear of a niece and nephew who were due to travel from the east to west coast this week.      I have always been a person of moderate, considered views this is tested now. I can speak with confidence, I am not frightened, I am not questioning my values, I am angry and all Americans are angry. This is not jingoistic, flag waiving patriotism, it is outrage and Human pain in the face of the suffering of so many...too many. I now fully realise how my parents felt at the news of Pearl Harbour. These incidents strengthen the resolve of a nation and I hope that the UK shows their support, however they can, for all who have suffered such an evil and grievous wound.      Our stunned disbelief stems from the fact that such an attack upon the US mainland has not occurred since our Civil War, and not since the Revolutionary War has such an attack on the mainland come via a foreign nation. For other nations, this is a way of life. For us, it is a new terror -- and perhaps a wake-up call. My own personal concern is the potential longevity of any full-fledged war that may erupt. Enemies like this don't simply give up after a few bombings. This won't be the equivalent of hurling missiles at tiny nations until their leaders do what we tell them. This kind of enemy doesn't go away until the very last individual has perished. And that's a frightening thought, to say the least.      Like the rest of the nation I am stunned. I went to bed last night feeling safe and although I live in Kansas (in the middle of the country) my sense of security has been shattered. Already I know someone who knows of someone who died in the tragic events of today. These attacks will touch the lives of everyone, I know that I will never be the same.      It is absolutely sad and unbelievable to see what has happened in America. I strongly support what President Bush said during his address to the Americans that 'there will be no distinction between terrorists and those harbouring them' in the course of fighting against terrorism. May God bless all Americans with peace in this sad period.      Nobody here really understands what has happened. Everyone is in disbelief. I feel so sad, angry, and helpless. I want to scream, I want to cry, I want to strike at someone, I want to see someone responsible feel the pain that we feel, that I feel. I want those families that have lost love ones to not hurt. We have lost our innocence, the world has just lost innocence.      I personally was not in New York, I saw it on television like most of the people, but I did know some people who were heading to the World Trade Center today, who I have not yet heard from. The sight of the WTC building burning was horrible enough, but then to see a plane fly right into the second building was absolutely sickening. It was definitely the worst sight I have ever seen in my life.      There was an estimate of around 20,000 people in both of those building at that time. Also, an estimated 90,000 people pass through those buildings daily. The burning NYC skyline seemed like a scene out of a Godzilla movie, only it wasn't. Although I was in Philadelphia today, the effects were still greatly felt here and everywhere. City Hall was cornered off by cops with heavy automatic guns. The Philadelphia International Airport was completely shut down. There was major traffic all around the city and suburbs as schools got out early and businesses were evacuated.      Many are calling this worse than Pearl Harbor, and I agree. This is truly a ""day which will live in infamy."" The one thing this country really needs is the support and prayers of everyone around the world.      Got back from New York last week. Had my 41st birthday celebration in the Wild Blue restaurant on the 107th floor in the North Tower. Can only say I watched in disbelief at the pictures on TV. Hard to believe what I was witnessing. Shocked and depressed by the people that can carry out such attacks. To me religious bigotry is the most dangerous force in the world today. I suspect this is what is behind these events. Removal of poverty from the world and education is the only answer.      I am not an American but have lived here for two years. The behaviour of the American people in the past day has shown that this is a nation that will survive. The USA has shown its very best side under extraordinary circumstances. No terrorist organisation is going to subdue the spirit of this country. It is now time for the free world to take action to do as much as it can to prevent terrorism.      My brother Charles works, worked, on the 92nd floor of the South Tower. We presume he has died and still cannot contact any of our friends in New York to confirm. My one observation at this time is to express my complete incredulity at the lameness, the uninspiring and frankly pathetic response of the President of the United States during the day that has just passed. It seems he went from Miami, where he condemned the ""folks"" who carried out these attacks, to Louisiana, to Nebraska and is now, finally, apparently, returning to Washington. We will continue to seek word of our brother but must now presume the worst. That's all.      One of our co-workers was on the American Airlines flight from Boston this morning. Our thoughts are with his family, and those of all the others affected by this tragedy.      I am in shock by the devastation that has occurred in the US. I have friends working in NY and fear that they may not still be with us. It is all so surreal but yet it is well and truly for real. It's no dream, no nightmare even. My heart and thoughts are with all those whose lives have been lost and the families and friends. May the US Government deal with this in the correct way - what that is I do not know. Peace be with you all.      September 11th will mark history with one of the highest step in horror. The world will never be the same. Our hearts go out to all of you. Our hope is for a better tomorrow.      Why are we assuming so readily that Arab fundamentalists were behind it? Remember the Oklahoma City bombing. I am finding it very difficult to believe, that despite their so called open policy, the Americans failed to detect at least bunches of four Arabs times five, boarding a plane at the same time - correct me if I am wrong but I learnt it from Hollywood films that it takes at lest a foursome to take over the plane. Why nobody is talking about the Oklahoma bombing scenario? And the fact that it might have been done by the dissatisfied Americans? Or is it a scenario of an American or Americans doing this to their fellow Americans so inconceivable, even to contemplate as a possibility?      Well As a Muslim I am very very upset and shocked. If there is any involvements of Muslims it is a shame. But at this moment I am really shocked and amazed and as hurt as my American friends are. Patience is the best way for now..      I feel like our world has been raped. I can't get these poor people out of my head. This is a day I'll never forget. My thoughts are with every person affected by the tragic events of today.      May the Lord bless and comfort those in this time of pain and terror. Our most sympathetic condolences.      This is horrible day, my heart is with the American people.      This is worse than the attack on Pearl Harbour. Pearl Harbour was a military target, the World Trade Center was not. The words of your Prime Minister that Britain stands shoulder to shoulder with America are appreciated.      I hung up the phone five minutes ago. Two close friends - gone. This issue is no longer academic or abstract with me. God help me, but for the first time in my life I truly know what it is to desire revenge.      I'm just so far away from NY but it's just like happening next to me. It was around 10 NY time when I heard about the attack. I was working out at a gym. The woman exercising next to me was talking on phone, telling her friend that she has some colleagues working in the 1 WTC. It was about an hour later that we got the news about the collapsing. I can hear her crying.      I can't understand in the year 2002 how terrorists are able to board four or five planes with guns? Is security asleep on the job?      Seeing people jumping out of a 110 floor high building after a plane crashed into it makes one want to cry. Let's hope all people can come together to stop madness like this. Black, yellow, Jewish, gay, rich, white, poor, straight, man, Muslim, child... all of us      My thoughts are with all the American families suffering the horror and those of all the others affected by this tragedy. I can't but condemn this barbarian act. I have confidence in the resilient spirit of American people and their ability to bounce back from this outrage. God help all sufferers to overcome this tragedy.      It's terrible. I watched live WTC southern tower's hit and all that happened after that. Then I watched Palestinian's joy and elation in Jerusalem. I think the most terrible fact is that there are ""humans"" that can be happy of someone's pain. GOD bless America. And GOD bless this world.      I really feel sorry for Americans but that was a reaction against US foreign policy. That was like Newton's third law, opposite and equal reaction, may be more than equal. So, should we expect another Hiroshima?      Its simply unbelievable. No matter how hard I try, I still can't accept the fact that something so gruesome happened. I pray for the families of the deceased.      It's a great disaster ,all the world had shocked. We are all praying for the innocent victims and their families, the killer must be punished whoever they are, but also I think America must work hard in order to lessen the number of its enemies in the world.      I herd about this tragic event when I got to work this morning. My friends and I are all so shocked that for a while we could not say anything to each other. Our sincere and heart felt sympathy to the victims' families and we wish to wish all those brave rescue workers all the best. This is like it has happened here in Fiji. We are all so sad and worried. Those cowards need to be brought to task and should never be forgiven. We remember all Americans in ours prayers.      My uncle Charles works in the World Trade Center and is feared dead. We have made several attempts to contact him through his cell phone and home phone but have heard nothing. His wife has heard nothing. This is something America must never forget.      I think this is a real tragedy for the American people and I have family that live in New York and I don't know if they are ok. It's very upsetting.      I was in school when they announced over the loud speaker what happened. Everyone in the whole school was shocked, and stopped dead in their tracks. The one plane crashed in Somerset, PA, only 80 miles from where I was. That's scary. Knowing that there are still six or seven planes unaccounted for is even scarier. The school kept us until our parents could pick us up. I've been watching the news since I got home.      I'm from the UK working in midtown Manhattan. My company had a Customer support centre in one of the WTC buildings. We don't know what's happened to everybody. We know they were evacuating, and we've spoken to one of the staff, but he got separated from everybody else. There still aren't any realistic casualty figures.      Being only 13, this whole thing deeply frightens me. My Parents have a friend who lives in Manhattan, and Cannot Reach Him. I hope to God he's alright and my deepest thoughts go out to those injured. I hope the people who committed this horrible act of Murder realise that they will not get away with this.      This is the most serious event of my lifetime. My husband is on his way home from his job at a Military Base and reiterates how serious this is. My daughter and I are crying and praying together because this is so tragic and unbelievable! The pictures are horrifying.      I am waiting, terrified for my husband and mother to return home from their trip to the UK. They're now grounded in Gander, New Foundland. I haven't heard from them but the airline assures me they're are safe. Now they're saying this may not be the end of it. Please stop whoever you are if you have any humanity in you, just stop.      Most of my co-workers have gone home for the day (it is 4pm). I am sitting in the office hoping/praying/waiting for some news from my boss's husband who worked at the WTC. Like all of you, I can't begin to fathom the minds of the masterminds behind the attack. I hope that there will be a rational response to these irrational acts.      Here at our college on the West Coast, the campus is in mourning. We were going to translate Aeschylus this morning, but this tragedy is much harder, much worse. I hope that we -- I mean all human beings in the world -- can all use this as an opportunity to observe ourselves, to stay relaxed, and not to react violently and cause the world to erupt into war. This is the time to turn the other cheek. We are living in history; let us learn a lesson and move on, but be bullied into war, because that's obviously what the terrorists want.      I am out of words. I am a Muslim Arab, and if speculation proves right, I fully resent all such actions carried under the name of ""Allah"". No religion in the world calls for the assassination of innocent civilians. I sincerely hope that the US will carry out sever action against the culprits. Our world is not zoo, and humans are not animals to manslaughter. How can we live, if even the simplest daily habits, such as going to work, actually put our lives on stakes?      The world is reacting in shock and in horror to the devastating events of this morning. We probably all have had a moment of ""this could never happen here"" today but it has. My office in Ottawa is within 2 blocks of our Parliament Buildings and the U.S. Embassy - everything shut down in the downtown core by early afternoon. There was a bomb scare at Parliament and they were searching the government building across the street from us with a canine unit. We have colleagues in New York, Boston and our prayers go out to the victims, their families and all those working so hard to find any survivors.      All that has happened is very tragic and it makes one's heart ache. Thinking of all the loss of life and property. My condolences for the people of America ,those who have lost their precious ones. This terrorist attack is a thing the people of America will never forget. "
HOC HOC-FK 3.17 " What those people did was wrong... both sides. As a parent your number one job is to protect your children from harm. IF the hatred is religion inspired as I have heard... what Bible are their preachers reading from?      I am outraged at that these children are being exposed to such abuse from Loyalists. But I am also angry at the parents for forcing their kids up that road when they know what's waiting for them. Little girls should not be used in this way.      The conflict in Northern Ireland will never end as long as new generations are subjected to such hatred and violence. Some of these children's earliest memories will be marred by these atrocities. It is tragic to see innocents subjected to such barbarism. Children of 5 do not have religious or political opinions.      I'm astonished at those in this discussion who seem to think that ""a plague on both your houses"" is the correct response. Are you totally blind? Do you seriously think that parents trying to walk their children to school in their own country, in their own city, are doing something wrong?      I came from Taiwan. In our history course I knew that modern democracy was founded in UK and this country also appreciates the idea of human rights. Although I also knew there are some troubles in Northern Ireland, I have never expected the situation is as bad as this. I feel very very sick to witness little schoolgirls to be harassed, abused and even attacked by adults for whatsoever the reason. These scenes make me very disappointed and disillusioned about UK. Those politicians involved should soon find a way out of this nonsense hatred.      What a brave load of loyalists, picking on innocent schoolgirls, they must be very proud.      I choked when I saw frightened and crying little girls running the gauntlet of hate from 'Christian' adults who were hurling abuse and missiles at them. It is a basic human right to be educated and for people to accuse the girls' parents for endangering their lives is to condone the perpetrators of hate and violence and is similar to the argument that a raped woman deserves it because she did not struggle enough or that she put herself in a position to entice the rapist deliberately! The British, once proud purveyors of justice, have lost it, if what we are witnessing in Northern Ireland is symptomatic of the rest of Britain!      Why don't the parents move their kids to a different school or better still move away from Northern Ireland, this is the only way you can fully protect your kids.      We have seen such violence on television but it has never involved children. It's such a shame that people do not even spare children and they have to be escorted by police. If I were one of those children, I'll be terrified. What a way to start an education.      After living in Glenbryn for a number of years I can understand the frustration of the residents, but they have to realise that while they are being attacked by republicans, loyalists from their own area are attacking catholic homes. They also have to realise that these children have absolutely nothing to do with the attacks on them, and should be allowed to go to their school as normal.      There is a terrible amount of hate in both communities in the Ardoyne, but we are not born with feelings of hate to one another, this is something that people learn, from their parents and the people around them, so if to hate is something we learn then it can be undone also. One way for people in these areas to start would be an integrated school where children from both communities can learn together and build a trust among themselves. I know this might never happen but these communities cannot go on living like this and they will have to start somewhere.      Kids being used as pawns? Hardly? I resent those that say that the girls should go into the school via the entrance behind the school. Reminds me of blacks in the USA being asked to sit in the back of the bus. These children have a right to enter their school anyway they wish. It shows the mindlessness of the Loyalist position. And this case isn't really isolated. Kids wearing Catholic jumpers in South Belfast have been targeted for attack by gangs of adults on a regular basis for sometime now.      My 6-year-old daughters attend Holy Cross. As they walked up the first day I did not expect things to be that bad. I would never subject my kids to that again so my wife is now using the back gate. Just as well since these so-called peaceful protestors have now started throwing blast bombs at young girls and their mothers. I am utterly disgusted. They have got to ask themselves one question, ""what if that bomb hit a young girl and killed her?"". How can the people who threw that live with themselves?      Spare a thought for the Protestant OAPs of Glenbryn who for months now have been unable to collect their pensions from their local Post Office due to attacks and threats from Republicans. Not a mention of the 14 year old girl who had her arm broken by a gang of Republican men from the Ardoyne because she dared to be out of her home to visit a friend at 6 o'clock in the evening. I could carry on all evening, the list is endless.      I am sickened, physically sickened, to see adults screaming abuse and throwing missiles (and now bombs) at innocent children. It does not matter to me if they are Catholic, Protestant, Muslim, black, white, Jewish or whatever. THESE ARE CHILDREN going to school... You are teaching another generation all about hatred.     The parents have a fundamental human right for their children to attend school unhindered. This whole protest is pathetic and demonstrates to the world that the bigotry of these protestors knows no bounds - they clearly have not been instilled with any morals whatsoever.      How come the sick people shouting abuse at the children are not arrested for public disorder, racial abuse, breach of the peace, child abuse and probably other public order offences? How long would it be before I was arrested if I tried the same tactics at a local primary school? Is Northern Ireland subject to different laws than the rest of the UK?      As a nationalist having grown up in Ardoyne, and now a parent myself, it is heartbreaking to watch such scenes. I was taught to respect my Protestant neighbours and always did throughout my childhood and teens in Ardoyne. However, watching the scenes of the last few days, I now view those so-called neighbours as scum and filth. I only hope my bitterness subsides and does not transfer to my children.      Oh dear! Will this war between Catholics and Protestants ever end? These children are the future. Education is the key.      How can we hurt the children? They are innocent. Furthermore, such actions have passed the thoughts of bilateral enmity to the next generation and it is totally harmful to the peace process of Northern Ireland.      Watching the pictures last night on BBC news of children being spat at and imtidated reminded me of footage from Southern States America 1960's when students were stopped from attending schools and colleges by the Klu Klux Klan because they were black. Then it was colour now it's religion. Why are we allowing this kind of disgusting intimidation to still happen in 2001? We can proudly send troops to Macedonia to sort out ethnic conflicts yet we cannot seem to sort out those in our own 'backyard'.      The peace process isn't working, what else can you expect but that the bigoted factions (of both sides) will resort to unpeaceful means. For people who call themselves Christians to involve children in their disputes signals to the rest of the world that they have reached the lowest possible point. The ""Troubles"" have been going on for so many generations now that it seems there is no other way. How many more people have to die before the communities build bridges instead of barricades.      What a sad, sad week for N. Ireland. What's next, babies in maternity wards! I am ashamed to say I'm from N.I.      Is there anyone in Ulster who can let the rest of the world know that these events are not typical of the province, that progress is being made towards reconciliation and that the men of violence face becoming outcasts from their own side.      As a Northern Ireland Protestant I want to make it clear that I totally and unequivocally condemn what is being done to the children of Holy Cross. They are damaging the name of Protestantism, the vast majority of whom I know for a fact have been horrified by what they have seen on TV in the past 3 days. There are a lot of Protestants working behind the scenes at reconciliation projects with their Catholic neighbours, and having successes too. There is hope for Northern Ireland if even one person survives who wants peace.      Utterly despicable and pathetic - both sides of the fence. Of these people on show here, they seem to have absolutely no desire to sort out their differences and to have also lost all perspective. Some are quite comfortable with the idea of parading their children in front of those who mean harm to make a point. Others shout at the children walking past and should consider how things would be if the boot were on the other foot. Are these people ever going to take any responsibility for their actions?      This is an event that can easily be associated with the struggle of black America in the 1960s and will live in Loyalist infamy for many years to come. The world is watching and Loyalism has done itself no favours. As a cause, Loyalism is out of control and lacks real political leadership.      I was taught to ""love my neighbour as I love myself"" by my parents, not by the Catholic school I attended, they provided the important reinforcement of that principle. If children see their parents acting in such a way (on both sides) what future is there for the community? Whatever the protesters may say about their motivation and justification for their actions, this is a primary school, and these are children. What they are doing will have an indelible effect on them. If they do not stop, then the whole community will be the losers.      All sides, both political and religious, should be ashamed of these recent events. Children are the only hope for a united Ireland. All this action does is serve to prime yet another generation of bigotry and hate.      Those that say it is the parents' fault for using that route to school instead of an alternative, ""safe"" route are completely missing the point. The kind of abuse and violence is not acceptable whether it be in Belfast or anywhere else and whether it be towards children or anyone else. To say the parents should take a different route is condoning the violence and giving in to the ""protesters"".      I am amazed the police haven't arrested them yet. After all, if it were football hooligans shouting abuse and throwing things at fans from another team, they would have been arrested, charged and banned from matches by now. Why are these children not protected in the same way?      Allowing children to spend their school years in a religion-based institution, separated from one half of their community is certainly not the best way of encouraging future integration. Why not replace all the Catholic and Protestant schools with a non-sectarian education system that doesn't highlight differences and fuel divisions from the age of 4?      I think it is an absolute disgrace, that these 4 year-old children cannot walk to their first day of school in peace. That day is supposed to be a special day that should be remembered and cherished for the rest of their lives. The Loyalist community should be ashamed of themselves. There is absolutely no excuse for terrorising innocent children. SHAME      I agree with the comments of those above who point out that given any choice at all the British would prefer these Loyalists to take their loyalties somewhere else. We would rather not be associated with them.      Why can't we throw some of the race legislation at them? If these people, or any of the other thugs parading as patriots across Northern Ireland, had elected to take their campaign up against people with skin of a different colour, then they would have had the book thrown at them, and quite rightly too. What is going on across this province is no different from the stupid racism seen in Oldham etc. recently, and should be treated as such. Neither side deserves any sympathy, neither side has any dignity or honour. Grow up, the lot of you. You are embarrassing the civilised majority of your neighbours, in Ulster, the rest of the UK, and in Eire!      Why are the ""Loyalists"" abusing Catholic children and their parents in this way? Because they are frightened - afraid that come the next Census, figures will show them to be in the minority in Northern Ireland.      The problem here is that both sides are using the children as political pawns. The protestants are obviously abusing them for daring to walk that way to school. However, the catholic parents have an alternative route that would avoid this, but are refusing to use it, declaring their right to use the road in question. Therefore, they are just as guilty of making political points using their children as tools rather than forgetting the political point and protecting their children, which I would have thought is every parents first priority. Therefore, both sides are equally to blame.      Protestants? Catholics? Aren't both groups supposed to be Christians as well?      I live in the SouthEast of England. My daughter is 4 and started school today. She saw this incident on the news yesterday and asked her Mother 'Will that happen to me tomorrow?'! My wife had to tell her that this was happening in another country. What sort of message does this send to the children of the UK, and doesn't this show that the people of NI have long forgotten why they're doing all this and cannot move beyond the habits of hatred and violence?      The scenes were shocking. The violent people on both sides are beneath contempt. Hurling obscenities and bricks at four year olds seems a new low. And the message from the media that parents should creep in the back gate is unhelpful. Presumably they would have been in there advising blacks in the deep south to stay at the back of the bus to avoid trouble. That said, these adults should keep children out of their tribal conflicts. It's a pity that all the good people from both communities have to live with these thugs and this climate.      These have been shocking scenes. But the Protestants have levelled some pretty bad accusations at republicans - to what extent are extremists on both sides fuelling the fire?      I am a father of two young children and no harm to anyone but I would think more of my children than to drag them through a protest no matter what it was about to spare them the stress that it would cause. I watched a news report this morning where it showed some children so scared they wanted to go back the way they had came and their parents or whoever it was taking them to school wouldn?t let them and physically dragged then on. This shows to me that these people dot care about the children involved even if they are their own and they are just trying to prove a point and provoke the situation even more.      The sanctimonious attitude of parents in England, Scotland and Wales who criticise the people of North Belfast for the way they treat children is pathetic and unhelpful. The situation in Northern Ireland is extraordinary and until someone has lived in that environment and felt the fear and the hatred that the people of Northern Ireland experience they are in no position to judge the participants in the conflict. The people of Northern Ireland need to be heard, not judged.     Why are the 'Unionist' Politicians / Orange Order so quiet on this issue. Do they condemn or condone the actions of protestants yesterday?      This incident just serves to reinforce something which I have believed for some time, namely that a system of segregated schooling will inevitably encourage division between the two communities and suspicion and mistrust of the ""other side"". I genuinely believe that this issue is one of the root causes of the continuing difficulties in Northern Ireland. All children should be educated together in non-denominational state schools.      I've become extremely cynical about the peace process in the last few months. It now seems evident to me that there is a substantial element on both sides that does not want peace, and is more interested in fostering sectarianism. How are the governments and the populace in the mainland meant to take claims of peace seriously with incidents like this? And surely issues of sectarianism like this on the ground involving normal people are more important than arms in the hands of a few criminals masquerading as patriots?      It was never as bad as this when I went to school during the worst days of the Troubles. Why has it got so bad now?      This event is a new low for one of the world's most pointless conflicts. When will people stop saying, ""What's wrong with THEM?"" and have the courage to say ""What's wrong with ALL OF US?""      From day one these innocent children are being subject to scenes of violence that no child of that age should witness. What is the mentality of 'adults' that allow this to happen? What are the chances of resolving these disputes if the next generation see this happening every day?      I have no questions because there can be absolutely no excuse for shouting abuse at children or disrupting their education. Decent adults should take their problems away from the school.      I don't live in NI, so the only impressions I have come from the media, and unfortunately there is nothing I can do about that. Having said that, I simply have to ask whether the people of Belfast want peace at all? The truth must be one of two things: either the local politicians are whipping this up, and creating conflict where there is none, or the people of Belfast really do hate each other.      It is outrageous that small children are being used in this conflict. The sight of angry men shouting and insulting children is an evil and immoral sight. Anyone who does this surely abdicates their moral right to engage in lawful protest or discussion, and the police should act with whatever means necessary to protect those who attend this school. Whatever the rights and wrongs, and whatever else may have gone on, to protest at school children and their parents who are peacefully and lawfully using this route has no justification whatsoever.     Why should children as young as 4 years of age be subjected to taunts and words of hatred as they travel to school? Surely all that is achieved is the continuance of the sectarian hatred into yet another generation.      I was shocked to hear of school children and their parents on the way to school being harassed to the extent that stones were thrown. I cannot fathom what is in the minds of people who think such action is justified. Sickening is the only way to describe it. How dare such people claim to have Christian values.      What on earth are you playing at ? The behaviour of both 'communities' sickens me, one lot who consider it OK to subject children to abuse and missiles for daring to walk down 'their road' and the other side has mothers prepared to subject to their own children to the abuse to prove a petty point. Why does it matter ? What's wrong with you people ?      One problem with this present issue and the condemnations is that we forget that children have been victims in the troubles ever since the start. Children have been injured and murdered by all concerned, terrorists on all sides, RUC, British Army, SAS... Children have suffered terribly and been traumatised over the last 30 years from being exposed to the continual violence on their streets. This is them reality of life in Northern Ireland and the peace process is the only hope.      We have had these type of scenes before - although perhaps not at a school. Is sectarianism increasing or falling in NI?      My remaining sympathies for the loyalists in Northern Ireland evaporated last night watching foul-mouthed bigots screaming abuse at young children. There can be no excuse for it and any leader trying to make them should be seen for what he is. It is time for us to cut these unpleasant people out of our country, they do not deserve to be part of it      To make small children the pawns in this ridiculous dispute shows that the parties involved clearly have no respect for their children, and therefore should not be surprised when such a climate of violence breeds yet another generation of violence, the perpetrators of which are either unaware or uninterested in what the real issue is, but have been brought up to hate their neighbours. here. It's just a shame that the people involved are either too stupid or too ignorant to realise this.      A recent survey indicated that the Mainland UK population is now more or less indifferent to the sovereignty of Ulster. However, when we see dreadful television pictures of Loyalist mobs hurling abuse and missiles at small children, there is a good chance that such indifference will change and there will be increased sympathy with the Catholic community. The Loyalist community should be very careful to retain the meagre outside support that it has, because once they lose the support of the mainland population, they will also lose the support of mainland politicians.      I find it repulsive that the Loyalist/Unionist community has attempted to create a role reversal situation to that similar of the Garvaghy Road ever July. These children and the protestant children in the community are the future of Northern Ireland. How can you compare 4 year children to the bigotry of the Orange Order? It seems the protestors are simply jealous that these children are better educated than themselves. Surely it is time for these idiots on both sides to grow up.      How low has someone to go, just to get their way. Oh play the kid walking past house on the way to school card. Why don't the parents of the kids, seek damages for taking the away the right to education for their kids. Where they their last month? No, How sad when you have to stop a CHILD on the way to school. Oh and bye the way, have these people not got JOBS to go t F    The sad situation in Ulster has been the constant use of children and young people to front demonstration and disturbances, while the perpetrators hide round corners and direct the operations      As a Protestant, sickened by the utterly detestable behaviour of the so called ""loyalists"" of north Belfast, I want our Catholic compatriots to know that, regardless of whatever undercurrents may have triggered this madness, no one of real faith shares a shred of common purpose with these blind, bigoted morons. Many Protestants like myself would gladly join the Catholic parents escorting their children to Holy Cross Primary School and demonstrate by our solidarity that we abhor and condemn these mindless attacks on innocent children. If our faith squeezes out the command to love our neighbour, then it is no faith at all.      I would like to make it clear to anyone reading this, outside N.I, that I am joined by the majority of protestants in saying that I am thoroughly ashamed and embarrassed to even be from a country that can let this kind of thing happen to our children. These people are letting down our whole nation. "
HOC HOC-IK 3.39 " I think they are right to be released - I feel that on balance the decision is a brave one and I agree it is better to give them a chance. I am shocked at the calls for vengeance - this is fuelled by the media - they should take a long hard look at themselves - the papers in this country have a lot to answer for - ask yourself who is more of a danger to the public in this instance - the two boys or the tabloid press.      I believe that Thompson and Venables would not be released if they were a danger to the general public. The question now is whether the general public will be a danger to them. They did commit a horrific crime. They will never lead a ""normal"" life due to their own conscience. They were ten years old. The violent murder of Jamie Bulger is terrible. The violent outcry of the public towards Thompson and Venables is terrible. I cannot see how this issue will be resolved. One boy is already dead and three families destroyed. Where will this end?      I am so glad that I no longer live in a vigilante society like England! I accept that many UK residents do not wish to punish these boys anymore. Please think about what these two youths have been through in the last nine years. They have both shown remorse and regret for their actions. I truly hope that they have some sort of ""normal"" chance of life. I would also like to remind UK residents that many convicted murderers in the UK often serve less than these boys have served. Yet those murders were often committed as a premeditated act! Please Brits get on with making your own lives better and stop this hateful bitterness.      The murder of James Bulger was utterly dreadful and tragic. It is the worst thing that can happen to any parent. However, many people seem to forget that those two boys were only ten years old at the time. There is a large degree of diminished responsibility involved in this case. If Thompson and Venables had been two or three years older when they committed the crime, it would have seemed fair to punish them more severely. But taking all the facts into consideration, it would be immoral to keep them locked up any longer. Why should they be punished as adults for something they did as young children? However difficult, the parole board made the correct decision.      Firstly, given the immense public opposition to their release it would have behoved those in charge to have respected that opinion. However, it doesn't matter when or where these young men are released, they still will not be fully cognisant of what they did. That reality will come home to them after the birth of their first child. Then they will understand the enormity of their actions. The pity of it is, not only did they destroy the lives of the Bulgers but also the lives of their own families and any future family they may sire. I feel enormously sorry for the Bulgers who are torn between seeking justice for their son, or putting this behind them and concentrating on the children they have now. It is an unresolvable issue.      The lunatic blood-lust now spewing forth is as horrifying as the original crime. An outraged call for vengeance by the mother of little James Bulger is at least understandable, even though it really has nothing to do with justice. But nothing can condone the second wave of evil now flooding the UK from the tabloid media and the ""eye for an eye"" mob. Once again, the worst instincts blur the distinction between the killers and the rest of us. Let's hope people come to their senses soon.      They were ten years old. They really cannot be held accountable for their actions. They were too young. They were truanting from school. Whose fault is that? They should be released on parole since one life destroyed is better than three lives. No one has a right to take someone's life away like that. James is gone. However, these two have learnt their lesson and should no longer be punished.      Ten year olds know the difference between right and wrong. I think they should remain in jail for the rest of their lives. If they are to be released into the world, they will be living in fear. They did a terrible crime and they should pay the price for it.      Ever since this tragic crime, the two boys have been treated as cold, hard adult killers by the justice system and society. I was 11 when it happened and I know that I did not have a fully developed conscience at that time.      These boys should not be made to suffer for their entire lives for what they did as children. However the constant fear of reprisal will no doubt be a punishment in itself. We should learn from a very similar example in Norway in which two young boys who killed a young girl were accepted back into the community in a matter of weeks. Oh and Norway still has one of the lowest levels of crime in Europe.      These boys should never be released. Why don't the courts listen to what people want and most of the relatives of James Bulger. His parents are living a nightmare every day.      I really believe that they should at least serve some time in a Young Offender's Institution because the secure units I saw on television were, apart from being locked up during the night, basically juvenile hotels. It is unfair that they have not really been properly punished for what they did. Ten-year-olds should know the difference between right and wrong.      Let us try to remember that these children were precisely that, children, when they committed their crime. At 10 years of age, many children have only just given up believing in Santa Claus; we can say with certainty that there understanding of the consequences of their act was limited. These were not adults, so expecting them to bear the full weight of an adult sentence is ludicrous. In many jurisdictions it would not even have been possible to charge them - and that is as it should be. I am horrified that some people remain so rabidly inclined to sacrifice these two children on the altar of their own misguided sense of justice.      Has anyone considered that living a lie will have disastrous psychological effects for Venables and Thompson? Knowing that you must keep your identity and past secret or a vigilante group'll set you upon could create acute paranoia and unforeseen mental problems. It's this kind of pressure which could push two already unstable individuals over the edge once again. They cannot be released until they will be safe from public vengeance. And that means never.      As a probation officer I am of the opinion that the people on the parole board responsible are trained to assess risk of re-offending. These two boys will be under the scrutiny of professionals for the rest of their lives. If they had been placed in an adult prison for a further period we would still have the same uproar about their eventual release as we do now.      The media is very dangerous and has been instrumental in demonising these two for their crimes to the point that public opinion would never be satisfied with any punishment. I believe that vigilante actions are mindless and at the end of the day I do not believe it will serve to make the mother of James feel any better for her terrible loss. Public opinion should not create policy and in particular the law, let's trust in the professionals who know how to do their jobs!!      I must say that I am absolutely appalled at the vengeful attitude shown by members of the British public. The crime was a horrific one, but they were ten years old. No penalty is truly sufficient for murder so let us try to do something positive; let the young men be and allow them to try to make something of their lives. The self-righteousness and hatred being expressed is disgraceful. And stop calling them killers; would we all like to be defined completely by single acts that we have done?      I don't think it's right that the boys killed James Bulger. However would taking their lives make a wrong right? Shall we all turn into murderers? We still have a lot to learn from the Norwegian experience of how that country was able to handle such a difficult situation.      Life in childrens services, even in a secure unit, is not a worthy punishment in society's eyes for the crime committed by these boys. They should serve some time in a prison or penal institution, so the realisation of their actions is evident and marks their lives forever.      Can't you realise that eventually these boys will be released, If not now then in 5 years where, after any progress they have made in the way of rehabilitation would be ruined and the corruptive atmosphere of your Youth Prisons would only increase their likelihood of reoffending.      If the parole board wants them released, let members of the board take custody of them personally.      Horrified by the death penalty and life sentences without parole, it is gratifying to see justice prevail, in spite of the blood-lust of the populace. Ten years from now, they would be 30 and probably unable to adapt to life out of prison. Ten years,and what 10 years in the life of a human being, is a long time, is enough. I can't believe the sanity and the sense of justice that I am witnessing from afar, when I constantly know of terrible deeds perpretrated in the name of justice and in the name of the people.      I'm interested to see so many child psychologists posting to this forum. Well I assume they are as how else would they know that ""They've killed once, they will do so again"". The bloodlust and mob mentality that some people are showing sickens me. I feel great sympathy for Jamie Bulger's parents and maybe I'd feel different if it was one of my children. But the parole board has passed them fit to be released, they are the experts and in any case incarceration should be about rehabilitation not punishment. It is said you judge a society by the state of its criminals. What does that say about western ""civilisation""? They were 10 when they committed a terrible crime. Rather than punish them forever, maybe we should examine a society where two boys commit this crime. No one is born ""evil"" and to demonise these two boys hides the greater problems in society      One angle I have not heard anyone comment on is that these ""boys"" may eventaully fall in love, get married and have children. One day, that secret will be exposed, can you imagine the feeling that poor mother and children face at that time. They should be denied ever getting married and having children as part of their release.      The killers of little James should never be released. They have killed once, they will do it again. They have not changed that much in the time they have been inside. I sincerely hope sometime, somewhere, someone gets them.      James will never walk this earth again, yet his killers will. The British Justice system and the do-gooders of this country have got a lot to answer for. They obviously don't really care that a two-year-old has been killed or that a mother and father have lost their baby. How would they feel if it was one of theirs?      Who are the people on this anonymous Parole Board? They appear to have power without responsibility. At least if the decision were left to the Home Secretary he would be open to censure and would have to stand up and say why he took a particular decision - and carry the can if that decision turned out to be the wrong one.      While I believe in humane methods of trying to rehabilitate criminals, I feel that it is far too early to have released these boys. Their lives have been salvaged: good. But by not having any element of punishment for what they did, we can only see that their heinous crime has been rewarded by a life they could never have dreamed of.      Denise, Ralph and family will live with the horror of this forever, and they have no redress. This parole decision, forced on the UK when the original trial judge and various home secretaries had held out for a much longer term, leaves them with an even deeper sense of loss, surely? We ordinary members of the public who watched news broadcasts in horror at the time and who have felt the deepest sympathy for them, can only share now in the added injury, sickened by the travesty of justice for which we had all hoped. The best that can be hoped for is that each of them breaches some technicality and ends up back inside.      Once you have done your punishment, you should be allowed to start with a clean sheet. If the parole board in charge estimates: ""it is enough"", then it is enough. Even if they did something horrible, there is a fundamental difference, they were not adults. They surely did not realise exactly what they did. And where did they get the idea? Would it not be from the movies they had seen on TV, or from where else? Instead of crying for many more years of revenge, why not start talking about forgiving?      The real issue here is less one of justice than of the purpose of the government. Isn't one of government's main purposes supposed to be the defence of its citizens from crime? Prison sentences are about punishing those who hurt others and break laws, not about rehabilitation of the criminal. Those who commit acts of violence against others have made a choice to do so. When they did this, they voluntarily gave up their rights as a responsible citizen. There is no such thing as being fair-minded to criminals.     I accept that Robert Thompson and John Venables should be released sooner or later but the sentence was far too light. I think that they should remain in custody until they are at least 30 years old. I know they were only children but the crime was particularly horrendous. I lived in Manchester at the time of the killing. It seems as though the system has shown more compassion for James' killers than for his parents.      Many people have spoken with indignation of the fact that Thompson and Venables have had better education and care while in local authority secure accommodation than they would have had they not committed the crime, and that they have in effect been ""rewarded"" rather than punished.      Having read the comments on this page and the media circus surrounding this situation I am have to say I am ashamed to be British. The psychotic baying for the blood of these two boys disgusts me, and makes all who call for it no better than Thompson and Venables themselves. If you genuinely believe them to be evil, show that you are the better person by letting them live their lives in the constant knowledge that they took a little boys life. Any decent, moral human being would think that enough. Alas, I fear that compassion and rational thought will play little part in how this story will come to its inevitable grisly end.      Maybe, just maybe, if they'd had the same level of care and attention during the first 10 years of their lives that they've had for the second they might not have committed this terrible crime?      I hope somebody, somewhere finds these two evil people and that they get what they deserve. What is this world coming to that we treat them so well? They should have no new names or identities. They should just have to walk out of the prison gates like any other criminal, and take what is there to greet them.      It's very easy to say ""lock them up throw away the key. but hopefully eight years is enough to learn a bit about what is wrong with a society that this happens in and how we can fix it. Ten years old is a very strange time. Trying to do what grown ups do but still thinking like a child. Love is what we all need to show each other.      I am British and have been living abroad for several years but I was living in the UK at the time of this horrendous murder. However, the release of these two unfortunate children just reminds me of my feelings at that time. That it should not have been these two 10 year olds on trial, indeed their identity should never have been made public in the first place.     It is modern British society that should have been put on trial. The media hysteria is indicative of this unfortunate Britishness love of scandal and on blaming their troubles on anyone but themselves. Of course these boys should be released and hopefully sent out of the country and left in peace.      It's a ""no win"" situation. I think that 15 years would of been more just, but to put them into an adult prison now that they are 18 years old would of been disastrous. All the rehabilitation work of the past eight years would of been undone by the prison system as it exists. I feel very sorry for the family of James but the two boys would have to be released eventually. Eight years isn't long enough though and I don't feel they have been really punished.      As some one who has the trust and love of many kids, I find the actions of these two killers abominable. They tortured a two-year-old to death and were fully aware of what they were doing.      Do we really have any comprehension of the amount of pure evil it takes for someone (no matter what age) to do what those boys did to James? Excusing them because they were only 10 and did not fully understand the consequences of their actions cuts no ice with me. They tortured James and, to them, it was a FUN thing to do. There is a very dark underbelly here that needs to be exposed.      How can the Parole Board say for certain that they are not capable of doing this type of thing again? Did they undergo and in-depth psychological evaluation that proved this was just a one off? I have read that there is somewhat of a pattern in serial murderers where they start as children by torturing and killing animals. If these two started by torturing and killing a 2 year old boy, what are they capable of next?      If they can kill once they can do it again doesn't take high flying lawyers and judicial systems to figure that one out.      Who are we to say the boys have not changed? No one knows and yet we all seem to think that they have or they haven't. Let the professionals decide.      Can anyone comment on an approximation of the total 'lifetime' cost to the taxpayer for this unpopular decision? How many nurses would you get for this money? What happens if their identities are discovered, does the 'protection' continue? do we start again? Or as should have been the case, do they become answerable for their crime?      10 year old boys that have been brought up with no structure, no love and plenty of unjustified beatings deserve to be given another chance.      James has been dead eight years. Let him rest in peace and let these boys build a life where they can make a useful contribution to society, wherever that may be. No useful purpose can be served by keeping them in prison, it won't change what has already happened.      I feel sick. While I appreciate that eventually they would have to be released I do not agree that eight years is long enough. Whether it is an adult or a child who committed murder, eight years is not long enough!      This is an outrage - not only are Venables and Thompson granted freedom, but they are also rewarded for murder with new identities, homes and numerous other handouts from the state. They will have the safety of a new life, something James Bulger was denied.      Although I sympathise with the family of James Bulger the reason these boys were released now is so that they are not sent to an adult prison which would have ensured they were corrupted absolutely. Since they are going to have to be released at some point, why not do it now when they still have the chance of leading normal lives rather than spending several more years in institutions that are just expensive ways of making bad people worse.      What these guys did was horrific no one disputes that - however they were kids who were tried as adults. Whilst kids understand right from wrong, they often don't understand the repercussions of what they did. The media attention on this case has been far greater than for child murders by mature adults who definitely understand the repercussions of their crimes. It's ironic the sympathy given by the UK public to a 14-year-old boy jailed in the US for killing a young girl in a mock wrestling match. It's time to have a similar approach here and give these guys a second chance providing strict parole guidelines have been set.      Can we even BEGIN to imagine what happened on that day? My son is 10 now, and he is fully aware of his own actions. They should not be released, under any circumstances. People who think they know best, are just that - people who think - they really don't know. God help them if released, because they will be exposed - the media is too clever.      The judicial system has once again failed the whole of British society, not least the family of James Bulger. The age of these murderers and their background has no relevance. These two evil people should never have been released. Anyone involved in this shameful decision should be ashamed of themselves. A sad day...      It's too soon. Sure, their ages and their progress during the last eight years should be taken into account, but so should the horrendous nature of their crime. The parole board has failed to strike the right balance with this decision and arrived at a conclusion many - not confined to the hang 'em and flog 'em brigade - will find deeply offensive.      Manslaughter or plain murder are one thing and 10 year olds could be excused for it on the grounds of not understanding the consequences of their actions. Planned and rehearsed abduction, torture, horrendous murder and a subsequent attempt to make it look like an accident, are altogether an entirely different kettle of fish. We are not talking ordinary misguided, abused and neglected 10 year olds from the sociology textbook on the ills of inner city depravation, we are talking about something else. That's why most people don't want these two anywhere near them, and many would prefer that they never be released at all. The number of even remotely similar cases is very small, so the experts can't really be certain about anything. The decision to let them go is, I'm afraid, little more than an experiment.      What happened to the 'time' fitting the 'crime'? This is an absolute disgrace, for eight short years to be punishment enough for such an abhorrent crime. It's time for the justice system to be accountable too.      Well, in a strange way, I feel justice is being done. Imagine the killers' lives from now on. They may well find themselves in the wrong place at the wrong time with the wrong people. No one to help them, protect them or come to their aid. A bit like poor James' situation 8 years ago. They have to live with that possibility, in the big open world, for the rest of their lives.      The torture and murder of James Bulger was appalling and neither Thompson nor Venables can ever be forgiven. However, there is little to be gained from locking them away for the rest of their lives. The guilt and lies that will overshadow them will constantly remind them of the atrocities that they committed. I hope that their true identity is never revealed. What could be gained by their persecution? It would only lower those involved to the level of these two killers.      I have lived in Liverpool for the past five years and know that feelings up here still run deep about the murder of James. I am appalled that the two killers should be released back into the community after a relatively short time in custody for the nature of the crime and without tasting life in a real prison. This is a sad day for justice in the UK, as I feel that in this case justice has not been done.      Despite the horrific nature of their crime, surely these two adults deserve a second chance for a crime they committed at the age of 10. Given the strict conditions of their release, I think it's reasonable to allow them the opportunity to redeem themselves.      An eye for an eye. These two killers should not be given new identities to protect them, they should have the same protection as was given to James Bulger - none. Killers should never be given new identities in any circumstances. Would any parent want either a killer living by them or perhaps their 18-year-old daughter going out with a killer?      Of course it's the right decision, the parole board wouldn't let them out unless it was safe, I just hope for their sakes that they will never be discovered and will have a chance to live productive lives.      If you feel that a miscarriage of justice has been done today then before you can do anything to the killers you have to overthrow the whole apparatus of the British judicial system. They have judged that the boys should be released, it is them you should criticise before saying anything about the boys. From the start people have demonised the boys because it makes it easier to ignore the act of brutality they perpetrated. This fuss being made now is the whining of a nation of guilty consciences.      British justice is a disgrace.      British justice!!! We pander to the criminal element and punish the victim. It is about time we introduced harsher sentencing including life meaning life. Parole for good behaviour should also be abolished. The sentence should reflect the crime not your behaviour afterwards.      It is too soon to release the two killers. The British people have a great sense of natural justice, fair play and can distinguish right from wrong. The public know that 12-15 years inside would have been appropriate for the two boys.      It is strange, is it not, that ordinary decent folk, who spend much of their lives working hard to earn an honest living get very little in terms of ""freebies"", and yet these two boys commit a gruesome murder, spend several years at Her Majesty's pleasure and are then released into an ideal environment - new identities, relocation, financial security, etc etc. Is this the message we want to be sending out the youth of today?     It doesn't matter what their names will be, or where they go, or what they do - they'll be recognised. They won't be safe in the outside world - I don't believe they'll be fully aware of the international hatred of them, until the moment they stop looking over their shoulder.      Thompson and Venables have an evil streak that no amount of rehabilitation can cure. They have received more perks whilst in their so-called 'Young People's Correctional Facility', than the majority of young people in the whole of the UK.      Perhaps the tabloids would like to see Venables and Thompson held indefinitely in a prison cell with Ian Brady or Myra Hindley... but we live in a democracy with a well-established judicial system whose decisions should be respected, however unpalatable they may seem.      I think the best solution would be for them to be released under the supervision of a TV crew. This way we can allow the vigilante pursuit to be broadcast for those who feel that John and Robert have not suffered. All you cold hearted ""do-nothings"" could tune into this on your idiot box and feel perfectly justified in your pathetic small-minded opinions.      It's hard to say but it's true that it won't be any good to keep them in prison. I disagree with their new identity thing because it will not guarantee anything. Someone, somewhere will know who and where they are.      Personally the thing that scares and ashamed me the most is the fact that our society is capable of mounting such a witch-hunt that these boys will forever be at risk themselves. They will be old enough now to fully realise what they have done - which, I suspect, will be a prison in itself. We need to accept the decision of the courts, and stop this mob-rule and vigilante action.      Up until now these boys have been in a holiday camp with PlayStations and TV/ videos. They haven't served any time. They committed an adult crime and should serve an adult punishment. They need to be imprisoned with grownups and learn to cope. Not be able to go out on visits to shopping centres and leisure centres!      Fact is they can only serve up to a maximum of 15 years (whether people like it or not). Surely there is less chance of them re-offending if they are released now, rather than spending 7 years in a more adult environment, being exposed to harder criminals and becoming more bitter.      I feel that these 2 boys are victims of society. They both come from backgrounds that were far from stable (according to the media). However, as a father of a four-year-old boy myself I would not like to see these boys released. They have killed in cold blood before and may do so again. No matter what the reasons are for what they have done we must never give them the chance to kill again.      As an ex-pat I was in the UK at the time of the killing of James Bulger. I believed then and do so now that John Venables and Robert Thompson should have been held until they were 18 and then tried for the murder of James Bulger. As things stand justice has not been served, or seen to be served. Shame on the British legal system when it can allow known killers to go free. I only hope these two are not allowed to enter Australia. My husband and myself fought hard and long to obtain immigration status and had we had a criminal record no way would we be living here now. Send them to some remote island where they will have only each other for company and where they do not need to be part of the human race, just as they robbed James Bulger of his right to live amongst his family, then justice will have seen to be done      Ten year olds know the difference between right and wrong. There is a deep and hidden reason why the two boys did what they did. If anything this needs researching. They should be not be set free.      I hope that all those people calling for the release of Thompson and Venables can put themselves in the position of James Bulger's mother for a moment and see how they would feel if it was one of their children who had been brutally murdered. I'm sure that their opinions would be much different if it had happened to them.      Do you remember what you were like when you were 10? Were you the same person at 18? How many nurses could you pay for with the money that you have spent keeping these two in prison?      I am an expat working in Norway, I do not think these two should be released for a very long time. The do-gooders of this world have a lot to answer for.      Unfortunately there is a lot of injustice in this world, the killing of the little boy is no exception. Perhaps no one will win in this situation, the victim, families, even the offenders in their lives to come. Please see it for what it is, a no-win situation for all - now get on with your lives people! "
HOC HOC-JY 2.58 " When government policies are targeted towards particular sections of the community (eg the minimum income guarantee for pensioners, combating benefit fraud etc.), it seems a sensible use of resources to advertise to make people aware of their rights and responsibilities. Otherwise, the government gets criticised for not telling people what they're entitled to or, in the case of benefit fraud, not entitled to. So, it seems, whatever the government does it's in the wrong!!      I am appalled at the amount of money the Government has spent on advertising so far this year. Just think what that money could have achieved for the people of this country if it was given to local authorities instead.      Yes I whole-heartedly endorse the significant rise in advertising by the Labour Party. The issue however is that the advertising should highlight the political, economic, cultural and moral ineptitude of the present 'government' and not the endless spin and deceit which is sadly all Labour is able to provide in substance and quantity.      There should be no TV advertising by political parties as it is a waste of money. Door-to-door canvassing in the streets and party political broadcasts are quite sufficient I think. Sixty million pounds could build a hospital, fill it with life saving machines and staff to work them. It's scandalous!      It's a complete waste of money, which could be better spent elsewhere. But this Government just insists on wasting money, at every opportunity (remember the DOME)      I think that the Government can do a better job of recruiting nurses, teachers, social workers, police by investing in those services. Running an advertising campaign to make people feel better about jobs they already have won't solve anything. The Government should not squander precious taxpayer money on spin; it should invest it in the future of Britain.      Either you're condemned for poor take-up of government initiatives, or you're condemned for promoting them.      Would the public forget about politics without advertisment? I don't think so, especially if one considers the present situation in the countryside. Ads don't help to solve these problems but I think they are necessary because it helps many people to get at least the slightest idea why to vote for a certain candidate. The poster had a nice colour! Cynical? True!      The amount of taxpayer's money they've spent on advertising is insane, I can understand advertising campaigns for recruiting more nurses and police officers. But advertising that just boosts Labour's media profile is just a blatant waste of money on something that doesn't serve any useful purpose for the country. If Labour want to boost their media profile, then let them pay for it from their own bank accounts and not the taxpayers.      This is yet another example of the cynical nature of this Government. Everybody here agrees on one thing. This money could have been spent on the services themselves. Good work would bring good publicity. This is just blatant pre-election campaigning, but disguised (badly). Not that the Tories or Lib Dems wouldn't have done it, had they thought of it when in power!      I applaud the government for attempting to inform people of their rights. However, as someone who has recently become a father for the first time and who had to jump through the Chancellor's many hoops, I can confirm that the money could be saved by having fewer daft initiatives and simplifying the tax system. For instance, how many of you know that the Working Families' Tax Credit and the Children's Tax are different things applied for on different forms to different departments? That's why they have to advertise so heavily.      The reality is that the media industry demands sound bites and advertising campaigns, otherwise it largely ignores issues. The government - of whatever party - has to resort to mass advertising to inform its electorate of new policies and initiatives. If too little money is spent governments are accused of hiding policies and trying to save money, and if they spend adequately are then open to accusations of wasting taxpayers cash. Once again, an issue gets between the policy and the people. We are side-tracked into concerns over how the policy is delivered, rather than the policy itself. Democracy suffers in the process.      Most of the adverts are SO dreadful, I can only assume the advertising industry see the UK government as a cash cow waiting to be milked. There are enough adverts littering our streets and stealing the time we have for our own thoughts - the government should cut advertising down to the smallest possible amount. Just tell us when the elections are, so we can boot the lot of you out!      I know that in Australia, at least, much of government advertising is grossly overdone. I know I speak for many when I say all we want is the facts - what we need to know presented simply, intelligently and to the point...      These figures showing that Tony Blair's government is now the biggest advertiser in the country are far from surprising. After all, New Labour has always been about spin over substance. One has to feel some sympathy for the junior minister and sacrificial lamb wheeled out by Millbank to claim that the rise in spending before a likely election was a coincidence. This government is very good at spending taxpayers' money and these new figures simply reaffirm that Labour is all mouth and no delivery.      I do not think it is a waste of money. If #60million is supposed to have been spent, that amounts to #1 per person in this country. The government is promoting the stakeholder pension and most people do think that saving for retirement is important. It is also well known that for example there are huge numbers of pensioners (about 200,000) who are entitled to income support) but do not claim it. The government is also helping the tourist industry at the international level.      I wouldn't mind so much if the adverts were constructive - as it is, the only election-related ones I've seen have been the standard, playground-style ""my party's better than yours"" cobblers which does nothing apart from show politicians up as the childish morons most of them are. Still, since the Tories hit the world with ""Labour's not working"", adverts don't have to rely on policies any more. After all, politics doesn't either.      I don't think the advertisements are really saying 'We'll do this if you vote for us' or 'we have been successful in doing this so vote for us', therefore it isn't fair to criticise the government for peddling propaganda. In actual fact they are being honest (for a refreshing change!) in saying that the public services are on a sticky wicket in terms of recruitment quotas, which may not cause a positive association anyway. Police colleges are filling up, and families are able to increase their income through entitled, but non-claimed benefits, so it should be considered as money well spent.      Put simply, if we want to recruit police, teachers and nurses then we need to advertise for them. As the biggest employer in the country, is it not probable that the government should have the biggest recruitment drive and therefore the biggest advertising spend? What would be the alternative - not advertise and then get criticised for not recruiting enough? And of course advertising spending is twice as much as last year - there are many more recruitment drives and more benefits that can be claimed, all of which were set out in previous budgets. There is nothing short-term or electioneering in this; the advertising will help recruit the very people we want - police, teachers, nurses. People who complain about the lack of these professionals should welcome the advertising spend.      I thought that the government had just spent about 500 million pounds on a website to advertise vacancies such as this. Instead of wasting money on advertising and Internet sites, why don't they make the jobs worth having in the first place?      On one side of the coin, it can only be a good thing that saturation advertising from Whitehall lets people know about benefits, registering to vote, the census and so on. If this helps people to realise what they can apply for, get and benefit from, great (if they could just get those forms so that you don't get fed up half way through a tree of paper for the sake of #20 a month......) On the other side of said coin, it is horrifying that they need to spend that much. Where does the money go for it to cost that much, and could this money not be used to help a few schools and hospitals?      I think the money is truly well spent. After all how would we know that the Government is doing a good job unless it tells us!      I think that government ads are a waste of time, particularly where the general election is concerned. I think that they should advertise themselves positively, for example highlighting their achievements since 1997, instead of trying to destroy the Conservatives with their ""Economic Disaster 2"" advertisement.      It is complete hypocrisy for any Tory - or Tory supporter - to criticise New Labour for ""ludicrous"" amounts spent on advertising. Millions were spent to proudly advertise the fact that the Conservatives were to sell off assets that were the property of the taxpayer. Remember the milkman delivering all the bottles of water a household would need? Or ""Tell Sid"" ad nauseam? Or perhaps any Tory would like to justify the adverts currently appearing on billboards near you criticising New Labour for the mess the last government left them in? Let's face it, any advert claiming ""You paid the tax, so where are the trains?"" when the Tories privatised the rail network really IS ludicrous.      I would rather see the money spent on advertising being put back into society in form of aid to pensioners, NHS staff housing, better medical equipment and free higher education at university level. I find it sickening to watch the government spends millions of pounds of our money on public slanging matches with the opposing party. It's sickening to think that #60 million has been spent in the last 3 months alone. The money should be given back to the people in the form of better transport, education, health services etc.      This issue has little to do with the particular government in place and more to do with people being so politically apathetic. Political parties need to advertise so that people are mobilised into voting, instead of not even bothering to turn out on election days. Many people in this country do not deserve their democracy because they can't even be bothered to take part as active citizens.      This government knows exactly what it is doing when it comes to the media. To claim that the increase in spending is a ""coincidence"" is another example of the Government treating us like idiots. Its all spin, spin, spin - last minute hype to make it look like they are doing something.      Why do the government need to advertise to encourage families to claim the new children's tax credit? Is it that it's so complicated that the people it's aimed at don't understand it?      As has so often been mentioned, this Government is obsessed with appearances and style. At one end, you have the spinning that is orchestrated by the likes of Peter Mandelson and Alistair Campbell, but this particular spending, whilst admittedly being very high, is to make people take up state relief and benefits being offered to them, and to recruit people into state services. I agree with the PM on this one. After all, high profile campaigns to recruit police officers and teachers appear - at long last - to be paying off.      The waste of taxpayers' millions on advertising is pretty bad coming from a government that boasted it would improve health and education. (There's a primary school near my home where kids are taught in huts that were built at the end of WW2 designed to be only temporary housing.      Watching the level of this Government's advertising can only be a good thing. When I see a poster saying how great the NHS is I know they've made a shambles of it. When I see a poster reminding me to fill in my census form I recall how much money is being spent on a glorified electoral roll. The campaign about stakeholder pensions never lets me forget how badly this Government screwed that up as well. It's great - I don't need to do anything except look at posters to find out where the Government is struggling to achieve anything.      It appears that the Conservatives are upset at valid attempts to inform poor people of their benefits and to attract people to jobs in the infrastructure that the Tory government ran down and their press ridiculed. Is this because the benefits that have been advertised would be scrapped and the new people recruited by the adverts would have to be sacked by a Hague government to pay for its planned tax cuts?      Surely it is not coincidence that the surge in advertising comes just before a possible election in June. Another scheme to muddy the waters to get Joe Public to forget the Millennium Dome waste of monies, muddy the waters to let Joe Public forget the screw-up the Ministry of Agriculture made of the foot-and-mouth disease and next the vote catcher of giving money in trust to new born babies for their future education. I've got a good idea, lets introduce FREE education for our future generation. But that's probably too radical for this money wasting egotistical Government. P.S. How much of the tax-payers money has been paid to the UNELECTED ministers, and spin doctors?      #60 million! That's almost as much as three days' continued membership of the EU!      Whilst the Conservative Party were in government Mr Blair's judgement, and that of his colleagues, was that taxpayers money spent on advertising was a disgrace and merely Party political propaganda. It is good to know Mr Blair is so flexible in his thinking - and on so many issues.      If the political parties did anything worthwhile they would not need to advertise, like any good product word of mouth and would be enough. Apart from the fact that there are a million better places to spend #60 million.      Public information can be very useful for informing the public about new policies, referendums, etc. But when the Government is using huge sums of money simply as election propaganda, this is a waste of taxpayers money.      This Government seems more biased towards presentation than to delivery, so it is not surprising that near an election, advertisements ostensibly promoting public services dramatically increase. As with any product with glossy packaging, satisfaction can only be assured by the contents; as far as this Government is concerned I feel very disappointed and annoyed with their over-reliance on hype.      I believe the police training colleges are now just about full, which vindicates at least some of the expenditure doesn't it? Perhaps the critics would rather there were perpetual staff shortages in the public services simply because they don't really believe in them.      Yes, it's a waste of taxpayers' money. If the government wants to encourage more recruitment of teachers, nurses and police then surely it should stop undermining their activities at every opportunity. Perhaps the government could start by keeping some of its previous election promises on education, the NHS and crime.      If it has to advertise so heavily in order to attract people to the state-run professions then there is something wrong with the way those professions are being run. Being a teacher, a nurse, a fireman or some other socially useful thing always seems attractive to children - but then they don't usually try to match pay packets to mortgages! If the employment conditions and the remuneration package were sufficient less advertising would be needed.      It appears that Tony Blair has changed his policy of country before party - clearly Labour party advertising seems to be more important than saving the tourism industry.      Would it not make more long-term economic sense to invest the same #60m in better conditions & facilities for teachers, nurses and the police? Then the media would provide all the advertising free of charge.      Is anyone claiming that these are ""vote Labour"" posters? I suppose some may claim that they highlight what the government has been working on this (and every) year of their term and are therefore political. Well, the civil service has been implementing these policies. Does that make them political? Of course not.      Perhaps a few common misconceptions should be cleared. None of this advertising is directly spent on party political purposes; the Central Office of Information strictly maintains impartiality in this respect. Furthermore, if you consider that most government projects consist of huge sums and can be highly complex, then the advertising spend compares well with private industry.      Most of the adverts I've seen don't seem to be advertising the Labour party at all. I think it is a coincidence, though I think it's good that we question it. We should have an independent board to make sure such accusations can be dismissed or investigated.      As the Government admits, most of the money has been spent advertising for more police, nurses and teachers who all say their main problem is the cost of housing. Why is this money not being spent on tackling the root of the problem - providing more homes so that prices become affordable once more?      I am happy for them to spend money on public information campaigns such as 'speed kills'. For example, we need a campaign to reassure drivers that it's not compulsory to overtake cyclists.      #60m on flaunting their own image! This is scandalous how many operations or police on the street would this have paid for? Spin doctors gone mad, this could only account for it.      Whilst I agree that the sudden increase in spending does look a little suspicious I also believe that a government must be allowed to communicate with its people as long as political content is not included and is confined to party political broadcasts.      Fantastic! The Government appears to have had a huge advertising campaign that has completely passed me by! Under these circumstances it seems to be a complete waste of money. But the money could have been spent on many different things which would in the end have resulted in far more positive advertising. All parties are the same, they are all to blame for encouraging the mud-slinging environment.      Sixty million pounds is absolutely obscene. This is twice the amount of the largest corporate advertiser in the UK! Of course, this figure is only for the last three months, so by the end of the year it should be #240M. This could have been an extra #5.7M for each police force in the country. This Government needs to more accountable due to their cavalier manner in how they spend our money. Its time they bowed their heads in shame and left office, we can't afford any more of their amateur bungling. "

JOC JOC-12B-09O 6.6 "I do not agree with ID12059's opinion that he does not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. Of course it is a serious problem that Mr. Abe resigned from president because he had a disease. However, according to William Saroyan, a man of ability can learn a lot from failures. This statement apply to Mr. Yoshida. After he resigned from president, he had been president again. Eventually, he took Japanese independence back. He learned a lot from failures. This example will apply to Mr. Abe. I believe that he will do good job. I hope Japanese people believe that too.  I sympathize with your opinion. But in order to raise a voter turnout, not only a young man's consciousness reform but statesmen need to set forth a young-men-oriented policy. So I think that a statesman's change of generation is also required.  Now that the political power has changed and many people expects that Japan will recover from the shock of 3.11. They also expects Japan will regain the rank of an economic power. Nowadays we often hear about what you call ""abenomics"". I'm a little anxious about the result of this election because I think people are losing consistency in their opinion. Think of the case of atomic energy. Most of the people want to phase out nuclear power and anti nuclear power demonstration are continuing these days. But LDP's manifesto doesn't refer much to the atomic problem. I do agree that economic concerns won out but this landslide is a bit abnormal. I'm worry if the lack of consistency will heighten tensions with China, and South. We must compare territorial problem with east asian peace and consider carefully . Parties are not our mother. We shouldn't depend everything on parties, nation, and our prime minister. We should think and decide on our own.  Having read many comments, I felt that many people focused on expressing their opinions about the result of the general election itself. Some of them have said that they were shocked by the fact that Mr. Abe became to be a president again. A few have explained the reasons why they thought DPJ did not deserve to win. Of course, in this unstable society, it is important to evaluate political parties and what they have done in recent years. However, I would like to comment on the future which I expect Japanese society to become this time. I think that Mr. Abe should formulate his policies realistically. In the manifest of LDP, there are many drastic policies stated remarkably. For example, it is said that an amendment to the Constitution is required in order to consider the Self-defense Forces to be National Defense Forces. Also it says that right of collective self-defense should be functioned. However, I do not assume that these policies will actually keep us safe. It is because these actions mean that our stance on pacifism promised after WW2 will change. If this perspective is recognized all over the world, reliance on us from other countries may be lost. Before we consider these problems, I think LDP should solve other innumerable problems. It might be important that LDP should rebuild national finance as soon as possible. I would like Mr. Abe to proceed with the unity reform of social security and tax and Abenomics at the same time.  I think that it is the most important thing for Abe to show the Japanese nation their resolution. The Prime Minister has changed many times since about 10 years ago. So Japanese nation think that new the Prime Minister will resign in about a year as well as the former The Prime minister. So Mr. Abe must show us their determination and he has to continue the Abe Administration to be realized his promise.  Abe lost election six years ago. I think that is because he can't show clearly the plan he would do. But this time, he can show concrete course to rebuild Japanese economy and be trusted.  Recently, the relationship between Japan and China is getting worse. Moreover, Japanese economy falls into deflation. Japan is under crisis now. I expect a lot from Abe in terms of improving Japanese recession.  I do not necessarily support Liberal Democratic Party but I strongly support Abe because he wants to revise the Constitution of Japan. Today China threatens the neighboring countries such as Japan and the Philippines with the naval force. Therefore Japan should reinforce the self-defense capacity.  I am in favor of your opinion. I think Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem, too. Moreover, Abenomics will resolve economics and a lot of problems.  I thought that it was impossible for Abe to be reelected , but he made success. This is the result that Japanese people believe in him. Abe has the policy that he would change the Japanese constitution. It is my concerning of this result. I don't want to be in dangerous fields. "
JOC JOC-14A-01O 6.33 "I can't believe that the captain of the ferry boat escaped after the tragedy. Needless to say, the duty of the ship's crew is to save passengers from the accident. Recently, such accidents as crew caused are increasing both on the sea and in the air. I hope that crew should accomplish their duty properly.  We must have second thought about responsibility of captains who control vehicle which people ride on. If captains will happen accident , passengers may be injured or die as this accident. Therefore captains must accept heavy responsibility for passengers lives and we must carefully select responsible captains.  I think the captain must be punished with appropriate penalty. Of course, it is not difficult to imagine his fear of death and why he wanted to run away faster but he is the captain, he kept thousands of people's life and it means he had to think and make action to save passengers life first of all. If he did so, I think we could save more people. I want to him to regret throwing his responsible and rehabilitate himself. I wish we never cause these case I think, if the captain had given the passengers appreciate directions, more passengers might have survived. This accident was caused by some human errors. So, the company which administered the ferry and the South Korean government should respond to the victims and the bereaved sincerely.  I was so shocked when I heard this news. I think what the ferry's captain did is the cruel thing and what should not be allowed. I feel sorry for many people who was passed away and still missing passengers. I want to know the truth and the details of this accident.  The captain lacked responsibility which he shouldered about 500 lives. Every crew should understand how to escape from the vessel when accidents occur. Last month, German airplane crashed. I hope such an accident will never happen. I think an education for pilots change more strictly.  I think we must learn from this disaster. If people do only criticism this case is wasted, so I think we should avoid repeating the same mistakes. For example, drivers raise the security awareness of ship.  I read this news , then it is like a ""Titanic"". Lee flew earlier, so Lee was no consciousness of safety. I felt anger for this captain. I think that we should make more stricter about the ship's law. I think of students regrettably. Lee was take more responsibility.  I heard this news, this accident is the most terrible thing in recent ships accident. It is like Titanic. I think that I was able to save more people. A lot of children got into this ship. In other words this accident would take the future of many children.  I was shocked when I heard this news. This is not accidental but man-made disaster. The persons concerned of the ship downplayed safety. I think we mustn't cause similar this accident.  I think if captain had made a correct judgment and take direction, much more people's life might have been saved. it can be said that The lack of this captain's responsibility cause this terrible disaster.  I think so too. Recently there are many accident of vehicle and crew throw away their duties. It is very sad story and I want to do their best to save passengers. It is very important for the society.  This is very sad news. I think we must learn from this disaster. Actually, I didn't even know how to escape from wreck. I took it for granted that ship is never sinking. If that happens again, I dive in the ocean before a ship capsizing. And all drivers should raise the security awareness of ship. I want to avoid repeating the same mistakes.  I agree with his opinions, Because if people do only criticism, this case is wasted, so I think we should make use of this case next.  This is very bad news. I believed the captain of the ferry made the life of passenger importance. The captain should help them. A mental examination of a license should be done more severely.  I think that it is very sad story. Japan had a similar air accident, Japanese air plane No, 123 fallen down on the Osutaka mount. We have to remember those terrible accidents and we had better not make same mistakes again.  I think so, too. He deserves to be punished. How terrible the captain is. I doubt his responsibility. "
JOC JOC-14A-03O 10 "I don't think that death penalty enables us to keep our society safe, and I hope death penalty be abolished anywhere in the world.  I think this way of penalty is not good. Because, he dose not only regret his guilty but also this penalty is too horrible. "
JOC JOC-14A-07N 5.92 "When I read this article, I was shocked to know labors' unfortunate circumstances. I think that the corporation should give them the treatments with human dignity. The company close their eyes to labors' suffering in order to make much profit. In a capitalistic country, you may seek profit. However, treating labors as animals is inadmissible. The government has to enact laws which protect the human rights of labors. Employers always want to exploit workers for inadequate pay as far as the law permits.  I was very surprised that slave labor is still happening. Indeed, there were black slaves previously the 1960s, and owners had produced a product by activating the slaves human trafficked in human beings. However, it should have banned that the slavery all over the world the present day. This practice will deprive of human rights. Why can they do easily an outrage action like this. I can understand that they want to get a lot of profit in production and exports , but it is incorrect to enslave workers in order that. I think that they should review the production process properly.  This article said that employment relationships (in all over the world) are very severe. I think this problem is happened in Japan too. To solve this problem, I think country's government should make laws about employment. Probably there are laws about it, but it isn't sufficient to protect labors. So I think government should strengthen the laws. For example, these days, there are problems about overtime work. So, how about regulate working time strictly, or pay for overtime work appropriately.  Reading this article, I felt ""How terrible and appalling situation this is!"" This is definitely exploitation. Of course I can understand that underpaid laborers are needed in terms of cost reduction, but I presume that fundamental human right should be respected at the same time. Human beings are different from animals in that they can think logically and speak language . If we third person continually connive at this situation , it isn't too much to say that we let the laborers die. It's not humanitarian. So we should take measure for this situation.  When I read this article, I was really shocked and surprised. Although I learned about the hard situation about shrimp industry, however, that's main point was environmental issue about mangrove so I didn't have enough knowledge about workers. Therefore, I think this time was very valuable because I came to know that how terrible their situation is ! Shrimp is my favorite food but I don't want them to work so hard and I think we all have to think this problem as very serious and find the way to improve their lives. If such problem about food is going to be more and more worse, then we cannot live in the same way as now. For example, consumers try not to buy so many shrimps then there will be less need for slave workers to work too hard. It is the most important for everyone in the world to live ""their"" lives.  I was shocked to read this article for the first time because I probably eat prawns, shrimp and other foods which are produced in the situation like this everyday not knowing about slave labor. Many businesses, not only them of foods but also them of other industries, have been becoming multinational corporations to seek the economical labor force. They build many factories in countries whose standard of wages is low. However, I think they must consider the situation of labor and mustn't forget that labors are human beings. Wherever they work in, their human rights have to be secured.  We should have a query about cheaper imports. There are cheaper labors behind cheaper imports. It develops a strong tendency to use cheap labor with the progress of globalization. Ideally, we consume local production. Now, we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. I'll take quality over quantity. We stop depending on overseas cheaper labors.  On the morning of the day I have read this article, I ate the shrimps which my family had bought in COSTCO. So, when I read this article, I was surprised, and I felt that I have a close relation to this news. I was shocked at still using people like slave. I didn't know the back ground of the shrimps I always eat are such a cruel systems. The company of shrimp must abolish this system of slave labor immediately. If many men are handled of slave, I don't want to eat the shrimps and I would not like buy other shrimps. I think, many companies are thinking methods for how to sell cheap shrimp, how to sell a lot of shrimp from other companies. But that methods of using slave labor are wrong. For stopping the system, consumers don't buy such shrimps. I think that gives the most damage for the company, it would be effective, however, being realization is so difficult . Because consumers have priority over not slave's problem but the price. I got the chance that I heard the problem, so I should tell the fact for many people. Because, the foods we eat have a relation to slave labor's problem. Many people know this fact is important at first. Thinking of Governments, they can prohibit the system of slave labor, and they don't permit to sell such a shrimp. Moreover they decide the lowest price, they don't compete with others for the cheapest prise, and they make a rule of labor>'s system, and condition , saving the people like slave. I suppose these are tied with saving the slave laborers.  When I read this article, I was shocked and astonished very much. I did not know about this at all although I often eat shrimp which are imported from those countries. I felt myself shameful and remorse for those countries' people. In these days, it seems that there is a society without no discrimination for gender and ethnic group. But I do not think so definitely. I feel there is clearly racial and sex discrimination in the world. Once I visited abroad, I felt discrimination for me as Asian people. One shopkeeper recommended tasting service for Caucasians who are in the line before me. On the other hand, the shopkeeper did not recommend the same thing for our family and the other Asian people who are in the line behind us. I felt very sad and understood this is the reality. In addition to this, I feel sex discrimination definitely. I joined to the extracurricular club whose ratio of boys and girls is 5 to 1. Naturally men are given priority and girls cannot be understood about girls' own troubles and there are almost no considerations for girls. There are still clear discriminations in the world and we must abolish the system as soon as possible.  When I read this article, I got surprised at using slave labor to make shrimps. If we eat that shrimp , we will be buying produce of slave labor. That means we agree with slavery. That is probably reluctant for us. Moreover it is unethical to use them because they pay no attention to their human rights. So I would like to suggest that Japanese government should stop importing that shrimp and also make that shrimp industry give up using slave labor.  This article surprised me very much. I have learned the bad conditions of farmers such as coffee and cacao. However, I didn't know the fact of shrimp. This problem should be resolved as soon as possible. But it is very difficult. We, consumers, want to buy the cheaper product. So farmers and corporations must make an effort to make their products cheaper. They can't stop using slaves. Thus we are involved in the problem. We should know it and change our action.  When I read this article, I was very shocked at slave labor being used in the sever condition. Although I know there are discrimination in the world, I didn't think such a terrible situation. It will be difficult Japan stop importing shrimp from their countrys, so the government should make regulations which protect human rights and control the company strictly.  When I read this article, I was surprised and frightened at the circumstance of slave labor in shrimp industry in Thailand. Why are there such captive laborers? Why are they sold like animals and are forced into unfair labor? Which should we respect as human beings, them or shrimp? Then, I questioned media response to the reality in Japan. This news should be known all over the world. I hope the day they can work in appropriate condition as human beings will come.  When I read this article, I was really surprised. I didn't know the fact that the fishmeal suppliers use slave labor. Using slave labor should not be permitted. We must respect each other's human rights. We have to do something to get the fishmeal suppliers to stop using slave labor. I think the best way to get them to stop using slave labor is that government enact a law about working condition, and regulate working condition. I hope that slave labor will disappear from this world.  When I read this article, I was so surprised to the fact that slave laborers are killed. And then, I remembered the TV program I watched last year. The program was about children's laborers in India. In developing countries, companies need make things cheap and make much profit. They use slaves to pay cut. However, the fact isn't known to us, who buy their goods. We should know more about these present circumstances.  When I read this article, I think this is very hurtful news and I was shocked. I've never know that they are working very so hard. They are working like slaves to make shrimps which we will eat. I think it should be changed. I think the company should care about our human right. We should abolish this working system now.  It is the main problem in this article that is the fact that the world STILL allows people to use slave labor. Slave labor should have been eliminated, but is still. Using slave labor has many problems that people who are limited to work have no rights, aren't paid properly, etc. In modern world it is natural for people to be free. But we think it too natural. Therefore, we don't have intension to see the world. The world is still irrational, so if we intend to see the world situation, we don't notice the world's irrationality. In this article, examples include Shrimp Industry, but in others situations there are slave labor problems. And we should intend to understand the problems.  I was surprised at the fact that there is still slave labor now. Speaking of slave labor, most of us image African slave. It was an injustice one and banned 19th century. I learned such history, so I thought all slaves completely disappeared. In this situation, developed countries should do something. For example, we should indicate an error of this system and should not buy shrimps from Thailand. There are many other solution strategies, but the most important thing is getting rid of slaves completely.  When I read this news, I was surprised at using slave labors in shrimp industry. It is natural that some companies want to sell at a price cheaper than other companies. However, we must not use slave labor at any time. I think what kind of person should be treated as a person. This is because that anyone in the world have the human rights. I think that Japanese media did not response this news quickly, because they think the news will have any effect on consumers buying shrimp. I hope that the day when all people can live in equality comes.  When I read this article, I was surprised and become sad. I didn't know that they were in such a situation. The slave is the system that there must not be. You must think that we cooperate and defeat such situation. The media should react to such situation as one means. If repeat a steady thing, change the situation; will help it. I think that it is important that it continues and acts.  From this article, we can learn two things. First, there is the fact that our lives are supported by others. Although this is the extreme case, there is a lot of others' sacrifice. We must realize that how a lot of benefit we owe others. Second, we recognize the system of slave labor. Let me assure you that nobody like cheap products. So, although we think that we shouldn't have slave labor, few of us take actions. So we should take action to cut down the number of the slave labor.  I was shocked to read this news. I have not known how shrimps which are sold in supermarkets are produced. There are many slave labors who are treated as animal in shrimp industry. This problem is related to Japanese because we buy prawns or shrimps at SEIYU or other supermarkets. In Japan, however, few people know this fact. I think we should become aware of this problem. We just can do is taking action to protect slave labor's right. I hope the shrimp industry produce foods without using slave labors.  It was quite shocking to see that there are still slavery remaining to this day. I knew that slavery existed during the Civil War, but I never knew that slavery existed in the 21st century. Slavery violates human rights in every way, and there should be severe punishment to slave owners. It is also disgusting to know that the shrimp and prawns from Thailand set on supermarkets are the ""produce of slavery. "" Since this concerns not only Thailand, but the countries around Thailand, we should figure out a way to stop slavery and save these people on board.  I was so surprised at the news that some of our daily food is based on slave labor and shocked how terrible the present situation of slave labor is. I suggest that we, that is , the consumer refuse to buy the commodity of company which handle slaves terribly for their interest.  The truth that shrimps which we unintentionally eat in daily life is raised by large numbers of men bought and sold like animals and held against their will on fishing boats surprised me. Especially I was shocked at the severe working conditions that can lead labors to death. I can't believe such a thing is possible in this modern society. Since we consumers eat cultured shrimps, we have to consider the workers who are related the process and choose the one which the workers are concerned.  I have thought that there are no slavery today, so I was shocked when I read this article. Not only me , almost everyone think there are no slavery today, I suppose. There are a lot of serious problems , for example, environmental problem, a food shortage , and poverty. That's why we miss the problem of slavery. I think everyone have equal right , so employers have to pay fair wage to them. We should make efforts to look at problem hidden by main serious problem.  I hadn't been imagined that many slaves worked to get fishmeals in horrific situation until I read this article. This fact should be known for Japanese people, because imported foods are related with our life. To solve this problem, governments should make international regulation which prohibits sell food products which use slave labor. Also consumers should research details of products, for example, price, place of origin.  I have already known that there are some suppliers that use slave labor. However I thought they are minority, and most of suppliers are not using, so the news about CP foods, the world's largest shrimp farmer, surprised me. I mustn't buy things from bad suppliers like CP foods to protect people from the labor in horrific conditions.  When I read this article, I think it is cruel that supplier use slave labors. They treats labors as animal. If they does this in Japan, they must be charged. We are part of the world and we are friends, so we should think this problem as our friend's problem. Human rights should be respected all over the world. I think slave system must be abolished.  Consumers have to understand that we may have participated in forced labor indirectly, and have to take action. This news that the food eating every day might be morally made by the bad method made consumers anxiety and grief . At the result, sales of related goods decreased . However, it will not become solution only by economic sanctions and refrain buying. It is necessary to make laws that indicate the rule of the process until food reaches consumers.  I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible.  I was very surprised to read this article. I often eat shrimps. But, I did not know that such a terrible thing was taking place in the process that made the shrimps. I cannot understand the sense of people employing the same human being as a slave. Even if they want work force, I think that it is wrong to treat a human being like an animal. If an individual less thinks about human rights, we cannot anticipate the improvement of the situation, but I hope that such situation is improved as soon as possible.  I think slave labor are used not only in shrimp industry but in various industries. I have seen the documentary video about Indian child labor in factories and mines. It is very very serious problem and we must consider the laws and projects that prohibit these unethical labor. The most effective actions about unethical labor is to buy only fair trade goods and not to buy tremendously cheap goods in supermarkets. However most people think it is impossible. Therefore I think it is the important first step to attract the interest of lots of people about these unethical labor. Improving labor environment will take a long time, but we must change these cruel situation.  I can't believe even in the modern world, some people were forced to work and not paid like slaves. According to the article, workers are treated like animals in their terrible work environment. It is true. We should face up to reality. However, Japanese government or companies would not wrestle with the problem actively. That's because Seafood consumption in Japan depends on imports from south east Asia. Perhaps such forced labor would contribute to cheap price in Japan, which makes us happy. Before we claim the human rights and dignity, we should reconsider our attitude.  This article will shock the world. We should criticize such an inhumane working. I warn Thailand government to research about this issue and They must force CP foods to close the factory.  If you buy prawns or shrimp from Thailand, you will be buying the produce of slave labor,  this word was very impressive for me. We are apt to buy cheep goods without thinking anything, but retailers may use forced labor like this news. To solve this problem, watch agency should be in place in an appropriate manner in all labor market. And we should continue investigation whether supermarkets use slave labor. I hope that terrible things will disappear from all over the world.  I was surprised and shocked at labor using slaves is still being. In developing country, they want to cut costs as possible as they can. So, they uses slaves. We should stop to import shrimps from their country but we can't because of shrimp demand. The only thing we can do is we know more about such a circumstance and thanks for the food.  Reading this article, I remembered the story of ""The Cannery Boat (KANIKOSEN)"", which is about people forced to work like slaves. I was surprised to see that such painful situations still exist today. I felt angry at old-fashioned way of capitalists' treating workers. In the flaw of globalization, we should respect and consider them, which is the contemporary way of working.  When I read this article , I was shocked and surprised at using slave labor. Although I often eat shrimps, I didn't know such a terrible thing. To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world! When I read this article, I think there was something similar to what happened to current Thailand in Japan. That is the yarn-making factories which was privately-owned in the Meiji era. From the view point of modern people, there seemed to be extremely oppressive work and exploitation in the factories which were pursuing the biggest benefit. It is said that the daughters who was born into country cropper family were delivered to the yarn-making factories. We should deeply think about the work of international migrant workers.  In Japan, we can't see slavery labor, but in fact today there is this labor. This labor should be banned. It will kill more and more people. So it should be restrained.  In this news, there are still slave labor in shrimp industry. And the global retailers like Seiyu sells us a lot of shrimps that they bought from CP foods. And CP foods were supplied by shrimp industry using slave labor. US and UK responded this terrible fact quickly. But their medias were anxious about their effect on consumers buying shrimp. So they remained to be seen this. When I read this article, I was very surprised and thought, ""I can't believe slave labor still exists !"". But in our living cities, many things are sold for unbelievable low prices. We should feel something is wrong when we buy them. But I guess many people don't even know this fact. So I think it is important for saving people who work slavery to know tis fact.  i am very surprised at this news. i like shrimp . so i should think this news very much.  I have known a little about slave labor but I didn't know so cruel like that. This industrial system is profitable only for developed countries and ignore the human right of people in developing countries. And those who buy the products from the suppliers using slave labor are accomplices. It is the industry that makes all the people who are relevant to that happy, so we must consider how to solve this problem hard and as soon as possible.  When I looked this news, I was surprised very much that such a thing still happened. This is because, though movement to get rid of slavery is taking place all over the world, it really existed. I think that it is wrong to make a person unhappy only for the thought that they want to be cheaper. I think that Many people eat sold prawns without knowing this fact I think that it is important that even slightly many people know this fact to solve this problem even a little.  This article serves us one thing that advanced countries must not look away from realities of developing countries. We may eat shrimps which this article says. developed countries have large amount of money, but developing countries don't have enough. However, developed countries should not squeeze as small money as possible from developing countries. I think that advanced countries would rather improve state of developing countries.  This article said that employment relationships all over the world are very serious. I think the problem also is occurred in Japan . I think there are two solutions about this problem. The first is that the government should make laws strict which are related to employment. Probably. the current laws are not sufficient to protect labors. So I think government should strengthen the laws. The second is that each person should know the current situation.  I was so shocked at this story. if I were a slave labor and forced to work 18 to 20 hours per day for seven days a week , I would dead soon. I wander that the world has another lot of slave labors and they work very very hard today so I want to buy fear trade products when I go shopping.  I feel sad that there still exist such a things like slavery and human trafficking. We should not allow those inhuman acts and take an active part in trying to abolish those things.  I was shocked at the circumstance of slave labor in shrimp industry in Thailand. Also, I don't know that these terrible situation still have existed. The slaves are as same as women like us, but their lives are so far from ours. I can't ignore the serious fact. However, ironically, there may be possible of our eating food which is produced by them. We are also the parties concerned. We should be aware of it and reconsider the solution.  I'm so sad and angry with there still being customs of people treated as slaves. It is impermissible. We should behave to abolish this bad custom.  I agree with him. actually, some Japanese labors are in same environment called black company. we should take action to protect human rights.  we should treat people as slavery. in fact , we Japanese eat shrimp a lot. but not so many people don't know what happens while shrimp are made.  Developed countries including Japan have responsibility for this situation. They desire cheap cost , so developing countries have no choice but to cut labor costs. I think developed countries must pay appropriate wages and make the circumstance that nobody is slave labor.  I agree with your thought. When we buy cheaper goods we should never forget the existence of cheaper labors. In addition, we should have the awareness that it depends on our decisions whether cheaper labors conditions will be improved or not.  I am against a part of your opinion. It is true that we have an indirect hand in using slave labors. Of course, when we consider human rights, this is not necessarily a good thing. However, i think we have to have an efficient production method to sustain a population of 100 million. The too terrible labor circumstances should be prohibited, but a constant such work force may be necessary.  I think labor like slavery should be prohibited in this 21st century. And I think Japan can take an important part of improvement of this situation. As a same Asian country, first we should buy a lot of goods like shrimps. It is seen as having the opposite effect. But without enough monetary base, the capitalism do not work perfectly and the cannot mend the working environment. Second, Japanese industries should advance to Thailand. Because Japanese company do not break rules about labor. The better working environment is with enough payment, holiday, social welfare service Thai. So they can export it to Thai. Japan and Thailand have a common about customs, Imperial(Royal) house, Buddhism strict manners. I think the relationship between Japan and Thai is the key to solve the problem.  I agree with you, To solve this problem, we should make a law about prohibiting such a terrible thing. And I hope that such a terrible thing disappear from this world! I agree with you. some Japanese labors are in same environment called black company They are same as slavery labor.  I was so shocked from this news because I can not believe there are still people treated like slave . We should save them .  Using slave to make a profit is serious problem especially in poor countries. By helping these countries, we can tackle this problem.  This is because I also think we have to take legal action against slave labor. Some of the countries think establishing laws which restrict economic business activity is not good. However, until making laws which fixes the standard of labor condition, we cannot banish products made by slave labor.  I didn't know the news too. And I agree with your idea that taking action to protect slave right, but it is difficult problem to solve it. We can spread the news and fact to many people for slave labor.  My opinion is condensed into this classmate's comment! Slave system must not exist. We should cooperate to defeat this situation. I feel sad because slave system still exists. I felt slave system is not history, but ongoing problem after reading this article and comment.  I don't believe that the slave labor should remain. When you buy a merchandise that is produced using slaves, you should think that you are the one who is making the slaves' life harder. People still should buy goods that are produced in a proper way, even though they might be more expensive.  I agree with his (or her) opinions. Slaves to be prohibited strongly, it is not allowed. His opinion is very natural. For human beings, human rights is very important thing. However, It is no doubt that the presence of slavery is a big problem. The pursuit of profit could lead taking away the right to be protected. This problem should be solved on a global basis. Even if we buy something at the supermarket, it may be involved in this issue. We, rich people, may encourage slavery.  I agree with your thinking. We should consider that there are many people who is labored in cheap salary when we buy cheap clothes which made in Southeast Asia. "
JOC JOC-14B-08N 6.45 "Since I had the image that Canada was safe, this incident surprised me. I am regret that the criminal who is key person of this incident has died. The same incident may occur in Japan. I think that Japan does not have a sense of crisis of terrorism. By getting to know this incident, the Japan house should also strengthen the watch to terrorism.  Attacks such as religious terrorist shootings gives a terrible impact on our society and people's lives . I think think that 's a very big blow that the important figures of the terrorists had killed without catching. I think that many countries need to raise the level of the terrorist measures and Japan also do not think it is someone else's business.  I think that this news surprised a Japanese. This is because Canada has not a dangerous image such as the Middle East. I also thought that Canada was a safe country. However, this image completely changed by this incident. At the same time, Japan came to have to think about terrorism seriously, too. The standby alert for other countries such as North Korea may be surely set. But, I think that Japan must raise the level of the terrorist about from the specific thought group except the country.  I was surprised at this news so much. I have been to Canada once. When I visited there, I thought how quiet place here is and how peace Canada is. Thus this news about gunman astonished me so much. In addition to that, I think we could understand the seriousness of ISIS. ISIS problems will expand more and more. Other countries like USA, UK, Japan and so on should take some measures.  In this article, there are two interesting point. At first, how many people believe that Canada is safe place. I can deny this strongly. It is because Canada allows people to have their own guns although the system is so strict. Moreover Canada is next to the US In such a society, we always have to watch out the danger. Second, Canada isn't like his next country. If this kind of thing happened in his next country, he should return to his enemy soon and essentially. However, he didn't do such thing. I think his next country have to learn his attitude.  I agree with your opinion. I also thought Canada is the safety and peaceful country. It is necessary for Canada to identify why this terrorism happened and to keep people from taking such cruel action again. Then, Japan has the possibility to occur horrific terrorism. Now Japan has strict rules about gun, so gun fight hardly takes place in Japan. However, terrorist might attack people by harmful chemical weapon as Aum Shinrikyo. We have to settle many problem existing Japan to prevent terrorism.  I was very surprised to read this article, because I did not have an image which Canada is involved in terrorism. Even a country which is safe, we cannot know when the country will be involved in International issues. Not to cause matter like this, many country include Japan have to tackle this problem.  Though I think Canada is peaceful country, you must be surprised at this article from your experience. Your opinion is persuasive enough. I wish this diplomatic issue can be solve as possible.  When I read this article, I was really surprised because I thought Canada was as safe as Japan. However the terrible terrorism has occurred in Canada, so I think it is possible to happen such as a terrorism in Japan. So far, the terrorism seldom occur because there is a strict gun control in Japan, so that it is difficult for Japanese to image about it. If the incident happens, they will not correspond with it. In order to correspond with it, we must know this news and whenever the terrorism happens. Government should solve this problem in cooperation with other countries.  When I heard about this news, I was very surprised at it because I have imagined that Canada was a peaceful country. Also, this news indicate that Islamic State is a menace to world peace. All the country should cooperate with and control IS's menace.  I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised to read this article. Attacks such as religious terrorist were threat to us because these attacks point to people who are only general citizen. We have to take measures as soon as in Japan.  I totally agree with you. I have thought Canada is peace and there is no conflict by the time I read this article. So I was so surprised too.  I agree with you. In truth, Japan is safe compared with other country. But we should be alert every time as you say, because there isn't complete safe zone all over the world.  I was so surprised and scared because I had an image that Canada is peaceful place and there were no terrorists. "" There will have no heaven. "" I got strong impression from this speech. We, all the countries should fight with Islamic's menace. "
JOC JOC-14B-14N 5.62 "I think the resumption of operations at the facility should be stopped and also there is nothing for it but to do. We have to provide energy without big supporting, but if we keep on relying on thermal power generation, it will become resource-tight.  I can't agree with your opinion. I think that we need nuclear power. In truth, nuclear power may be dangerous, but I believe we can use this power safely. If we can use nuclear power safely, this power provides our society a lot of richness. "
JOC JOC-14B-15N 8.93 "When I read this news, I was surprised very much. I am against a capital punishment. The person that the death penalty is carried out may be surely the person who did murder. Even so, it is easy to murder a murderer. I think that the murderer lives seriously and should compensate for a crime. According to this news, Reyhaneh Jabbari was hanged without enough investigation. Moreover, it is said that such a thing is not uncommon in Iran. I feel sad and anger. I think that Iran should respect the life of the person and promote the abolition of capital punishment.  This article shows us that even now these cruel judgments have been practices. In Jabarri's judgment, Iranian government consider that the capital punishment was judged and executed fairly based on Iranian laws. Moreover, we can say that Iranian government quietly insist Iranian law and the way to govern Iran is only Iranian business, and that there are no right for other organizations to force Iran to change the judgment laws. It is the reasonable insistence. However, the present Iranian laws are unfair for women. There were lots of countries which had harsh convention of women. Nonetheless many countries have revised more equal lows and rules. Now Iranian government need to face the social and judicial inequality of woman.  I am surprised that there are many people who are executed all over the world. In this case, although she murdered him, I think she should not repent for her crime with death. He had life without her murder. She should live with his life. "
JOC JOC-15A-05N 5.61 "This kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event in Europe because the number of homosexuals seems relatively large.  When I read this title, I couldn't understand what it was. But as I read this article, I thought it was wonderful for everyone to think about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality, but it is an age when there are many gay or lesbian in the world. So I think we can't discuss many things without them now. I think Japanese has the prejudice why they love same sex. So Japanese should recognize them and have the attitude which encourages homosexuality. From now on, their right will be guaranteed immediately.  I think that the movement that the minority like homosexual is received in everyday reality will be needed as time passed, this example is the first step to promote tolerance. In Japan, same-sex marriage was accepted at Shibuya lately. From now on, we should spread these movement.  I think that we should more actively promote movement as homosexual being accepted. I think that now, many people accept homosexual. However most of them don't want to discuss this subject aggressively. Therefore accepting homosexual have not been prevalent. Let's discuss accepting homosexual.  It is good for emphasizing equality between normal couples and others to take the measures, but I think we don't have to use icons of a couple in traffic signals.  When I read this article, i couldn't understand immediately. Because gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. Many gay TV celebrity are succeeding in Japan. So if Japan import this traffic signals, we will be tolerant about gay culture.  I was surprised to hear this news because I didn't have such an idea as gay and straight traffic lights. Also, I was astonished to know Vienna are generally positive about new traffic light. However, in Japan, I believe that most people may not be positive to set up these traffic lights in the city. Recently, Shibuya Ward decided to issue the Partnership Certificate to the same-sex couple. I'm not familiar with such movement. But, we should accept this movement for mutual understanding and happiness of our society.  At first, I couldn't believe the traffic lights exist in the city. It is difficult to judge whether the idea is right or not. Certainly, many people tend to be positive about homosexuality in recent years, but there are the objection. Although there are many kinds of opinions, it is the homosexual's opinion that most important.  I was surprised at this article when I read it. I think homosexual is received gradually in many countries, but Japan has a sense of discrimination for homosexual. We should promote the movement that homosexual being received all over the world like 'gay and straight' traffic lights.  When I read this title I was surprised . This article is about homosexuality. Some people aren't willing to recognize homosexuality. I think that Japan must think about a homosexual than now. Japan should recognize the homosexuality properly. I strongly think that it should allow you to live without being discriminated even if homosexual.  Installing 'gay and straight' traffic lights is a good idea, I think. These days, gay isn't out of the ordinary any longer. More and more people should accept them, and we shouldn't discriminate between gay and straight. 'Gay and straight' traffic lights are the first step for equality and equal treatment. That's why I think we ought to spread this trend.  I was surprised by this news because I have never seen such signals. But I mainly agree with this topic because I think it is good to promote same-sex couple. I think it is wrong to give equal right not only to straight couples but also gay couples. I also think that it is not good to have bad image based in their race, nationality, and sex. I want Japanese government to install signals like Vienna.  I was surprised to see this article. I have seen only the traffic light with a man. I think it is a good idea. It will amaze me when I wait the light changes. Furthermore It means the society allows same sex couple. I want Japan to install this traffic light.  This traffic lights show our modern society. Recently, in Japan, the issue of gay and straight attracts our attention. But in Japan, we can not see and feel concrete activity which linked to those people. So when I read this article, I thought Japan should do an action recommending such people like a foreign country. I feel Japanese people have to try to think about this issue more seriously from now on.  The world is changing. Should Japan also change in terms of tolerance of same-sex   marriage? I disagree with approval of same-sex   marriage for some reasons. It is true that some people say that same-sex   marriage is an individual problem so a definition is legally necessary. However, Japan has a tradition that people regard their family very highly. If same-sex   marriage were legally allowed, Japanese family system would be destroyed. Should Japan accept ""global standard"" without criticism? I don't think so. In addition, most Japanese people are biased toward same-sex   couples. Whether same-sex   marriage is approved or not, same-sex   couples will be permanently prejudiced in Japan. Same-sex couples had better leave Japan. Therefore in Japan same-sex   marriage should not be legally allowed.  When I first read this article, I was surprised because I have never seen these traffic lights. Recently, I think these couples are gradually accepted in the world, so I think it is good to set up these traffic lights. However, technically speaking, we Japanese aren't sensitive these various couples, so I think it is important for us to understand them.  I think so too. I expect people accept this idea and epochal action in Japan.  Today, there is a various kind of love such as gay. For them, prevailing the thought that such a kind is popular is important. Of course, we must think the demerit of this. For example, gay couple cannot birth their child. In particular, in today's Japan, low birth-rate is one of the social problems. For the benefit of group, we shouldn't promote this campaign.  I have never heard of the idea of gay traffic lights. I think it is a great idea because I can think of no negative points trying this. I agree with the voices of people on the street in this article. I also believe this idea should be considered in Japan as Shibuya, for the first time in Japanese history, allowed same-sex marriage recently while most people seem apathetic. I hope these sexual problems will be discussed more in Japan.  Homosexuality begins to be accepted now in the world. But in Japan, the problem about the homosexuality is rarely taken up in the media. So, this idea is good for Japan because people become able to think that homosexuality is not a special thing. But I want Japanese government to use the tax for a more important thing, for example, social-security, the low birth rate, electric generation, and so on.  I've never seen such a interesting traffic lights that arouse my curiosity strongly. Although Austria's Freedom Party make an objection to them, I agree with these designs. As the article says, the 'gay and straight' traffic lights will make people pay more attention to traffic safety as well as take more interest in homosexuality and equality. That is killing two birds with one stone. Especially, amid the progress of diversifications of values, I think we should turn our eyes towards the matter of human rights for gay people earnestly. So, I think that designs are very nice.  I think it is good idea that gay traffic lights are fit up. Some country meditate the problem about homosexuality and take action. In Japan, I sometimes watch a news or program about homosexuality on TV. But, everyone don't think seriously about it. But, there are gay and lesbian in Japan too. So, we should understand homosexuality and take any action to save them.  I have never seen these traffic lights too. So I was surprised when I read this article. There are seldom gay or lesbian around us. So it is quite difficult that we understand them. But I think it is important to understand them.  When I read this article, I was very surprised, because I have never seen such traffic lights. And I think that it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. In Japan, I've watched homosexual people on TV, but I didn't think seriously about them. So I think we should introduce this idea.  I think that it is very interesting idea. I want to look at such a signal in Japan. The problem about sexual become more serious. Recently same-sex marriage came to be accepted abroad. The problem about sexual is apt to be avoided in Japan. However we should think the problem about sexual. I strongly believe that we should make tolerant society about the sexual.  I agree with you. I think that Japanese government should make tolerant society about the sexual. The Japanese should get rid of prejudice. Each one should think about sexual.  I agree with you. In Japan, minorities had been ignored. So that, we should accept diversity in every field such as sexuality.  I agree with your idea. We Japanese are insensitive about this issue, so we should try to understand them and discuss whether Japan install these signals or not.  Me too. I have never seen these signals and I didn't know these signals were existing. When I first read this article, I was surprised, but I think these diversity is good and we should try to understand these issue.  I think that it is good idea to make people think about same-sex couples. Since homosexuals appear in a program as an entertainer, Japanese people are tolerant of homosexuality. It is important to promote tolerance and the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. Many countries should install traffic signals like Vienna.  I agree with you. We should pay attention to the issue of homosexuality.  When I heard this news, I think this is very interesting tackling. Recent years, it is more important about the equality and we have to be anxious about the minority. This tackling is the one way of keep equality and reform of peoples consciousness. I want to try this tackling in Japan too.  It was not until I read this article that I knew 'gay and straight' traffic light in Vienna. I think this idea is very unique. In recent years, homosexual problem has been accepted gradually around the world. Also, countries that legalize same-sex marriage is increasing. However, it is not legal in Japan at present. I think Japanese government should promote these movements more than now. And we must deepen our understanding of the homosexual issues.  I was surprised at this article title. I couldn't image of gay and straight traffic lights at first. But I think this signals are good, because it is possible to attract attention of pedestrians and driver to traffic signals. So it can reduce accidents. And also, people will be able to understand about gay more and more.  There is a prejudice against homosexuals in Japan. In fact I also, but one person to have a prejudice. I know that since the rights as a person is in everyone equality, it's free to become who to love. But I think that there is still resistance against homosexuals. In order to eliminate this feeling also, the movement held in Australia is very effective. By the government to represent the attitude that accepts gay, prejudice against homosexuals will fade.  I think this idea is efficient because it is good for not only attracting the attention of all road users, but also promoting the idea that same-sex couples are a normal. However, seeing these traffic lights only once time is not radical solution for prejudice of same-sex couples. To think same-sex couples normal, we need to see such couples as much times as different-sex couples in our life. But the number of same-sex couples is small, so the spread of these traffic lights is necessary for our equal life.  When I read this article at first, I remembered the news that same-sex couple's marriage is admitted in Shibuya. However, I think an understanding for that trend is not popular in Japan and it takes time to spread to the whole Japan. In my opinion the movement for encouraging gay people is a good idea in equal treatment. I want this action spread in Japan, too.  I think it is very important for everyone to think about same-sex couples. Recently, I often hear about the system that same-sex couples could live comfortably. In my high school days, one of my classmates was a homosexual person, but he didn't hide the truth and we never discriminated against him. I think he was proud of himself. Everyone's having their pride is very necessary to live in this world, so I hope to establish more the system that not normal couples but also same-sex couples could live comfortably.  I agree with this opinion . When I have been to Brighton in England , i feel something which like freedom . I am not gay but Ifeel that Brighton was comfortable for everyone. Even if women, men, normal, abnormal, young, old, people! I felt that the idea of installing gay-themed traffic lights is very interesting because I have seen traffic lights that are only red and green. And gay-themed traffic lights are good to tell people that same-sex couples are a normal.  I can't believe that there are ""gay and straight"" traffic lights in Austria. It is very good that the Austrian society accepts gay. However, that traffic lights is abnormal. WHY AUSTRIAN PEOPLE! The discrimination against the same sex couples are severe in the world, also in Japan. Homosexuals should be treated equally by other people even if they do not understand them. It might be difficult problem for all people. However, the society that people do not accept homosexuals cannot make an equal society. It needs corporations of people to make its society, therefore governments should consider a counter plan to help people who are not able to be accepted their homosexuality by societies. Recently, some people who declare homoeroticism are increasing, so I hope it becomes an equal world.  I think so too that such culture is not accept in Japan. And also we should consider this issue. But I think we don't need to make such traffic lights.  I think this event is good because we mustn't discriminate same-sex couples. In the past, we think they were strange. But now, number of them seem to increase. Our common sense always change and will change. Then we must change thinking and correspond to the situation.  I agree. I also think most of the Japanese people do not accept those movements. However, if it holds in Tokyo, more people may be interested in the same-sex couples. The traffic lights are seen by lots of people including foreigners, so it will be able to get an attention.  I agree with you. It is epoch-making idea to insist on same-sex couples is normal. I think this idea is noticed by a people well.  I have never heard this news about the idea of unique traffic lights in Austria. I think it effective to understand LGBT. In Austria, some people oppose this idea because of contravention of traffic regulations and financial reason. However, a large number of ""likes"" on the Facebook may reflect public opinion. Nowadays, I often hear the word ""LGBT"" which refers to lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender. But, compared with foreign countries, Japanese society doesn't seems to be tolerant toward those people yet. So, I think, Japan also should do some efforts like that.  I was very surprised to read this news. When I read it, I wondered if there is a need to set up lights at pedestrian crossing that show pairs of figures instead of the usual stick man. To be sure, a series of event of it is good, but, it cost much money. According to this news, it cost $7NA, 000. I think it is a waste of money. The money can be used for a more important thing, I think.  At first, I couldn't understand, too. In Japan, gay couples are not recognized except from a part of the area. In a TV show, a topic of gay is often picked up, but there is still a social prejudice. We have to remove it.  I think that traffic lights should not be used as a poster because strange traffic lights can induce accidents. I also think this traffic lights do not promote equality. Everyone will look the lights curiously and not think about it seriously. I think the cost of this campaign should be used to other things.  Since I live in Japan, I've never seen the various traffic lights. So when I heard the topic, it takes time to understand it. Recently, the mass media has become to take up the topic about the right of a homosexual. I agree that gay should get the opportunity to live more comfortable. Thinking of the law system in Japan, however, there are many points of improvement to live equally. Following this topic in Australia, we need to think of the right of homosexual.  I agree with you. The sexual problems are still difficult to solve. However, we should try to understand them.  I think this idea would be able to diminish the prejudice that guy couples are abnormal. this plan should be done all over the world.  Before I read the article, I'd never heard this movement. However, this is very interesting and meaningful. That's because this can make people accept homosexuality more. I want to do same action in my country. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't admitted. Besides, some people think they can't accept them. So, I think, there are people who suffer from their homosexuality. We should understand them more and shouldn't exclude them from society.  I agree with you. I think installation of 'gay and straight' traffic lights in Japan will lead to promote tolerance and legalize same-sex marriage.  I agree to your comment that this kind of tolerance may be necessary for public event but I think that it is necessary not only in Europe but also in all world.  I agree with you, because it is good way in order to think about homosexuality. So I want to try this tackling in Japan too.  I was surprised that there really exist gay and straight traffic lights. I don't have the idea of the same sex couples, so I doubt the necessary of this type of traffic lights. I don't criticize transgender , but I think that those traffic lights don't need.  I agree with you. I also think that it is good that the Australian society accepts gay, but this type of traffic lights have no utilities for the usual public.  This movement is interesting. It will help people become conscious of sexual minority, and make some of them tolerant of it. I think what is needed for same-sex couples to be accepted is general understanding and tolerance towards them, and these strange traffic lights will make a difference.  I think so. This campaign is likely to miss the primary function of signals. Keeping safety is more important than prevailing a new thought.  Certainly, like you, there are many people who don't have any bias against same-sex couples, but some people do. I think this movement is needed.  I agree with your comment. Homosexual people especially in Japan suffer from discrimination, so I think we should promote such movement as possible.  This traffic lights in Vienna are so interesting. And more interesting things is many pedestrians like this concept. We should promote this idea that same-sex couples are normal. But, I think some people oppose it in Japan. We Japanese should introduce this attempt, too.  I agree with you. This traffic signs is good for helping people be aware of sexual minority. But I think the icon adopted traffic signs should be more simple as well as the conventional one.  I think that this trend is good . Japan should promote this idea.  I agree with your opinion.  I was very surprised, too. We should imitate this idea and think more carefully about homosexuality. There is no discrimination This action is very fabulous. I didn't know gay and straight traffic lights. I think that this plan and this thought are very good and should be evaluated. However, people don't accepted same-sex  couples in Japan, especially. The task which we must do is to accept same-sex  couples.  I think this idea is very important for taking sexism away all over the world. Accepting gay officially is essential when we try to live in comfortable in the city.  I agree with the idea that Japan introduce that kind of device. In my opinion, Japan still ignorant of sexism.  I agree with you!Not only Austria people but also Japanese should accept these traffic lights someday.  It is very difficult to execute this trial in Japan. Since Japanese society don't accept gay couple. this idea is not bad. However, Japanese should add other function to traffic lights. It is to display number of seconds before turning the traffic light on the screen of traffic lights.  I agree with you. This idea will change prejudice of Austrian and people in the world. I pray that all people in the world will be able to live freely and happily.  I think Japan has to introduce this lights. This is because Japan has the bias to gender. If we introduce this, Japan can solve the gender problem.  I think so , too. If we introduce this lights, we can live in comfortable in the city.  I'm surprised to read this article . in many countries gays and lesbians are gradually accepted. However Japanese people still think these people negatively. I think we should be more liberal.  I agree with your idea. This idea will make Japan better.  when I read this title, I wonder if 'gay and straight ' traffic lights are needed. However, when I read this article, I think that in order that people gain the understanding for gay, the trial like this is necessary. Particularly in Japan it is hard for gay to be accepted by others, so I think that in Japan the trial like this should be done.  I think such movements in Europe are very strange and rational.  This signal is very unique and is the thing getting a lot of looks of the person watching it. Therefore it will be a chance to have people interest about homosexuality to increase these signals. And it will be the opportunity that homosexual is permitted worldwide.  I agree with you. I think also that we should spread such a movement in Japan. And I want to eliminate the prejudice against homosexuals.  I think about gay in generosity, and Austrians are think about gay in generosity too. I think that the idea of the signal of gay is grate!! I think that the racial discrimination is not good, because the people have various thoughts. We should treat gay like us.  I think so. Those people such as gay or lesbian in Japan should be accepted more.  I agree with you. I think this traffic light can induce accidents. They should promote the campaign in the other way.  I think this decreasing bias to same couple plan is interesting and very important concept. In Japan, this concept is not perfectly received. But it is going to usual in Japan too I think. Because, I heard the news that same couple is admitted in Shibuya, Tokyo When I read this article, It is interesting for me that gay or lesbian is accepted in many countries. So , I think that in Japan , they should be accepted though it is true that Japanese have the prejudice against them.  I remembered this news too when I read this article.  I think so , too. It is important for us to have flexible thinking because it is bad that we are stereotyped .  I think that this campaign is very good for both gay and straight. This is why we must pay attention to traffic signals traffic signals, so they are to attract the attention of all road users, both drivers and pedestrians. Probably people in public have few opportunities to know about gay. So, the interest in gay of people in public will be increased with an increase in this campaign. I think that it is important to deepen the understanding to gay before criticizing it.  I agree with the idea that we state the equality in traffic lights. It is true that new lights lead to waste of money. However, it's ""waste"" has great importance, I think. People have started to take actions against discriminations such as gay. But people haven't changed their way of thinking completely. They feel some sense of incongruity in their mind. Therefore, I think it is important to take in true equality in daily life. New traffic lights are good start! I was surprised at this news. But I think this is a good idea to have various kinds of signal lights, because we all should be treated equal. And by such a signals I think those people could feel better! I think this idea is so unique too. And this could get many people interested in those thing. But I'm not sure if we should install these system in Japan. Cause we don't like to change something.  I agree with your opinion. When I read this title, I was not able to imagine the contents of the sentence, too. If it was able to reduce accidents and also, people would be able to understand about gay more and more, it is very good idea of killing two birds with one stone, I think.  I think so, too. To produce such traffic lights our conscious are improved.  I think so , too. To produce such traffic lights, our conscious are improved.  I think this idea is so clever. In this world, there are various people and these days many people know about them who are same-sex couples and they think it is normal. But in Japan, not all people feel so. To know about them is the most important, I think.  I think that gay traffic lights are great. It's generally said that Japanese people understand little. Japanese government should install gay traffic lights for Japanese people to understand gay.  Although it's important to consider gender, for example bisexual or homosexual people and so on, it's not necessarily that pedestrian traffic lights depict various couples. I think there is another way.  I think so too. various people have various idea. When many people accept this idea, not only traffic problems but also social problems will go in a positive way.  I think so. I think we, Japanese people should consider various people, including homosexual people. We must need to discuss them.  Traffic lights of the same sex is an interesting idea. We should be the equal treatment to the all of the people. I do not know the plan of the equal treatment. If it plays in Japan, I do not see at the pubLic, so I think Japan carries on it openly.  I think so. This idea makes Japan more freely.  I agree with you. Japan should promote many things about homosexuals. We cannot discuss various things without them in this society.  From this article, I knew that there were varieties of lights in the world for the first time. I'm familiar with Japanese one, which has only red, yellow and green, so I expect that I won't be able to cross the road in Vienna easily. Also, I noticed that world people thought about the equality of same-sex couples seriously. The way of promoting it is indirect, I feel. However, the way is also close to citizens and clear for them. In Japan, few people think about sexual problems seriously, so these lights may be installed at Japan, more Japanese people will have interest in it, I think.  I also think it is a good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. I hadn't thought about the problems seriously, too, so I felt I must have think more about them. The thought that same-sex couples are normal may be achieved father in the future, but it is certainly going ahead to good direction, I think.  I couldn't also believe there were these lights normally. The idea is difficult for me, too, but I think that it is good way of promoting the perspective on sexual problems. Taking account of both your opinion and my opinion, it is certain that homosexuals' opinions is most important.  I think so too. Japanese people seem to be negative to homosexuality, so it cost us many time to get accustomed with the traffic signals.  I agree with your opinion. These days the world accepts homosexuality, so Japan should try to be positive such an action.  That is very good idea to set up these traffic rights. I think these lights enable sexual minority people to live comfortable lives. Now, People who is gay or lesbian are completely accepted in Japan. This traffic lights should be adopted in Japan.  I also think that it is desirable for these traffic light to be adopted in Japan. Maybe the idea that same-sex couple is normal will take root more in Japan.  It was not until I read the article that I knew the positive movement to promote tolerance for gay. I think that the campaign is great because traffic lights are seen by a lot of people, so the signals will be a chance to make many people feel gay of a minority to be familiar.  I think this is good idea to change some peoples' think that same-sex couple is strange, but this traffic lights is for gay couples. There should be more traffic lights for lesbian couples.  I agree with your opinion that Japanese government should install signals like Vienna! But, if such signals appeared quickly in the street, we may feel out of place.  I agree with you. Japan should promote so many things about homosexuals. So young people must discuss this topic.  There are many gays every country. I tend to agree with Australian new traffic system. They appear in public place so that gays are admitted in true meanings. Japan also should appreciate same-sex marriage.  I have a friend who are a sexually minority. She is really good girl and kind for every one but she cannot marry legally in Japan. I want Japanese government to make a low that she can marry with who she really loves. So I agree with this champaign because every one gets a chance to understand them.  I saw such the traffic lights represented a gay couple for the first time. I was surprised and think very interesting topic. I think the form of loving is free and recently, other countries have a positive thinking for same-sex  couples couples. The traffic lights are representing that world people think about same-sex  couple deeply. In Japan, a lot of people don't tend to think about that, and they are few chance that they can know same-sex  couple. I also don't know about same-sex  couple. I would like to study about this topic from this time.  I tend to agree your opinion. Japanese people don't have a chance thinking about same-sex couple and those people I think, so the government should try to do an action to promote this topic.  Your straight opinion is valuable . I also wonder this traffic light really promote equality. If this lights come to Japan, Japanese people confuse and may increase the accidents. They have become usual lights.  I agree with your opinion. I also think about the form of loving is free. But in Japan, we do not often see those people than other countries. I think Japanese society do not have the society which those people can live easily. The Japanese society should make the society which such people are easy to live more. The activity to make traffic lights is very meaningful to make such a society. So Japan should try to do such activity like other countries I agree with you. The lack of Japan is publication of gays. I also hope that they can marriage legally in Japan.  I think so too. For Japanese people, it is difficult to get a chance to know or understand them because many people don't make relationship with them. So, to get a chance to know spontaneously is important.  This was interesting and important topic to think about. Nowadays, people are more and more concerned about their freedom and rights. These rights includes same sex marriage. This topic is still very sensitive but we have to face it.  I don't think that Japan can solve the gender problem by introducing the traffic lights. Although they may help us be aware of the problem, it can't be solved by only doing so. With this as a start, we have to know about gay people. Then I think we should understand that there are various values and accept them.  The news recognized me to be a lot of types thinking. I can't understand but I think I should receive these people and I should be effort to understand these people.  I think it very good idea, but I feel something strange. If we respect all kind of gender and people, heterosexual people has to respected. Changing all traffic lights is too much.  I disagree with you about how to capture the way of installing new traffic sign. I think we should be more tolerant of homosexuality, but I think it is odd to adopt gay illustration in traffic signs.  I agree with your idea. In Japan, same-sex marriage isn't recognized yet, but the gay traffic lights are the first step for tolerance for the same-sex marriage.  This is very interesting idea showing Vienna's tolerance for gender. I also agreed it. Every time pedestrians walk through the crosswalks and see these new traffic lights, they will remember homosexual lovers. Then, whole society will become considerate. In addition, given that many ""likes"" on Facebook, people are satisfied to have taken part in this project by paying taxes. So these should be introduced into other areas.  You have a really good friend! The other day, same-sex couples were allowed to marry legally in America. This is wonderful news for her! Although Japan is conservative to this matters, I hope that she will be able to marry in Japan.  I agree to your opinion. In fact, the impact of advertising may be big. However, this should not be done with much money. There must be better way.  I haven't thought about homosexual couples well. These days, these couples have not been discriminated. However, understanding of them is not still enough. We have to know them more.  I agree with you. Japanese people should think about gay culture. Japanese people have prejudice idea about gay culture. Marriage of LGBT officially allowed in all states in the US. I believe that it should be allowed in Japan.  I agree with you. As a same-sex marriage was permitted in US , the kind of tolerance should be permitted all over the world.  I was very interested when I first read this news. Recently, allowance of homosexual has became the major topic in the world including America and Japan. Shibuya recently allowed homosexual marriage in the prefecture law. In addition, I found the way they connected road lights and homosexual problem very innovative. I think it is the first attempt to do it. I hope this will success to increase the awareness about both homosexual and road safety.  You are right. Knowledge makes understanding, and understanding makes tolerance.  Yes, we should think about the problem more.  Yes! This event is very interested news! Japan should suggest many idea for gay or LGBT or ect. . . However people recognized a gay in Shibuya! This event support by Shinzo Abe's wife! The day when a gay is recognized in Japan is not far.  It is a good idea! However, the interest in LGBT of people may fade when signals of LGBT increase and come common. I think that an idea with any other topicality of the signal is necessary.  As for the homosexuality, there are still a lot of people that the ""abnormality"" ""perversion"" word ""to be metamorphic"" appears on the head. In addition, there is really the person pouring such words for a homosexual. However, in the first place a human being is not a simple animal that an object to turn love to is limited to the opposite sex. I think that neighboring people should understand such a thing.  I see. It is question for us why Australian people can accept these strange traffic light. In Japan, it is unbelief to use these light and accept our society but we have to change these strange sense of value to make our society various.  I agree with your idea. This age is not same as that of old days. We should follow any situation as time passed. There are a lot of people who don't have the same idea as we about sex. We ought to receive them for their comfortable life.  I agree with your opinion. We can not discuss social problem without gay problem. Japanese people do not know a lot about gay people and have a prejudice. So these traffic lights might be really good opportunity to think about gay people.  I agree with you. This movement is efficient because almost everyone looks signals every day. But, I worry that some look the lights curiously and just for fun. I hope same-sex marriage is allowed in Japan.  I agree with you. Homosexuals are now discriminated in Japanese society.  I don't know that there are some kinds of traffic rights that give people messages to think about homosexual until finish reading this article. I think these kinds of traffic rights are interesting and enable people to think about diversity of sexual reference. People often despise homosexual people. That may be an infringement of human rights. Therefore, people should accept homosexuality I think it could be the good opportunity that we accept LGBT, too.  I think people around the world pays attention to this topic because US Supreme Court judged same-sex marriage is reasonable right in the Constitution. I think the world is in the stream judging homosexual love. But some people opposes it because of religion and etc. Maybe it will be a long time to judge homosexual around the world. Love doesn't relate to sex.  Your opinion made me think about this news more deeply! Indeed they may induce accidents. But I don't agree with your thought that they are not related to promotion of equality. By the mass media or SNS, these unique traffic rights will become a topic of conversation. This is great step.  I agree you. Japanese people don't have opportunities that they think about gay and gay is not accepted. Therefore we should introduce this gay and traffic light and attract attention.  I agree with your opinion about last sentences especially. Today, the public opinion in Japan is still strict for homosexual. Although I don't know this ideology is right, this ideology is received acceptance for the world more.  I agree with your opinion. It is important to discuss the problem, thereby it will resolve.  I think so too because gay culture do not spread in Japan. However, recently I often see such people in TV etc. So the example like article should be accepted in Japan.  I agree with you and have the same opponent. Such idea is good in reducing the sexual discrimination and attracting passenger's attention. Last month, I heard a piece of news about same-sex marriage is admitted in America. I want this movement to spread around the world.  I do not know that kind of movements are taken place. In Japan, there are few people who care about that kind of problem. We have to know that kind of people are worry about their treatment. We have to acknowledge and recognize these problems.  I think so too. we Japanese are a little too indifferent this issue.  We usually don't think the right of gays, so it is revolutionary idea that they use traffic lights that all people see every day for campaign. Actually, in these days, it seems that the campaign of the right of homosexuality is stimulating. For instance, same-sex marriage has just accepted in all states in America.  I agree with your opinion. ""straight"" people sometimes have bias against ""gay"" people. However, through like these campaign, it can make people pay attention to gay and deepen people's understanding to gay, and people won't criticize them unreasonably.  This idea has 2 sides, pro and con. It can be seen as a discrimination since we separate lights from the normal ones. It also shows that we have understanding about particular sexual propensity. It may work well in Austria, but if it were installed into Japan, I don't think so, being that some of us still think that the LGBTs are not in our company I agree with your opinion. However, it is true that there are people of LGBT in the world since it is proved biologically that 1NA% of human are to be born as LGBT, so we will have to consider about this issue in some time.  I agree that this kind of idea is not familiar for Japanese people, but I think most people will not be opposed to this if this happens in Japan. It is because I remembered the news that people make their profile pictures rainbow on facebook after gay marriage becomes completely legal in the United States. I see a lot of my Japanese friends did it.  I've got different point of view on this your opinion. I don't think gay culture is not received perfectly in Japan. I have a friend who are gay. but he accept all people who are around him. we have to make opportunity which is gay such as him become famous. Even if it is change traffic right  I agree with your idea. In the U. S , the same sex couples were allowed to marry with. This trend is important and we should speed this trend all over the world.  Thank you for your comment. I didn't think that the traffic lights will promoted by SNS. I rethink that it is useful to promote equality, but I also think that the traffic lights may be made a fool of on SNS.  I think that Japan should take this plan because sexual problems are happening now. I allows us to recognize particular sexual propensity.  I think this event was wonderful. Japan has positively progressed the problem of LGBT, but it is still lag. We should get the understanding of LGBT and prepare new system for them after deep deliberation.  I think so. Certainly, this idea is very unique and good idea. Though the idea is effective Austria because Austria is tolerance for guy couple. It is not effective much in Japan which is not tolerance for guy couple.  I think so , too. I think it is an important thing in the coming world to recognize homosexuality all over the world.  I think so too. Before, I didn't know about the gay culture. But recently, I found there are many people who is gay on TV. So we may should import this traffic signals.  I agree with you. Japan is far behind other developed country such as US in the understanding of the LGBT. Recently, states are considering legalizing same-sex  marriage. Meanwhile, The Shibuya ward has become the first place in Japan to recognize same-sex  partnerships. Although, we also acknowledge the developing.  I think so , too. Japan also tackle homosexuals problems.  I think so , too. And this problem is more difficult than we think. It is most important thing to know more about this problem. So what now Japanese society will become acceptance or not, we must be careful.  I think so too. In Japan, homosexual is not accepted. We should make comfortable society for homosexual.  WE should THINK DIFFERENCE BETWEEN NORMAL AND OTHER COUPLES . BUT I THINK THAT WE SHOULD NOT THINK THIS DEEPLY.  I agree with your opinion. I think that little Japanese people have the understandings for same-sex couple because they don't have the chance. Therefore, like vienna, Japanese government should do the similar trial and gradually gain the consensus.  When I read this article for the first time, I was very surprised at the picture of signal. I have not seen the signals like this picture in Japan. These days, the problem of homosexual is increasing. I think it is important for us to think about this problem.  I agree your opinion. As you know, It is obvious that Japanese don't know the same-sex couples . I think we should learn the problem of homosexual more and look at the positive side of the problem. Of course, I also want to know the problem taking this as an opportunity.  I think so too. This movement will be make Japan an equal society if Japan accepts this system.  I was surprised when I read this article for the first time. But the movement is extremely nice because the rights of both normal couples and gay couples are equal.  I agree with you. I think also Japan should accept same-sex marriage system.  I also think people around the world pas attention to this topic!! When I heard the news of the legalization of the same-sex marriage in all state of America, I remembered this topic. Many Japanese people don't think this topic deeply. I also was. I'm glad to have a chance to think about this.  I agree with the way of installing new traffic signs. This problem has not been aware of recently. It is time that we should be more tolerant of homosexuality. We can't laugh at people who are not straight.  I agree with you about installing new traffic sign. I think discrimination consciousness to same sex should be lost.  I think it is fair. We should to be fair to all people I agree with your opinion. We should think these people.  I am opposed to your opinion. Because there is a possibility that the declining birthrate and aging population. Marriage with the opposite sex is I should think of law of nature. Same-sex marriage it should refrain because it may also be a problem in the religious. It might be some people that do not have to put up in people But not ginger. Also in Japan exist opinion like that.  When I was in New Zealand there was a homo-sexual day and we did some activities to accept homosexual people like ATM on the street was re-painted to ""gAyTM"". For me that activity was so impressive because as you know Japan still take disadvantage on same gender marriage and many people sometimes do not accept homo-sexual people. but I thought, if we do some activities for them, it already recognized them as different. if we really think we should recognize them as normal, I mean same as others, we should not do anything special. We should only make a law for their comfortable lives. I do not disagree to spend tax on doing such kind of activities, but more people do some special things for homosexual people more they might feel uncomfortable.  I think it is a great challenge to capture many people's attention about gay. This is one of the biggest topic and trend all over the world nowadays. As you know, same sex marriage is now legal in all states in the US. Before that, only a few states allowed same sex marriage so lots of people came to the states to marry. Many people were waited this so there were lots of celebrations everywhere. And it was a big trend that Facebook users changed their profile picture to one with a rainbow filter to celebrate the new law in the US. According to these trends, many people are very positive about gay. It is very delightful change that we are allowed to have the equally right to love someone even if he or she is the same sex and allowed to open it. This change is spreading in many countries like the US and European countries, but I think gay people still hard to live to open that they are gay. Recently, it is getting better environmental for gay people than before. For example, we see more famous people on TV who are gay and sexless clothes are trend now. However, there are still discriminations and I think there are more discriminations in Japan than the US. One of may gay friends told me that he can tell that he is a gay to his American friends but he doesn't want to tell Japanese friends because he is afraid of a prejudice. I think nothing wrong to love someone and they should open it like straight people do. I hope Japan will be the comfortable place for gay people too. "
ACA ACA-B2K-001 3.12 "SINGULARITY STRUCTURE It has been seen that singularities inevitably occur in the solutions describing the interaction region of colliding plane waves. Using the line element (6.20), we have in this region  (8.1) where f(u) and g(v) are monotonically decreasing functions for positive arguments. It is therefore inevitable that some kind of singularity will occur on the hypersurface f + g = 0. It can also be seen from (6.17), that this is the hypersurface on which the two opposing waves mutually focus each other, as the contraction of each wave here becomes unbounded. This was anticipated by the discussion in Section 5.3. It is now appropriate to consider whether the caustics formed in this way correspond to mere coordinate singularities, or whether they are necessarily curvature singularities as they are in the Khan-Penrose solution. It has also been pointed out previously that coordinate singularities necessarily occur in the regions II and III that contain the approaching waves. The character and significance of these singularities must also be considered in this chapter. 8.1 Singularities According to the general theory of relativity, space-time is represented by a connected C ∞ Hausdorff manifold M together with a locally Lorentz metric g . A singularity in the space-time is indicated by incomplete geodesics or incomplete curves of bounded acceleration (Hawking and Ellis, 1973). By definition, space-time is smooth and does not contain any irregular points. It follows that a singularity may normally be considered as occurring only at a boundary of space-time. Unfortunately, no single definition of a singularity has yet been found which is applicable to all situations. One of the more useful ways of attaching a boundary to a singular space-time is by a b (bundle) -boundary construction. The b -boundary  is the projection into a space-time of a natural boundary attached to a higher-dimensional Riemannian manifold. In the standard b -boundary construction, the Riemannian manifold is the bundle of frames over space-time having a positive definite metric induced by the affine connection. Boundary points of the frame bundle are determined by giving end points to all Cauchy sequences which do not converge in the frame bundle. The bundle boundary is then projected down to make a boundary for the space-time. According to the classification scheme devised by Ellis and Schmidt (1977), singularities in maximal, four-dimensional space-times can be divided into three basic types: quasiregular, non-scalar curvature and scalar curvature. This scheme describes the singularity structure of a space-time  on which the Riemann tensor is C k . It uses a b -boundary construction to determine the location of singular points. If the b -boundary is non-empty, there are only two possibilities. Either a point q in the b -boundary may be a  regular boundary point if the space-time  can be embedded in a larger space-time  such that the Riemann tensor is C r and q is an interior point in , or it may be a  singular boundary point if the space-time  is not extendable through q in a  way. A singular boundary point q can then be classified according to this scheme. It may be a C k (or C k- )quasiregular singularity if all components of the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives evaluated in an orthonormal frame parallel propagated along an incomplete geodesic ending at q are C (or C 0- ). Such frames are called PPON frames. It may alternatively be a C k (or C k- ) curvature singularity if this is not true. In this case it may either be categorized as a C k (or C k- )non-scalar curvature singularity if all scalars in the metric tensor , the alternating symbol , the Riemann tensor and its first k derivatives are bounded, that is, tend to a C (or C -) function. Alternatively, it may be a C k (or C k- )scalar curvature singularity or a scalar polynomial curvature singularity if some scalar does not tend to a C (or C -) function. The most familiar class of singularities are the scalar curvature singularities. These include the ‘big bang’ and ‘black hole’types of singularity which closely correspond to one's intuitive concept of a real physical singularity. As such a singularity is approached, some physical quantities diverge and all observers feel unbounded tidal forces. The non-scalar curvature and quasiregular singularities are much less well understood and have been less fully investigated. Consider, for example, a space-time with a non-scalar curvature singularity. No curvature scalars diverge in this case, yet some components of the Riemann tensor evaluated in a PPON frame along an incomplete curve do not tend to  finite limits as the singularity is approached. The physical effect of this is that all test particles which fall into the non-scalar curvature singularity feel infinite tidal forces, but observers can move arbitrarily close to the singularity on other curves and feel no untoward effects. Finally, consider a space-time with a quasiregular singularity. In all reasonable frames the Riemann tensor is completely finite. In this case, observers near a quasiregular singularity, including those who fall into the singularity itself, do not feel unbounded tidal forces. All three types of singularity are found in colliding plane wave solutions. In the following sections and chapters the singularity and global structure of particular solutions will be analysed in more detail. The singularity in region IV In the exact solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) described in Chapter 3, there is a scalar curvature singularity in region IV on the hypersurface . However, it is not clear whether or not this type of singularity will occur in other solutions, particularly as the Khan-Penrose solution contains impulsive gravitational waves. This question has been considered by Szekeres (1972), who found that, for colliding gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization, a curvature singularity is inevitable. This work was generalized by Sbytov (1976) to plane gravitational waves with arbitrary polarization, with the same result. However, more recently, counterexamples to these conclusions have been obtained, in the non-aligned case by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986c), and in the aligned case by a degenerate solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987b) and by the algebraically general solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez (1989). In these cases, the curvature scalars remain bounded on the hypersurface , and scalar polynomial curvature singularities occur in the extensions of the solution through the focusing singularity. These exceptional cases will be considered in detail later on. For the present, it may simply be observed that Szekeres and Sbytov had omitted to include these cases. Another counterexample proposed by Stoyanov (1979) has proved to be incorrect as it does not satisfy the required boundary conditions (see Section 10.2). The same question applied to colliding electromagnetic waves is more complicated, and the answers are less conclusive. Generally, one may expect that, for a combination of gravitational and electromagnetic waves, a curvature singularity in region IV will usually occur. However, for purely electromagnetic waves it is less clear. In the first exact solution of this  type, given by Bell and Szekeres (1974), the singularity on the hypersurface  was shown to be only a coordinate singularity that could easily be removed by a coordinate transformation. This solution, which is conformally flat in the interaction region, will be described in Chapter 14 together with the full analysis of its singularity structure as given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). Other type D electrovac solutions have been obtained by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987a) and Papacostas and Xanthopoulos (1988). Further algebraically general solutions without curvature singularities can easily be constructed as will be indicated in Section 17.2. All these have quasiregular singularities that are interpreted as Cauchy horizons on the surface . These will be described later. We may conclude that, in all cases, the opposing waves mutually focus each other onto the hypersurface , on which the contraction of the waves is unbounded and the line element (6.20) is singular. Usually this will be a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, but a large class of  significant exceptions occurs. It is convenient to point out at this stage that, for colliding gravitational and electromagnetic waves, two of the scalar polynomial invariants (Penrose and Rindler, 1986) are given by  (8.2) It follows from this that, in order to prove the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity, it is sufficient merely to show that the component 2 is unbounded. In this case either I or J must be unbounded, and a curvature singularity occurs. It would, of course, be useful to have a number of general theorems that could be used to determine the singularity structure of particular classes of solutions. Apart from the earlier results of Szekeres (1972) and Sbytov (1976), the only general theorem to date is that of Tipler (1980). This is in fact a straightforward generalization of a theorem of Penrose (1965b)(see also Hawking and Ellis 1973, p.263). Quoting it directly: Theorem 8.1 (Tipler)Let (M, g) be a space-time with g at least C 2 , and suppose (M, g) has two globally defined commuting space-like Killing vector fields δ x and δ y which together generate plane symmetry. If,(1) the null convergence condition holds;(2) at least one of the six quantities  is non-zero at some point p in (M, g); and (3) through the point p there is a space-like partial Cauchy surface S, which is everywhere tangent to δ x and δ y , and S is non-compact in the space-like direction normal to δ x and δ y ; then (M, g) is null incomplete. This is an interesting theorem which seems to prove the existence of singularities for a large class of colliding plane waves. However, it requires that the metric be at least C 2 everywhere. It thus excludes situations involving impulsive gravitational waves. It does not apply therefore to the solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971), Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ), and the exceptional solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Nor does it apply to the colliding electromagnetic wave solution of Bell and Szekeres (1974) in which impulsive gravitational waves are generated by the collision. In addition, it proves only geodesic incompleteness and says nothing about curvature singularities. There exists, however, a very large class of exceptional solutions in which curvature singularities do not occur. For gravitational waves these include a degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987b) solution and the solution of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986b), which are respectively parts of the Schwarzschild and Kerr space-times. These have been described in more detail by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988), and will be described in Sections 10.5 and 13.3. They contain impulsive wave components, and therefore do not satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. In all these solutions, the singularity that occurs when  corresponds to a Cauchy horizon. This may be followed by either a space-like, or a time-like curvature singularity. The latter case would indicate that, if it were possible for real observers to pass through the horizon, then most would miss this singularity. A further class of exceptional vacuum solutions in which the curvature singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon has been obtained by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989). These solutions contain a subclass in which the approaching waves have smooth wave fronts and the metric is everywhere at least C 2 . They thus satisfy the conditions of Tipler's theorem. They are geodesically incomplete, but the focusing hypersurface in this case is only a quasiregular singularity. These solutions thus illustrate the fact that a proof of null incompleteness does not necessarily imply the existence of a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. The Killing-Cauchy horizons that occur in these solutions have particular significance as the caustics formed by the mutual focusing of the opposing waves. They have also been further investigated by Yurtsever (1987), who has shown that they are unstable against plane-symmetric perturbations. It is therefore reasonable to conclude that the existence of space-like singularities is likely to be a generic feature of colliding plane wave solutions. This conclusion is also supported by the work of Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1987 b ), who have shown that the presence of an arbitrarily small amount of dust will change a horizon into a curvature singularity. In these exceptional cases, it is necessary for the approaching waves to take very specific forms in order to achieve the appropriate solution in region IV. The instability of the horizons in these solutions can easily be demonstrated in that they require very specific forms for the initial functions f(u) and g(v) . Any slight variation in these functions would change the Cauchy horizon into a curvature singularity. Most of the exceptional solutions that have been explicitly obtained are of algebraic type D, although the solutions of Feinstein and Ibañez are algebraically general. Perhaps it should also be remarked that algebraic type D solutions do not necessarily have horizons rather than singularities, a counterexample being one of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 b ) solutions. An alternative proof of Tipler's Theorem 8.1 has been given by Yurtsever (1988 b ). This emphasizes the role and necessity of the assumption of a strict plane symmetry. In this approach, the exceptional solutions that have Killing-Cauchy horizons in the interaction region do not satisfy the condition of strict plane symmetry as defined by Yurtsever. The structure of the singularity in the interaction region has been further analysed by Yurtsever (1988 c , 1989 a ), who has shown that the metric is asymptotic to an inhomogeneous Kasner solution as the singularity is approached. Initially (Yurtsever 1988 c ), he considered the case when the approaching waves have constant aligned polarization and obtained explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data posed along the wave fronts of the approaching waves. From these expressions it is clear that, for specific choices of initial data, the curvature singularity formed by the interacting waves degenerates to a coordinate singularity. It can also be concluded that these Killing-Cauchy horizons are unstable against small but generic perturbations of the initial data and that, in a very precise sense, ‘generic’ initial data always produce all-embracing space-like curvature singularities. In the subsequent paper (Yurtsever, 1989 a ), he has shown that these same conclusions are also reached in the case when the polarization of the approaching waves is arbitrary. The Khan-Penrose solution The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971) which has already been discussed in detail in Chapter 3, may now be reconsidered. It was shown there in particular, that the scalar invariants are unbounded on the hypersurface  in region IV, where  and . This clearly demonstrates the existence of a scalar curvature singularity on this hypersurface. In addition to this, there are apparent coordinate singularities  extending from it into regions II and III. The naive singularity structure of this solution is thus as represented in Figure 3.2. It is now necessary to consider in more detail the character of the apparent singularities in these initial regions II and III. As described in Section 3.3, if it is possible for real particles to pass through them, then it will be possible for those particles to subsequently look back and observe the naked singularity in region IV. If correct, this would provide a counterexample to the cosmic censorship hypothesis. It is more likely, however, that these singularities will prove to be more than artificial coordinate singularities that particles can pass through. Figure 8.1 Sections through surfaces v = constant,y = 0, when u = 0, for three different (negative) values of v . Figure 8.2 Sections through the surface v = constant,y = 0, for three different values of u . This question has been discussed in an interesting paper by Matzner and Tipler (1984). Because of the obvious symmetry, we may concentrate on the singularity in region II. The first point to note is that, since the initial waves are impulsive, the interiors of both regions I and II are flat. For , curvature only occurs on the null boundary . The line elements for regions I and II are respectively  (8.3). (8.4) That these both describe flat space-time can be demonstrated by transforming (8.4) to the form (8.3) by putting . (8.5) It may be observed that the coordinate singularity  is effectively removed by this transformation, and there appears no a priori reason preventing the continuation of the coordinates  through it. Figure 8.3 Surfaces v = constant,y = 0,, for different (negative) values of v . Notice that the line  is common to all surfaces. Matzner and Tipler proceed to investigate the properties of the null hypersurfaces v = constant, working with the null Minkowski coordinates . Projections of these hypersurfaces are illustrated in Figures 8.1, 8.2 and 8.3. It can be seen that as  the curvature of these hypersurfaces diverges. It should also be noticed that the surfaces v = constant, considered as embedded in the three-space , consist of nested two-surfaces all having the line  in common. It is then possible show that the hypersurface  is not merely a coordinate singularity, but is actually a singularity of space-time in the sense that there does not exist a C 1 extension from region II to this surface. This can not be a curvature singularity, since the curvature tensor on it is zero. Matzner and Tipler accordingly describe it as a ‘fold singularity’. With this interpretation, the structure of the Khan-Penrose solution is thus as described in Figure 8.4. This result raises another problem. In the absence of the second wave, the entire space-time may be described by (8.3) for , and by (8.4) for , for all values of v . In this case, is merely a coordinate singularity. It has no physical significance and can be removed by a coordinate transformation. However, once the second wave is present, with wavefront , the above result states that  becomes a space-time singularity even for . This seems to violate our familiar concept of causality. The presence of the second wave seems to change the character of the prior singularity. Figure 8.4 The singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution. The resolution of this problem can be demonstrated using Figure 8.3. The family of surfaces for v = constant can be continued up to. However, there is a curvature singularity at . The final surface , which forms a bound for the prior surfaces, therefore contains a singularity on the line . In fact, this line  is actually common to the entire family of surfaces for which . Thus the line  must be considered as a singularity of space-time, which is identified with the point . In the Khan-Penrose solution, the singularities in regions II and III are topological singularities that are identified with the curvature singularity in region IV by the particular choice of coordinates. This point may be further clarified by considering a family of null geodesics that are initially parallel in region I, and enter region II. The null geodesic ,v = constant, starts in region I, passes through the gravitational wave and apparently ends at the  singularity. This may be contrasted, however, with a neighbouring geodesic which is given using  the null Minkowski coordinates defined by (8.5), by . This geodesic is given by . (8.6) From this it is clear that v increases indefinitely as  even for arbitrarily small values of ε. Thus, although the geodesic with   approaches the ‘fold singularity’ apparently at a finite distance from the curvature singularity in region IV, an arbitrarily close geodesic that is initially parallel to it in region II diverges from it and crosses into region IV before it reaches the hypersurface . This geodesic subsequently terminates in the curvature singularity in region IV. The projection of these two geodesics onto the plane  is illustrated in Figure 8.5. Figure 8.5 Projections of two neighbouring null geodesics onto the plane . The geodesics are parallel and arbitrarily close in region II, which is flat. It has thus been argued that the singularities  and  in regions II and III are essentially extensions of the singularity  in region IV. The apparent non-causality that appears in the introduction of these singularities is a consequence of the projection of the space-time onto the plane . Such a projection does not in general preserve causal relations. Although Figure 8.4 is very useful in formulating the colliding plane wave problem by dividing the space-time up into appropriate regions, in many ways it is misleading. In particular, it does not adequately describe the singularity structure of the solution, which appears to be non-causal. The problem arises from the attempt to represent space-time on a two-dimensional diagram. In many ways it would be preferable to attempt to picture a three-dimensional structure as in Figure 8.3. Such a picture has been drawn by Penrose, and was included in the paper of Matzner and Tipler (1984). This structure is illustrated in Figure 8.6 where the four regions are separately represented. Since curvature occurs only on the boundaries of regions I, II and III, the differently shaped boundaries of these regions have to be identified artificially. Region IV is curved and no adequate representation of it can be given. Using the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977), it can be seen that the singularity in region IV of the Khan-Penrose solution is  clearly a scalar polynomial curvature singularity. Also the fold singularities in regions II and III that have a topological character, are quasiregular singularities since on them the curvature tensor is zero. Figure 8.6 A three-dimensional picture of the Khan-Penrose solution with . The interiors of regions I, II and III are flat, but the boundaries have intrinsically different geometry. Points on opposite sides of the wavefronts  and  must be identified. Region IV is curved, so its representation should be considered no more than schematic. The structure of other solutions In the previous section the singularity structure of the Khan-Penrose solution has been analysed in some detail. This has been possible because the interiors of regions I, II and III are all flat. In the general problem, however, it is only the background region I that is taken to be flat, and regions II and III, as well as IV, are curved. Consequently it is not possible in general to analyse the singularity structure in such detail. It is reasonable to assume, however, that most colliding plane wave solutions will have the same general singularity structure as that of the Khan Penrose solution. This in fact turns out to be the case, as will be shown here and in the following chapters. In almost all cases a curvature singularity develops in region IV on the hypersurface , although there is a large class of exceptional solutions in which the singularity is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. These exceptional solutions provide the  only significant variation of the general singularity structure described above. The structure of these solutions will be described as they are derived in the following chapters. It has also been shown that, for all colliding plane wave solutions, coordinate singularities necessarily occur in regions II and III. For vacuum solutions, in these regions at most one component, either 4 or 0, of the curvature tensor is non-zero. Scalar polynomial curvature singularities therefore cannot occur. The coordinate singularities on the hypersurfaces  and  may thus either be quasiregular singularities if the curvature tensor on these surfaces is bounded, or they must be non-scalar curvature singularities if the curvature components become unbounded. It will now be argued that the topological ‘fold’ singularities of regions II and III in the Khan-Penrose solution, are also general features of all colliding plane wave solutions. Figure 8.7 The singularity structure for colliding sandwich gravitational waves. The shaded regions have non-zero curvature. If the approaching waves are ‘sandwich’ gravitational waves, then the regions behind the waves are flat. These flat regions must be described by metrics that are equivalent to those of the Khan-Penrose solution for regions II and III. After all, the impulsive waves considered by Khan and Penrose may be regarded as idealizations of such waves. In these cases similar ‘fold’ singularities will occur, as described in Figure 8.7. These singularities in regions II and III have been more thoroughly investigated by Konkowski and Helliwell (1989). By concentrating on the Szekeres (1972) family of solutions, they have shown that these are quasiregular singularities in the classification scheme of Ellis and Schmidt (1977) in the cases of impulsive and sandwich waves. In the alternative case of thick gravitational waves, they are non-scalar curvature singularities. In addition, by considering scalar wave perturbations in the impulsive  wave case, they have also shown that the quasiregular singularities are unstable and convert to scalar curvature singularities. To consider further the general character of these coordinate singularities in regions II and III we may concentrate on region II. The metric in this region may be taken to be of the form (6.20), but with the metric functions U ,V ,W and M all depending on u only. These functions may be obtained from those in region I simply by replacing g by ½, or v by 0. Considering the geodesics in this region, it is clear that there exist three conserved momentum components p x ,p y and p v besides the energy integral. These are given by  (8.7) where ε may be taken to be 0 on null geodesics and 1 on time-like geodesics. Using (8.7), we obtain the equation  (8.8) Expressions for U and M in region II can be obtained from (7.2) and (7.8) in the form  (8.9) With these,(8.8) may be integrated to give  (8.10) It may immediately be seen from this that no time-like or null geodesics with either p x or p y non-zero can avoid crossing the surface  into  region IV before reaching the surface on which . The only exception occurs when . This clearly manifests the character of the fold singularity as described in the previous section. In colliding plane wave problems, what is essentially a coordinate singularity for a single wave is transformed into a fold singularity prior to the collision by the presence of curvature singularities at the points  and . Generally these are associated with a space-like singularity on , but as described above, there are exceptional cases in which this singularity is replaced by a horizon. However, even in these cases, it is found that there exist at least distribution valued singularities just at these points. From this, it may be argued that the presence of fold singularities in regions II and III appears to be a general feature of colliding plane wave problems. It has thus been argued that the general structure of all colliding plane wave solutions is as illustrated in Figure 8.6 with  with the possible exception that, for some solutions, the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon. Figure 8.8 The general structure of colliding plane wave solutions related to the initial hypersurface on which initial Cauchy data is set. It is also appropriate to attempt to relate this general singularity structure to some initial hypersurface on which the initial Cauchy data for the colliding wave problem is specified. To do this it is necessary to incorporate the properties of plane waves that have been described in Section 4.4 and illustrated in Figure 4.1. In particular, it must be noted that no global space-like hypersurface exists on which initial Cauchy data for the problem can be set. The existence of the topological ‘fold’ singularities in regions II and III implies bounds for the initial Cauchy  hypersurface in both of the directions from which the waves emerge. This property is illustrated in Figure 8.8. It can immediately be deduced from Figure 8.8 that, for solutions in which the curvature singularity in region IV is replaced by a Cauchy horizon, any possible extension through this horizon must be non-unique. Any extended space-time beyond this singularity will depend on extra initial data in addition to that specified on the initial Cauchy hypersurface for the colliding wave problem. The above arguments lead to the conclusion that the usual initial data for colliding plane waves leads to a unique solution only up to the topological singularities  and  in regions II and III, and to the ‘focusing’ singularity  in the interaction region. This focusing singularity is normally a curvature singularity, but this may be replaced by a Cauchy horizon. In this case, any future extension through the horizon is non-unique."
ACA ACA-B2K-003 3.66 "OTHER VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH ALIGNED POLARIZATION The solutions of Khan and Penrose (1971) and of Szekeres (1970, 1972), discussed in Chapters 3 (and Section 8.2) and 9, describe the collision of plane gravitational waves with aligned linear polarization. It is convenient to consider separately in this chapter a number of other exact solutions that satisfy this same condition. A general method In situations in which the approaching waves are linearly polarized, and their polarization vectors are aligned, it is possible to put  globally. In this case the line element (6.20), and the field equations (6.22a-f) take a particularly simple form. Equation (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give (6.24) and there is only one main equation, namely (9.3), which is a linear equation in V . For any given solution of this equation, a function M can always be found satisfying the remaining equations (6.22b, c, f), although such a function may not satisfy the required boundary conditions. The integral (6.24) involves two continuous functions  and  that are monotonically decreasing for positive arguments. As suggested by Szekeres (1972), it is therefore possible to use these as coordinates in region IV, although care has to be taken at the boundaries and it is not possible to extend these coordinates into the prior regions II and III. Using (7.8), the line element in the interaction region can thus be written in the form  (10.1) and the main equation (9.3) becomes . (10.2) which is the well-known Euler-Poisson-Darboux equation. For any particular solution of (10.2), the new function S can be found by integrating equations (7.9), which now become  (10.3) In order for any particular solution to be appropriate to describe colliding plane waves, the function S must satisfy the conditions described in equations (7.10) to (7.13). Using this notation, the components of the Weyl tensor are given by the expressions  (10.4) It can thus be seen that, although (10.2) is linear so that different solutions for V can be superposed, the associated gravitational waves cannot be simply superposed. In addition, the scale factors A and B satisfying (6.13) and (6.14) must contain components of S , and from (10.3) it can be seen that these components are also non-linear in V . Once a solution of (10.2) and (10.3) describing the interaction region IV is obtained, the approaching waves in regions II and III can immediately be deduced. For example, in region II, we simply put  and assume that f takes the form . Then, removing the constant from S , it is convenient to put  (10.5) and the approaching wave is then given by  (10.6) The approaching wave in region III is obtained in exactly the same way in terms of the function . In order to obtain exact solutions, the first step is to obtain a general class of solutions of (10.2). Szekeres (1972) has indicated how to integrate  this equation using Riemann's method, and has given a general solution expressed as a line integral involving a Legendre function of order -½. This will be described in Chapter 14. However, because it is very difficult in practice to evaluate the integrals which this method involves, this does not turn out to be a convenient method for obtaining explicit solutions. As an alternative approach, it may be observed that attempting to solve equation (10.2) by separating the variables leads to the solution  (10.7) where A and J are arbitrary constants. Thus a general class of solutions can be obtained by considering  (10.8) for arbitrary sequences of constants σsub i and A i . The particular decomposition (10.8), however, does not turn out to be particularly convenient in the construction of explicit solutions. We will therefore proceed by changing the coordinates. Before introducing a new set of coordinates, it may be noted in passing that Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered an alternative coordinate system and have expanded a general solution in a different way involving Bessel and Neumann functions of zero order. Their approach will be described in Section 10.7. The appropriate technique is to consider transformations of the basic functions f and g which are here treated as coordinates. It turns out to be convenient to put  (10.9) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting ,. (10.10) With this, it may be noted that  (10.11) and t and z can be expressed in terms of f and g by  (10.12) The boundaries of region IV are now the hypersurfaces on which , and the focusing hypersurface in this region occurs when . Thus, to correspond to the interaction region, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . Using these coordinates, the main equation (10.2) becomes  (10.13) A general class of solutions of (10.13) can now be obtained by considering variable separable solutions of the form . (10.14) With this,(10.13) reduces to the pair of Legendre equations  (10.15) and a class of solutions of (10.13) can be expressed as a sum of products  (10.16) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds respectively, and a n ,q n ,Pn and b n are series of arbitrary constants. In general, of course , Legendre functions of non-integer order may also be included. The Legendre functions of integer order are well known, but it may still be appropriate to note just the first few. (10.17) It may easily be shown that the solutions of Khan and Penrose, and of Szekeres are included in this class. The Khan-Penrose solution uses ,(10.18) and the Szekeres solution (9.4) generalizes this to  (10.19) It may be noted that the Legendre functions of the second kind  are all singular when . The singularity  occurs when , and thus can be seen to be associated with the focusing singularity in region IV. In fact, in order to satisfy the boundary conditions, at least one Legendre function of the second kind must be included in the solution of (10.13). This may easily be demonstrated by substituting only the products of Legendre functions of the first kind into the condition (7.15), which can not then be satisfied. Another solution of (10.13) can be obtained by considering separable solutions involving a sum rather than the product (10.14). This leads to the solution  (10.20) where a is an arbitrary constant. This can immediately be seen to be the obvious solution  which, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner metrics as will be shown in the next section. This term may be added to the sum (10.16). A further solution of (10.2), or (10.13) is given by  (10.21) where c and d are arbitrary constants. In fact a series of solutions of this type can be used having different values of c and d . Thus a different representation of the solution of (10.13) can be written in the form  (10.22) Alternatively terms from the sum (10.22) may also be added to those of (10.16). However, as will be shown in (10.68), some of these terms may also be expressed in terms of products of Legendre functions, and so are already included in (10.16). It may be noted in passing that particular terms of this type have been included by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) in the class of solutions that will be described in Section 10.7. Having obtained an expression for V as any combination of the terms (10.16),(10.20) and (10.22), it is then necessary to integrate (10.3) to  obtain S . These equations may conveniently be rewritten in terms of the coordinates and defined by (10.9) in the form . (10.23) However,V is now so general that no complete integral for S has yet been found. Instead, we proceed by discussing the particular cases that have been obtained. The non-singular ‘solution’ of Stoyanov We may now consider a paper of Stoyanov (1979) in which he claimed to have obtained a solution without singularities. His method was to look for a regular solution of the field equations in region IV, and then to obtain the global solution simply by requiring that the metric coefficients be continuous across the boundaries. The solution he presented for region IV has the line element  (10.24) where a is an arbitrary constant. This clearly uses  (10.25) which does not satisfy the boundary conditions (7.3) which require that f and g must be smooth functions. In fact, it has been shown by Nutku (1981) that the discontinuities in the derivatives of f and g on the boundaries of region IV indicate the presence of an infinite discontinuity in the Ricci tensor on these hypersurfaces. Thus, although (10.24) is a vacuum solution inside region IV, it cannot be a global vacuum solution describing the collision of purely gravitational waves. It may also be observed that, with the positive signs in (10.24) and (10.25),f and g are increasing functions that are inconsistent with (7.13). Such a possibility can only arise if the impulsive components of the matter tensor occurring on the boundary of region IV have negative energy density. It is in this way that the singularity has been removed. It is only with the possibility of the presence of matter with negative energy density that the focusing effect of colliding waves can be avoided. Nutku (1981) also pointed out that the line element (10.24) is the well known cosmological solution of Kasner (1921). He gave the explicit coordinate transformation by which the line element (10.24) becomes ,(10.26) where the coordinate t is not the same as that used elsewhere in this chapter, and  (10.27) which clearly satisfies the necessary conditions . (10.28) The Stoyanov solution has been obtained with the solution of (9.3) given by  (10.29) which is the solution (10.20). With this, the remaining equations in (6.22) may be integrated to give  (10.30) which clearly cannot be continuous across the boundaries of region IV if the junction conditions (7.3) are satisfied. It must be concluded that the above solution cannot be interpreted in terms of an interaction between plane gravitational waves. Certainly, it is not a counterexample of a solution for colliding waves without singularity. However, in region IV, it is the well known Kasner solution which features regularly in discussions of solution generating techniques. In fact, it turns out that this solution can be used as a ‘seed’ from which other physically acceptable solutions may be derived. It will therefore be referred to again in later sections. This solution in the case when  has been further investigated by Taub (1988 a ), looking particularly at the properties of the distribution valued curvature tensor. The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez and Griffiths Now consider the case with the solution of (10.11) given by  (10.31) This solution was first presented by Ferrari and Ibañez (1986,1987 a ) in the case when  and . The solution with general parameters was published by Griffiths (1987). The Ferrari-Ibañez (1986,1987 a ) solution can be seen to be a modification of the Khan-Penrose solution, while the more general case is a generalization of the Szekeres solution (10.19) with . With the solution (10.31), the remaining equations (10.23) may be integrated to give . (10.32) It may be noticed that S contains the term  (10.33) which includes the terms (7.10) that, with (7.8), are required to ensure that  is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.34) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.35) Figure 10.1 Wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari Ibañez-Griffiths solution with . These have been obtained from (10.6), but the scale factor contained in the bounded part of S has been removed. Profiles are shown for the special cases in which  or , when the wave front is continuous. The more general situation is represented by the cases in which b takes the values 1 and -2. By extending this solution into regions II and III and putting , it can be seen from (10.6) that the approaching waves contain an impulsive wave component  only if  and . This case includes the Khan-Penrose solution for which  and the Ferrari-Ibañez (1987 a ) solution in which ,. However, with , the impulsive wave is followed by another wave component. Some profiles for approaching waves of this type are illustrated in Figure 10.1. It can also be shown using (10.6) that the wave front of the approaching wave in region II behaves as  (10.36) Thus, unless , the wave front may have a distributional amplitude. It is unbounded if  and has a step if . The wave front is smooth if . Scaled profiles for the approaching waves are illustrated in Figure 10.2 for some particular values of a and b with n equal to 4, 6 and 8. In all cases the approaching waves become unbounded as  in region II, and as  in region III. Figure 10.2 Scaled wave profiles of approaching waves in the Ferrari-Ibañez-Griffiths solution for various values of a and b , and with n taking the values 4, 6 and 8. It can also be shown that this family of solutions has the same singularity structure as the class of Szekeres solutions as described in Section 9.3 and to which it reduces when . In region IV, there is a scalar polynomial curvature singularity on the space-like surface  on which  and . It may be noted that when , the initial boundaries  and  of region IV contain a distribution-valued singularity. These initial boundaries are regular when . As in all other solutions, it may also be noted that there are non-scalar curvature  singularities in the initial regions II and III on the hypersurfaces on which  and  respectively The soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ) have also used a generating that is familiar in the study of solitons to obtain a solution of (10.2) in which  (10.37) where  and a is an arbitrary constant. This was initially obtained using the inverse scattering technique in which the initial ‘seed’ solution is taken to be the Kasner or Stoyanov solution given by (10.20) or (10.29). This solution can immediately be seen to be a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution (10.18) by the addition of the solution (10.20). It necessarily contains impulsive wave components. It was pointed out by Griffiths (1987), however, that this solution may easily be generalized by treating the parameter k in (10.36) as another arbitrary constant. In this way, this family of solutions may also be considered to be a generalization of the Szekeres solutions with . As in the previous example, this generalization then permits the approaching waves to have a continuous wave front for appropriate values of k and a . It is this more general class of solutions that is considered in this section. It is possible immediately to integrate equations (10.23) to obtain . (10.38) This contains the term  which, as in (10.33), is required to ensure that e -M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. If the leading terms in the power series for f and g take the form ,(10.39) then the required boundary conditions are satisfied if . (10.40) In this case it is remarkable that the junction conditions place no constraint on the parameter a . This feature is, in fact, related to a general result that will be described in Section 12.1. When evaluating expressions for the Weyl tensor, it is convenient to use the coordinates and defined by (10.10)(it may be noticed that these differ from those used by Ferrari and Ibañez). The scale-invariant components of the Weyl tensor are given by  (10.41) For the sake of later discussion, it is found to be appropriate to choose the scale functions A and B defined by (6.2) and (6.14) to be  (10.42) The negative signs are due to the signs of f' and g' . From (10.41) it can be seen that, in general, this solution has the same singularity structure as the Szekeres solution. There is a curvature singularity on the hypersurface given by  or . There are, however, exceptional cases which occur when  and  . In these cases  (10.43) which satisfies the condition  (10.44) which implies that the space-time is of algebraic type D (see Kramer et a . 1980, or Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos 1986 b ). These particular degenerate cases will be analysed in more detail in the next section. When  and , the approaching waves contain an impulsive component. For ,, the null boundaries of region IV contain distribution-valued singularities. These boundaries are regular when ,. The approaching waves have a step wavefront if , and the wavefront is continuous if . Also, as in the Szekeres solutions, there are non-scalar curvature singularities in regions II and III when  and  respectively, for all values of a and all permissible values of k . A generalization of the class of solutions described in this section has been obtained by Tsoubelis and Wang (1989). This has been obtained by putting . (10.45) By a comparison with (10.37) and (10.19), this can be seen to be a generalization both of the above Ferrari Ibañez solution and also of the Szekeres class of solutions described in Chapter 9. Its properties can reasonably be inferred from those of these two subclasses, as has been confirmed by Tsoubelis and Wang. The degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions Consider now the special cases of the above Ferrari-Ibañez solution in which  and , in which the Weyl tensor components are given by (10.43). The properties of these cases have been further described by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988). In the case when ,, there is again a curvature singularity when . However, when  and , the space-time appears to be regular for all , and the singularity caused by the mutual focusing of the two waves appears to have been removed. It is, therefore, appropriate to consider this particular case in more detail. Since  in these cases, it is possible to scale the null coordinates such that. (10.46) When , the metric functions in region IV are then given by  (10.47) and the Weyl tensor components are then given by  (10.48) As expected, these indicate that the approaching waves are impulses followed by continuous components. Of greater significance, however, is the fact that in this case there are two point singularities at the points , and ,. The existence of the singularities at these points implies that the lines  and  in regions II and III act as ‘fold singularities’ like those described in Section 8.2. These lines therefore form boundaries to the space-time in these regions. It is convenient now to return to the time-like and space-like coordinates ψ and λ. In the degenerate case when  the line element in the interaction region takes the form . (10.49) To analyse this particular case further, consider the change of variables . (10.50) With this, the line element (10.49) takes the form  (10.51) which may immediately be recognized as the Schwarzschild metric with ., With , however, we have  which is normally understood as the region inside the horizon. In addition, since increases from zero in the interaction region, this region must correspond to the part of the Schwarzschild space-time indicated in Figure 10.3(b) which is inside the initial horizon. However, it may also be noticed that the coordinate which represents the axial coordinate in the Schwarzschild solution covers the entire range  in this case. Figure 10.3 The interaction region of the degenerate solution viewed in two different coordinate planes. The plane (a) is the u ,v or  plane as in previous figures. Diagram (b) represents the  plane and is equivalent to the familiar Kruskal-Szekeres diagram for the Schwarzschild space-time. From Figure 10.3, it appears that the approaching waves collide at the surface  and reach a horizon at . There is, however, no a priori reason why the coordinate should not be continued beyond π/2.;  If such a continuation is possible, this would indicate that the waves would continue through the horizon until they finally end in a curvature singularity at . The other degenerate case in which  can also be transformed to a Schwarzschild space-time but, in this case, the interaction region corresponds to the upper region inside the horizon and all trajectories end in the future singularity. This case, together with the above transformation, has also been described by Yurtsever (1988 a ). It is instructive also to express the metric in Kruskal-Szekeres form. This can be achieved from (10.49) using the transformation  (10.52) where u and v are null coordinates in the  plane. With this, the line element becomes  (10.53) where ψ is given by . (10.54) In these coordinates the structure of the solution in the vicinity of the horizon is clearly shown to be regular. It is also convenient to consider this solution in terms of alternative null coordinates u' and v' such that, in the interaction region  (10.55) where the new constants a and b are the strengths of the approaching gravitational shock waves. With these coordinates it can be seen that the Schwarzschild mass parameter, which is unity in the line elements (10.51) and (10.53), is here related to the amplitudes of the approaching waves by . (10.56) It follows from this that stronger approaching gravitational waves would produce a shorter proper time between the collision and the subsequent horizon. They would also give rise to a smaller Schwarzschild mass parameter, and hence greater curvature on the horizon. When trying to relate the global structure of this solution to part of the Schwarzschild space-time, it should be emphasised that for this class of colliding plane waves the coordinate is not periodic but covers the full range . Topological singularities occur on the lines  and  on the horizon  (or ). This global structure of the solution has been determined by Hayward (1989 a ). He has noted that the above solution also forms a covering space of part of the Schwarzschild white hole with a quasiregular covering space singularity along the polar axis around which the space-time is wound. He has also suggested an alternative extension of the Schwarzschild exterior inside the black hole. In addition, he has suggested some possible extensions for the non-unique region beyond the horizon including one that is time symmetric. Referring to Figure 10.3(b), the opposing waves in this case collide on the hypersurface . The interaction region is then that part of the Schwarzschild space-time inside the initial horizon as indicated, which extends to the horizon as the focusing hypersurface. An extension through this surface may be taken to be the familiar two parts of the exterior Schwarzschild space-time. This can be continued to the subsequent horizon. A further extension through this horizon is then possible up to the next surface on which  or  at which the space-time again splits into two separating gravitational waves which are the time reverse of the initial approaching waves. At the conclusion of this section, it may be noted that Ferrari and Ibañez (1988) have shown that the shear-free principal null congruences associated with this type D space-time do not focus on the horizon. However, these congruences are in different planes from the congruences on which the two wave components propagate, and for which the contraction and shear clearly become unbounded as . An odd order solution All of the solutions considered so far have involved only Legendre functions of even order. A solution with odd order functions has been presented by Griffiths (1987). This has . (10.57) With this function, equations (10.23) can immediately be integrated to give . (10.58) As in (10.32–34), it can be clearly seen that this expression contains terms of the form (7.10). It may thus be concluded that, if the leading terms in the expansions for the functions f and g are given by (10.34), then the boundary conditions that are required for the solution to describe colliding plane waves are satisfied if . (10.59) As in previous examples, it can be shown that the approaching waves have an impulsive component if . Also the wavefront is unbounded if , has a step if , is continuous but not smooth if , and is smooth if . The expressions for the Weyl tensor components are rather complicated, and there is nothing particularly remarkable about this solution. In the previous examples discussed in this chapter, the two waves approaching each other are identical. The component 0 in region III has an identical form to 4 in region II but with the null coordinate v replacing. Similarly, the expressions for V in the two regions can be related by the same replacement. In this case, however, since odd functions are being used, a change of sign is also included. Thus, and  in region II are replaced by  and  in region III. The approaching waves still have colinear polarization but, in this case, their amplitudes are opposite rather than the same. The second Yurtsever and the Feinstein-Ibañez solutions For colliding plane wave solutions, we are considering space-times with two space-like Killing vectors. Such space-times have also been considered in the context of cosmology, where certain vacuum inhomogeneous cosmologies satisfy the same field equations as the interaction region for colliding colinear gravitational waves (Gowdy 1971), although different boundary conditions are appropriate. In fact the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies can be considered to represent closed universes built from opposing plane gravitational waves. The similarity between these solutions  has been noted by Feinstein and Ibañez (1989), who have used known cosmological solutions to obtain a new class of colliding plane wave solutions. In this section, the Feinstein Ibañez solutions are presented. The electromagnetic Gowdy cosmologies will be described in Section 17.3. It is appropriate at this point to consider the alternative system of coordinates defined by . (10.60) It may be noted that the new coordinate t is a decreasing, or past pointing, time-like coordinate, and that the singularity in region IV occurs when . These coordinates have also been used by Yurtsever (1988 c ). In this case, the line element (10.1) for colliding waves with aligned constant polarization can be rewritten in the diagonal form  (10.61) and the main vacuum field equation (9.3),(10.2) or (10.13) becomes  (10.62) and the subsidiary equations (10.3) become  (10.63) where the dot and prime denote derivatives with respect to t and z respectively. The above equations (10.62,63) are exactly those for the vacuum Gowdy cosmologies that have been considered by many authors. The general solution of (10.62) can be expressed as a line integral. However, for the class of Gowdy cosmologies, it is found to be convenient to consider the class of solutions given by  (10.64) where  and  are arbitrary linear combinations of the terms in curly brackets, including the Fourier-Bessel integrals of the form  (10.65) and  are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order, and  and  are sets of arbitrary constants. The first term in (10.64) is clearly identical to the solution (10.20). It is the term that, on its own, gives rise to the Kasner solutions. The set of terms included in L 1 have regular behaviour as . It may be noted that this property is also shared by the combination of terms  that are contained in (10.16). The set of terms included in L 2 , however, are badly behaved as . These are the terms that are considered to induce chaotic behaviour in these cosmological models. The last term in (10.64) is identical to (10.31). This contains the so-called gravitational soliton components. Yurtsever (1988 c ) has considered the asymptotic structure of those solutions which only contain the combinations  and , i.e. in which . He has shown that these solutions are asymptotic to the inhomogeneous Kasner solutions as the singularity  is approached. He has also given explicit expressions which relate the asymptotic Kasner exponents along the singularity to the initial data specified along the wave fronts of the incoming colliding plane waves. It follows from this analysis that the focusing hypersurface  is a curvature singularity except in the special case in which one of the Kasner exponents is zero. This special case of the degenerate Kasner solution is flat and, in this case, the focusing hypersurface is a Killing-Cauchy horizon across which space-time can be extended. It is reasonable to conclude from this that, although there are colliding plane wave space-times which contain a Killing-Cauchy horizon rather than a space-like curvature singularity, these space-times are unstable against small perturbations of the initial data and that ‘generic’ initial data always produce space-like curvature singularities. Feinstein and Ibañez (1989) have considered the family of solutions for which the combination L 2 is zero. They have shown that, for this case, a curvature singularity does not develop in region IV as  provided that . (10.66) They have also shown that, in this case, the necessary boundary conditions (7.15) are satisfied provided there are at least two solitonic terms  with constants satisfying  (10.67) using the notation of (7.11). (The unfortunate repeated use of constants c 1 and c 2 in this equation should not cause confusion.) It may thus be noted that these two solitonic terms provide the conditions for continuity on the two different null boundaries of region IV. For continuity it is also required that  and , so d 1 and d 2 are constrained to the range . (10.68) It follows from this and (10.66) that , and so the first term in (10.64) must necessarily be included in these solutions. It may also be noted that the solutions given in the notation of previous sections by  (10.69) where c 1 and c 2 are given by (10.67), similarly do not contain curvature singularities on the hypersurface  provided the constants d i and a are constrained by (10.66) and (10.68). It is also of interest to note that the two solitonic terms that provide the continuity across the boundaries of the interaction region are in fact identical to the two separate terms in the Szekeres solution (9.4). This may be observed by noting that  (10.70) and similarly . (10.71) It follows from this that even the Szekeres solution, which is everywhere at least C 2 , can be adapted by the inclusion of a suitable multiple of the term (10.20) to provide a solution without a curvature singularity in the interaction region. Thus, the occurrence of a quasiregular singularity in region IV can have nothing to do with the relaxation of the continuity conditions across the boundaries. The class of solutions included here contain an arbitrary number of parameters. It can be shown that they are algebraically general in the interaction region. They contain the usual coordinate singularity on the hypersurface  but, for this class, this is not a curvature singularity. Feinstein and Ibañez have shown that the solution is extendable across this surface. However, the extension is not unique. The first Yurtsever solutions For colliding plane waves with aligned linear polarization, it has been seen that the main field equation (10.2) is linear. Various classes of solutions have already been obtained by separating the variables of this equation in a number of different ways. A further class of solutions in which the main equation is separated in yet another way has been given by Yurtsever (1988 a ). These solutions were originally obtained indirectly by first considering the Weyl solutions for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, they will be presented here in a more general way that is also more appropriate in considering colliding wave solutions. It is appropriate here to start with the main equation in the form (10.62) using the variables t and z defined by (10.60), and then transforming it by putting  (10.72) where the parameters v and η are not necessarily real. Indeed, real values of these variables only cover part of the interaction region as will be clarified later. With these parameters, the main equation (10.62) becomes  (10.73) and this has a series of separable solutions of the form  (10.74) where  and  are Legendre functions of the first and second kinds. Figure 10.4 In the interaction region IV for the Yurtsever solutions, the variables v and cosh η are imaginary in the initial region marked A that immediately follows the collision. This region is followed by the regions marked B in which these variables are real. We must now reconsider the parameters of these solutions. As defined by (10.72),z and  are imaginary when the product fg is positive. Since both f and g decrease from ½ towards -½ in the interaction region, it is appropriate to divide this region into the subregions A and B in which the product fg is positive and negative respectively as indicated in Figure 10.4. Explicitly we may put  (10.75) It is clear that v is zero midway along the two boundaries between region IV and regions II and III. The inverse functions of v that appear in (10.74) must therefore be excluded for colliding plane wave solutions since they must be regular along these boundaries. It is therefore appropriate to express general solutions in the form  (10.76) This solution will from now on simply be quoted in the second form since either equation formally includes the other. It may be noted that these solutions are continuous on the boundaries between the subregions A and B. Also, the terms involving the Legendre functions of the first kind are regular on the focusing hypersurface , while those involving the Legendre functions of the second kind are singular on this surface. To be precise, in the original class of solutions given by Yurtsever (1988 a ),V is taken in the form  (10.77) which can be seen to be generalizations of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in Section 10.5. They are therefore distortions of the Schwarzschild black hole solution in the interaction region, and correspond to interior Weyl solutions for static axisymmetric space-times. In terms of colliding plane waves, these solutions all involve approaching waves with initial impulsive components. Some particular examples have been described explicitly by Yurtsever (1988 a ). Clearly these solutions can easily be generalised by modifying the coefficients of the first terms of (10.77). By choosing these appropriately, it is possible to remove the impulsive components from the approaching waves. Further explicit solutions To obtain solutions describing the collision and interaction of plane waves with aligned linear polarization it is necessary first to solve the main field equation, which may be expressed in terms of different coordinates in any of the forms (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). Any number of further explicit solutions may easily be generated using the methods described in the previous sections of this chapter with different combinations of particular solutions of the main equation (9.3),(10.2),(10.13),(10.62) or (10.73). It is appropriate here simply to list the various possibilities. First there are the solutions (10.16) which have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.13). These involve Legendre functions of the first and second kinds  (10.78) where a n ,q n ,Pn and b n are series of arbitrary constants. It may be noted, of course, that non-integer values of n may also be included. There are also the particular solutions (10.20),(10.8) and (10.22) that can be re-expressed in the form  (10.79) where  are arbitrary constants. Then there are the solutions of (10.62) that are contained in (10.64) and have previously been included in Gowdy cosmologies, namely  (10.80) where  and ) are Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order,,, and  are sets of arbitrary constants. It may be noted that the solutions (10.80) have been obtained by separating the variables in (10.62), taking only solutions that are periodic in z . This constraint is not required for colliding plane waves and an additional set of aperiodic solutions is given by  (10.81) where  and  are modified Bessel functions of the first and second kinds of zero order. Finally, there are the separable solutions of (10.73) which are non-singular on the initial boundaries, namely  (10.82) which again involve Legendre functions of the first and second kind. When considered as infinite series, these different forms may simply be regarded as different representations of the same class of solutions. However, when looking for particular explicit solutions it is necessary to consider only a few terms. In this way, further exact solutions for colliding plane waves may be obtained by combining particular components from  any of the series V1, V2, V3, V4 and V5 and by choosing the arbitrary constants such that(10.83) where k 1 and k 2 are constrained to the range (7.13). If this condition is satisfied, then it remains only to integrate the subsidiary equations in the form (10.3) or (10.63) to obtain the remaining metric function S or M ."
ACA ACA-B2K-004 2.33 "ERNST EQUATION FOR COLLIDING GRAVITATIONAL WAVES The solutions being considered here for colliding plane waves all have a pair of commuting Killing vectors that are assumed to exist globally. It may therefore be expected that the solutions obtained may be related to known cylindrically symmetric solutions, or to stationary axisymmetric solutions, which similarly have a pair of Killing vectors. Such a relation was first pointed out by Kinnersley (1975), and by Fisher (1980). The exact relation between these solutions has been established more recently by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), and Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1985 a ), and exploited by these authors and their colleagues. In this chapter we will present an analysis of the colliding wave problem using a method that has become familiar in the study of stationary axisymmetric space-times. In this case the field is described in terms of a complex potential function that is referred to as the Ernst potential (see Ernst 1968 a ). This approach leads directly to various methods for generating further exact solutions. A derivation of the Ernst equation First it may be recalled that, of the vacuum field equations (6.22a-f) considered in previous chapters,(6.22a) may immediately be integrated to give ,(11.1) and (6.22d, e) are integrability conditions for the remaining equations. Attention is thus focused on these main equations for the metric functions  and . It is now appropriate to consider a different combination of these functions, by putting  (11.2) or, inversely . (11.3) This modifies the form of the line element (6.20), which now becomes . (11.4) It is also convenient to introduce the complex function . (11.5) With this, the line element (11.4) can be written in the form  (11.6) and the two main equations (6.22d, e) can be written as the single complex equation  (11.7) It may be seen that this is in fact Ernst's equation, which can be written in the coordinate-invariant form  (11.8) where  is the square of the gradient of an arbitrary scalar field which, in this case, is a function of the two (null) coordinates only. Similarly, v2 is the 3+1-dimensional Laplacian operator (or the generalized d'Alembertian) given by . (11.9) Using the above notation, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor given by (6.23) can be written as  (11 10) When considering Ernst's equation, it is frequently found to be useful also to introduce an associated function Ε, defined by  (11.11) With this, the line element (11.4) or (11.6) can be written in the alternative form  (11.12) and the main equations (6.22d, e), or alternatively (11.7), become . (11.13) This is the alternative form of the Ernst equation and may be rewritten in the coordinate-invariant form . (11.14) Using this function, the non-zero components of the Weyl tensor (11.10) can be written as  (11.1) The problem now involves finding appropriate solutions of (11.7) or (11.13). These equations, however, contain the derivatives of U , and hence they depend on the arbitrary functions f(u) and g(v) that are specified by the incoming waves. This apparently explicit dependence on initial conditions may in fact be removed by adapting the coordinate system of Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Here we again use (10.9–12) and put  (11.16) where ψ and λ are considered as time-like and space-like coordinates, which may then be rescaled by putting . (11.17) In this coordinate system, equation (11.7) takes the more familiar explicit form of Ernst's equation:(11.18) and (11.13) similarly becomes  (11.19) The intermediate steps in the derivation of these equations may be deduced from (16.6) and (16.11). See also (12.30–31). It may be noticed that, in this case, the solution of these equations immediately determines some of the metric functions. This is in marked contrast to their application in stationary axisymmetric space-times, where the Ernst equation only determines potentials for the fields. The original metric functions, as considered in previous chapters, are now given by  (11.20) Boundary conditions When looking for solutions of the Ernst equation for stationary axisymmetric space-times, it is appropriate to require that solutions be asymptotically flat. However, for colliding plane waves very different boundary conditions apply. For colliding plane waves it is necessary to choose Z or Ε, and hence V and W , such that the solution of (6.22b, c, f) for M is continuous across the boundaries of region IV. For vacuum solutions, it is appropriate to use (7.8) and equations (7.9) may then be written in the form . To ensure that the boundary conditions are satisfied, it is then essential that the solution of these equations should include the necessary components (7.10). In this approach, solutions in the interaction region for  or  are related to the functions  and , and hence S may be obtained as a function of f and g . The boundary conditions described in Chapter 7 may then be considered to place restrictions on the structure of these functions, which characterize the approaching waves. In practice, these boundary conditions are difficult to apply, basically because the condition that M be continuous is only indirectly applied to the functions V and W , or Z , or E , that feature in the main equations. It is therefore often convenient to apply the boundary condition in the form (7.15) or (7.16). Writing , this becomes  This form is particularly convenient when , which occurs when impulsive waves are present. The boundary conditions in this limited case only, have been discussed by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ). In terms of the functions f and g , the conditions (11.22) become  where k 1 and k 2 must satisfy the inequalities (7.13). Alternatively, writing , the boundary conditions require that   which, in terms of the functions f and g become  (11.26) Finally, it is convenient to express the boundary conditions in terms of the variables t and z . These become, for ,(11.27) where k 1 and k 2 satisfy (7.13). Colinear solutions In the next chapter, the approach described above will be used to derive new solutions for colliding gravitational waves whose polarization vectors are not aligned. Such solutions essentially have W non-zero, and hence Z and Ε are complex. However, before moving on to consider such cases, it is appropriate first to review the colinear solutions described in previous chapters. These solutions have Z and Ε real. (i)The solution of Khan and Penrose (1971), discussed in Chapter 3 and Section 8.2, which describes the collision of aligned impulsive gravitational waves, is given by . (11.28) In this case  and . It may be observed that, for stationary axisymmetric space-times,(11.28) is the Ernst potential which leads to the Schwarzschild solution. (ii)The Szekeres (1972) class of solutions, described in Chapter 9, is given by . (11.29) In this case  and , with  for  and . (iii)The ‘solution’ of Stoyanov (1979) given by (10.24) uses . (11.30) In Section 10.2 it has been argued that this solution must be considered to be unphysical on its own, but it may be included as a factor in more general solutions. It does not satisfy the boundary conditions (11.26). (iv)The solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 a ) and Griffiths (1987), which is described in Section 10.3, is characterized by  where  (11.31) In this case  and , where  and . It may be observed that, when ,(11.31) is the Ernst potential which, for stationary axisymmetric solutions, leads to the solution of Erez and Rosen (1959) which describes the external field of a non-rotating body with a quadrupole moment. (v)The generalized solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ), described in Section 10.4, is characterized by . (11.32) This can be seen to include the Stoyanov factor (11.30), and to reduce to a Szekeres solution with  when . Again  and  where  and . The degenerate cases occur when . (vi)The solution of Tsoubelis and Wang (1989) given by (10.44) has  (11.33) This can be seen to be a generalization of (11.29) and (11.32), and its properties can immediately be deduced. (vii)The odd order solution of Griffiths (1987) described in Section 10.6 uses the Ernst potential , where  (11.34) Again  and , where  and . It is not difficult to see how further solutions of this type can be generated."
ACA ACA-B2K-006 3.07 "VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH NON-ALIGNED POLARIZATION The purpose of this chapter is to describe the known exact solutions for colliding gravitational waves in which the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned. The first solution of this type was obtained by Nutku and Halil (1977). A further generalization of this solution was attempted by Halil (1979), but this has subsequently been found to be incorrect and so will not be considered here. The Nutku-Halil solution The Khan-Penrose solution discussed in Chapter 3 describes the collision of impulsive waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. Nutku and Halil (1977) have generalized this solution to give one which describes the collision of impulsive gravitational waves with non-colinear polarization. This is the most simple solution of this type. In terms of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the metric functions of this solution can be written in the form  (13.1) where  (13.2) and α and β are constants such that(α -β) is the angle between the polarization vectors of the approaching waves. This solution can be seen to reduce to the Khan-Penrose solution (3.9) when . It may also be observed that the functions f and g are given by  and . This solution has been analysed in great detail by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Their approach commences by rewriting the field equations in the form of Ernst's equation as described in Chapter 11. It can then be seen from (11.20) that Ε is the associated Ernst function. Chandrasekhar and Ferrari were then able to show that the Nutku-Halil solution is obtained by the simple choice of Ernst function given by  (13.3) where p and q are real constants which satisfy the condition . It is always possible to use a rotation of the type (12.9) to put , and in this case  and . It can easily be shown that the Ernst function Z associated with this solution is given by  (13.4) It may be observed that (13.3) is in fact the Ernst potential which leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. This reduces to the potential for the Schwarzschild solution when  or . Thus the difference in the polarization of the approaching waves in this situation can be seen to be equivalent to the rotational parameter in the Kerr solution. Taking the Ernst functions as (13.3) or (13.4), it can be shown that the boundary conditions described in Section 7.2 can only be satisfied if  and  It is then convenient to transform the null coordinates such that and . Thus the form (13.2) is obtained uniquely from the Ernst function (13.3). It also follows from this that the approaching waves necessarily contain impulsive components. Expressions for the components of the Weyl tensor 0, 2 and 4 describing the wave and interaction components have been given by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), though in a notation which differs slightly from that adopted here. However, it can still be clearly seen that this solution is a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution in which the approaching impulsive waves have different polarization. Apart from the initial impulsive waves on the boundaries  and , the interiors of regions II and III are flat. It can also be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is the same as that of the Khan-Penrose solution. There is a curvature singularity on the space-like surface  in region IV, and there  are fold singularities in regions II and III which are identical to those described in Section 8.3. It may also be pointed out that Ernst (1986) has shown that  the Nutku-Halil solution can also be obtained using a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation, with the seed metric being the isotropic Kasner metric. The Panov solution Panov (1979 b ) has applied the generation method of Geroch (1971), described in Section 12.3, to obtain a non-colinear solution from a colinear one. In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), Panov started with a colinear solution U ,V , and M of (6.22) with . He then worked with the Killing vector  which is (12.25) with  and . This enabled him to put , and hence , and also from (12.30), and , where . With these expressions, the metric components may be derived from (12.23), giving  (13.5) where, from (12.28),P 3 must satisfy  (13.6) or, more conveniently,. (13.7) It is worth pointing out that, if the initial Killing vector had been taken to be , which is (12.25) with  and , an equivalent transformation would have been obtained with  and . This would have given an identical set of equations, but with V being replaced by -V , and P 3 by P 2 . In terms of the Ernst formulation of the problem described in Chapter 11, the above transformation implies that, if Z is a real solution of (11.18), then a new complex solution is given by  (13.8) where  must satisfy the equations  (13.9) Panov then took the initial solution to be the totally general solution of Szekeres (1972), which can be considered to be equivalent to the general solution given here by (10.16). He has thus determined a general class of non-colinear solutions, and he was able to show that, when the appropriate boundary conditions have been applied, the approaching waves necessarily have variable polarization. It has already been shown that the new solution obtained using a Geroch transformation will automatically satisfy the required boundary conditions if these are satisfied by the initial solution. In this case, it can also be seen that the new and initial solutions have the same singularity structure. The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the associated Ernst function which is contained in the Nutku-Halil solution can be written as  (13.3), where . Now, it is well known (see Chandrasekhar, 1983) that this is the Ernst potential that leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, as described in Section 12.4, Chandrasekhar and Ferrari have also shown that, for the colliding plane wave situation, the Ernst function may be regarded either (a) as containing the metric functions, or (b) as a potential for those functions. When the Ernst function (13.3) is considered as containing the metric functions, it leads to the Nutku-Halil solution described above. However, when the same function is considered as a potential, it then leads to the Kerr solution. Thus part of the  Kerr space-time must also be considered as a solution of the colliding plane wave equations, though in this situation the coordinates have a different interpretation. This alternative interpretation of part of the Kerr space-time has been described in detail by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Essentially it may be considered to have been derived from the Nutku-Halil solution using the Neugebauer-Kramer involution described in Section 12.4. We start here with the Ernst potential given by , so that(13.10) where . According to(12.36), the first metric function is then given by  (13.11) and, from (12.34),w is given by  (13.12) where  (13.13) With this,(13.12) becomes  (13. 14) which can immediately be integrated to give  (13.15) where c is an arbitrary constant. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos have chosen the constant of integration in (13.15) such that when . The reason for this choice is associated with the convenience of aligning the coordinate directions with the shear axes on the surface  on which the two waves mutually focus each other. Accordingly we set . (13.16) A variation of this constant is equivalent to making an Ehlers transformation as described in (12.16–18). With (13.16), may now be written in either of the forms  (13.17) For purposes of simplification, it is convenient to introduce the terms  (13.18) In view of(12.43) and (13.1), in this case we must have . (13.19) The metric function M can also be obtained from (12.42) and (13.1), giving . (13.20) These expressions now complete all the metric functions contained in the line element (11.4), which may now be written as . (13.21) After some rearrangement, this may be written in the more convenient form . (13.22) in which Y does not appear in a denominator. In order to show that this is indeed the Kerr solution, we first relabel the parameters by putting  (13.23) which satisfies the condition  for arbitrary constants M and α. It is also appropriate to introduce the new coordinates r and θ instead of t and z given by  (13.24) where it may be noticed that, using the previous notation,. The remaining coordinates may also be transformed by putting  (13 25) It is also convenient to introduce the definitions . (13.26) With these substitutions the line element (13.22) may then be written in the form  (13.27) which after rescaling d s is the standard form of the Kerr solution. For this solution to describe the interaction region of colliding waves, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . With (13.24), this implies that  (13.28) which is satisfied only by the region of the Kerr space-time that is inside the ergo-sphere. This is not unexpected, as this is the only region of Kerr space-time in which the Killing vectors are both space-like. The plane on which the two waves collide is given by , or by  which is between the two horizons. The hypersurface on which they mutually focus each other, which is given by  or , is here given by  which determines the horizons of the  Kerr solution. Thus, the curvature singularity which usually occurs when , in this case, is replaced by a coordinate singularity which is normally interpreted as a horizon of the Kerr solution. The components of the Weyl tensor inside region IV can be derived using (11.10) and have been evaluated by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos. The space-time is of algebraic type D and, in particular, it may be noted that  (13.29) The curvature is clearly non-singular as  except in the aligned case  (or ). In this case only, the surface  corresponds to a curvature singularity. In the interaction region t is a future pointing time-like coordinate. It thus follows from (13.24) that r is also a future pointing time-like coordinate which increases from the collision at  to the outer horizon at . In this case a possible further extension beyond the horizon would present no problems. It may be noted, however, that if the signs of the expressions for t ,p and q in (13.24) and (13.23) are changed, the Kerr metric (13.27) is still obtained but the orientation of r is altered. In this case, the collision at  is followed by the inner horizon at  and any extension would lead to a future time-like curvature singularity at . The difference between these two solution has been further analysed by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). It is the latter case that has been described by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) in which there is an extension beyond the horizon at  which contains a time-like singularity analogous to the ring singularity of the Kerr solution at . Since this singularity is time-like, it would be missed by most observers. In the other case, which has been given explicitly above, there is an analytic extension which is the asymptotically flat exterior Kerr solution. It may be pointed out, however, that in both cases the extension beyond the horizon is not unique. When considering the question of the character of the coordinate singularity at , Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) have given a transformation by which it can be removed. They have found it convenient to introduce a decreasing time-like coordinate given by . The transformation  (13.30) then removes the coordinate singularity at , or . This provides an analytic extension beyond the Cauchy horizon which is another part of Kerr space-time. This extension, in one case, is followed by a time-like curvature singularity which corresponds to the source of the Kerr solution. It may be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is very similar to that of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in detail in Section 10.5. In fact this solution reduces to either of the two cases of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution in the limit as  which is the limit as the polarization of the approaching waves become aligned. The non-singular case occurs when . It may be noted that in this limit , the rotation of the Kerr solution vanishes, and the solution reduces to the same part of the Schwarzschild space-time as the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution. It is now appropriate to consider the extension of the solution into the prior regions I, II and III which describe the approaching waves that give rise to this particular interaction. The metric (13.21) may easily be extended into region II simply by replacing both t and z by u . It turns out to be convenient to make the coordinate transformation . (13.31) With this, the line-element in region II takes the form  (13.32) where . The line-element for region III is identical to (13.32) except that v replaces u . Both these line-elements are then continuous with the Minkowski space (3.6) in region I. The plane wave metric given by (13.32) has the single component of the curvature tensor given by . (13.33) It may immediately be observed that the approaching waves have variable polarization except in the aligned limit . They include an impulsive component and a step component. As in the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution, the singularity structure is thus complicated by the fact that the solution contains impulsive waves on the wave fronts  and  which form the boundaries of the interaction region. The presence of these wave components introduces  additional distribution valued singularities at the points , and ,. As described in Chapter 8, these point singularities ensure the existence of fold singularities on the surfaces  and  in regions II and III respectively. The profiles for the approaching waves in both cases have been described in more detail by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). They have shown that, in the case where the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the inner Kerr horizon, the amplitude diverges towards the fold singularity which is thus a non-scalar curvature singularity. On the other hand, when the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the outer Kerr horizon, the amplitude decays towards a quasiregular fold singularity. Other solutions It may be noticed that the solutions presented in the previous two sections have been obtained using the generating techniques described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 respectively. Other techniques may also be used, both in isolation and in various combinations. Since they involve the same Ernst equation, it is clear that all the solution generating techniques that have been developed for stationary axisymmetric space-times in recent years can also be applied to colliding plane wave situations. A number of papers have recently been published which present new colliding wave solutions using some of these techniques, and it is likely that many more such papers will appear. Most of these concentrate on a description of a particular technique and how it may be adapted to the colliding wave situation. At present, however, there is less emphasis on the physical significance of the particular solution generated. Nevertheless, solutions with a number of parameters have been obtained, and general classes of solutions have been defined. Ideally, one would like to be able to specify the particular solution corresponding to an arbitrary set of initial conditions. Such techniques are available in the axisymmetric case, and may soon be extended to the colliding wave situation. The initial attempts at the solution of this problem are mentioned in the next chapter. So far most of the explicit solutions that have been presented have involved impulsive wave components. In the notation of (7.11), they have used . Much less attention has been given to smooth-fronted waves of finite duration. Some further general aspects of cases involving impulsive components have been clarified by Ferrari (1988). In particular, it has been shown that the proper time between the collision and the subsequent singularity is  inversely proportional to the square root of the amplitudes of the impulsive components of the approaching waves. This time is also affected by their relative polarization and is a minimum when the approaching waves are colinear. This result also applies to solutions which contain a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. In addition, Ferrari has also shown that the shock waves which accompany the impulsive waves only affect the rate at which the Weyl scalars diverge on the singularity. Having made these general remarks, we may now briefly review the new exact solutions that have been presented. The generation techniques themselves will not be described in detail here. First, there is the important class of solutions that has been obtained by Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 a , b) using the inverse scattering method developed by Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) and Carr and Verdaguer (1983). Using this method, they have obtained a two-parameter class of colliding wave solutions with non-aligned polarization. This in fact is a generalization of the soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ) described in Sections 10.4 and 10.5. The Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution has been obtained using as seed the Kasner metric. They utilize the Belinskii-Zakharov soliton technique with two real poles. The resulting metric for region IV is singular on the space-like surface , except in a particular limiting case. By extending the solution back into regions II and III, it can be seen that the approaching waves must have both an impulsive component and a step component with variable polarization. The limiting case of the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution is particularly interesting. It is of type D, and can be shown to be part of the Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region where there are two space-like Killing vectors. The line element can be written in the form  (13.34) where p and q are constants satisfying . It can immediately be seen that, when  and , this further reduces to the two colinear degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions that have already been considered in Section 10.5. The structure of this solution has been further examined by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988). Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 a ) have shown that an Ehlers transformation (12.13) applied to the Ernst function of the Nutku-Halil solution (13.3), together with a simple coordinate transformation, yields a non-colinear generalization of the Ferrari Ibañez soliton solution that was described in Section 10.4 but only with even integer values of the parameter α. This generalization is in fact contained in the solution of Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 a , b). A further generalization extending the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution was reported by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 a , b), with a full derivation given in Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988). This solution contains three arbitrary parameters. In stating this solution, it is convenient first to define the function  (13.35) where a , α and β are the arbitrary parameters, and where . (13.36) With this definition, the Ernst function for this new solution may be written as  (13.37) When , this reduces to the Nutku-Halil solution. With , one obtains the Kerr-NUT solution with α being the NUT parameter. The subcase with  and  becomes the Schwarzschild-NUT space-time. Transforming (13.37) using the Neugebauer Kramer involution produces another three-parameter family of solutions with the alternative Ernst function given by  (13.38) With , this reduces to the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution. Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ) have also found a simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations relating colliding wave solutions. With this, they have obtained a generalization of the  above solution in the case when . A further generalization of the  solution is also obtained using a Neugebauer-Kramer involution. It was pointed out by Ernst (1986) that the Nutku Halil solution can be derived from the isotropic () Kasner metric by applying a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation. The Kerr space-time of the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution can also be derived from Minkowski space using a double-Harrison transformation. It therefore seemed reasonable that other colliding wave solutions may be generated by applying double-Harrison transformations to other Kasner metrics. This procedure has indeed been successful. It was used by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988) to determine the solution described above in (13.35) to (13.38). The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques. Naturally, however, Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser preferred to use the so-called Hauser-Ernst homogeneous Hilbert problem approach (see also Ernst 1988). Finally, it may be mentioned that Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have recently obtained another particular solution describing the non-colinear case using the generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) as described here in (12.56) and (15.57). Further solutions could easily be obtained using this method."
ACA ACA-B2K-008 3.9 "COLLIDING ELECTROMAGNETIC WAVES: THE BELL-SZEKERES SOLUTION In an important paper, Bell and Szekeres (1974) gave an exact solution which describes the collision and subsequent interaction of two electromagnetic plane waves. This solution, which appears to be remarkably simple, will be described in this chapter. Other exact solutions describing colliding electromagnetic waves will be described in Chapters 16 and 17, after more powerful techniques have been developed. The Bell-Szekeres solution Bell and Szekeres have considered a very simple situation involving a collision of two step electromagnetic waves. Prior to the collision, the waves may be described by the familiar line element (4.15). In regions I and II, this takes the form  (15.1) and the step wave is given by . The opposing wave with  may be described in an identical way with the null coordinate u replaced by v , and a different space-like coordinate replacing r . The two electromagnetic field components in the initial regions I, II and III are taken to be . (15.2) The fact that both of these expressions are real simultaneously indicates that the polarization of the two electromagnetic waves is aligned. In addition, they have identical step profiles. The relative amplitudes a and b may, of course, both be equated to unity when convenient. The components of the Weyl tensor are initially all zero. By this stage, we are familiar with the fact that it is appropriate to transform the metrics in all regions into Rosen form. Accordingly, the line elements in the initial regions may be taken in the forms of (4.19) and (4.20), namely  (15.3) The initial-value problem is now well set, and it remains to find the unique solution in the interaction region. The field equations for colliding electromagnetic waves have already been obtained in Chapter 6. In terms of the metric functions of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the gravitational field equations for the interaction region take the form (6.22), and Maxwell's equations are given by (6.21). The appropriate boundary conditions for this situation have been described in Chapter 7. As usual, it may be noted that (6.22a) can immediately be integrated to give  (15 4) where f and g are arbitrary decreasing functions in the interaction region. From the junction conditions it can be seen that, in this case, these functions necessarily take the forms:. (15.5) The solution of the complete set of equations (6.21,22) given by Bell and Szekeres is . (15.6) It can be seen that these functions satisfy the required O'Brien-Synge boundary conditions. Thus the line element in the interaction region IV is . (15.7) This line element is in fact one form of the Bertotti-Robinson solution (Bertotti 1959, Robinson 1959), which is known to be conformally flat. The coordinate transformation  (15.8) transforms the line element (15.7) into the more familiar form . (15 9) Halilsoy (1987) has considered an application of the transformation  to the above solution. However, this does not lead to any new results that are of physical significance. The structure of the solution The above solution describes the collision of two step electromagnetic waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. This follows from the fact that  is real, and . As has been pointed out above, the solution inside the interaction region IV is conformally flat. However, as Bell and Szekeres have shown, there are necessarily discontinuities in the derivatives of the metric function V across the initial boundaries of this region. These manifest themselves as the impulsive gravitational waves  (15.10) which may be considered to be generated by the collision. It is in fact a general feature of colliding electromagnetic plane waves that gravitational waves are always generated by the collision. This can easily be demonstrated by considering the field equations (6.22d, e). In the interaction region, and  are necessarily both non-zero. It follows that V and W can not both remain constant. Thus, the congruences tangent to both waves must begin to shear, and it can be seen from (6.23) that the components of the Weyl tensor  and , and possibly  will necessarily appear. In this case, the discontinuity in the electromagnetic components causes impulsive gravitational waves to be generated. It can also be shown that smooth-fronted electromagnetic waves would generate smooth-fronted or step gravitational waves that would persist through the interaction region. It may also be observed from (15.10) that difficulties occur at the points . At first sight, it would appear that curvature singularities occur at these points (Matzner and Tipler, 1984). However, curvature tensors of this type can be interpreted as distributions (see Geroch and Traschen, 1987) and, in this case, the standard definition of a curvature singularity in terms of unboundedness in a parallelly propagated frame is inapplicable. The global structure of this solution has been analysed in detail by Clarke and Hayward (1989). They have confirmed that, in regions II and III, the surfaces on which  and  respectively behave as ‘fold’ singularities similar to those of the Khan-Penrose solution described in Section 8.2. Initially, the most surprising feature of the Bell-Szekeres solution was that a space-like curvature singularity does not occur in region IV. In this case, the surface on which , which is here given by , turns out to be merely a coordinate singularity since the curvature tensor is clearly bounded. Bell and Szekeres have demonstrated how this singularity can be removed by considering the following coordinate transformation:(15.11) where . With this, the line element (15.6) becomes  (15.12) which is clearly regular when . In order to retain the one-to-one correspondence, it is appropriate initially to restrict the Bell-Szekeres coordinate x to the range . The coordinates X and Y are restricted by , where the boundary  contains the space-like plane on which the collision occurs. It has been shown by Clarke and Hayward (1989) that region IV is part of a space-time that is regular apart from two covering-space singularities that occur when . These are points on the boundary of region IV where it joins with the limits of regions II and III. At these points, which are on the polar axis  and  in the Bertotti-Robinson form of the metric (15.9),. With the above transformation, each interval of the coordinate x of length 2 π/; c corresponds to a circular region in the X ,Y plane with the origin removed and cut along the line . Neighbouring regions of x are joined together along these cuts to form a surface which continuously winds around the origin. The origin of the X ,Y plane thus corresponds to a singularity of a quasiregular covering-space type. It is also sometimes convenient (Clarke and Hayward, 1989) to make the further coordinate transformation  (15.13) With this, the line element (15.12) takes the alternative form of the Bertotti-Robinson line element  (15.14) Region IV is now described by the line element (15.14) with the coordinate ranges given by  (15.15) This is joined to regions II and III across the surfaces . (15.16) Clarke and Hayward (1989) have also shown that the Bell-Szekeres solution is extendable to the future through the surface , but the extension is not unique because of the presence of the singularities. They have further suggested two possible extensions which will be described in the next section. It is also somewhat remarkable that the global structure of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as described by Clarke and Hayward (1989), is very similar to that of the collision of an impulsive gravitational wave with a null shell of matter, as described by Babala (1987). This will be discussed in Section 19.3. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have conducted a thorough perturbation analysis of this particular solution. Throughout the interaction region subsequent to the collision they have obtained a complete set  of bounded normal modes that are expressed in terms of spin-weighted spherical harmonics. These modes exhibit a behaviour of ever-increasing frequency as the Cauchy horizon is approached. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1988) have also considered perturbations in the initial regions which contain the approaching waves. For the approaching wave in region II which propagates along the null line ,, they have shown that v -independent perturbations are not permitted to all orders, while all the v -dependent perturbations exhibit strong divergences along the ‘fold’ singularity. Unfortunately, these perturbations can not be joined continuously to those of the interaction region. It is therefore not possible to consider the effects of these perturbations subsequent to the collision. Extensions of the solution In the Bell-Szekeres solution, it has been shown that the hypersurface  on which the opposing waves mutually focus each other is a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. It is therefore appropriate to consider possible extensions to this solution through the horizon, even though any such extension will not be unique. Two possible extensions have been given by Clarke and Hayward (1989). One natural extension of region IV is simply the future extension of the region as described by the line element (15.14). This is achieved by extending the coordinate range to  (15.17) where . In this extension, the waves cross and focus. The subsequent space-time is unchanging. Another equally natural extension of region IV is obtained by noting that the line element (15.14) admits a reflection symmetry  about the hyperplane  (or  about ). Thus, there is an extension in which region IV is extended as far as  and is then followed by the time reverse of the entire solution. In this extension, the waves cross, mutually focus each other, re-expand and then separate leaving Minkowski space between them to the future. This situation is illustrated in Figure 15.1 in terms of the original null coordinates and the line elements (15.3) and (15.7). Other apparent extensions of the Bell-Szekeres solution have been suggested by Gürses and Halilsoy (1982) in which the approaching electromagnetic waves consist of a sequence of steps. The step lengths, however, have to be double the distance to the fold singularities. Thus, these  solutions necessarily extend the space-time through the covering space singularities and can not, therefore, be considered as appropriate solutions for colliding plane waves. In all these solutions the space-time can only be extended uniquely up to the fold singularities in regions II and III and the surface in region IV on which . It must therefore be concluded that the Gürses-Halilsoy extensions are not physically significant. Figure 15.1 An extension of the Bell-Szekeres space-time. Regions marked I are flat. Regions marked II and III contain electromagnetic waves with , and  respectively, having metrics given by (15.3). There are impulsive gravitational waves along the boundaries of region IV, which has metric (15.7). A non-colinear collision In the Bell-Szekeres solution, the polarization of the approaching electromagnetic waves is aligned. It is appropriate now to consider how this solution may be generalized to include the case when the polarization is not aligned. In the approaching waves a rotation of the polarization is expressed by a rotation of the components Φ 2 or Φ in the complex plane. The metrics in both regions are unaltered, since a null electromagnetic field  is defined by the metric only up to a constant duality rotation. Thus, to extend the Bell-Szekeres solution, the same initial conditions are given except that the component  becomes complex and, from (6.22e),W must become non-zero in the interaction region. A solution presented by Griffiths (1985) satisfying this condition may be written in the form  (15.18) where  (15.19) The relative polarization angle of the two waves prior to the collision is given by α. It may be noticed that the expression for U here is equivalent to those of (15.4,5) and (15.6). The common multiple 2 has been inserted so that this solution can be more directly related to the Bell-Szekeres solution to which it reduces when . It can be shown that this solution has exactly the same properties as the aligned Bell-Szekeres solution. It is conformally flat everywhere except at the boundaries of the interaction region where there are impulsive gravitational waves that may be considered to be generated by the collision. These are given by  (15.20) According to a theorem of Tariq and Tupper (1974), this new solution must as be the Bertotti-Robinson space-time in a different coordinate system. In fact it can be obtained from the Bell-Szekeres line element (15.7) by the simple rotation  (15.21) Thus, the gravitational field in this case is identical to that of the Bell-Szekeres solution, as may have been expected. In the collision of plane  electromagnetic waves with non-aligned polarization, it must therefore be concluded that the dynamics remains unaltered. It is only the form of the metric in the interaction region that needs to be modified to that given in this section."
ACA ACA-CMA-007 3.67 "EVOLUTION, ETHICS, AND THE REPRESENTATION PROBLEM BERNARD WILLIAMS This paper is concerned with culture and with evolution, but not with cultural evolution. It discusses the relations between biological evolution and the areas of human culture which may broadly be called ‘ethical’. The concept of cultural evolution is problematical, and there are notorious difficulties about applying the notions of evolution and natural selection to cultural development; in particular, the ends served by various cultural developments are themselves defined by culture, as are the ‘choices’ to which Wilson refers in his paper (this volume). That area, however, is not the concern of the present discussion. There are two kinds of connection between evolutionary theory and ethics: one normative, and one explanatory. There is also a connection between these two, to which I shall come later. The first of these is older than the second, and has acquired a bad name; indeed, it acquired it fairly early, in some part from the monumental and unappealing system of Herbert Spencer. In fact, as John Burrow has shown (Burrow, 1966) a lot of this material ante-dated The Origin of Species ; the concept of ‘the survival of the fittest’(Spencer's own phrase) was already implicit in earlier sociological work which Spencer derived from Malthus. Darwin himself had little sympathy for these ideas and not much, personally, for Spencer, though he did once say — I quote Burrow (p. 182)—‘in a moment of enthusiasm…that Spencer's Principles of Biology made him feel that he ‘is about a dozen times my superior’, and thought that Spencer might one day be regarded as the equal of Descartes and Leibniz, rather spoiling the effect by adding, ‘about whom, however, I know very little’’. The bad normative applications of evolutionary theory to ethics which were made by Spencer and others also, of course, involved a lot of bad evolutionary theory: if normative lessons could be drawn from Darwinian  theory, there is certainly no reason why they should take the form suggested by Social Darwinists. However, there is in addition a standard objection which holds that no such lessons can be drawn at all, at least in any directly logical way, since any project of deriving ethical content from premisses of evolutionary theory commits the ‘naturalistic fallacy’, an error which is today often equated with that of trying to derive ought from is . Interesting questions about ‘naturalism’ in ethics in fact go beyond these purely logical issues. Naturalism in a broader sense consists in the attempt to lay down certain fundamental aspects of the good life for man on the basis of considerations of human nature. If this project falls, it is not for purely logical reasons; it will rather be for the more interesting reason that the right sort of truths do not exist about human nature. I shall come back to this wider question at the end of this paper. The point about ought and is , so far as it goes, does have some force. It can be put in the following way. Suppose that considerations of evolutionary theory show that certain behaviour is in some sense appropriate for human beings. Either human beings can diverge from this pattern, or they cannot. If they can, then the biological considerations are not going to show that they ought not to; while, if they cannot so diverge, then there is no question of ought . This argument seems to me sound so far as it goes, but it does not go very far. Implicit in this last argument is another logical relation which is more interesting for this question than that between ought and is : the relation, that is to say, between ought and can . This relationship underlies some important negative arguments which by citing certain claims to the effect that human beings cannot, as they may suppose, live in a certain way, lead to the conclusion that certain ethical goals or ideals are unrealistic and should be revised. By arguments of this kind, biological or similar arguments could coherently yield constraints on social goals, personal ideals, possible institutions and so forth. To say that human beings cannot do certain things is, of course, an extremely vague form of statement. At one extreme, it may mean that the world will not contain an example of any single human being doing that thing; at the other end, it may merely mean that if a group of human beings  adopt a norm requiring that behaviour, the norm will often be broken, its observance will give rise to a good deal of anxiety, those who comply without anxiety to the norm will be unusual in other respects, and so forth. This vagueness will not matter so long as one is clear about the level at which the formula of ‘ought implies can ’ is being applied: thus the latter, and weaker, kind of‘cannot’would be enough to provide a strong argument against the behaviour being made into a norm for a human society, but it would not be enough if the question concerned the adoption of a personal ideal in an individual case. Here, as so often, it is a centrally important question, who is supposedly being addressed by a given piece of ethical discourse. Granted that one is clear about that, the fact that relevant statements of what human beings can and cannot do come in various strengths is not so important. What is vitally important is the difficulty of knowing which of them, relevant to difficult ethical issues, are on biological grounds in fact true. In this area there is an important connection, which I mentioned before, between what I called the normative and the explanatory interest. If some biological constraint can rule out, or make unrealistic, some normative practice or institution, then knowledge of it may not only encourage us to decline that practice if it is suggested, but may also contribute an explanation of why human communities do not in general display that practice or institution. Might biological considerations then go further and explain the human adoption of other practices, which are conformable to biological constraints? This raises a general question which is central to these areas, and which I shall call the representation problem . It is a problem which comes up at various points in considering the relations between biology and human practices, and may be put in the following way:how is a phenotypic character which would present itself in other species as a behavioural tendency represented in a species which has a culture, language and conceptual thought ? It may be said that in some cases, at least, such a tendency will show up in that species merely as itself — that is to say , as a merely biological character of that species. But, in fact, virtually no behavioural tendency which constitutes genuine action can just show up in a cultural context ‘as itself’. Where there is culture, it affects everything, and we should reject the crude view that culture is applied to an animal in a way which leaves its other characteristics unmodified. (Related to that view is the naive assumption of certain sociobiologists that sociobiology should expect to be more closely related to social anthropology than to other social sciences, because the ‘primitive’ peoples studied by social anthropology are nearer to nature than  human beings who live in large industrialized societies.) None of this is to deny that there is a biological basis for elements in human behaviour which are culturally affected, moulded and elaborated. It is not to deny that some culturally elaborated behaviour can usefully be explained from a biological perspective. It is simply to recall the fact that almost all human behaviour, at least that which deserves the name of ‘action’, is in fact culturally moulded and elaborated. In accepting that there is a representation problem, I reject two views according to which there would be no such problem. First is a simple reductionist view, which would neglect the way in which culture not only shapes but constitutes the vast mass of human behaviour. When ancient Greek thought first discovered the opposition of ‘nature’ and ‘convention’, it also discovered that an essential part of human nature is to live by convention. The study of human nature is , in good part, the study of human conventions, and that is what it is from the strictest ethological point of view. That is how this species is. It is a claim additional to this, but one which I also believe to be true, that human conventions, at least beyond a certain state of elaboration, can be understood only with the help of history, and that the social sciences accordingly have an essential historical base. To pursue the question of whether that is so, would go beyond the limits of the present discussion, but it is worth bearing in mind, when the relations are discussed of biology to the social sciences, that an essential social science is likely to prove to be history. The second point of view which is excluded by taking seriously the representation problem is one which I am disposed, perhaps unfairly, to call ‘the Wittgensteinian cop-out’. This is a view implicit in the idea that the central concept for gaining insight into human activities is that of a ‘language game’. Since ‘language’ in this formulation is regarded both as the key to human convention, and also as something which human beings possess and animals do not, the phrase itself implies the lack of interesting explanatory or constraining connections between human and animal behaviour. It suggests an autonomy of the human, under a defining idea of linguistic and conceptual consciousness, which tends to put a stop to any interesting questions of the biological kind before they even start. It therefore does not give any help even in the areas, such as sex and hunger, where we most obviously need means of describing the relations between culture and the biological. The feature of human culture and human activities that gives rise to the representation problem is above all that human communities embody norms , and it is this notion that I shall principally discuss. However, there  are other ways, as well, of picking out differences between human activities and those of other animals. One is the very general feature that humans possess conceptual and reflexive consciousness; this, and the very large philosophical problems introduced by those three terms, I shall happily leave on one side. Another distinction between human and animal behaviour is that considerations of motive are appropriate to the assessment of human action. This is a matter that is worth some brief discussion, since it is closely connected with the fuss that has been made about the application of the term ‘altruism’ to animal as to human behaviour. In other animals there is behaviour which benefits another individual, and moreover there is behaviour the end of which is to benefit another individual, in a sense of ‘end’ which requires a lot of work to make clear, but which is uncontentiously illustrated by behaviour the end of which is that the animal should take in food. In the human case, many more layers can be added, and other distinctions drawn. There are questions of intention, where this concerns what thoughts produce the action, and what features of the action are, relative to that thought, accidental. There are questions of underlying desire. Some actions which benefit others come from the desire just to benefit that particular person, while others flow from some more general disposition, while the desire to benefit a particular person or group may be accompanied by a variety of other desires, for instance to extract goodwill from them, or the possibility of a reward. The cultural and psychological elaboration of these various motives of course raises difficulties for any simple relation of them to the biological. Some of those difficulties arise just from the general problem of applying biological models to a species which engages in intentional thought; to that extent there is no special problem about altruism and morality. People think that there is a special barrier here to the application of biological models, I believe, because they take ‘altruism’, in a ‘properly moral’ sense, to refer to some quite peculiarly pure motive, such as the intention to benefit others derived from impartial reflection on their interests and associated with no other desire whatsoever. But it is extremely unreasonable to suppose that all (perhaps any) human beings act from that motivation, either, and if morality is to be a generally human phenomenon, it is simply a mistake to equate it from the beginning with such exigently Kantian formulations, and it is a mistake even from the point of view of the human sciences. It is no doubt true that a biological perspective will make one more suspicious of extremely intellectualist or, again, very purist views of morality; but equally, so will a reasonable historical and psychological understanding of morality. It is the notion of a norm that perhaps gives rise to the central representation problem. The main point is condensed in the question raised by Pat Bateson in his paper (this volume), about the relation between an inhibition and a prohibition. The most, it seems, that a genetically acquired character could yield would be an inhibition against behaviours of a certain kind; what relation could that have to a socially sanctioned prohibition? Indeed, if the inhibition exists, what need could there be for such a prohibition? If the prohibitory norm is to be part of the ‘extended phenotype’ of the species, how could we conceive, starting from an inhibition, that this should come about? This is a central example of the problem, but it is not the only example even with respect to norms, and it will be helpful to distinguish various things that fall under the general heading of a ‘norm’. Not everything that falls under this heading is a sanctioned prohibition. We can distinguish various items; I will represent them as stacked , in a way which is typical, but not by any means universal. (1) Behaviour which is normal. This does not just mean ‘frequent’: exceptions are perceived as ‘odd’, but are not necessarily disapproved of, sanctioned, etc. (2) (1) together with an institution. This can be applied to the case of marriage, where there will of course be usually sanctions of varying degrees against behaviours that threaten marriage, and sexual activity outside marriage may be disapproved of, but this does not imply that merely not engaging in marriage is disapproved of, nor that an unmarried condition is sanctioned. (3) Behaviour which lies outside (1) and (2), and to which in addition there may be strong personal disinclination: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in enlightened circles. (4) (3) together with rejection and disapproval of the deviant behaviour: e.g. homosexuality as regarded in less enlightened circles. (5) (4) together with sanctions personal or legal: e.g. homosexuality in the least enlightened circles. Among the cases in which the options are not stacked like this, is that in which the sanctions and disapproval exist against behaviour which is in fact frequent and not the subject, perhaps, of any deep personal disinclination; this, at the limit, is pure humbug, like the old school-master's attitude to masturbation. (1) to (3) of course raise some difficulties for a biological approach, particularly with regard to institutions, and an adequate treatment of the representation problem will deal with all these levels. The question of  inhibitions and prohibitions arises most clearly at levels (4) and (5). There is, moreover, a specially paradoxical version of it which arises from certain cases in which not only does extra conceptual content have to be introduced to characterize the human prohibition, but also the introduction of that content stands in conflict with the proposed biological explanation of it. A clear example of this arises with the famous example of the incest taboo, which has been discussed by Bateson (this volume). There are of course many incest taboos, that is to say, prohibitions on sexual relations between persons of various degrees of familial relation, and some of these are hardly even candidates for biological explanation. Moreover, there may well be some very severe doubts about the application of the biological model even to the favourite cases. The present discussion, is not, however, concerned with the factual merits of these explanations, but only with the shape that they take. In other species, there are behavioural drives the function of which is to avoid inbreeding. Such a drive, however, has to be operationalized in some other way, since the animals do not have any direct knowledge of the matters relevant to inbreeding: the inhibition against mating has to be triggered by the recognition of or reaction to some property adequately correlated with the kin relationship, such as being an individual with which the animal has been brought up. It is this inhibition that is allegedly displayed, in the well-known case, by those brought up in the kibbutz. But we have not yet reached any incest taboo. There are no sanctions against marrying those that one is brought up with (as such); the sanction is against marriages which would constitute close in-breeding. The conceptual content of the prohibition is thus different from the content that occurs in the description of the inhibition. It indeed relates to the suggested function of that inhibition, but that fact will not explain how the prohibition which is explicitly against in-breeding will have arisen. It certainly does not represent a mere ‘raising to consciousness’ of the inhibition. It can have come about, in fact, only given human knowledge of relevant facts — presumably, of the ill-effects of in-breeding. But once that is an essential step in the explanation, we no longer need the biological element in the explanation (of the prohibition, that is to say, rather than of the inhibition). It turns out that we have to appeal in any case to something like a rational collective agency, directed towards avoiding recognized and agreed evils, and that already provides an adequate explanation — a fairly traditional one — of the incest prohibition. A similar paradox can arise with other norms supposedly based at a biological level, but there are cases that avoid it. Consider for instance the  ‘double standard’ in sexual morality, traced by Symons (1979) to the disparity between ovum and sperm. This account, though it applies much more widely, is essentially the same as an explanation of these social phenomena which goes back at least to Hume, who accounted for ‘the artificial virtues of chastity and modesty in women’ by referring to the naturally greater disposition of males to protect children that they believe to be their own. Here again, there may be serious doubts about relevant anthropological facts, but the present point concerns the principle of the explanation, which involves an important difference from the incest case. Here, it is natural to think in terms of the institutionalization of a disposition which could be displayed in a simpler form pre-culturally. The conceptual content required in this case to describe the institution, though it involves a great deal of cultural elaboration, does not display the same kind of break between the pre-cultural and the cultural as is found in the incest case; and the biological pattern of explanation could recognizably run through such ideas as human beings finding certain institutions ‘natural’, which does not require any appeal to a rational collective agency to understand the basic biological idea, as is damagingly the case with the incest example. In fact, an explanation which went back to a biologically grounded disposition could in this case precisely avoid the invocation of rational collective agency, which is rather an intellectualist embarrassment to the story as Hume (1738–40) tells it. None of this implies that even if such biological elements did play some role in explaining these institutions, the institutions would then be necessary or unchangeable — even if the explanation were true, this could still be a case in which becoming conscious of their rationale was a help in changing them. In one of the two cases we have considered — incest — the prohibition is paradoxically related to pre-cultural dispositions: it expresses their function, but not their content. In the case just considered, social institutions could in principle be an expression of a pre-cultural disposition. In other cases, again, the existence of norms seems to be a substitute for a pre-cultural disposition. This might well be so with the control of aggression and of self-seeking behaviour; I shall make one or two remarks about this question without pursuing it at length. In the work of Maynard Smith and others (see, for example, Maynard Smith, this volume) games theory is applied to explaining selection for certain genetically based patterns of behaviour. Games theory can equally be applied to characterizing human norms which are instituted against aggression and other non-cooperative behaviour. (Ullmann-Margalit (1977) gives a recent analysis, though the outlines of the idea that  sanctioned norms can represent a solution to the Prisoners' Dilemma can be found in Hobbes.) The principles of the two applications of games theory are in many ways the same but their results point, in a sense, in opposite directions. If sanctioned norms are necessary in the human case, or socialization into rule-observing behaviour, this must be because constraints on human responses in these areas are not, or not significantly, genetically based. Granted structures of the Prisoners' Dilemma type, cooperative behaviour can be secured only granted a certain level of assurance, and the need of norms (in particular of sanctioned norms) to produce that assurance shows that the assurance cannot be adequately delivered by genetically based signals. It is very tempting to suppose that the lack of any such reliable signals, and the perilously low level of security often reached in human communities, must be connected with a high level of conceptual and, in particular, predictive thought, and also an associated capacity for deceit. This perhaps gives a special force to the Voltairean remark about the function of language being to conceal thought. The previous remarks have raised some questions about the relations between human norms and possible underlying dispositions determined at a biological level. They represent some aspects of what I have called the representation problem, and it is only through further investigation of that problem, and by becoming clearer about how the various kinds of norm could relate to our biological inheritance, that we can come to see much about what biological constraints there might be, beyond the obvious ones, on social and ethical arrangements. I do not believe it to be excluded a priori that there could be some, and I do not believe that very much is to be achieved by very general assertions or denials of the possibility. What is needed is more detailed analysis, not only anthropological but philosophical, of the demands that any explanations of this sort would have to meet. It will be needed, above all, if we are to be able to read the historical record. It is only if we can read that record that we can discover some very important biological characteristics of human beings, since (to repeat an earlier point) it is through convention, convention that has a history, that human nature is expressed. It is not merely that without a hold on the representation problem we cannot discover the relevant content in the historical record; without understanding that problem, we cannot adequately control the idea that there is any relevant content at all. If a biologically grounded disposition showed up simply in the form of what human beings could not or would not do, then there would be no real problem of alternative behaviours. The alternatives will simply be absent from the record, and it is unlikely that anyone, except as the most extreme  perversity, would want to undertake them. This, of course, is the area in which the is/ought argument scores its clear but uninteresting success. What is much more interesting, I have already suggested, is the idea that there could be patterns of behaviour which human beings are entirely capable of wanting and indeed, on an individual or limited scale, of achieving, but which for biological reasons are bound to be psychologically costly, or confined to a small group of otherwise unusual individuals, or otherwise bound to fail as general social institutions. To understand how this could be involves some understanding of the representation problem, and to decide that any given pattern of behaviour has this character of being, as one might put it, ‘biologically discouraged’ requires one to be able to read the historical record. It hardly needs emphasizing that on any question that is interesting, such as social roles of the sexes, we would have to be able to read the historical record better than we now can in order to arrive at any strong conclusions about what is biologically discouraged. I come back finally to what I mentioned at the beginning of this chapter as the area of ‘naturalism’ more broadly conceived: that is to say, the question of founding human ethics on considerations of human nature, in some way which goes beyond merely respecting the limits, biological or other, on what human beings are able to do. This is the project of thinking out, from what human beings are like, how they might best and most appropriately live. Such a project continues to attract some philosophers. Its attractions are obvious. It does not, in any obvious way, require any supernatural warrant, while it is less arbitrary or relativistic than other secular ways of looking at the content of morality. It seems to offer some promise of being both well-founded and contentful. It seems to me that a correct understanding of human evolution is very relevant to projects of this kind, but that the effect of that understanding is largely discouraging to them. This is for two different kinds of reason. The first is a reason at a more particular and factual level and is correspondingly more sensitive than the other to changes in hypotheses about the emergence of human beings. It is simply that the most plausible stories now available about that evolution, including its very recent date and also certain considerations about the physical characteristics of the species, suggests that human beings are to some degree a mess, and that the rapid and immense development of symbolic and cultural capacities has left man as a being for which no form of life is likely to prove entirely satisfactory, either individually or socially. Many of course have come to that conclusion before, and those who have tried to reach a naturalistic  morality which transcends it have had to read the historical record, or read beyond the historical record, in ways which seek to reveal a partly hidden human nature which is waiting to be realized or perfected. The evolutionary story, to the extent that it can now be understood (and to the much more modest extent to which I understand it myself) seems to me to give some support to the view that in this respect the historical story means very much what it seems to mean. The second and more general reason lies not in the particular ways in which human beings may have evolved, but simply in the fact that they have evolved, and by natural selection. The idea of a naturalistic ethics was born of a deeply teleological outlook, and its best expression, in many ways, is still to be found in Aristotle's philosophy, a philosophy according to which there is inherent in each natural kind of thing an appropriate way for things of that kind to behave. On that view it must be man's deepest desire — need?— purpose?— satisfaction?— to live in the way that is in this objective sense appropriate to him (the fact that modern words break up into these alternatives expresses the modern break-up of Aristotle's view). Other naturalistic views, Marxist and some which indeed call themselves ‘evolutionary’, have often proclaimed themselves free from any such picture, but it is basically very hard for them to avoid some appeal to an implicit teleology, an order in relation to which there would be an existence that would satisfy all the most basic human needs at once. The first and hardest lesson of Darwinism, that there is no such teleology at all, and that there is no orchestral score provided from anywhere according to which human beings have a special part to play, still has to find its way fully into ethical thought."
ACA ACA-ECV-001 2.29 "1 Introduction Morwenna Griffiths and Margaret Whitford Philosophy is in urgent need of a feminist perspective. For centuries the practice of philosophy has been overwhelmingly the prerogative of men but it is only recently that feminist analysis has made it possible to see the distorting effect of this historical fact. The articles in this book demonstrate in a variety of ways where the bias occurs and how it might be redressed. They also show that redressing it is a matter of importance to feminists as well as to philosophers. Feminist ideas are interrelated with philosophical ideas, but most feminist writing would not be recognised as ‘philosophy’. Unlike most academic philosophy much of it is personal, polemical, poetical or allusive. Yet part of the practice of feminism is concerned with the essentially philosophical activities of redrawing concepts, reclaiming language, redefining what counts as significant or important, and, as Daly (1984) calls it, ‘naming’. The reconceptualisation which feminism is attempting has a direct and vital bearing on central philosophical issues, not only in political philosophy where it might have been expected, but also in epistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind, and ethics. At the same time, in their attempts to rearticulate these basic issues, feminists necessarily take over and use philosophical concepts already available — and in so doing they may import, entailed or entangled in apparently neutral concepts, implications which reiterate and reinforce the assumptions that are being challenged. This point is made explicitly by several of the contributors to this volume (see Mary Midgley, Jean Grimshaw, Joanna Hodge and Anne Seller). Philosophy from a feminist perspective has practical implications for both philosophers and feminists. The practice and content of Western philosophy are male-dominated and male-biased. This statement is not directed at any one set of philosophers. It is true in general, in spite of the fact that philosophers by no means speak with a single voice, and do not even agree among themselves about what they understand philosophy to  be, since the nature of the subject, its preoccupations and methods, is itself a matter of philosophical disagreement. How then could philosophy in general be said to have a male bias? To see this one needs to take a closer look at some of the ways in which philosophy has been conceptualised. Western philosophy has a long tradition so it is not surprising that it has changed over the centuries both in content and in method. Schools and traditions, with their prescriptions about content, method or both, have risen and fallen, sometimes to rise up again in a new guise. Philosophers of all kinds continually look to thinkers from previous times for inspiration and argument, and schools can often be distinguished by which predecessors they read and discuss. Conversely, bitterly opposed schools can sometimes look to a common ancestor. The result of all this is a web of overlapping — but different — ways of conceiving of the nature of philosophy. The tradition that is presently characteristic of the Englishspeaking world, including the United Kingdom, is often called ‘analytic’. From about 1955 to 1975 it had a particularly strong hold here in the form of ‘conceptual analysis’ or ‘linguistic philosophy’, in which it was axiomatic that any ‘empirical’question was not philosophical. Philosophy was held to be a ‘second-order subject’ concerned only with reason, logic and the clarification of thought. It could be of use to ‘first-order’, empirically based subjects, but it could learn nothing from them. Plainly, any questions about sex or gender are necessarily non-philosophical, if philosophy is taken to be conceptual analysis in this narrow sense. Any attempt to introduce them into the discourse is immediately blocked by the slogan posing as question —‘but is it philosophy?’ Philosophy that limits itself to conceptual analysis can discuss the discourses of those who talk about sex and gender, looking for conceptual coherence and the presence or absence of rational argument. But it cannot treat gender as a theoretical or methodological category, that might structure its own tools and methods of inquiry, and so it cannot examine its own discourse for masculine bias. Unless the category of gender is explicitly seen as of methodological importance, the question cannot even be raised. Alternative traditions to the analytic one are mostly to be found in Continental Europe (and in some North American universities). Montefiore and Ishiguro (1979) point out: The universities of Europe which have not been influenced by the  analytical tradition…have by no means represented any unitary tradition. The disagreements, or even lack of communication, between, for instance, Hegelians, Marxists, phenomenologists and Thomists have often been deep. But these disagreements are ‘small’ in comparison with the barriers of mutual ignorance and distrust between the main representatives of the analytical tradition on the one hand and the main philosophical schools of the European continent on the other. (pp. viii–ix) These barriers have reached towering heights in the twentieth century, although information does slowly trickle through them. It is still true to say that many Continental philosophers would hardly be recognised as such by their English-speaking contemporaries. Montefiore and Ishiguro again: How unfortunate…that they have refused to read or respect one another, the one convinced that the other survives on undisciplined rhetoric and an irresponsible lack of rigour, the other suspecting the former of aridity, superficiality and over-subtle trivialization (Ibid., p. ix) Partly as a result of a slow trickle through the barriers, and partly as a result of internal inconsistencies, the analytic tradition has recently shown signs of moving from the strictly aloof position it adopted in the heyday of conceptual analysis. It is now possible, even in respectable academic circles in this country, to recognise that the concepts people use are related to the (changing) circumstances in which they live. The question ‘but is it philosophy?’ is losing its power to block further discussion. It remains true, however, that it is still deeply contentious to suggest the possibility of points of view in philosophy, let alone that substantial conclusions might be drawn from them. In this volume, the possibility of a women's point of view in philosophy is discussed directly by Paula Boddington from within the analytic tradition. Other contributors who are working within this tradition (Brenda Almond, Morwenna Griffiths, Mary Midgley and Anne Seller) also consider in what ways central philosophical issues might look different from a women's (or feminist) points of view. Other contributors, like Alison Assiter, Joanna Hodge and Margaret Whitford, have been influenced by the non-analytic  traditions of Continental Europe. In some ways these traditions are of especial interest to feminists since part of their history is an opposition to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century versions of the Enlightenment and the mechanistic, scientific, atomistic picture of the universe. These are concerns shared by substantial numbers of feminists. However, it is clear from these three papers that the Continental traditions themselves need to be subjected to feminist scrutiny. These traditions are, in theory, more hospitable than the analytic one to the idea of different points of view, but in practice their point of view has been overwhelmingly male. The feminist criticism of this volume is the more powerful because its contributors come from a variety of philosophical traditions. No doubt it will very quickly become apparent to the reader that there are differences in their philosophical assumptions that may not be reconcilable. Nor do they share any body of feminist dogma. It would be odd if they did, since feminists, like philosophers, do not speak with a single voice. We think it would be a mistake to try and establish any ‘consensual’ version of feminism or of feminist philosophy because we are committed to exploration of the beliefs and views we hold, even the ones which at present seem indisputable. At this point the question may well arise: since there are such profound differences among the contributors, how could these different views be said to constitute a perspective? And given the diversity both of contemporary philosophy and of contemporary feminism (Delmar, 1986), how could a feminist perspective in philosophy be recognised? One suggestion is that feminist philosophy could be identified by its content. This is not a suggestion we agree with, but it is a popular one, especially in North America where a number of closely related discussions have emerged recently about the content of feminist philosophy, or the form a feminist critique of philosophy should take (Flax, 1983; Hartsock, 1983; Jaggar, 1983; and see also Ruth, 1981). They include substantive conclusions about what would be different in philosophy if it were influenced by feminine rather than by masculine assumptions. For instance, Flax argues that certain preoccupations are typical of masculine philosophy, and arise out of dilemmas deeply rooted in the masculine unconscious, resulting from childrearing practices: Apparently insoluble dilemmas within philosophy are not the  product of the immanent structure of the human mind and/or nature but rather reflect distorted or frozen social relations. (p. 248) Philosophy reflects the fundamental division of the world according to gender and a fear and devaluation of women characteristic of patriarchal attitudes. (p. 268) The apparently irresolvable dualisms of subject-object, mind-body, inner-outer, reason-sense, reflect this dilemma. (pp. 269–70) Hartsock (1983) argues that for men but not for women: The core experience to be understood is that of discontinuity and its consequences. As a consequence of this experience of discontinuity and aloneness, penetration of ego-boundaries, or fusion with another is experienced as violent. Thus, the desire for fusion with another can take the form of domination of the other. (pp. 299–300) She argues that this perception of discontinuity and dominance has consequences for the way experience finds expression in the work of male philosophers. For women, in contrast, discontinuity is not the core experience, and relationships are not perceived as violent. Jaggar (1983) sums up the position as follows: ‘The standpoint of women generates an ontology of relations and of continual process’(p. 376). There are serious problems with this kind of content-based assertion, as Grimshaw (1986) points out in her discussion of ‘the maleness of philosophy’. Firstly, it ignores those male, often misogynist, philosophers who have emphasised relations and continual processes. She cites Hegel and Bradley as examples. We would also point out that prior to the seventeenth-century scientific revolution the universe was seen, by European men, as a great chain of being, connected rather than atomistic, necessarily related to humanity, rather than being a ‘neutral domain of facts, of contingently correlated elements, the tracing of whose correlations will enable greater and greater manipulation and control of the world’(Taylor, 1985, p. 134). Secondly, it distorts the history of philosophy by assuming that it has been unchanging in its  preoccupations and conceptualisations, which it clearly has not. However, as Lloyd (1984) shows in her tracing of changing ideas of reason, while ideas may change, their gender inflection may remain. Throughout the history of Western philosophy women have been thought inferior or less than fully human, though some philosophers, like Kant and Rousseau, have found them charming and necessary to men's well-being, as long as they keep in their place. Thirdly, it has a tendency to a rather static and essentialist picture of both ‘men’ and ‘women’, in this way ignoring the important and real differences between women themselves. We do not think that any particular content in philosophy can be identified as female. Where we agree with the suggestions of the feminist philosophers we have just quoted is in their insistence that philosophical theory comes out of experience, so that philosophy formulated exclusively by men will reflect the experience of men. But we also want to emphasise that neither the experiences men have nor their ideas about masculinity have remained constant. They have varied over history and they still vary today with race, culture and class. But however much they vary, the symbolic division of the world by gender appears to be a constant and fundamental way of articulating experience. Therefore, the experience of women will vary systematically over time, place and circumstance, in step with, but different from, the experience of men. As several of the contributors point out, one should be wary of reducing women's experiences (plural) to women's experience (singular). But the division of the world by gender continues to underlie these changes. Gender is defined by opposition. To be masculine is not to be feminine. Feminine is what is not masculine. What appears on either side of the male-female divide is extremely variable. For instance, whether males tend to be warlike, bookish, competitive, cooperative, individualist or role-oriented is specific to time and place. But where masculinity is associated with any one of these, femininity will be associated with the opposite, and, where women are oppressed, taken to be inferior. Philosophy, in so far as it is the articulation of the concepts, dilemmas, explanations and abstractions of a culture, will only be half the story unless both genders contribute equally. As far as our own history is concerned, feminist criticism shows that Western philosophy has been consistently masculine in orientation even while it has changed its  preoccupations and methods. But the other half of the story cannot be simply added on. Grimshaw (1986) suggests: The trouble with [a view that what is needed is a re-evaluation of the feminine]is that it still leaves uncriticised the whole association of particular qualities with the masculine and others with the feminine… A response to the gender inflection or masculinism of philosophical theories should involve, I think, neither merely the assertion that women too should be seen as included under or capable of whatever norms are suggested by the theory, nor merely the assertion that what is seen as feminine should be valued too, or given equal status with what is male. Rather, what is needed is a critique of the polarisation of masculine and feminine qualities, and in particular a critique of the way in which such qualities may be interpreted or clustered. (pp. 47–8) Grimshaw emphasises that femininity or masculinity are not fixed, nor are they independent of each other. We would add that to suggest giving equal status to what is currently thought to be feminine or masculine is to ignore the way in which one is defined by the other. In our culture to give equal status is a contradiction in terms, so long as gender is an expression of power relations and the male continues to be the superior term. We are saying, in short, that a feminist perspective in philosophy is necessarily critical. Like any other philosophy it is specific to its circumstances. It will depend on the characteristic experiences of women and men at the time of its formulation, and on the way they have entered into philosophical discourse. Feminist criticisms and contributions need to expose and redress distortions where they are found. Thus, if maleness is especially associated with individualism, feminists may need to point to connectedness, but if connectedness is part of the male view, emphasising it won't be feminist. Intuition is now said to be ‘feminine’, and is opposed to logic (which is thereby ‘masculine’). But intuition used to be the favoured type of knowledge, and St Thomas Aquinas, for example, would never have allowed intuition to constitute a specifically feminine attribute, because it would have meant admitting that women were nearer God. Since the feminist perspective is necessarily critical, feminist  philosophy is not a way of articulating women's experience in parallel with men's: it is not a form of relativism. This is a particularly important point. That which a feminist perspective enables us to perceive is valid for everyone. However, since we have argued that content is not the defining criterion of feminist perspectives, we are not claiming a new objectivity or neutrality. We are not claiming that women on their own (or feminists on their own) have the truth, but rather that men on their own do not. Therefore, here again we have reservations about the position articulated by Alison Jaggar (1983) at the end of an excellent discussion of political philosophy from a feminist perspective: Women's subordinate status means that, unlike men, women do not have an interest in mystifying reality and so are likely to develop a clearer and more trustworthy understanding of the world. A representation of reality from the standpoint of women is more objective and unbiased than the prevailing representations that reflect the standpoint of men. The concept of women's standpoint also provides an interpretation of what it is for a theory to be comprehensive. It asserts that women's social position offers them access to aspects or areas of reality that are not easily accessible to men… The standpoint of women reveals more of the universe, human or non-human, than the standpoint of men. (pp. 384–5) Though appealing and heroic, such a vision seems to claim too much. But although we are not arguing that women or feminists have privileged access to the truth about reality, we agree with Jaggar that the standpoint of women offers an opportunity to see what is wrong with current male-defined theories and to correct them. It could be objected at this point that all philosophy is critical, that all philosophical theory attempts to question, correct or overturn current orthodoxy and so that feminist philosophy is just philosophy, and there is nothing specifically feminist about it. The difference is, of course, that feminist criticism arises from the experience of feminism and from taking feminist theories seriously. This would be true whatever the particular circumstances which produced the feminist response. The experience of becoming feminist inevitably leads to changes in one's view of oneself, and in one's view of the rest of the world. It  is never an intellectual exercise which leaves everything the same. It is a discovery that changing concepts is a political activity: that it is not value-free, but is tied to the adoption of a particular interpretation of the world. The result is a re-evaluation of one's personal life, a re-evaluation which is often surprising and usually difficult. Things which were previously seen as obviously true come to be seen as obviously false. The tensions generated by this process (and by the kinds of activity, personal and political, which accompany it) have philosophical consequences, both concerning which concepts seem problematic, and also what is problematic about them. The articles in this book explore some of these consequences. A preoccupation common to all the papers in the book springs directly from the difficulties involved in reassessing how the ‘facts’ of one's experience correspond to the descriptions of them offered by others. It could be summarised by the feminist slogans, ‘the personal is political’ or ‘the politics of experience’. Whatever the problems with these rather global and unanalytic formulations, none the less they do encapsulate one indispensable and basic argument of feminism, the argument that women's experience has been left out: one of the central themes of feminism has been the importance of women's experience, and one of its central enterprises has been to show how a great deal of male theorising about women has tended to deny, invalidate, or be unable to account for this experience. This is not to say that women's experience, perceptions, feelings and emotions are self-validating and constitute in themselves an epistemological standpoint, or even to say that they are always correctly identified and described, but it is to suggest that philosophy would look rather different if women's experience had the same rights of entry as that of men. Most of the contributors draw attention to this point in one way or another. For example, Morwenna Griffiths refers to the feminist emphasis on generating abstractions on the basis of concrete, personal experience (rather than assuming that inherited abstractions adequately explain experience). One of the strengths of this approach is that it becomes much more immediately apparent why certain issues are felt to be important. The experience of trying to force one's perceptions into preconceived categories, and the pain and distortion that this has often led to, is now used as a basis by feminist theorists for the argument that to see feeling as ‘contaminating’ objective, scientific knowledge points to a distortion of conceptualisation. As Jaggar (1983) points out, this is  not a simple process of incorporating the neglected experience: ‘a theory may require that we revise even the description of the world on which the theory itself is based’(p. 381). The contributors are not making the easy assumption that to validate their experience women do not have to put themselves into question; on the contrary, it must be recognised that to be a feminist theorist may involve some painful and hard-won putting into question of the beliefs and commitments that are the point of departure. But the contributors all agree on the importance of that experience. In these papers, all kinds of non- and extra-philosophical activities become the basis for philosophical reflection, for instance menstruation and childbirth (Brenda Almond's paper); a gut reaction to pornography (Alison Assiter's paper); the fantasies that disturb because of their apparently unfeminist nature Jean Grimshaw's paper); and nonviolent demonstrations against missile bases (Anne Seller's paper); the point in each case being that these experiences are the starting point, because their importance did not seem to be recognised within the theoretical categories already provided, and so urgently impel the theorist to work out categories that are more adequate. A second preoccupation evident in these papers is responsibility, and what could roughly be described as the ethical dimension of conceptualisation. Several contributors explicitly criticise the social atomist conception of human beings, defined by Mary Midgley in this volume as follows: This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, that an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties. As she goes on to argue, ‘The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description.’ Because the life-experience of women is normally so different from that of men, they are likely to conceptualise freedom, equality, rights, responsibility and autonomy, to give but a few examples, in a rather different way from men. Thus Brenda Almond suggests that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are morally significant. In our culture women typically conceptualise themselves in relation to others; discussion of the implications of this can be found in several of the papers (Alison Assiter, Lorraine Code, Jean Grimshaw and Judith Hughes). The result of seeing the difference in women's experiences in positive rather than negative terms — seeing women as having something to  offer philosophy rather than seeing them as inferior or aberrant versions of a male norm — is that the contours of familiar conceptual landscapes begin to change. Judith Hughes, for example, puts forward a way of seeing autonomy (and adulthood) based primarily on the notion of responsibility rather than that of rationality, thus giving an ethical dimension to autonomy. Lorraine Code argues that epistemology should not be divorced from ethics; one should be a responsible knower. Alison Assiter extends the notion of autonomy into the private realm where the tradition cautiously refrains from setting foot, and suggests that how we treat and are treated by other people in private has a direct bearing on our autonomy in the public sphere. The ideal of an unrelated self is shown to be an ideal developed by people who have never been in the position of having primary responsibility for the care of children or the old. This position, actual or potential for all women, leads to a version of the self which is more likely to be defined in relationship and which therefore implies certain commitments or responsibilities which can hardly be denied. Where standard discussions of autonomy place it in the context of rights, freedom and equality, paternalism and rationality, here it is discussed in conjunction with questions of fantasy, how we treat others, social and personal relations, and responsibilities. Where standard discussions of the self talk about memory and unity, brain transplants, the rational agent acting on his beliefs and desires, or the self in its public aspect as citizen, here the self is looked at in the context of the past history of a person, unconscious or fantasy relationships with others, the importance of feelings, or the body. This is not simply an alternative or complementary perspective, since it raises directly the issue that what counts as a philosophical problem is itself an issue for critical inquiry. We have been arguing that changing concepts is a political activity; that it is not value-free, but arises out of a particular ethical or political interpretation of the word, and that one of the aims of the dialogue between feminism and philosophy should precisely be to reconceptualise the world that is offered by philosophy as it is at present. Some feminists would expand this argument to suggest that the political and/or ethical discussion should be made an explicit part of the methodology of philosophy. Harding (1986) argues that since scientific knowledge (the epistemological paradigm) is in any case used for social ends, social aims should determine the formulation of scientific or epistemological problems. Along the same lines, Anne Seller in this volume argues for a more democratic epistemology. From this perspective, ethics in the broad sense (the question of relations with and responsibilities towards other people or a community) is not just a branch of philosophy but informs the conception of what philosophy is or might be. Contributors to this volume were given no more precise brief than the provisional subtitle ‘explorations in philosophy from a feminist perspective’, and they are working within quite different philosophical traditions and on different sorts of issues. However, the papers are unified by a common factor: they all draw on a body of writing and thinking — with admittedly elastic boundaries — which is not taken seriously by the mainstream as having anything to offer philosophy. Providing an outline of each paper in the second part of the introduction, below, we draw attention to the feminist debates which are the source for each contributor's point of departure. In the third and final section we give a brief survey of the most well-known publications in the area of philosophy from a feminist perspective. We hope this will be of value to both feminists and philosophers approaching these questions for the first time. The opening paper, by Mary Midgley, discusses the central issue of the possibility and necessity of a women's point of view. She addresses the tensions generated by two related dilemmas in feminist thinking, and points out why they have a wider relevance in philosophical and political thought. The first of these tensions is about the degree of attention that needs to be paid to natural (i.e. genetically given) sex differences and similarities. The second, related one is about the reasons for treating all people as if they were the same, regardless of their individual peculiarities of sex and gender. She relates these concerns to the philosophical projects of finding universals of human nature, of morality and of political being, and in particular, to the project of achieving equality between individuals of varying class, race, age and cultural background. The questions are both political and controversial. As Midgley makes clear, discussions of natural sex differences can never be simply a neutral issue, even if it is an empirical one, since one still has to consider what consequences should follow from the differences one has discovered. Feminists began by arguing that sex differences are artificial and insignificant, for the very good reason that the idea of natural differences had so often been used to justify discriminatory treatment against women. Midgley argues that it is time to move on  from this position. She sees natural sex differences as providing the basis for a critique of certain philosophical conceptions which exclude women, and in that way is enlisting them on the side of feminism. The view that philosophical conceptions may be not so much ‘universal’ as ‘male’is discussed further in the next paper. Brenda Almond draws on recent feminist arguments that women's distinctive perspective and experience lead them to view morality in a different light from men. This distinctive perspective is derived from a focus on the concrete, as opposed to the abstract, and is characterised by an emphasis on responsibility rather than on rights. Almond suggests a number of ways in which the ancient idea that the two sexes have — or should have — different moral outlooks can be given new life in the context of modern feminism. She considers whether it is true to claim that there is a sex-related divergence of views, and the possible reasons for any such divergence, and goes on to suggest that there are areas in which women's views may typically differ from those of men. In particular, Almond questions the notion of autonomy as it has been developed since Kant, arguing that this notion is of limited value to women, since ‘the ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy has in practice almost always been outside a woman's grasp'. She suggests that women's distinctive experience leads them to form a moral sensibility that is closer to aesthetic response than to the legalism implicit in much principle-based morality. Almond argues, like Midgley, that women's experience adds a positive and complementary contribution to our ethical conceptions. An ethical perspective is also present in Alison Assiter's paper, in which she argues that the Kantian or Hegelian notion of autonomy should apply to sexual relations as much as to the public world of social contract. She suggests that persons and their autonomy should be respected in all private and personal activities, including erotic fantasy. The argument should be seen in the context of feminist debates about pornography and its significance. One of the clearest discussions of these debates can be found in Elizabeth Wilson's book What Is to Be Done about Violence against Women?(1983). She points out that what feminist thought has done is to take pornography out of its usual position in the argument between conservatives and liberals over censorship, and to put it into a completely different framework (p. 137). For feminists, there is another context which gives the phenomenon of pornography a different meaning: the social context of violence against women. Pornography is seen as one manifestation among others of the way in which women are controlled by male power or violence (other manifestations are rape, or the fear of rape, wife-battering, prostitution, child-abuse, etc. ).(For further discussion see Brownmiller, 1975; Lederer, 1980; Dworkin, 1981; Griffin, 1981; and Kappeler, 1986 which are directly concerned with pornography, and Snitow et al ., 1984; and Vance, 1984 on sexuality.) Like these writers, Assiter makes a consideration of pornography central to a consideration of women's social situation. She enters the feminist debate here, arguing that some feminists have misunderstood the significance of pornography, taking it to be a major cause of the oppression of women, rather than a symptom of it, albeit a symptom which itself then contributes to that oppression. It is now beginning to be argued by feminists that in order to deal with pornography and what the phenomenon reveals, we have first to understand it, understand, that is, the meaning and function of fantasy for both men and women, and what effects it has on the rest of one's life (see Wilson, 1983 for a summary of this discussion, and also Carter, 1979; Linden et al.,1982; Midgley and Hughes, 1983). For Assiter, fantasy is not just a harmless and essentially solitary activity in which everyone engages to a greater or lesser extent, but is something which also has an effect on the way people behave towards others, and on the way they may feel they can justifiably treat each other, particularly women. There is thus a connection between people's private fantasies and their status as autonomous individuals. Drawing on a notion of autonomy which originates with Kant, and which is developed in the writings of Hegel and Marx, Assiter extends this notion and criticises the way in which it has been confined to the public sphere. In arguing for the relevance of the notion of autonomy in private life, she brings into question the demarcation point between private and public life which is assumed by most of the philosophical tradition she is working in. It has been pointed out by feminists that the tradition which depends upon this demarcation line fails to give a satisfactory account of conflicts that arise in the private sphere. Thus two apparently unrelated discussions: the notion of autonomy in relation to the public-private distinction, and pornography, are shown here to be intimately related .4 The notion of autonomy is discussed in a different context by Judith Hughes in the next paper which, like Assiter's, illuminates  the concept from a new angle and, like Almond's, emphasises the importance of responsibility. Underlying Hughes's paper are questions about how children figure in political debate, what problems the considerations about children bring to light, whether these problems have any special significance for women, and whether women's new awareness of their own political situation can be used effectively in thinking about children. Thinking about these questions produces the conclusions that are the starting point for Hughes's paper: that the philosopher's child invariably turns out to be male and that autonomy seems to be for men only. These conclusions lead her to argue that rationality has been falsely assumed to be the criterion of political adulthood, and that rationality does not entail autonomy. Thus, analysing the attempt by political philosophers to justify the exclusion of women from public life on the grounds of their defective capacities (either rational, moral or cognitive), she suggests that there is a hidden argument which takes the exclusion of women to be unquestionable and attempts to justify the status quo by seeking an explanation in the defective capacities that women must then be assumed to have. She argues that autonomy should not be seen as a psychological capacity, but as a social one, depending on public acknowledgement, and that this acknowledgement arises from the recognition of responsibility rather than of rationality. A fourth paper discussing the notion of autonomy indicates the importance of the concept for women, for whom the experience of dependence and powerlessness is often a central feature of their lives. Jean Grimshaw looks at some of the ways in which feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be autonomous, and the relationship between these conceptions and philosophical ways of thinking about the human self. She locates her argument within both feminism and philosophical thought. She considers the idea, implicit in much feminist theory, of an authentic self which is said to be socially conditioned by patriarchal power, and argues that this idea owes much to a tradition in Western philosophy which dates back to the Aristotelian distinction between actions that are voluntary and actions which are coerced, a tradition that can be traced through Descartes to the present time. Grimshaw argues that feminists' appeal to this humanistic conception of the self as a unitary, atomistic, conscious and rational core is quite inadequate to conceptualise experiences such as self-deception or obsessional delusions, or the contradictions which feminists have described  between their rationally held views and political convictions on the one hand, and their emotions and desires on the other. In order to account for women's lack of autonomy it is not sufficient to think merely in terms of removing a veil, or stripping away the outer layers. The concrete experiences of women (and men) are here used as the basis for a critique of a particular conception of the Grimshaw suggests that Freud and psychoanalysis might offer an explanatory account of the self of considerable value. Both feminists and contemporary philosophers in England and America have had an uneasy relationship with psychoanalytic theory. Philosophers have been primarily preoccupied with the scientific status of psychoanalysis and whether its therapeutic claims can be substantiated. They have, on the whole, ignored it as a theory of mind, though a few (such as Richard Wollheim) have been deeply influenced. Feminists have been antagonistic to psychoanalysis, seeing it as a means for the social control of women, although over the last few years, the mood has shifted, and psychoanalysis is being re-examined for its possible value to feminists (see Sayers (1986) for an overview). In France, psychoanalysis has been taken more seriously by both feminists and philosophers, and the psychoanalytic model used as a basis for the reconceptualisation of a number of philosophical issues. The paper by Margaret Whitford shows how the feminist philosopher and psychoanalyst, Luce Irigaray, uses psychoanalytic theory to provide a critique of Western rationality and the traditional symbolism, which symbolises rationality as ‘male’(see Lloyd, 1984). Foregrounding the theme of sexual difference, Irigaray locates male-female symbolism as one of the fundamental underlying polarities of Western thought. Placing Irigaray's work in the context of Freudian and post-Freudian theory, Whitford suggests that Irigaray's apparently very traditional and essentialist use of symbolism has a strategic function, like that of Derrida's analyses, designed to draw attention to the underpinnings of Western metaphysics, in order to undermine them. Feminists have approached the work of Irigaray eagerly, looking for a theory which would help to understand and change the situation of women, but have been divided in their interpretations of her writing. Some see a romantic celebration of difference, a static, essentialising, ahistorical view of women, others find her work politically equivocal. Whitford's view is that Irigaray's work has been read out of context, and that we need to give much more careful attention to the  psychoanalytic dimension of her thought. Her argument is that Irigaray, as a psychoanalyst, sees psychoanalysis as a process of change rather than as a scientific theory: Irigaray's work suggests ways in which psychoanalysis could be seen as a model for feminists seeking fundamental social change, in particular by proposing an alternative model for the relation between the rational and the non-rational which would be more satisfactory than the dominant paradigm. In the next paper Morwenna Griffiths also addresses the question of the relation between the rational and the non-rational. Drawing on the re-evaluation of emotion characteristic of contemporary feminist theory and practice, she argues that feminist conceptions of emotion constitute a critique of dualist conceptions of mind found in much Western philosophy in the English-speaking world and elsewhere. She refers, in particular, to radical feminists who turn on its head the criticism that women are more emotional than men, and claim that not only are women more emotional, but that this is their strength, and that in comparison, men are enfeebled, deadened and impoverished creatures. As Griffiths points out, there are problems with this position, but she argues that, despite its flaws, its passionate impetus to reconceptualisation is invaluable. Griffiths suggests that the legacy of Descartes to the philosophical understanding of emotions has been to subsume them into one of two categories, mind or body, and to make them rational or non-rational. She proposes an alternative model of mind in which feelings are paid sufficient attention, and in which, through language, they are seen to be intelligent rather than rational, non-rational or irrational. She argues that one's feelings are a source of knowledge as well as being a result of understanding, and that for both social and biological reasons they are gender-related. Thus she concludes that being male or female gives one a distinctive viewpoint which should be included in any theory of human beings. She also endorses the radical feminist view that the well-being of private and public life depends on a better understanding of feeling. The legacy of Descartes comes in for further scrutiny in Joanna Hodge's paper, which examines the concept of ‘the subject’ which philosophy has inherited from Descartes. This concept, she suggests, has been both valuable and limiting for women. Valuable, in that, by providing a conception of an autonomous, rational and apparently neutral subject, it made it possible for Enlightenment liberalism (in particular Mary Wollstonecraft) to question the  exclusion of women from public life. Limiting, in that it conceals a covert gender specificity which operates to justify women's continued exclusion — whether from public life or philosophy. Now, however, contemporary critiques of the notion of the subject (see, for example, Heideggerian phenomenology, structuralism, psychoanalysis or Derrida's deconstruction) have begun to dismantle the assumptions concealed in the notion of subjectivity. In her densely argued and complex paper, Hodge points out that one can distinguish between the subject , a notion with ontological and metaphysical commitments, and subjectivity , an empiricist notion (developed, for example, by Hume) which retains its epistemological function while abandoning its ontological links. Descartes, effecting a split between rational consciousness and sensual embodiment, offered an account of the mind-body relationship which accepted the traditional hierarchy according to which reason governs the body or the senses. He saw the body in functionalist terms, but failed to make a distinction between the different functions of the male and female bodies. Subsequent empiricist versions avoid the Cartesian problem of the relation between mind and body by focusing instead on the epistemological processes of subjectivity , but in this way obscure even further the nature of the body attached to these processes. However, feminism brings back to the centre of the debate the ontological issue of the different kinds of body to which the rational processes may be ‘attached’. Feminist analysis has shown in detail that women's bodies bear cultural meanings that are quite different from those ascribed to men's bodies. This difference is particularly visible in the phenomenon of pornography which serves to foreground the issue of the nature of the body, an issue not discussed by Descartes and completely absent from subsequent post-Cartesian philosophy. Hodge argues therefore that women's epistemological position cannot be exactly the same as men's. Like Assiter, then, Hodge suggests a link between the issue of pornography and the notion of an autonomous and rational subject. Her paper argues for the importance of standpoint to be taken into account in discussion of fundamentals such as epistemology and ontology, but also suggests that feminist political theories which assume that a conception of the subject is already available need to be complemented by more radical feminist theories (such as those of Daly or Irigaray) which criticise and take apart the metaphysical implications inherent in philosophical conceptions of the subject. The epistemological issue is discussed in more detail in the following two papers. Firstly, Anne Seller's paper argues that the view of knowledge as a correct description of the world has only limited application. The epistemological model of truth and falsity which applies to formal statements of propositions turns out to be difficult to apply in the context of social and political life. Like Hodge, Seller takes the view that women who uncritically adopt philosophical conceptions of knowledge may find themselves saddled with consequences that are at odds with their perceptions of the world and their politics. She discusses this in relation to epistemological stances of realism and relativism. ‘Realism’ and ‘relativism’are not exact terms. They are each used here to gesture at a range of philosophical positions. Realists are impressed by the constraints imposed by the ‘external world’ on what we know and can know. Seller takes realism as the view that ‘there is an objective order of reality which can be known by the human observer’. She discusses this in relation to the view held by some feminists that ‘every woman's experience of the world is valid, not false, illusory or mistaken, and that all views of the world are equally valid’. She considers the strengths and weaknesses of both positions and shows how the epistemological and political questions are intertwined with each other. She argues that the main task is that of deciding what to do, and that the best way of deciding is through a genuinely democratic epistemology. Once this is achieved, she suggests, the dichotomy between realism and relativism becomes irrelevant; both will proceed in the same way in trying to sort out what is going on and what to do. Lorraine Code's paper arises out of a concern on the one hand with the epistemological status of experiences, and on the other, with the importance of recognising the ethical dimensions of knowing: what she terms ‘knowing well’ or ‘taking epistemic responsibility’. She elucidates her concept of epistemic responsibility by focusing on the practice of stereotyping, and in particular, the stereotyping of women by men. The philosophical tradition she is working within is Kantian: she emphasises that human cognition is an ‘active process of taking and structuring experience’, and therefore, she argues, a process that entails freedom and responsibility and the associated ethical virtues of honesty, humility and courage. This active process is hindered for everyone if they use stereotypes. It is rendered particularly difficult for women who have been stereotyped, because the stereotype of  women is one which precludes the exercise of active responsibility. The other central theme of Code's paper is the relation between experience and knowledge. She argues against the Kantian tradition of seeking a pure, clear objectivity in knowledge which will leave personal experience behind. A concept of knowing well which rejects stereotyping cannot move very far from the experience which generates the knowledge. She defines the area of feminist epistemology as that of developing theoretical accounts of knowledge which retain continuity with women's experiences. In a critical discussion of Carol Gilligan's work in moral development (Gilligan, 1982), she notes that Gilligan's methodological principles, in particular the aim of listening responsively with receptiveness and humility, supply an example of the kind of approach that might fulfil this aim. The concluding paper, by Paula Boddington, returns to the issue of a women's point of view and what difference this might make to philosophy, leaving the reader with a kind of map of the basic issues to be explored: ‘an opening up of complexities’. Situating herself within the Anglo-Saxon analytic tradition, she looks at different conceptions of philosophy, its content and methods. Readers unfamiliar with philosophy will find her discussion of the nature of philosophy illuminating; they should be warned, though, that philosophers are likely to find it contentious. Including a review of material already published about women and philosophy, she distinguishes between female, feminine and feminist points of view, and then, focusing on the first of these, she considers how philosophy could or would be affected by the inclusion of more women in its institutional structures. She looks first at how the present conceptions and practices of philosophy might admit of different points of view at all. She then goes on to consider what might be changed by the inclusion of more women. Finally she returns to her original distinction between female, feminine and feminist, and suggests how the relation between them might have implications for possible developments in the practice of philosophy. She concludes that women's views need to be considered and then synthesised with men's to ‘find a human whole’. What is now known as ‘second-wave’ feminism emerged in the late sixties and seventies. By the early seventies, articles that saw themselves as explicitly feminist were beginning to appear in  philosophy journals (e.g. The Monist , special issue, 1973). As women began to cast a critical eye over the discipline of philosophy, a number of different types of work appeared. These can be divided, very broadly, into the following categories (although the categories clearly overlap both chronologically and conceptually). Firstly, there were discussions of issues thought to be of particular interest or relevance to women, such as abortion or equality. Many of these discussions are to be found in the early collections (see, for example, Gould and Wartofsky, 1976; English, 1977; Vetterling-Braggin, Elliston and English, 1977). An extended discussion of this kind can be found in The Sceptical Feminist by Janet Radcliffe Richards (1980). These discussions are characterised by an increasing scope and depth as the issues are accorded greater philosophical seriousness. Thematic collections on issues of particular concern to women continue to appear, for example The Family in Political Thought (Elshtain, ed., 1982) or Mothering (Trebilcot, ed., 1984). A couple of recent collections which bring together a range of articles on a variety of topics are 'Femininity', ‘Masculinity’ and ‘Androgyny ’: A Modern Philosophical Analysis , edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin (1982b) and the special issue of Radical Philosophy (1983) on ‘Women, Gender and Philosophy’. Secondly there was the re-examination and reinterpretation of the history of philosophy, looking at philosophers through ‘the prism of sex’ to see what they had to say about women. In practice, since philosophy often proceeds by paying attention to past philosophers and their ideas, the two categories overlapped to some extent with each other, and with a third category, political philosophy, which looks at the political philosophers in the light of the practice and experiences of feminist politics (see Okin, 1980; Elshtain, 1981; O'Brien, 1981). As the often misogynistic views of philosophers were exposed, two lines of approach were adopted. Either one could discard what the philosopher had said about women and keep the rest — which in fact often meant accepting conceptions of human nature that took the male as paradigm, and trying to demonstrate that women were as fully human as men, or one could argue that the philosopher's thought formed a system within which the attitude towards women formed an inseparable part (see Elshtain's (1981) discussion of the private-public distinction or Grimshaw (1986) for the examples of Aristotle and Kant), so that it was impossible just to take certain parts and leave the rest. The second of these choices was the one that most feminists adopted, and as a result the next decade  was marked by an increasing self-confidence on the part of feminists about their place in philosophy. This led to a fourth type of work which discussed the nature and limits of philosophy itself and whether there was any place for women in it, and considered whether the basic assumptions of philosophy included or excluded women. Here we would just like to mention briefly some of the studies that came out between 1980 and 1986, which attempt to develop accounts that would be either specifically feminist or draw upon a women's point of view. Under the heading of political philosophy, feminist philosophers begin by arguing with the tradition, trying to reconcile feminist insights with already existing systems of thought such as liberalism or Marxism, and go on to attempt to define a new perspective in philosophy. In The Politics of Reproduction (1981), Mary O'Brien rereads traditional political theory's preoccupation with the family and reproduction, and uses a revised version of dialectical materialism with a view to developing a feminist theory. She argues for the view that there is such a thing as a ‘feminist perspective’ and criticises feminist theorists (de Beauvoir, Millett, Firestone and Reed) who depend too heavily on existing (male) theories. Jean Bethke Elshtain, in Public Man, Private Woman. Women in Social and Political Thought (1981), looks at the way political thought has conceptualised the public-private distinction and its bearing on attitudes towards women, and critically examines contemporary feminist versions of that same distinction. Alison Jaggar, in Feminist Politics and Human Nature (1983), looks at the relation between feminist theory and political philosophy, arguing that different feminist theories — liberal feminism, radical feminism, Marxist feminism and socialist feminism — imply different conceptions of human nature and have different implications for practice. A collection of essays edited by Ellen Kennedy and Susan Mendus,Women in Western Political Philosophy (1987), presents a feminist perspective on questions that have been central to political philosophy and raises questions about the philosophical underpinning of political theory. In ethics, there have been attempts to incorporate or develop a women's point of view, perceived as missing from mainstream theory. Carol Gilligan, in In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development (1982), examines psychological theories concerning human moral development, and suggests that a male model has been developed which does not fit the experiences of  most women's lives. Criticising a rights-based ethics, she suggests that an alternative view of morality is needed which would include a typically feminine way of conceptualising the relationship between self and other. Nel Noddings describes her book,Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education (1984), as ‘an essay in practical ethics from the feminine view’ and attempts to evolve a specifically feminine form of ethics. A recent collection,Women and Morality , edited by Eva Kittay and Diana Meyers (1986) widens the discussion by bringing together different viewpoints on the issues raised by Gilligan. A variety of work has appeared addressing issues relating to reason, rationality and emotion. Carol McMillan, in Women, Reason and Nature (1982), argues that feminism makes the same mistake as anti-feminism in its excessive belief in rationality and empiricism, and consequently undervalues emotion, intuition and the private sphere. Genevieve Lloyd, in The Man of Reason: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’in Western Philosophy (1984), looks at the way in which Western philosophy has conceptualised reason, and shows that throughout its history ideals of reason have incorporated an exclusion of the feminine, which creates both practical and conceptual problems for women who may experience conflicts between reason and femininity. (This study contains a useful bibliographical essay on women and philosophy, going up to 1983.) Mary Daly, in Pure Lust (1984), a polemical book subtitled ‘Elemental Feminist Philosophy’ which explicitly and insistently refuses to fit the usual categories of what philosophy is supposed to consist of, argues that the passions and their relation to reason must be renamed, and thus reunderstood by women if they wish to free themselves from the constrictions inherent in the male naming of them. In the areas of language and epistemology, there is a collection of essays edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin,Sexist Language: A Modern Philosophical Analysis (1982a), which usefully brings together a wide range of articles by a variety of contributors. Another collection, edited by Sandra Harding and Merrill Hintikka,Discovering Reality (1983), a wide-ranging and challenging selection of essays in epistemology, metaphysics, methodology and philosophy of science, argues that it is not just content but also methodological assumptions and epistemology which show male bias. This book draws extensively on the work of Nancy Chodorow (1978) and object-relations theory in psychoanalysis concerning the construction of male and female personality. A recent book by  Sandra Harding,The Science Question in Feminism (1986), develops the work in epistemology and philosophy of science, and examines the work of feminist theorists in this area. Harding shows the obstacles to, and the far-reaching consequences of, trying to construct a theory of gender as an analytic category that is relevant to the natural sciences. Most recent work is often concerned with philosophical issues within feminism itself. Mary Midgely and Judith Hughes, in Women's Choices (1983), discuss the philosophical issues facing feminism. They locate the various strands in feminist thinking, and show the conceptual problems involved in combining them. The collection edited by Carol Gould,Beyond Domination: New Perspectives on Women and Philosophy (1983), discusses some of the philosophical problems raised by feminism. Jean Grimshaw, in Feminist Philosophers: New Perspectives on Philosophical Traditions (1986), explores tensions in feminist thought and examines some of the philosophical problems underlying them. The work of French women theorists is also beginning to be translated and discussed in this country, although for French theorists, the boundaries between philosophy, literary theory and psychoanalytic theory are often fluid, so that their work does not always fall clearly into the familiar categories of philosophy. However, the work of Christine Delphy, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Michele Le Doeuff (to name the most well known) is currently being discussed by feminists working in the area of philosophy or feminist theory. An impressive overview of the context in which contemporary French theory is being thought is offered by Alice Jardine in Gynesis: Configurations of Women and Modernity (1985). Jane Gallop's book,Feminism and Psychoanalysis (1982), is an excellent introduction to the range and implications of French feminist theory. A more accessible introduction can be found in Claire Duchen, whose book Feminism in France: From May ‘68 to Mitterrand (1986) contains a couple of chapters discussing the central theoretical issues."
ACA ACA-ECV-005 2.09 "5 The Philosopher's Child Judith Hughes SOME OF OUR CHILDREN ARE MISSING Children have served philosophy very well. That is the first thing which anyone surveying the literature would notice. Along with a selection from a list including women, animals, madmen, foreigners, slaves, patients and imbeciles, children have served in that great class of beings, the ‘not-men’, in contrast with which male philosophers have defined and valued themselves. Unlike the others who appear and disappear as fashion and progress dictate, children occupy a permanent place in the list partly because of their continuing presence as a potential sub-class, partly because they have never protested and mainly because it is assumed that in favourable circumstances they will become men and therefore require attention. They have received it in the shape of detailed educational theory carefully worked out to see them through the maturation process from infancy to adulthood. Generations of philosophers have documented this process. Perhaps the best known version is Shakespeare's seven ages of man which is a poetic statement of what had already been received wisdom for centuries and was to remain so for centuries to come. Education was to guide the infant through the transition to manhood including such stages as childhood, boyhood and youth. That is the second thing to notice; the philosopher's children are boys. The fact that at least half of the world's children would not actually go through this process beyond the first two stages is conveniently forgotten or ignored and, no doubt, the reasons for this were largely social. But the neglect of girl children through the centuries of theorising is more than a social injustice, though many might think this real and bad enough. Education has an end. Although it is fashionable to talk about its value ‘for its own sake’, what prompts the theorising is the strong and well-founded belief that the experiences of childhood affect the kind of adult which the child turns out to be. Where the end is  person- rather than role-oriented — that is, where the end is the development of the human mind and spirit rather than the production of, say, information technologists — then education is valued in relation to some conception of worthwhile human existence which it is meant to serve. Such an ideal does not stand isolated from the practices which strive towards it but interacts with those practices, helps to construct them, and is in turn constructed by them. The great philosophers have always produced such a person-oriented account at least for those whose education was thought to matter. Education has been directed at the production of the rational, the free, the independent of mind, the dignified, in short, the autonomous human being. Yet because the philosopher's adult has traditionally been male, his children boy children, and his educational programmes designed to facilitate the transition between them, the ideal of the fully human person has been masculinised to the point where otherwise thoughtful and sometimes good and wise men have unashamedly admitted that this defining ideal is not applicable to half the species. Rationality turns into narrow intellectualism, freedom into licence, independence into isolationism, dignity into selfish pride; the autonomous human being turns out to be no more than a social atom after all. The degeneration occurs, not because men are congenitally or even incorrigibly narrow, libertine, isolated or selfish, but because in defining themselves as autonomous beings in opposition to other human beings they have had to seek what separates them as a group from others. It is a curiously paradoxical foundation upon which to build a theory of autonomy. Moral autonomy is concerned with individuals not with groups; a conception of autonomy which depends upon group membership displays its own contradiction. This paper is partly about the rejection of certain accounts of autonomy though not with the rejection of the ideal of autonomy itself. It is also about children. WOMEN PHILOSOPHERS AND GIRL CHILDREN Why should women in general and women philosophers in particular be specially interested in the nature and status of children? There are, of course, the familiar and obvious reasons  connected with women's traditional role in child-rearing but there are less obvious reasons too. When philosophers dismiss women as ‘not-men’ they frequently do more than simply lump them together with children or lunatics. Explicitly or implicitly the suggestion is that women are children or lunatics or whichever other company they keep. It would be well to know just what this entails. Schopenhauer said that women remain big children all their lives; it would be interesting to know what he thought children were like. A common result of this is that when the philosophers deny autonomy to women, they do so for the same sorts of reason that they deny it to children and cite lack of rationality, capriciousness and vulnerability among their characteristics. We can do more than to reject such descriptions of ourselves; we can ask further questions: are children like this? is this why children are not autonomous? Again, women well know what it is like to be treated as children and they find it offensive. It would therefore be reasonable to consider whether children find it offensive to be treated like children. Is being treated as a child an intrinsically humiliating and self-denying experience? What is it to be treated as a child? Women philosophers are in a special position to consider such questions for in the image of the philosopher's child they see themselves. It is no accident that the liberation of women, such as it is, should form part of a wider movement of liberation in general; liberation for one part of the ‘not-men’ is bound to have a knock-on effect when your fellow groups are sometimes quite literally identified with you. The assumption that all groups in the ‘not-men’ class are identical with each other is so firmly rooted that, as we shall see in the fourth section, it is readily assumed even by modern libertarian thinkers that showing that, for example, some ground for distinguishing between men and women is false or irrelevant, immediately commits us to the view that the same ground is irrelevant in distinguishing men from children. ‘That's what they used to say about women’ is not a proof that saying it about a child is false. But it should make us very suspicious. That when women are given the vote it follows that children should be given it too is no argument at all, but a version of it occurs in modern debates over the justice or injustice of Mill's famous disclaimer in his essay On Liberty . Having denied that we may ever legitimately interfere with the liberty of another except on the grounds of self-protection, Mill (1910) asserts: this principle is meant to apply only to human beings in the  maturity of their faculties. We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood. Those who are still in a state to require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own actions as well as against external injury. (p.73) This view, as we shall see, has been attacked on the grounds that it rests on the false assumption that the distinction between adults and children is identical with the distinction between rational and non-rational beings. The attacks are based on empirical observation; most women and older children are actually quite as rational as most men while some men are actually less rational. If we agree that in that case women should be embraced by the liberty principle then so should children. I shall suggest that this does not follow because rationality is not in fact the grounds for the distinction in the first place. Partly to redress the balance and partly because talking about ‘children’ covers such a wide range of potential images, I shall try to keep before my mind an ordinary 10-year-old of our society. She is the child of this paper unless I indicate otherwise. Throughout we should ask ourselves, does this (whatever is being said) apply to her ? First of all, let us remind ourselves of the traditional picture of children drawn for us by some great philosophers of the past. One thing they are all quite sure about is that children are not like adults; in particular they agree that children lack some capacity for rational thought which adults have. NOW WE ARE 6 — OR 10 — OR 18…. the slave has absolutely no deliberative faculty; the woman has but its authority is imperfect; so has the child, but in this case it is immature. (Aristotle, 1959,1260A) Children…are not endued with Reason at all, till they have attained the use of speech but are called Reasonable Creatures for the possibility apparent of having the use of Reason in time to come. (Hobbes, 1914, p. 21) [Children]…love to be treated as Rational Creatures sooner than is imagined…[by which]… I mean, that you should  make them sensible by the Mildness of your carriage, and the composure even in your correction of them, that what you do is reasonable in you and useful and necessary for them. (Locke, 1968, p. 181) In training for youth, the child must be given reasons; in the training of the infant for childhood this cannot be done. Young children ought merely to have things shown to them as they are, or they get puzzled and ask question after question. But as we approach the age of youth reason appears. At what age ought the education for youth to begin? Roughly at the age of ten years, when by nature the child enters the stage of youth and begins to reflect… The youth…is capable of having principles; his religious and moral ideas can be cultivated, and he is able to attend to his own refinement. (Kant, 1930, pp. 250–1) If a society lets any considerable number of its members grow up mere children, incapable of being acted on by rational consideration of distant motives, society has itself to blame for the consequences. (Mill, 1910, p. 139) What are the philosophers' children like? They have an ‘immature’ deliberative faculty (Aristotle), are not ‘endued with Reason’(Hobbes), until roughly the age of 10 (Kant) and are ‘incapable of being acted upon by rational consideration of distant motives’(Mill). But they are not completely lost causes. The immature deliberative faculty will mature; children have the ‘possibility apparent’ of turning into rational beings (Hobbes); they love to be treated as though they were rational though they are not so yet (Locke); you can give the prerational child reasons for acting in certain ways and he will turn into the youth who is capable of having principles (Kant). Until the time when these things happen then Mill's disclaimer comes into operation. Children must be taken care of by others and protected from external injury and against their own actions. The traditional view is encapsulated in the claim that children are not autonomous; that is, on a standard interpretation, they lack the capacity to act rationally in pursuit of their own self-chosen goals. It is then a matter of preference whether you say that they cannot choose the goals or that they cannot form strategies to achieve them or both. In either case, the political implication is that denying rights  to children is entirely justified, and there the matter rests. In all this, there are perhaps a couple of things which look plausible when we compare the philosopher's child with our mental picture; Aristotle's observation that children are immature and Mill's suggestion that they might need protection. Beyond that, the similarities seem remote. There is obviously something wrong with a portrayal of children as totally lacking in reason until they leap out of bed on their tenth birthday announcing that they are now able to act on principle. Apart from being false, such an account leaves no room in our thinking about children for things like teaching and learning, or development in understanding and character and all those other concepts which refer to processes and not to states. The tension between these theoretical views of children as non-rational, non-autonomous beings and the practical knowledge of real children is evident in those quotations from Hobbes and Locke and Kant and Mill. Children, according to Hobbes, have the ‘possibility apparent’ of becoming reasonable. In what does the possibility consist? Hobbes is not using an inductive argument here; the ‘possibility apparent’ is not an inductive argument from observations about past children but is meant to refer to some discernible feature of present ones. But what? Hobbes does not tell us, but whatever it is it had better be something which a monkey does not have. It is not language since Hobbes is here talking about the prelinguistic child. Perhaps it consists in the ability to respond intelligently to the language of others. But then, either Hobbes has failed to distinguish the child from at least the higher and domesticated animals or the force of ‘intelligently’ must be explained in such a way as to exclude animals. In any case, if such a qualification is called for it is hard to see how a creature with no rationality at all could possess it. Locke's remarks are just as puzzling. Children are definitely not rational but love to be treated as if they were. How is this possible? Apparently they like having things explained to them without understanding either the explanation or even what an explanation is. Perhaps he just means that they like the sound of my voice? Well, maybe they do, but making any old noises is clearly not sufficient to enter the rationality stakes; I must at least say something. Is it just that I talk to them that they love? Maybe, but I can also, if I like, talk to my car, but yelling at it in the approved Basil Fawlty manner is hardly treating it as rational. Lockean children have the added  amazing ability to recognise reason in you without possessing any themselves, while Kantian kids, two stages back from rationality, have the disconcerting habit of getting puzzled and asking questions. Mill's minors are a little more complicated. Part of the time he sees them in the familiar way as creatures who lack rationality to at least some degree. But in the disclaimer his children need above all to be protected from the ghastly consequences of their own actions. Their problem seems to be not one of the inability to choose goals or to form strategies for achieving them, but an incorrigible propensity to choose the wrong ones and an awesome efficiency in achieving them unless adults intervene. All in all, it is a pretty unconvincing picture. If you say that children are completely non-rational then you have to account for the fact that they become rational, and to do that it appears from these examples that you have to assume that they already are. If, on the other hand, you allow rationality to children, then you cannot use their lack of it as a criterion to distinguish them from adults. Hobbes et al . are not aware of the unreality of their original pictures which is why, often in the same sentence, they produce these contradictions. The one thing they do not do is to re-examine the original for the tell-tale signs of forgery. ILLEGITIMATE INFERENCES The recognition that children cannot simply be written off in the rationality stakes and cannot therefore be denied autonomy on this account has led some writers to conclude that they cannot, therefore, be denied it on any account. We should notice that this view is not just a flight of fancy from the loony left, the pederast lobby or children themselves. It is also to be found in stronger or weaker versions of more cautious academic thought. In Escape from Childhood (1974), John Holt notes that children are, in fact, capable of a great deal more than modern society allows them to be. He sees childhood as a fairly modern invention designed to fit adult rather than children's needs, and an oppressive invention at that. He suggests that children should be given a comprehensive range of civil and legal rights including the right to vote, to manage their own financial affairs, to direct and manage their own education and to control their own sex lives and  to make and enter into, on a basis of mutual consent, quasifamilial relationships outside one's immediate family — i.e. the right to seek and choose guardians other than one's own parents and to be legally dependent on them. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) This is also the view put forward by John Harris, though in less specific terms. Like Holt, Harris believes that the so-called incompetence of children is an adult invention imposed on children for adults' convenience. He makes a firm proposal that the age of majority should be gradually reduced to 10 years, and remarks: We must remember that to deny someone control of their own lives is to offer them a most profound insult, not to mention the injury which the frustration of their wishes and the setting at naught of their own plans for themselves will add. Perhaps we should conduct annual examinations from an early age to be sure that we do as little of this sort of damage as possible? (Harris, 1982, p. 49) Now Holt and Harris both have many wise, enlightened and humane observations to make about some of the injustices which we inflict upon children, but as these remarks show, putting them right without inflicting equally grave injustice is no easy matter. Both of them appear to suffer from a form of mental myopia in imagining the consequences of such proposals, and I am not here referring only to Mill-type consequences of harm brought about by unwise decisions. What, we may ask Holt, happens to the child who, dissatisfied at home, seeks in vain for guardians who would suit him? What if no one wants him? Our papers are currently full of ‘hard-to-place’ children in local authority care advertising for foster or adoptive parents. In such a situation the skilled care of social workers is crucial to ensuring that an unwanted by-product of success for some children is not the total destruction of self-esteem for others. What, we may ask Harris, happens to the child who repeatedly fails his annual examination? To impose such a test on children would be a particularly invidious way of discriminating against them, unless Harris has in mind that we should all undergo such examination. He might then be open to bitter objections from many adults. These two suggestions, far from being enlightened liberation of all children, are actually oppression of a deeply damaging kind to at least some, and Harris's suggestion contains a capacity criterion in disguise. In any case, it would be dishonest to pretend that Mill-type consequences are not relevant here. Suppose Holt's 6-year-old does opt out of school? What happens to her then? What happens if her father is unwilling or unable to stay at home with her? Is it any better to oblige her to go abseiling or butterfly-catching instead? However much she may enjoy such pursuits, there will be times when she would actually rather wander the streets unaccompanied. Given that Holt is presumably not volunteering himself to take care of her, who will? His view that letting children run in and out of busy airports smartly avoiding the traffic is perfectly reasonable depends upon a conception of a child which is far narrower than even the sex divide. Holt's child is actually the Artful Dodger; mercifully, not all children are. There are other difficulties too. It is not clear whether or not Harris thinks that children of 10 should be obliged to take on full political status whether or not they want to, but Holt clearly does not. He proposes that ‘the rights, privileges, duties, responsibilities of adult citizens be made available to any young person, of whatever age, who wants to make use of them’(Holt, 1974, p. 15). If Holt thinks that this proposal would remove an arbitrary boundary line between adults and children, then he is mistaken. The point about an adult citizen is that he has these rights, privileges, duties and responsibilities whether or not he wants them. He may not exercise his rights or he may shirk his duties, but he cannot forgo them. They are not just available to him, they are his. That is what being a citizen involves. Rights and privileges do not pose any particular problems in the case of children. Holt can and does believe that children should have them as adults do, and then leaves it up to the child to decide whether or not to exercise them. But the same cannot be said for duties and responsibilities. Failure to exercise one's rights may be morally neutral; failure to carry out one's duties is not. It would be perfectly possible to give the rights to children without imposing the duties on them, the one does not entail the other, but we would then still be distinguishing between adults and children as citizens. Children still would not have full political status. Duties and responsibilities are not merely available to a citizen; they are an integral part of being a citizen. Holt does not want children to be obliged to take on any of these responsibilities  and he manages to make his point by concentrating solely on the rights so that he can remark: I do not say, either, that these rights and duties should be tied into one package, that if a young person wants to assume any of them, he must assume them all. He should be able to pick and choose. (Holt, 1974, p. 16) If he can ‘pick and choose’, I suggest, he is not a citizen, he does not have full political status and he is quite distinguishable on these grounds alone from the adults around him who do not have this option. Holt and Harris both, in the end, face the same problem. They attack the status quo by pointing out that the reasons given for denying rights to children are bad reasons, and then explicitly or implicitly deny them duties for no reason at all. Whatever else such a strategy may achieve, it certainly does not manage to produce a situation in which children are politically indistinguishable from adults and it rests on premises which, unless they can be defended, gain nothing for any defence to the charge of arbitrariness. WHEN IN DOUBT, GO BACK TO ARISTOTLE The trouble with all the views which we have looked at is that they tie the notion of autonomy firmly and solely to that of knowledge interpreted in either a broad or narrow sense. That it is firmly tied must be correct; the inhabitants of Brave New World are not autonomous precisely because they are denied access to relevant information. Relevant knowledge is a precondition of autonomy but it is not synonymous with it. Aristotle said something very interesting in that extract from the Politics which I quoted earlier; he said that women have a deliberative faculty but that it lacks full authority. What did he mean? What he did not mean is that women lack rationality; they can and do deliberate. At first sight what he seems to be saying is simply that no one is going to take any notice of the conclusions which a rational woman reaches after deliberation. On further reflection, I think this is exactly what he is saying, and its significance is immense. His  view is that the judgements which women make have no standing. Keeping to the domestic front for the moment, what this means is that the conclusions which women reach, no matter how carefully and intelligently they are worked out, can never have the status of decisions. You cannot decide, though you may desire, to divorce your husband if the law does not allow; you cannot order the wine if only his signature makes the order legitimate. And your inability to decide or to order has nothing to do with your mental powers. But Aristotle is not just making a sociological point about what is and is not permitted to women in his society. His remark goes deeper than that. It refers not to power but to authority, and what I think he means is that although a woman can make good and wise judgements, she cannot be the arbiter of that goodness or wisdom. For that she needs the ratification of men, and that is enough to conclude that her judgements lack authority. Now that is quite different from saying that women always make bad judgements, that is to say, that they suffer from some deficiency of rationality. Aristotle only produces spurious suggestions about a woman's incapacity to think or to stick to principles when he is obliged to say something about why their judgements lack authority. It then looks as though the argument runs: (1) Women lack some moral or cognitive capacity therefore (2) Women (must) lack authority. In truth this version is the argument on its head; its real form is: (1) Women lack authority therefore (2) Women (must) lack some moral or cognitive capacity. The important point here is that Aristotle's women are not autonomous, not because they lack abilities or capacities but because they lack authority; that is, their right to make decisions, to speak for themselves is not acknowledged. This acknowledgement is absolutely essential, for without it no mental act which they perform, however well, will count as a decision at all. The point I am making here is based on an observation by Stanley Cavell (1979, p. 460) and repeated by him in many contexts: ‘a human being could not fail to know, confronting me, that I am a human being’. Why not? Because to see someone is to see them as a human being and to see them as a human being is to acknowledge them as such. This acknowledgement is not derived from a prior knowledge of facts, rather it is a precondition of there being any  facts. We do not, on the Cavell model, first discover certain truths about an object and then conclude that it is a person; we first acknowledge the person and only inquire into facts later if necessary. The point was put graphically by my colleague, Ian Ground. Faced with a row of objects we do not, he said, lampooning Wittgenstein, perform appropriately by pointing to one after the other saying that's a tree, that's a tree, that's a man, that's a tree. Rather we will say (pointing) that's a tree,(pointing) that's a tree,(waving) hello!(pointing) that's a tree. What makes us greet the man is not an albeit swift chain of inference, it is his presence which commands the acknowledgement while the presence of the tree does no such thing. Of course, if the man is clearly carved from stone then pointing is in order, and if we subsequently discover that ‘he’ is an inflatable rubber doll we are suitably embarrassed. But we are embarrassed because we got it wrong when usually we do not. In our viewing of the other we see ourselves being viewed; the recognition is mutual. How then is it possible to withhold acknowledgement? Cavell's answer is that it is not. There is no way of seeing another human being except as another human being. In a poignant discussion of the hypothesis that Southern slave owners did not see their slaves as human beings he disagrees: When he wants to be served at table by a black hand, he would not be satisfied to be served by a black paw… Everything in his relation to his slaves shows that he treats them as more or less human — his humiliations of them, his disappointments, his jealousies, his fears, his punishments, his attachments. (Cavell, 1979, p. 376) Treating people as if they were not people is not a possibility; to try to do so requires all the resources of evil which the human mind can muster, but it always breaks down. What is possible is to treat people as more or less human. We can withhold acknowledgement from them on limited or selective fronts. This may not be downright evil, but in the absence of potential disbarments (like possibly being a rubber doll) it requires a considerable amount of bad faith. It is very hard to do. This is what Aristotle appears to do to his women. They are human, and are acknowledged to be, they can think but they are not to be acknowledged as authoritative, and if their presence demands such  acknowledgement, they are bad women who should have been taught to hide or repress such demands. Rousseau's blueprint for the education of Sophie is directed at this end, and if it is truly successful, she will internalise the lesson until neither her behaviour nor her demeanour will demand the acknowledgement. Then she has been infantilised and she is no longer autonomous. But Rousseau's blueprint contains its own contradiction. If you need to teach people or compel them in some other way to repress their natural demand for acknowledgement as rational, competent, authoritative human beings then you have no answer to the charge of some malefaction between bad faith and dreadful wickedness. Is this unfair to children? When we deny autonomy to our 10-year-old, are we too guilty of bad faith? What reason could we produce to allow that she may have the capacity to act autonomously while denying her the capacity-to-act-autonomously? Whatever it is we should first notice that while the capacity to act autonomously is construed as a psychological capacity, the capacity-to-act-autonomously is not. It is a social capacity which depends upon the acknowledgement of others. What we need to do is to show that withholding this acknowledgement is neither arbitrary nor unjust; we have to ask, does her being demand it. CARRYING THE CAN To do this we need to consider another element in the picture of autonomy which was so meticulously side-stepped by Holt. That is, the matter of responsibility. In Freedom and Resentment (1974, p. 19) Strawson talks not of a child's emerging autonomy but of ‘the progressive emergence of the child as a responsible being’. Responsibility is an aspect of autonomy to which lip-service is commonly paid but which takes a back seat in most discussions about children. I believe it to be central. In his essay, ‘In Defense of Anarchism’(1970), R. P. Wolff does give responsibility a central place in his brief analysis of autonomy. He argues that freedom of choice makes a man responsible for his actions while the capacity to reason about those choices places him under a continuing obligation to take responsibility for those actions. To take responsibility is to accept the duty of deciding for oneself what is right. A man, Wolff argues, can forfeit his autonomy by not  taking the responsibility on himself; by, for example, obeying commands blindly; but he cannot abnegate the responsibility which the possibility of choice confers upon him. Since being autonomous includes both freedom of choice and the capacity to reason about those choices, the impairment of either is a bar to autonomy. Against this background he makes two remarks about children: It is quite appropriate that moral philosophers should group together children and madmen as beings not fully responsible for their actions, for as madmen are thought to lack freedom of choice, so children do not yet possess the power of reason in a developed form. It is even just that we should assign a greater degree of responsibility to children, for madmen, by virtue of their lack of free will, are completely without responsibility, while children, insofar as they possess reason in a partially developed form, can be held responsible (i.e. can be required to take responsibility) to a corresponding degree. (Wolff, 1970, pp. 12–13) All men refuse to take responsibility for their actions at some time or other during their lives, and some men so consistently shirk their duty that they present more the appearance of overgrown children than of adults. (Ibid., p. 14) There is a striking similarity between Wolff's way of talking about children and the views we saw put forward by Hobbes, Locke and Kant. Wolff begins with the assurance that children are not rational and then immediately back-pedals to say that actually they are, partially at least. Four paragraphs later where the second quotation appears, the child is not unable to take responsibility but is refusing to take it. She is not an incompetent but a degenerate. Having denied that she is incompetent, I am certainly not going to concede that the only alternative is to make her a degenerate; there must be another choice available. What is missing from Wolff's analysis, though it is present in his terminology, is the recognition of the public face, the mutuality of responsibility. He talks of assigning responsibility to children,holding them responsible,requiring them to take responsibility and these are natural ways of speaking. What they do is to introduce a new element into the concept of responsibility which involves more than free will and reason; now a third party is present and is an  active participant in the language game in which responsibility has a role. People are not only responsible for something, they are responsible to God, other individuals, society or themselves, and this latter Kantian notion is derived from the primary social context in which it makes sense for the concept of responsibility to be invoked. This is just what I was claiming for authority. To say either that someone acts authoritatively or that someone is responsible for his actions may depend upon the possibility of ascribing mental states or capacities but neither is merely a shorthand way of ascribing them. In the case of the fully autonomous person, authority and responsibility go hand in hand. The capacity-to-act-autonomously is the coming together of the two. If both or either is impaired then so is this capacity, and both depend upon the psychological capacities of the agent plus the recognition of other members of the moral and political community. This raises a difficulty. PASSING THE BUCK The problem here seems to be this: am I saying that a child is responsible if and only if we declare her to be so, given that she knows what she is doing? This view has some historical clout. Given the knowledge it is always possible to hold someone responsible for their actions. Children were still being imprisoned and deported when Mill wrote that disclaimer. Is it then just a matter of fashion, of the times in which we live? Not entirely; to begin with we might take a pragmatic line in the light of new knowledge about the long-term effects of such treatment on a child's subsequent development. We might argue that while we can hold her responsible, the consequences of so doing turn out to be unacceptable. But the horror which writers such as Dickens expressed at the cruelty of his times was prompted by no such knowledge. Dickensian child victims grow into upright citizens if they grow up at all. What Dickens saw was what most of us see, the inhumanity of treating a child in certain ways. In what does the inhumanity consist? Not just in harsh action; increased concern about children is almost always part of a larger concern about people in general, but when horrible things are happening to people it is not unusual to focus on children and try special pleading on their behalf. This special pleading is, no doubt, partly emotional but it might very well include reference to  children's lack of knowledge and understanding. Yet the inhumanity does not consist in the ascription of certain cognitive states either. We may be quite right to ascribe agency to a child for his acts. The inhumanity seems to lie in allowing the full weight of responsibility to fall on the child. Responsibility is not only about agency. ‘When we say a person is responsible for what he does we mean not just that he was the agent…we also say that the act reflects (back) on the agent,’ writes David Wood (1973, p. 191). How much reflecting goes on depends upon the reflective capabilities of the child and also on the strength and direction of the beam which we, the adults, determine. Perhaps now we can take Mill's insight on board without opening ourselves to the charge of arbitrariness. Mill wanted to protect children against the harm which they might do themselves. The problem which was supposed to bring liberal theory crashing to the ground was that we do not wish to justify interfering with adult liberties on these grounds. It may be that what we are protecting children from is not so much the awful consequences of their ignorant decisions but of the burden of responsibility for those decisions which children are not yet ready to bear and which, for entirely non-political reasons, we cannot choose to impose upon them. If giving or withholding this responsibility were possible options in a one-person game, then this criterion would do nothing to counter the charge of arbitrariness but I have already argued that they are not and could not be. We can only play at ascribing responsibility outside this mutual interaction; making the horse a senator, blaming the toy which the child trips over are games which do not fool the horse or the toy. Growing up, maturing, emerging into autonomy is the process of the child taking from the adult more and more of the responsibility for those actions which she does knowingly. Respect for the dignity and freedom of the child consists in the recognition that the burden of responsibility shifts from the adult to the child as she herself demands it. We leave unhappy teenagers who ‘don't want to talk about it’ alone; the tearful 5-year-old comes and dumps the problem in your lap. In between, we say, we ‘play it by ear’ and what we listen for is the child's own claim to have its decisions treated as authoritative and to be ready to bear the responsibility. This claim is not a conscious, spoken claim; if it gets to that stage, we have already left it too late. The claim is implicit in the child's own social interactions and unless we are blind or acting in chronic bad faith we  can do no other than acknowledge it. But neither can we impose it. Holding a child responsible is not the same as making her responsible; we may succeed in the former, without her cooperation we can never succeed in the latter. Now it can still be objected that this is also true of adults and that I have still, therefore, failed to distinguish them from children. However, there is a difference. With children, the presupposition is that we take the responsibility until they show us that they want it; with adults we assume that they take the responsibility unless they show us that they don't. (We are surprised when the ‘man’ turns out to be a robot.) That is what membership of the moral and political community is, and it is a serious business which deserves more attention than I can give here. It is quite correct that children's application for membership should be taken seriously; once accepted there is no turning back, resignation is not an option. To end, a word about voting. Voting is not just a matter of knowing how to put a cross on a piece of paper, nor of having a rough or even quite refined view of the policies of the major political parties. It also, in a democracy, involves being responsible to some degree for the society which we have. Maybe ‘I didn't vote Tory’, but even that does not enable me to opt out of that responsibility entirely. Why else would I buy the sticker? Let us ask our 10-year-old's mother if her daughter is ready to take that responsibility. What would she say? Perhaps that, yes, her child is intelligent and thoughtful and even knowledgeable; yes, she would be as competent as many adults in coming to sensible conclusions. Also, perhaps, that sometimes at night, she finds her crying for the starving of Africa or unable to sleep with the terror of the possibility of nuclear war or desperately seeking a denial of the reality of the horror of the Holocaust. Perhaps she would be angry if, by trying to impose responsibility on her daughter by giving her the vote, we were also taking from her the only comfort which she has, namely that when she is older she will change all that. Or perhaps she would just tell us that her child is not yet ready; she would be right. Denying the vote to children is not based on some false assumption about 10-year-olds' political knowledge, nor to deny that they have interests, nor to protect them from the harm their votes might do. It is to take responsibility to ourselves for the way the world is. And that really does belong to us."
ACA ACA-FC1-001 2.9 "[CHANCERY DIVISION]In re A DEBTOR (NO. 784 OF 1991) 1992 April 13 Hoffmann J. Bankruptcy — Jurisdiction — Carrying on business — Debtor selling business and leaving United Kingdom more than three years before presentation of petition — No debts outstanding save for income tax liability — Whether debtor ‘carried on business’ within three years preceding petition — Jurisdiction to make bankruptcy order — Insolvency Act 1986 (c. 45), s. 265(1) (c)(ii) In May 1987 the debtor, who had carried on the business of running a nursing home, sold the business as a going concern and went to live in the Canary Islands. No debts remained outstanding, apart from a tax liability in excess of £500,000. In 1988 the debtor made an offer to settle the tax liability which was not accepted, and in February 1991 the Inland Revenue presented a bankruptcy petition. The registrar in bankruptcy made an order allowing service of the petition on the debtor in the Canary Islands. On the hearing of the petition he decided that the debtor had ‘carried on business in England and Wales’ within a period of three years ending with the presentation of the petition for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) of the Insolvency Act 1986and made the order sought. On the debtor's appeal:— Held , dismissing the appeal, that there was nothing in the policy of the Insolvency Act 1986 that indicated that Parliament intended to give the words ‘carried on business’ in section 265(1) (c )(ii) of that Act a meaning different from that which they had been held to bear in section 4(1) (d ) of the Bankruptcy Act 1914; that a debtor did not cease to carry on business for the purposes of section 265(1) (c )(ii) until all the trading debts of the business had been paid; and that, accordingly, the registrar had been right in holding that since the tax liability had not been discharged the debtor was still carrying on business and that he had jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order (post, pp. 122B–E, H — 123A). Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186, H.L. (E.) applied. The following cases are referred to in the judgment: Debtor (No. 1 of 1987), In re A [1989]1 W.L.R. 271;[1989]2 All E.R. 46, C.A. Smith (A Bankrupt), In re, Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215;[1989]3 W.L.R. 1317;[1989]3 All E.R. 897, H.L. (E.) Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186;[1950]1 All E.R. 405, H.L. (E.) The following additional cases were cited in argument: Bird, In re, Ex parte the Debtor v. Inland Revenue Commissioners [1962]1 W.L.R. 686;[1962]2 All E.R. 406, C.A. M'George, Ex parte, In re Stevens (1882) 20 Ch.D. 607, C.A. Sarflax Ltd., In re [1979]Ch. 592;[1979]2 W.L.R. 202;[1979]1 All E.R. 529 APPEAL from the registrar in bankruptcy. On 11 November 1991, Mr. Registrar Pimm, pursuant to a petition presented on 1 February 1991, made a bankruptcy order against the debtor, although the debtor had not lived in England and Wales since 8 May 1987, on the basis that she was still notionally carrying on business in England and Wales within the meaning of section 265(1) (c ) of the Insolvency Act 1986 because though there were no other debts outstanding there was an unpaid tax liability of over £500,000. By a notice of appeal dated 29 November 1991 the debtor appealed on the ground that the court had no jurisdiction to make the bankruptcy order because she had not carried on business in England or Wales within three years prior to the presentation of the petition. The facts are stated in the judgment. Richard Ritchie for the debtor. Nicholas Warren for the Inland Revenue Commissioners. HOFFMANN J. This is an appeal from a decision of Mr. Registrar Pimm, which raises a question on the court's jurisdiction to make a bankruptcy order. The debtor in this case carried on business in this country running a nursing home in the course of which she incurred a tax liability in the sum of about £500,000 which remains unpaid. In January 1987 she went to live in Tenerife and on 8 May 1987 she sold the business as a going concern. There is no evidence that any debts, apart from her tax liability, remained outstanding. In 1988 she made an offer to settle the tax liability, which was not accepted, and on 1 February 1991 the Inland Revenue Commissioners presented a bankruptcy petition which came before the registrar on 11 November 1991. The sole question before him was whether there was jurisdiction under section 265 of the Insolvency Act 1986. That section sets out various grounds for jurisdiction, including the domicile, residence and physical presence of the debtor in England, but the sole ground relied on in this case is section 265(1) (c )(ii), namely, that the debtor within a period of three years ending on the date of presentation, had ‘carried on business in England and Wales.’ The debtor says that she has not carried on business in this country since 8 May 1987, the date upon which the business was sold. The Inland Revenue say that carrying on business for the purposes of this section continues until all the debts of the business incurred in the course of trade have been paid, and that includes the liability for tax. The construction which is put forward by the Commissioners is one which was adopted by the courts in respect of section 4 of the Bankruptcy Act 1914, upon which section 265 of the Act of 1986 is plainly modelled. Section 4(1) (d ) of the Act of 1914 also contained various grounds of jurisdiction, including when the debtor, ‘has carried on business in England, personally or by means of an agent or manager’ within a year before the presentation of the petition. The only noticeable change in the language in the Act of 1986 is the extension of that period to three years. Section 4(1) (d ) was considered by the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186. The facts of that case were not materially different from this one. There too the only debt remaining outstanding from a business which had otherwise ceased more than a year before was a debt owed to the Inland Revenue. Lord Porter, who delivered the only speech, referred to a number of earlier cases dealing with the construction of ‘carrying on a business’ for the purposes of jurisdiction over the separate property of married women. The relevant statute in those cases had provided simply that jurisdiction should exist over a married woman ‘carrying on a trade separately from her husband.’ The question which arose in those cases was whether the cessation of trade, in the sense of ‘putting the shutters up,’ immediately deprived the court of bankruptcy jurisdiction over the married woman, or whether it continued while the trade debts remained unpaid. It will be observed that in those cases there was no statutory period after cessation of trade during which jurisdiction continued, and the court was therefore faced with a stark choice between saying that the jurisdiction ceased immediately active trade was suspended, or saying that it continued until the business had actually been wound up by payment of the debts. There was no basis upon which any intermediate position could be chosen. It is not in those circumstances surprising that the court decided in favour of the latter construction. In Theophile's case, however, the choice was not nearly so stark. There would have been less practical difficulty about saying that trade ceased when business ceased actively to be carried on, because there was a further period of a year during which a petition could be presented. Nonetheless, the House of Lords applied the same construction. The question before me today is whether Parliament, in using similar language in section 265, intended those words to bear the same meaning as those given to them by the House of Lords under the Act of 1914. The Insolvency Act 1986 is a consolidation Act only in the sense that it consolidates the Insolvency Act 1985 and some other provisions. It is an entirely new code in relation to the Bankruptcy Act 1914. The court therefore has to approach its construction on the footing that the new Act may exhibit policies and intentions which are not necessarily the same as those in the earlier Act, and which require similar words to be given different meanings from those which the courts gave them under the earlier legislation. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)[1989]1 W.L.R. 271, the Court of Appeal was concerned with the construction of a provision in the Insolvency Rules 1986 (S.I. 1986 No. 1925), rule 7.55, which provided: ‘No insolvency proceedings shall be invalidated by any formal defect or by any irregularity, unless the court before which objection is made considers that substantial injustice has been caused by the defect or irregularity, and that the injustice cannot be remedied by any order of the court. Under a similar provision in the Bankruptcy Act 1914 it had been held that a defect in a bankruptcy notice of a kind such as could reasonably mislead the debtor was not a mere formal defect or irregularity within the meaning of that provision, and therefore rendered the notice a nullity even though it was not calculated to cause substantial injustice. In In re A Debtor (No. 1 of 1987)the Court of Appeal refused to follow that approach and held that a statutory demand, which on the face of it contained a number of puzzling and perplexing statements, was nonetheless valid because the debtor knew precisely what he owed and there was no injustice in holding that his failure to pay the debt gave rise to a presumption that he was unable to pay. That approach to construction was approved by the House of Lords in In re Smith (A Bankrupt), Ex parte Braintree District Council [1990]2 A.C. 215, in which Lord Jauncey of Tullichettle said, at p. 238, that, in view of the changes in policy shown by the new Act, he felt justified in construing the provision of the Act of 1986 ‘as a piece of new legislation without regard to 19th century authorities or similar provisions of repealed Bankruptcy Acts.’ Those authorities show that, in approaching the language of the Act of 1986, one must pay particular attention to the purposes and policies of its own provisions and be wary of simply carrying over uncritically meanings which had been given to similar words in the earlier Act. It does not, however, mean that the language of the new Act comes to one entirely free of any of the intellectual freight which was carried by words and phrases in earlier bankruptcy or other legislation. Decisions of the court upon the meanings of phrases used in Acts of Parliament may come, in the course of time, to give them the quality of terms of art which Parliament may well be assumed to have intended them to bring with them when used in subsequent legislation. In section 265, for example, terms such as ‘domiciled,’‘personally present,’‘ordinarily resident,’ have had attributed to them, both in the context of bankruptcy and in that of civil procedure generally, a wealth of refined construction which it is difficult to suppose Parliament did not intend equally to apply when those words were used in the Act of 1986. Is there any reason why that should not apply equally to the words ‘has carried on business?’ There does not seem to me to be anything in the policy of the new Act which suggests that in this provision Parliament was intending to give those words a different meaning from those which they had been held to bear under the Act of 1914. It was suggested that the extension of the period to three years from one required the attribution of a different meaning because the Theophile construction meant that it did not really matter what the period was; as long as there was a debt, a bankruptcy petition could be presented. The effect of the outstanding debt would be to prevent the cessation of trade for the purposes of the section. That is not quite true, because the debt must, in order to found jurisdiction under section 265, be a trade debt. For the purposes simply of enabling the petitioner to rank as a creditor, the debt can, of course, be any kind of debt. It follows that the extension to three years does have significance. It enables a non-trade creditor to present a petition within three years after the last trade debt has been paid instead of within only one year. In Muir Hunter on Personal Insolvency (1991), p. 3037, at para. 3–070, it is suggested that the Theophile construction of the Act of 1914 is a somewhat artificial one, and the question is raised as to whether, under the new Act, unfettered by old case law, the long established but artificial construction will continue to be applied. It appears to me, however, that the House of Lords in Theophile v. Solicitor-General [1950]A.C. 186 did not regard their construction as being an artificial one. They came to that conclusion on the grounds that it appeared to them to be a tenable meaning of the words and in accordance with what they thought to be the policy of the Act of 1914 as to jurisdiction. I have already said that, on the question of jurisdiction, I can discern no difference between the policy of the Act of 1914 and that of the Act of 1986, and under those circumstances I think that the registrar's decision was right and the appeal must be dismissed. Appeal dismissed with costs. Leave to appeal. Solicitors: Binks Stern; Solicitor of Inland Revenue."
ACA ACA-HWV-003 2.66 "EDITORIAL White elephants about town The expanding urban population in many developing countries is causing a crisis in provision of public services. Inadequate local health services for low-income groups and long queues of patients at hospitals have prompted health planners to explore the best ways of improving government health facilities. The World Health Organization, in an attempt to assist health ministries in this process, has recommended the setting up of ‘reference centres’, a new tier in the health system between existing hospitals and health centres. The aim of these centres is to provide first-contact medical services 24 hours a day, obstetric services, diagnostic facilities, and inpatient care. Within their prescribed catchment area, a reference centre is responsible for the work of health centres, for community development, and for public health activities. Thus in effect reference centres are indistinguishable from small district hospitals, and they are expected to relieve the perceived overload at existing specialist city hospitals. At face value, decentralisation of services into communities seems eminently sensible, and reference centres have been effective in some countries. Some of these successful schemes are linked to universities that teach community health care and therefore need model community services to train students. The evidence that this approach will work more generally is patchy, and is furthermore based on a series of assumptions that have not been widely tested. The danger in WHO's strong endorsement of reference centres is that governments and donors may well interpret this as a green light to invest capital in the new service tier. Much more information and research within cities is needed before the architects are called in: the research that WHO are currently coordinating in several cities in Africa and Asia must examine the assumptions underlying their policy. The WHO strategy is based on the belief that hospitals are often overloaded by patients with minor complaints who should be using cheaper and more basic services. However, there is no firm evidence that hospital overuse is a consistent feature in all countries, and this perception might well reflect overstretched hospital management in certain areas. Large patient throughput in hospitals can undoubtedly give the impression of excessive use if patients spend many hours waiting to be seen or queuing for drugs. Before making global statements about overuse, one needs to examine ward throughput and outpatient flow data against the physical and professional resources. Even if hospitals are shown to be overused, WHO policy assumes that the people using hospitals ‘should’ be using the health centres. An alternative view is that hospitals provide a valuable primary health service to people excluded from health centres, which focus services on mothers and children. Adolescents, men, the homeless, and people with sexually transmitted diseases may not feel comfortable in a health centre. The opening of reference centres is no guarantee of an appropriate and accessible service for these population groups. The reference centre policy also assumes that the average cost (ie, per patient seen) of hospital care is greater than the cost at a health centre, and that a reference centre is cheaper than a hospital. Whilst ambulatory surgical care has been shown to be cheaper than hospital care in Cali, Colombia, such evidence cannot be taken as a general rule. Health centres with a low throughput may have higher average costs than a busy hospital outpatient department. A reference centre functioning as a small hospital with 24-hour cover needs many more staff than a health centre, and this will drive up recurrent costs. Unless the patient throughput per doctor or nurse at a reference centre is higher than that in the hospital, economies of scale suggest that average costs at this new tier will be greater. Few countries can afford increments in their recurrent budget. Yet this additional tier requires staff, drugs, and managerial support. Where should this come from? With about 60–80% of government national health facility expenditure in developing countries absorbed by hospitals, an obvious source is existing hospital budgets. If planners intend to trim hospital budgets and reallocate staff to smaller facilities, this strategy must be made explicit from the outset. Although the reference centre initiative is an important stimulus for planners to evaluate their existing services, there may well be better uses for scarce resources. Capital investment is rarely a solution to complex problems, and the recurrent cost implications may be detrimental to health ministries that are already over-committed. Building a new tier in the health system is a simplistic solution to the broader problems of management and resource allocation: countries should not follow the global call blindly."

FIC FIC-AC2-005 2.07 "That same evening Mark Sanders was dining alone in Istanbul after a satisfactory series of meetings with the local Managing Director and the Turkish Minister of Economic Affairs. He had declined an invitation to dinner, as the stabbing pains in his head had been getting steadily worse throughout the day. They were now blindingly bad. He placed his unfinished cigar in the ash tray and rose from the table, leaving his brandy untouched. He had decided to go to bed early. After lying in a hot bath for an unusually long time, he stretched out on the bed, eyes closed, hoping that the pains would go away. But he couldn't get the thought out of his head that in London, that very day, Muldoon and Klepner had given HIS Ten Year Plan to Cocello. The more he thought of the two carpet-baggers standing up at the podium, the more intense the pains in his head became. He put a hand to his forehead to ease the pressure. Nate couldn't possibly have believed that the Turkish problem was more important than the European Plan. Not in a million years. In which case the reason was blindingly obvious. Muldoon had more than hinted at what was happening. Detroit was paving the way for Mueller to take over and run the whole bloody show from America. That's what he had always wanted to do, and Klepner was his advance guard. His mole. His trained pet poodle who had been sent to Europe to reconnoitre the scene and steal Mark's clothes. He would then take over the European Components' planning activity when everything was centralised in Detroit. He thumped his pillow with his fist. The bastards are at it again, he said to himself, vividly recalling the Steiner incident in New York. Only this time it's curtains. He was finished. This had got to be the end of the road. He stared at the ceiling. How would he and Georgina change their lifestyle after all  those years as a corporate executive? How would they live? What would happen when the monthly cheque was no longer paid into the bank? What about the mortgage and the school fees? They go on for ever. Well, until sixty-five, and that's a hell of a long way away. What would they do in the interim? They'd have to move to a smaller house, that's for sure. My God, how would he tell Georgina? It would break her heart to leave the lovely old stone barn in Buckinghamshire. How could he keep Andrew at Agricultural college? Well they would, somehow or other. They'd done it for Adam and Christopher and they'd do it for him. But how would he break the news to Georgina that he'd let her down after all these years? He fell asleep, but the pains in his head were still there when he awoke in the morning. Clem Bunker was in a rare-rage. He had completely lost his temper when he had heard the news that Clasper had taken the giant Merseyside plant out on strike. Bunker had received the message from a convener at one of the Midlands plants, who was also hopping mad. And so, he said, were all the shop stewards at his plant, who were expressing the view that, once again, the Merseysiders were taking the law into their own hands, breaking national agreements and overturning official union policy. The Midlands' shop stewards knew it was only a question of time before the strike affected supplies to their own plants and those in the South, jeopardising the recovery plan which had been producing such vast improvements in performance. Morale had been at its highest for years, up to the moment that the news had reached them that Merseyside was out. ‘Clasper's behind this!’ Bunker was furious. ‘He was dead against the plan and now he's doing his damnedest to wreck it.’ ‘That's what everyone round here is saying as well,’ the convener agreed. ‘It's his Commie mate who got the chop. And nobody believes Clasper's version of the story. It's all too bloody coincidental.’ ‘Is that really the majority view at your plant?’ ‘Well, it's not often the majority express themselves without  some prompting from the shop stewards,’ the convener replied, ‘but in this instance the reaction was instantaneous. We heard the news over the radio at lunch break and I tell you, Clem, my lads are really up in arms. Nobody believes this cock and bull story about the sacking incident. They all know that Clasper's behind it. Who the hell does he think he's kiddin'? He's certainly not kiddin' my blokes.’ ‘Is that what the majority are really saying at your plant?’ asked Bunker. ‘Loud and clear,’ replied the convener. ‘They are sick to the eyeballs with Clasper and his bloody political conscience strikes. A hell of a roar went up in the canteen at lunch break when one of the shop stewards said that Clasper would go on fighting on behalf of the workers until every bloody one of them had lost their jobs. That's what my lads think about Mister bloody Clasper. The question is, Clem, what are you going to do about it?’ ‘I’ m going to contact all the plant conveners, when I put this phone down, and call an emergency meeting, Bunker told him. ‘In the meantime, get the shop stewards at your plant to take an accurate reading of the majority viewpoint without influencing the men either way. Initially, I want the gut feel of the members. We can take final readings and decide on an official union line when we know all the facts. I'm going to ask the other plant conveners to do the same.’ ‘OK, Clem,, the convener said quickly. ‘Will do.’ That evening, Bunker phoned Peters at The Inn on the Park to tell him that he had called an emergency meeting of plant conveners to help resolve the Merseyside problem. He was dismayed by the American's response. There was more than a hint of weary resignation in his reply. All the old fighting spirit and enthusiasm had gone. ‘Yeah. OK Clem. Thanks for ringing. and thanks for all the effort that you have put in personally. Just sorry it has turned out this way.’ He sounded like a beaten man. News of the strike made headlines in all the British newspapers. It was also given in-depth coverage on television and radio that evening, with News at Ten running it as the lead story in the first half of the programme and coming back to it again in the second. Clasper was interviewed outside the giant Merseyside plant and predictably blamed management for deliberately provoking the strike. ‘Are you really saying that the company is to blame for the strike?’ the man with the microphone asked, thrusting it under Clasper's chin. ‘Well you don't think my lads would be out here just for the bloody exercise, do you?’ Clasper demanded sarcastically. ‘Course they're to blame. Stands to reason. And my lads are staying out until Management reinstates the innocent victim.’ And is that the only thing which would influence you to call off this strike, which is obviously doing great harm to the company and the country?’ the interviewer asked. ‘Nothing more and nothing less,’ replied Clasper. ‘I'm already havin' to ask the lads to exercise great restraint over this particular issue. They want me to insist that the company sacks the foreman before they go back, but I've told 'em I won't be a party to victimisation either way.’ ‘Thank you, Mr Clasper,’ said the interviewer. ‘Now back to the studio.’ And there the newsreader told the British people that efforts had been made to obtain an interview with the local Plant Manager, who had declined to comment. The President of United Motors — who was in London at that moment — had also declined to comment on a local issue which, he had said was a matter for local management. The inference viewers gained was that management was to blame in one way or another. When he returned to the States, Mueller lost no time in carrying out Cocello's instructions to direct the phase-out of UK vehicle operations from Detroit, and to prepare detail plans to centralise European and world planning activities. His first step was to request that all copies of the European Vehicle and Components’ Plan be withdrawn from circulation. Having thus effectively stopped the Plans dead in their tracks, he then proceeded, in the name of the President, to dry  up the outward flow of all planning information from Detroit, so that, from that moment on, only he and members of the world planning group would be aware of what was going on, worldwide, at the planning stage. Mueller thus gained immediate planning control of world wide operations, even before he had formally received top management approval to proceed. The President had given Mueller an inch, but he had already taken a mile. This tactic was not unusual in the Corporation. Mueller had simply used his privileged position to advise the General Directors that he was operating on the instructions of the President. He would use that authority to his own personal advantage."
FIC FIC-FAJ-006 2.17 "SEVENTEEN As usual there is chicken lolling in the metal trays of the dining room, like unhealthy continentals in a mineral bath. For all its Last Year at Marienbad qualities, I choose the chicken again. Mr Shah is solicitous. He wants to know about Nairobi. Did I see anything of the riots? I tell him that some Indian shops have been burned, according to my taxi driver. He shakes his head sadly. ‘They blame us for their problems, I mean even though we have lived here for many, many generations. They always do. But it's not so bad down here. Some pickles and chutney?’ Léon Cohn-Casson had believed that the sooner all Jews lost any traces of separate identity the better. He agreed with Émile Durkheim that Jewish ethnicity would wane with the advance of secular society. The only way forward was on these secular, scientific principles. Sociology and anthropology were the application of these principles to understanding how people behave. For this reason he had encouraged Claudia to enter these new, modern sciences. He had cultivated Marcel Mauss, Durkheim's nephew, so that he could personally convey to her the importance of understanding the springs of human action. Mauss had come to their house in the avenue Hoche for dinner; like most academics — I am guessing — feeling a little shabby when confronted by the glowing paintings and rich Aubussons and complex dinner settings. Claudia wrote about his quiet passion. He could pluck examples of the universal spirit from any number of societies he had studied. What a queasy period those inter-war years now seem (I am looking at the chicken curry), the old hatreds and prejudices simmering and bubbling nicely with all the dark, irrational fears surfacing in a way that rational people like  Cohn-Casson believed had long ago been rendered obsolete by the evolutionary nature of society. The modern order, because it was based on industry, would produce a rational society. What a delusion. Cohn-Casson was born in 1882, not long after France's humiliation by the prussians. He had spent his life, as many of the French intelligentsia had, looking for a basis for order in society. France is a country which has grave doubts about its moral fibre; it sees its national character as being as permeable as a colander. It was for this reason that Léon Cohn-Casson became such a fervent advocate of a secular morality. He disliked the arriviste Jews because he felt that they were provincial and superstitious and liable to arouse hostility; nor did he believe that they would be loyal to France. But Cohn-Casson also found it impossible to side uncritically with Jews, because to do so would deny modern thinking, by placing tribal loyalties above the mandates of science. Léon Blum, the new prime Minister, said of people like Cohn-Casson: ‘They secretly curse those who put them in the hands of secular enemies.’ And here is Mr Shah. I can't tell him of the analogies I am cheerfully fabricating. He wants me to have some tinned pears which have come in from South Africa. Or I could have lychees."
FIC FIC-FAJ-009 0.88 "TWENTY There is no question, you can be ready for death, even wish it to hurry up. Saibol's brother, Tepilit, was ready to die because he realized that he would never get justice. Claudia pleaded with him to make some defence. Why should he make a defence? He had done nothing wrong. The cell where he was held was, like a prison cell in a spaghetti western, built of mud. The bricks were formed from unleavened mud, dug from the shallows of a nearby stream. The public works department, a heroic collection of people with strange provincial accents and manners, had a mould into which the mud was poured and then pressed from above. The roof of the cells was made of corrugated iron, imported from Birmingham. These little buildings were spreading out over the savannah in a game of checkers, with the goal of linking all the pieces into a chain of sound administration. The building programme was halted during the war with the scarcity of corrugated iron. It was very hot under the tin roof, Tepilit sat on the mud floor. He would not speak to Claudia; in despair she sent a message to Tom Fairfax in Nairobi. He spoke Maa fluently and he had unrivalled connections. As women do, she probably knew that she had made an impression on him on the two or three occasions they had met at Muthaiga. Claudia could see that locking up a Masai for a crime he did not understand was cruel and inhuman. Also, her relationship with the accused man had been — I am wondering to just what extent — quite intimate. After all, he had felt able to call her ‘heifer’(pakiteng). Claudia who was all too aware of what was happening in France — foreign Jews rounded up, her own father hopelessly compromised, labour camps from which none returned — wrote urgently to Fairfax  to come and get this man out of jail. It seemed to her ridiculous at such a time ‘to ask this man to make a defence. It is like asking a Jew to apologize for being a Jew.’ What Claudia had in mind was some colouring of the evidence so that the district officer, Miles Turnbull, a harassed, overworked but popular man, who was dead —bien entendu — could be seen to have acted rashly in asking his askaris to point a gun at Tepilit, which Tepilit naturally interpreted as meaning they were about to shoot him. But Tepilit refused to accept any suggestions that he had not killed the man deliberately. Far from it. As he sat on the mud floor of his cell, disdaining the bed, he said that he would do exactly the same again. His official statement, which bore his thumbprint, confirmed this. Fairfax, who was wearing his army uniform, soon lost patience. Despite his familiarity with the Masai, he found Tepilit's obduracy insulting. He had made a long journey, borrowing fuel for his plane. It could all be resolved quite simply. After a few months in jail for manslaughter, Tepilit could be released: the war effort encouraged flexibility. But Tepilit could not follow the reasoning. Fairfax was a farmer, a hunter and a figure in the colony's legislature. He had been to Sandhurst and served in a cavalry regiment before going to Kenya to farm. Like so many others before him — Blixen, Finch Hatton, Berkeley Cole — he preferred the life of safari. At the start of the war he had taken up his old rank of captain and was now a major in the King's African Rifles. He was dressed in that uniform with its fancy red flashes when he came to Claudia's aid. They became lovers. Perhaps she had known it would happen, perhaps he had answered her call for the same reason. For about six weeks before she set off for France, the long way via Cape Town, they made love feverishly. In the meanwhile Tepilit was transferred to Dar Es Salaam and hanged in the Fort one morning at four thirty. I have in front of me some photographs from a collection of settlers' memories. There they are, sitting on their fast  horses, gathered with their hounds, posing next to dead animals, picnicking by crocodile-inhabited rivers. In these photographs are ghostly presences, Masai and Kikuyu and other tribespeople. Sometimes they are blurred because, not being part of the composition, they are moving, carrying the sponge cake or the gun case or the canvas water bottle. At other times — included in the composition — they stand rigidly to attention, hardly breathing, their faces a frozen rictus. Fairfax could fit into any of those photographs seamlessly. (In fact, he is in one as a very young man accompanying the prince of Wales on safari.) Fairfax looks like Walter Cronkite. I see that behind the bluff little moustache and the liquid, fish-liver eyes — in my photograph the eyes are turned towards the prince of Wales (himself a rather ghostly figure under a solar helmet)— shelters another presence. Perhaps this happens to us ail as we age: our past lives detach themselves and stand to one side hesitantly, hardly believing the corporeal links to a former self. The records show that Tepilit was hanged on 18 March 1944. After he was transported by train to Dar Es Salaam nothing more was heard in Masailand until the official notice was posted in the district commissioner's office in Ewaso Narok confirming that sentence had been carried out. This news was passed to his people, who burned his few possessions and redistributed his livestock. There were arguments about procedure because he was the first Masai from the area to die in this way. None of the simple rituals could be observed but in the tradition of warriors who have performed brave deeds — say the grabbing of the tail of a lion before spearing it — Tepilit was remembered and spoken of. It was also widely believed that he would have become the laibon after his father's death. The day of the death of the white man is still a big item in the folkloric memory. It is this which the laibon, his brother, wishes to bring to my attention. For him there is a sense of unfinished business. He hopes that I may be able, in some way, to plug the gap  in his family history. This gap is still letting in the wind; he cannot see distinct segments of time past. I also wonder if it is possible to close the account. Here S. O. Letterman and I are at odds. I have suggested that we could leave the story open-ended, but he clearly thinks I don't understand the nature of movies very well. He quotes: ‘Movies are about two huge faces on the screen coming together and eventually embracing.’ But Letterman has sent me warm approval of my new ending. He likes the idea of the universal spirit. What he sees is not what Durkheim had in mind and what Claudia was trying to detect. Instead he sees the big idea of this movie: all people are linked by the universal spirit. Claudia, we suppose, died in Auschwitz believing in it. He suggests we emend Claudia's last message, delivered by Fairfax to the Masai, to include the words ‘the universal spirit’. Fairfax should now say to the assembled Masai: ‘Whatever happens to her she will always remember that it was the Masai who showed her that the human race shares one, universal, spirit.’ He also agrees to my request to take Fairfax on board as historical adviser and fixes a meeting in London in a few weeks to review progress. London. I hear the chimes striking in the grey sky. From here London seems to be a menacing, alien place. I have lived there for fifteen years, but the moment I leave I feel it closing the doors on me with indifference. In London Victoria is living in my flat, driving my car, using my bank accounts, washing our sheets. Nursing her resentments. Here, the short rains have disappointed. A quick curtain of water fell across the plains but by the end of the day they were as dry as ever. Up in the mountain, the Bible belt was drenched and from my window I can see the river running strongly as a result. The car washing and laundry activities have had to move some way up the bank. Mr Shah is impressed by my long fax from Letterman. The heading ‘Letterman productions, Hollywood, London, paris’, with a movie camera logo, seems to me to come from a comic book, but it obviously reminds Mr Shah of his brief association with Ava Gardner, Clark Gable and John Ford. I ask Mr Shah to fax Letterman in LA and Fairfax at Muthaiga. He likes these contacts with the more substantial world and happily hurries off in the direction of his stationery shop and fax bureau, where I know he will encounter many difficulties. A moment later he comes back. ‘Time difference about eight hours with LA, yes?’ ‘I think so. Behind. They're behind.’ ‘Okay. I thought so. No problem.’ The universal spirit is quite adaptable, even protean. Claudia's thesis on the exchange of gifts attempts to confirm the presence of the universal spirit at work in the Masai. But she is very aware of what Marcel Mauss called ‘the total social fact’. She doesn't, of course, mention it, but as a researcher living among the Masai she must have become part of the total social fact herself. By allowing Tepilit to engage in the formalities of gift exchange, she may have been able to observe at close quarters how it worked, but she was also entering into the drama. Mauss had suggested that by an exhaustive process of observation and recording, it might be possible to establish unchanging laws of human behaviour. But, he warns, this universal spirit, which his uncle, Émile Durkheim, had airily postulated, can only be recognized after taking into account psychological, religious, magical and pragmatic factors. This is clearly impossible. Only a professor at the Collège de France could imagine that anyone (let alone someone who had exchanged bovine nicknames with a Masai warrior) was capable of any such omniscience. This is the nature of sciences and pseudo-sciences, always striving for a set of rules and final solutions. Claudia probably took heart from another of Mauss's strictures that the ethnographer should not only observe the  particular but keep in mind the context. Her thesis has its gaze on the exact detail of the exchange of cattle, goats, blankets, gourds and snuff, and it tries to establish by the comparative method that these customs are part of universal human practice. The details of the comparative method are a little sketchy, but she claims that Melanesian practice is very similar. The poor anonymous Melanesians, famous only in anthropology. As I look out of my window — the scene is as interesting to me as a Canaletto — I see the clouds suddenly begin to rise o at high speed, like a milkshake being drawn up a straw, the top layers, the fluffy stuff, going last. I wonder if she had sex with Tepilit. I reproach myself at the same time. Who is to say what it was like living out on the plains for months on end, at first in a tent and then in a small house, not much more than a hut, built of saplings, mud, and cow dung, which she equipped with Somali fabrics and safari furniture? I suspect what Claudia really discovered about the universal spirit was more personal than scientific. The Masai believe that when a woman has sex with a younger man (in truth I have no way of knowing the relative ages) the woman becomes younger and more beautiful. Perhaps this, too, was part of the total social fact. As I speculate about Claudia having sex with a Masai warrior, I wonder if Fairfax was troubled by these thoughts. Letterman's notion of the universal spirit has a commercial aspect: it stands for that human striving which exists as a counter to the banality of human life in the suburbs and malls of our countries. According to this flattering theory, the audience are players in a bigger drama. The human spirit is trundled on to reassure them that they are still party to the heroic, which cynical people might think has departed the suburbs some time ago."
FIC FIC-FAJ-013 0.71 "TWENTY-FOUR Professor Uitsmijter has suggested what at first seems a crazy solution to my translation problems: I place my tape-recorder next to the phone, he records the laibon's words in Nairobi and he faxes back the translation. He has some electronic equipment originally intended for the language laboratory, which enhances the sound quality. As a result, my telephone and fax bill is much greater than the bill for board and lodging. Mr Shah is becoming concerned: he sees something unbusinesslike in me which I accept must be visible to others. Victoria says I have ‘blind spots, quite amazing blind spots about the real world for someone who likes to think he is so aware’. I have made more progress with the script. I have written the ending, incorporating Letterman's new lines. I have also started to write about the lion hunt organized by Claudia for Waindell Leavitt. But already I am running into problems. How do you make a film of a man faking a documentary about a lion hunt? How will Letterman fake that? And on that subject, how much of the unknown and unknowable can I sketch in? Elie Wiesel said a novel about Auschwitz is either not a novel or not about Auschwitz. What about a movie where the main character ends up in Auschwitz? This is not supposed to be fiction, but as I write I find myself obliged to make a judgement about Leavitt. Leavitt's bombastic, trivial films were completely phoney. Claudia must have known that. Modern audiences — I can hear Letterman saying this — won't go for the idea that Claudia, who is in some senses — although we ‘re not spelling this out, okay — a new woman, would take part in the killing of lions for a documentary. Instead we must present this sequence as entirely Waindell Leavitt's folly, into which Claudia is drawn in some way to  protect the Masai against manipulation. Leavitt becomes that stock character, the insensitive male exploiter. But Claudia's notes tell another story: she was intrigued by the whole idea and even suggested to Leavitt where they might find lions. It didn't take her long to regret taking part. Also, I am wondering what part Claudia's lover, the laibon's brother, should take in this. After he is wounded in this staged hunt, perhaps she could be seen to nurse him daily with iodine and mercurochrome, out of remorse, but in the process establishing the first physical contact. I have suggested that we use Maa with subtitles (I am thinking of Dances With Wolves and The Last of the Mohicans ). This scene could convey the burgeoning friendship and even love effectively. The initial, halting conversation would be about Masai bravery and the importance of showing no pain. Tepilit would question her about her interest in Masai women and why she seemed so concerned with their unremarkable tasks. She would explain the nature of her interest, so awakening in him a wish to know more about what goes on outside Masailand and also opening his eyes to the fact that the white folk see the Masai as childlike. Of course, Claudia is sensitive to the nuances. She tries to warn him. She says that the outside world has plenty of its own problems. The audience, but not Tepilit, understands by now her father's situation in Paris, so her warnings are poignant. But he is keen to join the King's African Rifles and go off and fight. She discourages him. After a few days he is well enough to travel and one of Leavitt's Willys safari cars takes them home. I plan a scene here in which the car makes its way through the vast landscape, the wounded Masai lying in the back. As they approach the valley overlooked by the Mountain of God, he asks her to accept from him the gift of a necklace. Before she can answer, they are engulfed by a crowd of young warriors, who want to hear the rumours of the lion hunt and the fight that it provoked confirmed. In this way, she has become part  of the total social fact, but we will present it as part of the age-old conflict between love and duty. Then I must consider the nature of their — of course— doomed love affair. Again I wonder how much Fairfax knows. Is it possible that in 1943 or 1944 she would have told him, liberated Parisienne that she was, the details? Would he have cross-questioned her? (I am probably too influenced by my own feelings regarding Victoria.) I can see that for the purpose of our movie any relationship between Claudia and Tepilit will have to be clouded in romanticism. I consider the question of kissing. Is it likely that they would have kissed? Of course Red Indian (Native American) women have often been kissed in movies by cowboys and soldiers, but how do we think a six-foot-three-inch Masai, almost naked, kissing a French woman will play? I compose a fax to Letterman. I need guidance on how sensational he wants the script to be. I also want to establish the degree to which he wants to be true to the facts, such as they are. I feel sure that Claudia would have shown Tepilit, if it were necessary, some of the metropolitan refinements of sexual practice. And yet, how can I know? Perhaps the Masai have taboos against fellatio and the other things the French, with their gastronomic traditions, favour in the sexual realm. I also wonder if she feared syphilis. Bror Blixen, Karen Blixen's husband, had syphilis and it was said to be common among the Masai. But then the settlers — settlers in all countries, as it happens — were particularly receptive to uninformed rumour. The unruly, incomprehensible natives were very quickly mythologized. Until 1942 there was no reliable cure for syphilis, too late for Karen Blixen. This is what happens: you start by wondering whether two people kiss and it leads away into the unknowable. I see now that the simplest reconstruction is fraught with difficulty. And yet there are two witnesses — three if you  count Lady De Marr — still alive. Of course, there are no witnesses to what happened at the other end of her journey. Pondering these problems, I stand by the window. The river has been flowing quite violently recently as the clouds (which the laibon was scanning each day), collide with the summit of the mountain, up above the religious suburbs to produce rain. There has been a scandal up there too. One of the missionaries has been badly beaten and stabbed. It is said that he was interfering with the choir girls, some of whom were betrothed. My informant is the Anglican vicar. Out here, being white still counts for a lot. It is a serious matter, attacking a white person, let alone a white minister. I wonder, however, if they are beginning to have suspicions about our parking-lot creeds and oven-ready ideas. This local Swaggart, who has tears in his eyes as he preaches the gospel, is tormented by the rows of large, bobbing girls in front of him as they sing the bouncy gospel renditions of traditional hymns. As they sway and raise their arms, he sees thirty pairs of large breasts and he imagines the same quantity of round thighs rolling and separating under the cassocks which he has had sent from Raleigh. In the vestry and in his bungalow, under the pretext of extra rehearsal, he has been fondling these big brown girls and offering them cigarettes and money for sex. Perhaps he has succeeded. The vicar says that a young Larusa, Masai after all, has stabbed him and beaten him with a stick and the whole town is talking about it. Some are waiting for God to express an opinion. The stakes in the religious free market have been raised. My friend the vicar is uncharitably pleased. There is something gossipy and gay about him. His conclusion is that a religion which counts its success by numbers of converts is suspect. He seems to be implying that sound religions are those which are hereditary. I can see some truth in this. Anyone who converts must have a motive. Many of Léon Cohn-Casson's contemporaries converted in order to be more French. They believed, all rational men believed, that  Judaism was simply a tribal leftover. To be French required a Western European faith. It demanded a leafy, abundant, ovoid religion, not a stony, nomadic, ascetic religion. The Jews from Alsace, the intellectuals, were convinced that a separate Jewish identity was on the wane anyway. Rational thought was the product of rational ways of organizing industry. Yet here on the mountain in the last decade of the century, there is a supermarket of discount religions. Claudia detects a relationship between religious thought and the way Masai society is organized. In her thesis she writes about it, but she also — I surmise — sees the downside (as Letterman says), namely that none of these religious beliefs will be sufficiently adhesive to hold Masai society together once the other solvents get to work. And what Claudia was to find is that our century has proved that the irrational and the immaterial have as strong a hold as ever. This way for the showers, ladies and gentlemen, your luggage will be delivered later to your quarters . I get an idea for another scene: Claudia makes a desperate journey to see the Governor to try to have Tepilit reprieved. He is charming and urbane, naturally, but refuses to help. He has no grounds for interfering in due process. He suggests that the rule of law is, in these troubled times, more important than ever, but the audience gets the impression that he is a pompous prick, giving a foreigner a little lecture about how things are done in the Empire. In desperation she tells Fairfax that she and Tepilit have been lovers. He is outraged. He asks her to go to a doctor to be tested for syphilis. A new cure has been available in Europe for two or three years, he says coldly. Tepilit is hanged. This is the cause of their separation which is to end so tragically."
FIC FIC-FAJ-015 2.43 "TWENTY-SIX The interviews are conducted at the St James's club off the Avenue Foch. Letterman has filled his suite with striking vases of flowers. He has a few modish novels, a collection of articles by Paul Bordieu, a copy of the New York Review and some scripts lying on the table in front of the sofa where he sits with a bottle of Yorre — never Perrier — and an ice bucket of champagne, sacramental, in front of him to greet the actresses as they are shown in. He has plenty of time for these creatures. He feels himself to be privileged. Casting enables him to ask all sorts of personal questions, which give him an insight into the kind of life that young, beautiful French actresses live. In his own way he is something of an expert on the private lives of actresses. Young actresses dwell in a quandary. They are strongly moved to express themselves outside the confines of their lovely bodies, while, of course, conscious that a large part of their appeal lies just there. They are very aware, too, that what Letterman is presenting to them is not just a script and a lot of money, but an intimate relationship with himself. This relationship is evidently not to be confused with a sexual relationship; it is just that once you have entered into an artistic liaison of this intensity, the sexual shenanigans are likely to follow. But young actresses in Paris have boyfriends who are successful composers, video producers and photographers. Even the very young in Paris are successful. It is a French talent. From poverty to Giorgio Armani takes no time at all, and in that brief time, if there is some uncertainty and a few wrong turns, they are contemplated over elaborate meals in good restaurants. So Letterman has to burnish his act. He is, of course, holding a few cards: this is a movie with a woman in the lead and it will largely be in English. (Letterman likes my idea of using Maa and subtitles very much; he was  hoping I would suggest something like that.) It is also a movie which is likely to be controversial in Paris. This appeals to the actresses he is interviewing. All the actresses think that it is vital that France should, as they say, engage herself with the past. Their analysis may not go any deeper than that, but it is expressed in a way which impresses Letterman, a sort of passionate commitment to the power of the idea which he has — subversively — been advocating in Hollywood for years. So he says. He mentions Alain Resnais and Louis Malle as influences. There are nine actresses to see in the first run. Letterman closets himself with these women all day. Occasionally he has to call in his assistant, a young Algerian Parisian called Farwaggi, to translate, but most of Farwaggi's job is to make sure tapes are delivered, CVs collected and taxis ordered. He is expected to give his opinion only when asked, although even these requests are tendentious. Letterman likes him because he is neither too elegant nor too assured. In a curious way — Letterman thinks — he bears the same relationship to Parisian life that the Hispanics have to LA life. Letterman is a believer in the immigrant mentality. His grandparents were immigrants themselves, from Frankfurt. His father was born in Germany, and a teenager when they brought him to Detroit. They took ship as soon as they saw the way things were going in 1934. Farwaggi is also in charge of ordering room service. Letterman likes to pander to the actresses' wishes. Getting behind their personal defences is part of his strategy. Farwaggi, his Arab provenance showing in the bluish (Camus-esque, thinks Letterman) stubble which grows stronger as the day progresses, a gentle mycological stain spreading on his eager, almost good-looking face, spends all day on the phone either ordering variations on the club's menus or rushing to and from the fax office. Letterman's activities are characterized by bustle and urgency. He is looking for an easy rapport, but he does not want it to be too easy. In his mind's eye he sees a girl who has  brains (although he knows that some very dim actresses can read with all the appearance of intelligence, and the converse) who has a slight resistance to the Hollywoodification of Claudia's life. He wants to be able to use her independence of mind —‘attitude’ as they say — to advantage. He also wishes to engage in a good argument with her about the nature of the character. After the opening pleasantries —‘What have you been doing? What movies have you been in recently?’— he asks each of them what she knows about Claude Cohn-Casson. ‘How would you treat the question of the collaboration of her countrymen and -women in her death?’ he asks. ‘Because this is something we are still thinking about, the extent to which it should be part of the story.’ ‘France must engage with her past.’ ‘Do you think movies should, in some way,’ he says, leaning back consciously preparing himself to listen, ‘start out with this kind of dialectic?’ The French like the word. The Minister of Culture uses it when he's in a conversational hole. To Letterman, who was once a fan of Marcuse, it is a distinctly toothsome word. In that one word, he sees, you have a basic tenet of European thought, namely that ideas are antagonistic and aggressive. Ideas are like negative atoms — or does he mean ions?— rushing around attempting to resolve themselves. (Nobody, he has noted, seems much interested in the promised synthesis.) For ten hours he watches the lovely squirrel lips, the high,paysanne cheekbones, the smoky eyes, the darkly glowing hair, the nervously crossed legs, the langoustine fingers, the half-risen,brioche breasts. This one uses the word niveau , which he does not know, as though it is an English word, one of those border-hopping words like ambience. She is making a distinction between parochial films and films on a global niveau . Her belief is that to reach a very wide audience one must establish character first so the audience can identify itself with the issue, through the character. This  is her opinion, anyway. She makes a small, dismissive, explosion with her lips, like a gentle fart. She smiles. She knows his game. There is none of that fake girlishness that young women employ in California. If anything, Letterman thinks, these women have a compulsion to reach a higher plane of conversation that strains credulity. Women can ‘t win, he reflects, sympathetically. He soon realizes that these actresses also have a distinctly French notion of Hollywood. He sees that many of the Hollywood films they admire have undergone a metamorphosis in France from straightforward studio fare to art. These movies have been carrying, like a sealed train, the bacillus of high art. Letterman resists the temptation to sneer at what some might consider pretentiousness. He recognizes that this willingness to fillet the intellectual and thematic from even the most ho-hum work is absent from the Anglo-Saxon world, yet he also thinks that he understands it because of his own (despite the tennis lessons and jogging) Jewishness. Even Hollywood's banalities and excesses have mythical appeal. Places like Malibu and Beverly Hills glow in their imagination. They want to be degraded by the system and die in a pool of their own vomit in a motel, where rooms are rented by the hour to cowboys. (This is how he tells it later after some disillusionment has set in.) The day has passed quickly. Despite the notes, and the polaroids made by Farwaggi in his anteroom, and the trays of fruit, club sandwiches,croques and so on— the cheerfully arranged amuse-gueules from the kitchen ordered for each girl — he finds he is becoming confused about their identities. Instead of seeing the person depicted on the duckpond surface of the polaroids, he sees an amalgam: this one's slightly dark upper lip, this one's nervy legs, this one's role in Le Médecin malgré lui at the Comédie Française (where he has recently sat through an excruciating evening of seventeenth-century high camp), this one's intensely white and brown eyes, this one's professed love of Shakespeare, this one's part in an erotic thriller (he can remember her  buttocks from that movie, but he can't fix them to the right actress without his notes). It would be absurd to say that they have become one. No, he will be able to sort them out into a short-list of three or four for further interview. But Claude Cohn-Casson has been subsumed by their physical selves, right here in the room, as sexy as hell. And the issues, as he sees them, have also been hijacked. These French women are in favour of contentious art. But they think that art has a quite separate existence from fact. They believe — and he finds the argument chic, too — that art is the final judgement. He decides at this stage not to ask any of them to dinner. He is not quite sure that they would all accept, but that is not why he holds back. He feels, in the light of the subject matter and the seriousness of their conversations, that he should exhibit some seriousness of purpose, although he solicits their opinions about restaurants to show that he is not all big issues. But also these young women make him feel old. Now he is poised here in Paris, sipping a champagne so dry it tastes like flint, on the brink of old age. He will be fifty in a few years’ time. He was born almost as the events of the movie were taking place. When they talk about these matters and the need to engage oneself with one's history, he realizes that ‘history’ is the operative word. But he understands. He is cursed with this understanding. When he was growing up in Dearborn there was a succession of sad-sack, embarrassing (to a fan of Johnny Unitas), old-world relations with funny accents who were constantly belly-aching about the war and — of course— the dreadful death and displacement which had taken place. To him, even then, it had been history, and it somehow deserved ill-fortune; in the heedless fashion of the American suburbs it seemed right to look down on the refugees from an old, superstition-riven world. So he understands. They think people were different then. He dismisses Farwaggi. It is eleven. Farwaggi moves  towards the door, almost shuffling, a satrap by inheritance. He offers to return at eight. ‘I'll call you,’ says Letterman. ‘I want to think a little first. I'm playing tennis and then I'll call you. You done good, kid.’ The idiom means nothing to him, but he gets the idea. He smiles shyly. ‘It was okay?’ he asks. (‘Eee’— sudden swoop —‘twashokay?’) ‘Just great. Food for thought. See you tomorrow. Not before ten at the earliest.’ Camus sets off into the night. This boy has studied at film school. He loves the films of John Ford. Letterman thinks John Ford films are ponderous nonsense. Particularly Stagecoach . He runs a bath. The day, the expenditure of emotion — the oyster knife he has been inserting into these women's lives — have tired him. He feels clammy. He undresses. His body always seems to bulk up after a day like this: he can see increased sponginess around his waist and chest. (One of the cruellest ironies of the death camps is that Jews were never meant to be thin.) He lies in the bath scented, marinated by the little sachets and ampoules of emollients he has tipped into the water. Not far away is the street where Claudia was brought up. It inspires him to be so close. He has found her house, which overlooks a park. In the park is a children's playground with a carousel. He sees this movie now as his own story, his own personal work. His oeuvre . He is l'auteur ."
FIC FIC-FAJ-018 0.91 "TWENTY-NINE S. O. Letterman has rented a small apartment in the rue de Beaune. It is above a traiteur and as he makes love with Candice Riberon, they are bathed, marinated and fêted by the scents of the food from below. At the back is a school where small, elegant children play in a courtyard. Candice has a husband who is a physician at the hospital in Montparnasse. She makes love with her eyes closed as though she is trying not to look at him. Her lips move constantly, as if she were remembering a text, like a Hasid at prayer. Letterman thinks that he is failing in love with her but he has the impression that she is using his cosseted and lineamented body in some sinister fashion. He thinks of that great opening shot in Le Métro and he realizes that her lips are moving in exactly the same way, her face pained as he does his practised best. He congratulates himself, however, on auditioning successfully for a part in this Parisian cinema. Since he has offered her the role of Claudia Cohn-Casson, she has introduced him to journalists, script writers and directors. But this world is kept separate from their lunchtime encounters in the rue de Beaune. She makes no acknowledgement of their affair in public and he understands that he is not to refer to it with these new acquaintances. (He thinks of Marlon Brando in Last Tango .) There is a brutality about her love-making. Her feral body takes its own route, grinding, convulsing, swallowing. She ends up sitting on him, facing the small window from where the children can now be heard playing, so that ail he can see is her lean and sculpted back, the ridge of her spine showing like knuckles on a fist. He fears, as this moving tableau blots out his view, that she does not want to look at him but, then, just as he is allowing himself this painful thought, she turns  and kisses him on the eyes before taking his cock in her mouth. (He is sometimes disturbed by the readiness of young women to do this; perhaps it is a dietary taboo surfacing from his past.) All the time she is in a mindless frenzy, he is thinking, comparing, and second-guessing. He is cursed with this evaluative frame of mind. He wonders in how many of the little windows in all the voguishly crumbling buildings beneath all the Mansard roofs, sex is taking place. He asks himself how many of these encounters can be as tricky as his own, with the gorgeous actress, Candice Riberon. In Paris, he is certain, there is a level of sophistication about sex absent in Hollywood. Yet sometimes he feels nostalgic for the Californian variety, just as an honest man dining in the Tour d'Argent can decently long for a cheeseburger. But this little flat is magical. Farwaggi found it in the Herald Tribune . It belongs to a journalist absent in Eastern Europe, and is really just a large closet with a marble fireplace and a tiny bedroom and a bathroom where Candice sits across the bidet unembarrassed, much as she sits across his body. He has two or three bidets in his house in Beverly Hills, but he has never seen them used in this way, with gusto. There was a vogue for bidets in California some years ago but he thinks they are primarily symbolic as jacuzzis have become. As soon as he sets foot on the elaborate stairway which rises three floors from the dark hall, itself leading off a gloomy cobbled courtyard, he has the feeling that he is leaving for a blessed hour or two his insubstantial world. (There are many sneering adjectives: plastic, cardboard, artificial, disposable, tinsel, polystyrene, cut-out.) Yet he has an instinct that this synthetic world is more in tune with the way things are going in the hierarchy of ideas, than the Parisian world of half-wild ducks cooked in their own jus and ideas located on different niveaux . (He now knows what it means.) These ideas have, anyway, suffered a gallicization, which places the French at the centre of the cosmos. On a more parochial level, his mother adopted a similar approach: Eisenhower was responsible, in her estimation, for causing her to have her hair bobbed. She blamed him personally. Letterman has forgotten the exact circumstances. He finds, in talking to Candice's friends, that collaboration during the war has become for them either a means of attacking the government or a subject of high-minded discussion. The intellos do not see themselves as in any way related to the past. They operate on a different plane altogether. This is their job. When they have made love — it is unbearably intense for him — clouds scud across Candice's eyes. She does not see him at all. He is troubled for two reasons. The first is that he has got her into bed so easily and the second is that it seems to mean nothing to her. Perhaps the two worries are related. Although she obviously enjoys the physical stuff, he would like her to bring some spiritual qualities to the performance. These are absent, saved for conversation in restaurants where she talks with great animation, but on a plane which seems to have nothing to do with her sexual avidity. He is, he thinks, some sort of sexual experiment for her. Sex is part of her embrace of an exotic culture; it goes with the territory, as they say. She returns from the bidet and dresses quickly. where he has so recently expended himself, disappear beneath her skirt, pulled down in one deft movement. Thinking cinematically — there is, he believes, a whole philosophic category of filmic vision — he sees the moment played in close-up: the camera moving slowly up her beautiful legs, brown and restive, reaching this little mysterious delta just as the short, dense skirt descends. ‘We must eat,’ she says. She turns her back to him to look in the mirror beside the cherrywood armoire. He sees her narrow hips, her lean back, her lustrous hair, and over her shoulder in the mirror her lips making quick whore's movements to spread the lipstick evenly. ‘Sure. Let's eat. You've got some appetite. Then I got to get back to work. You look beautiful.’ She turns towards him briefly and she smiles, her famous smile piercing him. ‘Allez, allez.’ She laughs now as he bounds off the bed, aware that his hairy —poilu — parts are comical. He showers. A bidet is not sufficient to remove the tinctures that must be clinging visibly to him. They make their way down through the courtyard past the concierge's busy-lizzies and geraniums in their cluster of terracotta and out onto the street where the Mercedes and driver are double-parked squeezing the traffic to an irascible trickle. Candice likes this conspicuous consumption. She slumps, her legs sprawled, as they inch out into the traffic, heading for a place which serves Gascon specialities. The Gascons favour the goose and its by-products. He looks at Candice and she puckers her lips, perhaps ironically. By casting her, one of the hottest young actresses in France, he has laid the ground bait. He is working the trade press both in Europe and the US. Soon he will talk to local producers about taking a share, but for the moment he is holding them off. The script comes next. He has sent off some ideas to Africa for inclusion in the first draft, which should be ready in about ten days. He knows it will need work. The manager and waiters treat them to a respectful embalming. He orders ravioli with foie gras and white truffle shavings. The ravioli are huge, like saucers, each one stuffed with the exquisite mixture. Around him, knowing people, people who were born eating this stuff, are conversing in that world-weary but photogenic way. He tries to remember accurately Flaubert, which he was combing on the plane: ‘Their indifferent glances told him of passion dulled by daily satisfaction.’ Candice is eating a dish of beans and preserved goose. He will never feel at ease with the French: he will never wear the right clothes; he will never feel healthy on goose and red wine and he no longer wants to try. Yet he admires them. He imagines that his own family might have had this ease in the bourgeois world before they left Europe. But for all his misgivings, here he is with one of the most desirable women in France eating truffle shavings and half an hour ago they were lying on a bed together. Still, he feels that the waiters know that he comes from Dearborn and they can see that in his cashmere tweed jacket he is sailing under false colours. He looks at Candice: a tiny globule of goose fat is glistening on her upper lip. He wonders if she has told her husband the docteur — he imagines a cheerful Depardieu in a white coat — of the steps she has been obliged to take in order to get the part. ‘You like geese liver?’ she asks. She pronounces ‘liver’ with a long vowel, so that for a second he thinks she is asking if he likes geese saliva. ‘Goose…? Sure, this is the greatest thing I have ever eaten’— he drops his voice —‘apart from your pussy.’ She looks round in mock horror. She laughs. His tired heart bounds. He thinks — Jesus, he is so suburban — of a tennis ball bouncing off the court. He looks at her and he can see — in her dark hair, her quite high forehead, her wide, generously made mouth (oiled and glistening), her intensely brown eyes — Claudia. No doubt about it."
FIC FIC-FAJ-023 1.14 "THIRTY-FOUR The laibon has had plenty of time to think about this ugly incident. I hesitate to pronounce on the degree of tranquillity in his life, but since 1943 he has not been further than sixty miles from this spot. Compared with the removals, job changes and constant travel that have affected my life, his has been tranquil. Of course, death and bereavement have come thicker and faster here. That may not be as important, being so frequent, in his estimation. Life is cheap . But in all these years he has certainly been spared those other, uninvited, distractions which sweep over our lives, a snowstorm of diversion and entertainment and half-understood knowledge. What we seek to see in this blizzard is the spectral shape approaching of what was once called — with a straight face — meaning. We know now that the world was not designed for us, but we haven't come round to acting on this knowledge. Explanations are plentiful: absurd, irrational, unscientific explanations, alongside absurd, rational, scientific ones. Although there is no overall meaning, everything can be explained on one measure or another. The laibon believes that he can pinpoint the beginning of his troubles to this lion hunt. He is sitting at our camp now, holding a mug of our tea, relaxing on a canvas chair. He sees that Leavitt's film introduced a new element into the life of his people. For the first time the hunting of lions was treated as picturesque. It had no other meaning. It was as weightless as tribal dances performed for tourists. It has taken him all these years to understand the implications. At a turn of the clockwork motor of the bulky camera, Leavitt had proclaimed that this submission to the seasons, to the rains, to the predations of lions, to the pasturing of cattle and all the placatory rituals that went with it, was unnecessary. It was  flim-flam, folklore, credulity. Its only value was as entertainment in movie houses. Claudia's study, while more high-minded than Leavitt's movies, had the same general effect. The laibon does not strictly say this. His complaint is a more general one about the lack of respect for custom and the gradual constriction of his world that has taken place in fifty years. But the connection is clear enough. The inner coherence of Masai life was destroyed by the implied contempt. Fairfax listens patiently to the laibon. As always the laibon holds his snuff container. He holds it the way elderly Greeks hold worry beads, a certain anxiety about the dwindling supplies of life remaining, kept at bay by this endless fiddling. There are long monologues before the laibon pauses. Fairfax then summarizes thoughtfully what the laibon has been saying. The laibon sees this moment as the beginning of the end of innocence. Leavitt may be the serpent, but Claudia is Eve. Gradually the consequences of that day, the wising up, have become apparent. Of course, the laibon does not phrase it as I have. He simply sees a connection between the sham lion hunt and the all-too-real execution of his brother. Because of his brother's hanging, he assumed the mantle of laibon. He is wearing the mantle now, made from the skins of the hyrax, a flea-ridden animal which looks like a giant guinea pig. Perhaps he has no calling and has been unhappy in the family business for years. The mistake Claudia made was to become part of the total social fact herself. Yet the laibon seems to be suggesting complicity by his own family in what Fairfax calls ‘the balls-up’. They should never have taken part in something so unnatural. They never would have, but for Claudia's influence on his brother. It also occurs to me, as I watch the laibon direct a stream of sugar into his second cup of tea, that there may have been something degrading about being delivered this cultural snub. The idea that hunting lions was just another native custom, albeit risky and magnificent, must have been deeply  wounding. The laibon wants it understood that it has taken him some time to trace the trouble back to this incident. ‘Ask him, if you don't mind, if he blames Claudia.’ Fairfax asks him and I hear the choppy pronunciation of her name a number of times. ‘Unfortunately,’ says Fairfax, ‘he does believe she was the cause of the problem. But as a woman he doesn't want to give her too much credit. He doesn't think that women should be allowed so much freedom of movement, although he understands that this is regrettably the custom, to this day, among white women.’ I look carefully at Fairfax's moist, fatigued eyes, which have seen so much, for signs of irony. ‘Is that your little joke?’ ‘I may possibly have added a word or two.’ ‘What about Claudia looking after his brother?’ ‘He liked Claudia. In a way that was the problem. Women should not be able to surpass men in understanding. It is not an advantage to a woman, and fatal to society, if women are allowed to take too important a role. It just causes trouble.’ ‘Does he have any idea what happened to her?’ Fairfax does not answer my question. After a pause, which is, of course, shredded by the cries and protests of birds and insects, he says, ‘I don't think any of us does.’ The laibon takes us to the spot beneath the escarpment, looking down through two rock walls onto the plain, where Claudia built her little house. The plains are movable, subject to wind, water and grazing. The watercourses wander, breaking and re-forming with the seasons. But the escarpments are fixed and here, where a stream tumbles down onto the plain, is the site of Claudia's camp. This is where she and Fairfax made love. To a Masai it is not a good site. It is close to high cliffs where leopards live and it is surrounded by trees, which  make cattle-ambush easy. This is the pastoralist's view of topography. For a Masai a broad, grassy plain with barely a tree in sight is preferable. But to my eye it is beautiful. I watch Fairfax carefully as he talks to the laibon. They are discussing the layout of the camp. There is nothing to be seen, but the reconstruction in the imagination is tangible. Here stood the little house looking down through a frame of brown granite to the plain below. There were two tents, thatched over against the sun, and here was the storeroom. Claudia's sleeping tent stood just here, with a view all the way to Ol Doinyo Lengai. Fairfax and the laibon stand on the spot. They remind me of a builder and a client discussing the positioning of proposed works. They agree on something and smile. It is camaraderie on the most ordinary level. A few hundred yards away behind the site is a cliff face, down which a stream tumbles. I know from Claudia's notes that this was a seasonal stream. Sometimes she had to have water fetched from miles up in the mountain. Like ail researchers and scientists in remote places, she found the arrangements, the logistics, more demanding than the work itself. She wrote a long letter to her brother about these problems. She worried about the amount of supplies she needed. She contrasted this unfavourably with the simple needs of the Masai and tried for a while to live on their diet of milk and maize meal. It didn't last: ‘Mais enfin ,’ she wrote, ‘je suis française .’ She bought a small shotgun and it was a simple business shooting spotted guineafowl or the umber-coloured francolin, which she stewed slowly on the fire. Later she tried to make an oven out of an iron safe, but it did not work. The old men talk. Fairfax is no longer breaking off to translate. Against the cliff they are figures in a landscape painted in watercolour by some Victorian with grandiose ideas about nature and the sublime. It pulls at the heart. Here they are shooting the breeze, Fairfax in his outmoded but perfectly cut clothes, the laibon in a dark blue shift and a cape of fur, with ear lobes that contain three or four little  bead earrings and a silver wire holding a small copper bell. As he gestures, his robe slips and I can see his penis, which is inky black and purplish towards the (circumcized) tip. It is very long. The century is closing. Everywhere I hear about the malaise and uncertainty this is producing. But I am looking at something from the previous century. Behind them the rock face is bound together by the rope roots of the fig tree, and on the hillside above them are ravines thick with flowering Cape chestnuts; above that level there are hillsides of succulents and, even higher, alpine pastures and more cliffs. These two old chaps both knew Claudia. It's miraculous."
FIC FIC-G01-003 2.38 "42 You could have been forgiven for imagining, that Peter Nicholson had undergone surgery to replace his vocal chords with a megaphone. His words boomed out, spoken with clarity and in a tone that suggested that he was keeping his words simple for the less intelligent inmates of the prison. On either side of him the warders  looked down onto the other landings, watching for any signs of unrest amongst those below. Warders on each of the individual landings also ensured that silence prevailed as he spoke. ‘As you may have heard,’ the Governor said, smoothing his hair back with one hand, ‘Whitely has been in the news lately. The media are obviously hard up for stories because they seem interested in what they refer to as our overcrowding problems here. Also, the local MP has taken it upon himself to look personally into what goes on in this prison.’ Robinson looked at Porter and raised his eyebrows quizzically. ‘To that end,’ Nicholson continued, ‘a Home Office delegation will be visiting this prison tomorrow to see how it runs and to see how well you're all cared for.’ He smiled sardonically. A murmur rose that was quickly silenced. Nicholson paused for a moment theatrically. ‘The members of this delegation will be speaking to a number of prisoners. Asking about conditions, etcetera.’ He looked around the upturned faces. ‘You may speak to them if you wish. Help them with their questions. You may have some questions for them . If you have any problems or grievances, you're quite free to tell them.’ ‘Yeah,’ murmured Porter. ‘And get our fucking heads busted by the screws when they've gone.’ Swain took a step towards him, shooting him a warning glance. ‘If any of you have any problems, at any time, you know you are free to speak to the officers in charge of your landing or to me personally,’ Nicholson continued. There was another babble of chatter, and this time it took longer to quieten. Nicholson looked around once more. His green eyes, like chips of emerald, caught the light and reflected it coldly. He brushed a speck of dust from his sleeve as he waited for the silence he required. Finally satisfied, he continued. ‘I want this prison running perfectly for these visitors,’ he said. ‘I want co-operation between you and the officers. I want the cells spotless. I want them to be impressed by what they see. I don't like people meddling in the way I run this prison and that's what they're doing. Meddling. I want them to leave here, knowing that this prison is well run and that its inmates are being adequately dealt with. I don't expect them to leave here with a catalogue of stories about what a terrible place Whitely is. As I said, you may speak to them if you wish. That is your prerogative. But bear in mind that if they hear too many bad reports, they'll disrupt the way I run this prison. And I don't like disruptions. I hope that's understood.’ He looked around him, then smoothed his hair back once more. ‘That's all.’ Nicholson and his officers turned and moved away from the landing rail, out of sight of the other prisoners. On all the landings the inmates were allowed back inside their cells. ‘Breakfast in twenty minutes, get a move on,’ said Warder Swain, slamming the door shut behind Robinson and Porter. ‘Suck this,’ rasped Porter, holding his penis in one fist. ‘Fucking cunt.’ Both men started to dress, taking it in turns to wash as best they could in the small sink perched on the cell wall. ‘I wonder if anyone will be stupid enough to tell this bunch of do-gooders the truth?’ Robinson mused, drying his face. ‘Are you joking?’ Porter muttered, fastening his grey  overall. ‘Even the screws wouldn't tell them anything. They're more frightened of Nicholson than most of the cons in here.’ Robinson nodded in agreement. ‘A tour of the prison, eh?’ he said, smiling. ‘I wonder what they'll make of our humble little home.’ ‘Probably want to move in with us,’ Porter quipped. He crossed to his locker and took out a comb, running it through his short black hair. The inside of the locker was a mosaic of photos: naked women, a team picture of Liverpool FC and a couple of postcards all vied for attention. He blew a kiss to one of the women, then closed the locker again. Robinson was sitting on the edge of the upper bunk. ‘I'll tell you one thing, Rod,’ he said, ‘and I'll bet money on it. There's at least one part of this nick they won't see. Nicholson will make sure of that.’"
FIC FIC-G01-012 0.62 "51 Coffee dripped from the bottom of the cup as DI Frank Gregson lifted it to his mouth and took a sip. It was strong. He pulled the lid from one of the other milk cartons and poured in the contents, stirring until the dark colour lightened. Opposite him DS Stuart Finn was smoking a Marlboro, blowing out streams of smoke, alternately gazing into the depths of his tea cup and glancing out of the window. The neon lights outside were barely visible through the sheen of condensation coating the inside of the cafe window. The film of steam combined with the patina of dirt on the glass made them almost opaque. Inside the cafe there were half a dozen other people. At a table in the corner three young girls sat, smoking and chatting quietly, occasionally glancing across at the two policemen. Two men sat at a table near the counter, one of them  pushing huge forkfuls of food into his mouth, the other sipping at a cup of tea. Another man sat alone at the table next to them, peering at a magazine. Finn noted that he was tracing a column of names and addresses with the tip of his pen, occasionally ringing one with the biro. The place smelled of fried food and damp. Finn stubbed out a cigarette in an already overflowing ash-tray and immediately lit another. He noticed that he was almost out of them and fumbled in his jacket pocket for some change to feed into the cigarette machine. On the radio in the background, a voice announced that it was nine-thirty. ‘It's weird, isn't it?’ said Finn. ‘How all these places start to look alike after a while.’ Gregson shrugged. ‘The cafes, the bars, the clip-joints,’ Finn continued. ‘In the bookshops, too, there's something familiar about them, every one of them. Even the same punters, it seems.’ He chuckled. ‘I was flicking through a couple of magazines at that last place.’ He smiled. ‘More cunts than a meeting of the Arsenal supporters’ club.’ The DS shook his head, still grinning. Gregson didn't return the smile. He merely sipped at his strong coffee and ran a hand through his hair. ‘Yeah, the places look familiar and the answers are starting to sound familiar, too,’ he said wearily. ‘No, never seen him. Never heard anything. Didn't see anything.’ ‘I wonder if any of the other blokes are having better luck.’ ‘Are you serious? This whole fucking area is sewn up tighter than a nun's crotch,’ Gregson grunted. ‘Then why are we here?’ ‘Because it's our job.’ Finn sucked gently on his cigarette and looked across the table at Gregson, who was peering through the window into the street beyond. ‘You knew it was going to be like this, Frank,’ he said. ‘You knew that no one around here was going to help us. Why call a search in the first place?’ ‘Procedure,’ Gregson told him. ‘Bullshit,’ Finn said, smiling thinly. ‘What do you know?’ ‘I know that we should be asking questions instead of sitting on our arses drinking cups of tea,’ the DI told him, pushing his half-empty cup away. ‘Come on, tell me the truth,’ Finn persisted. ‘You owe me that. We've been working together long enough. If I had a hunch or an idea about these killings I'd tell you .’ Gregson smiled thinly. ‘The idea I had was crazy,’ he said slowly. ‘Illogical. Impossible, even. I checked it out. You remember I said to you that the only thing any witnesses could agree on about the first bloke who killed himself was his staring eyes?’ Finn nodded. ‘I checked the files, because that rung a bell somewhere. We arrested a bloke called Peter Lawton for a series of armed robberies. Remember me telling you?’ ‘Yes, I do,’ said the DS ‘He's banged up, though, isn't he?’ ‘In Whitely Prison in Derbyshire. Yeah. He has been for the last six years.’ Finn looked vague. ‘The second killer, the one who murdered the girl, I checked out his MO because that sounded familiar, too.’ ‘And?’ ‘It matched with the MO of a guy called Mathew Bryce who was also arrested over eighteen months ago. He's doing time in Whitely as well. What conclusions can you draw from that?’ Finn shrugged. ‘That someone copied them,’ he said. ‘Or that they both escaped and duplicated the crimes they were originally arrested for.’ Gregson smiled when he saw the look on Finn's face. ‘See why I didn't mention it before? It's fucking crazy. We know they didn't escape because we would have heard, the whole country would have heard. They're still inside Whitely.’ The phrase on both the files he'd read re-surfaced in his mind. Term being served . ‘But if someone imitated the crimes committed by Lawton and Bryce, what's to stop somebody else imitating murders committed by any killer locked up in any jail in the country?’ ‘That still doesn't explain why they torched themselves,’ Finn observed. Gregson shrugged. ‘On that point,’ he said, ‘your guess is as good as mine.’ The DI got to his feet and headed for the door. The other occupants of the cafe watched him go. Finn left some money for the tea and coffee on the table, then fed change into the cigarette machine and pulled a packet out. He joined his superior at the door, pulling up the collar of his jacket as they stepped out into the street. ‘Where to next?’ he said, cupping his hand around the Marlboro he was trying to light. ‘Over there,’ said Gregson, nodding in the direction of the neon-shrouded building opposite. The lights formed the word ‘Loveshow’."

NWS NWS-AHB-039 4.38 "Money-Go-Round: Making the most of allowances UNLIKE those rich enough to set aside assets for a period of years in order to avoid tax, those dependent on income — particularly those subject to Pay As You Earn — have limited scope to fend off the taxman. Broadly speaking, their best strategies to cope with a Labour win would be to ensure they make the most of allowances created through the independent taxation of husbands and wives, and — where possible — to take income on a self-employed basis rather than as employees. Married couples, where one of the spouses has little or no income, should transfer income from deposits and investments into the account of the non-working spouse to use up his or her allowance — that is, a slice of tax free income. For this tax year, the individual personal allowance is £3,295 and the married couples allowance is £1,720. Next year, starting on Monday, the personal allowance rises to £3,445 but the married one is unchanged. Employees might also seek to change their status to self-employed and work for the same company, or others, on a consultancy basis. Alternatively, they could seek to arrange their affairs so that part of their income is received on a self-employed basis, rather than being treated as overtime. The reason is that Labour said it will retain the present National Insurance contributions ceiling for the self employed at £21,060 whereas employees will suffer an additional 9 p.c. deduction on earnings above that threshold. But the Inland Revenue has already warned that it will investigate any changes of status to ensure that they are genuine. In addition, many employers are reluctant to allow employees to change status because they could be liable for unlimited arrears payments of National Insurance if these are subsequently disallowed by the taxman."
NWS NWS-AHB-040 4.14 "Money-Go-Round: BES might look better with Labour By IAN COWIE BUSINESS Expansion Schemes share issues may appeal to those who can forego access to part of their savings for five years in return for sheltering these funds from tax. Indeed, assurances from Labour that the abolition of the BES will not be retrospective could increase attractions. At present, BES investors can claim relief at their top rate of tax and take gains tax-free after five years. So BES stock with a nominal value of £1,000 costs a top-rate taxpayer only £600. This means, for example, that only 20 p.c. growth is required for the investor to double his or her after-tax return. Labour has said that the top rate of income tax will rise to 50 p.c. on income, after allowances, of £36,375 or more. Thus the real cost of £1,000 worth of BES shares to anybody earning more than that during the fiscal year, which starts on Monday, would be only £500. No growth in the BES company at all, after charges, would be necessary for this investment to double in value over five years. But it is important to distinguish between high-risk BES issues and those that are virtually banking contracts, albeit underwritten by housing associations and educational institutions. Those in the high-risk category are, broadly, those which invest in trading companies or which lack an assured means of turning this unquoted stock back into cash. By contrast, contracted-exit BES issues have already signed covenants or agreements with institutions which will enable shareholders to realise their investments. This type of BES has raised £340m this tax year compared with less than £50m in the riskier offerings. The determining factor in choosing between contracted-exit funds is the quality of the covenant — how secure is the institution underwriting the realisation value? BES analyst Anthony Yadgaroff said: ‘The best of these have already been fully-subscribed, but one exception is Close Brothers Bessa Plus where the covenant is very good and you get a minimum return of £1.25 for each £1 invested. Standing behind this offer, which is equivalent to 14.5 p.c. per annum, is Hill Samuel, and standing behind Hill Samuel is the parent company, TSB. ‘I also quite like Johnson Fry's Election Protection BES and Capital Ventures Election Hedge, but my reservation with these is that contracts remain unsigned.’"

Brook has been in operation in Britain for 27 years, and the evidence suggests that Brook has contributed to the decline of sexual health there. Brook dispenses contraceptives to all, regardless of age or status, and including under-age girls. Brook will also make all the necessary arrangements for its young clients to obtain abortions. Brook operates without parental knowledge or consent, determined that parents should never know that their under-age children are sexually active and receiving contraception, if the child requests confidentially. Brook is equally determined that parents should have no say over their children's exposure to permissive sex-education material. Those areas where Brook's influence is strongest have particularly high abortion rates. However, readers may be glad to know that Family and Youth Concern are hosting a one-day conference at the Wellington Park Hotel on 11th September, when Mrs Victoria Gillick, the arch-enemy of the Brook Advisory Centre will tell of her battle with this agency over the years. Also, Mrs Valerie Riches will speak on the content of many of the sex-education programmes used in British schools, which in practice offer only a moral sexual instruction, and subject the young to ideas which would not normally occur to them. The conference is open to all those people of good-will, who recognise the challenge to traditional family values, and appreciate the danger in allowing the breakdown of the social ecology to go unchecked.

NWS NWS-K2N-012 4.92 "Man jailed for killing his girlfriend AN alcoholic who admitted killing his five months pregnant girlfriend was jailed for five years today. Jennifer Trimble (32), died two days after receiving head injuries during a drunken row with the accused Thomas Wightman in February last year. Belfast Crown Court heard that the couple's six-year relationship had been stormy and that they had hit each other on numerous occasions. Cuts A Crown lawyer said police were called to the pair's Donard Street home in Belfast after neighbours heard shouting and fighting. Officers found Wightman (35), with cuts to his eye. Ms Trimble was lying unconscious on a settee in the front living room. She had severe bruises to the face and eyes and her head was wrapped in a towel. She failed to regain consciousness and died two days later in hospital. The prosecution said that the two had been out drinking and had started to fight when they came home. Wightman told police he hit his girlfriend's head against the bathroom door or wall, but said he had not intended to kill her. Defence lawyer Tony Cinnamond said, however, that Wightman's recollection of the events were hazy due to drink and it could have been that he struck her and her head banged against the wall. ‘Almost certainly this was a very unlucky blow for her and for him,’ he said. The lawyer said the pair had fallen deeply in love and his client was ‘devastated’ by what had happened. Case Passing sentence, Lord Justice MacDermott said: ‘The background to this case is one of excessive drinking and violence.’ He told Wightman: ‘People simply must not be violent towards each other. If they are and this kind of tragedy occurs then they must be punished for such behaviour.’ The judge accepted that the accused would be ‘tormented’ by this knowledge for the rest of his life.

NWS NWS-K3C-018 4.21 "Call for action on cover at hospital By Ian Lang Daily Post Staff HEALTH watchdogs in Aberconwy are stepping up their pressure on Gwynedd Health Authority to ensure there is adequate weekend and night-time anaesthetic cover at Llandudno Hospital. Earlier this year Aberconwy Community Health Council called for urgent action to tackle the situation. They say that cover is presently provided from Ysbyty Gwynedd at Bangor, but are concerned that delays in getting to Llandudno could prove potentially serious. The health authority say a consultant anaesthetist living in Colwyn Bay is available. But the health watchdogs have countered that one person cannot be expected to be on call all the time, and that person might also not be available. Instead, they want three anaesthetists who live nearer Llandudno Hospital to be put on a local cover rota. They also pointed to an incident during which a patient had to wait for four hours for an anaesthetist. They had been pleased that the health authority's chairman, Grahame Hulse, had taken a sympathetic view. But the community health council's chief officer, Mrs Chris Stead, said the council had still not been given any assurances that the situation was being addressed."

But Mr Leckie must be partly right. Professor Robert Davies, of Bart's, has pointed out that exhaust pollution explains the curious fact that city dwellers these days are more affected by hay fever than those in the country. Both these allergic conditions have the same underlying cause: a dysfunctioning immune system. Therefore all immunosuppressive factors can play a part. These include chemical allergens (exhaust fumes and tobacco smoke among them), food allergens (too often overlooked by asthma specialists), and physical and psychological stress. Their effects are cumulative; there is no single answer in cell-mediated allergy."
NWS NWS-K5C-091 4.55 "Homelessness Glasgow University's recently published study of homelessness among the young in Scotland simply highlights the facts which have been known to anyone who had been working in the social security system in whatever capacity for a number of years. The changes which came into place in April 1988 have had a devastating effect on young people. At the stroke of a pen they removed hundreds of thousands of needy youngsters from the benefit system and condemned many of them to a life of mendicant poverty, many also slipped into prostitution. In desperation, in many cases, young females deliberately become pregnant because they know that once they are in that state they are immediately restored to the benefit system. Moreover, there is at least a possibility that local authorities will house them and their rent will be paid under housing costs. However, there is a snag, even in this desperate solution, in that the changes also withdrew the facility which was available under supplementary benefit to make single payments for furniture etc. Prior to 10 April, 1988, a young person in this situation could apply to the Department of Health and Social Security, as it then was, for a single payment grant for essential items of furniture. The apparatus put in its place, of social fund grants and social fund loans, is widely and almost totally discredited. I do not suggest that to restore benefit to 16 to 18-year-olds would solve this problem overnight, but it would go far down the road to alleviating this problem which surely must be unacceptable in 1993."

Our research is not complete, and your report appears to have been based on a brief article in a farming journal. We have found no greater frequency of complaints of seasonal allergic-type symptoms in oilseed rape than in non-oilseed rape rural areas. Just under 20 per cent of the population, however, in both areas complain of spring/summer symptoms and in the oilseed rape area a proportion attributed their symptoms to this crop. It seems likely that, in many cases, they are correct, but that these symptoms are not due to what doctors would normally regard as allergy. The word allergy means different things to different people, from almost any unusual symptom to a specific and measurable form of immunological response. We hope that our continuing work will shed light on these different concepts, and in due course we shall publish our results in medical journals. For the moment, it seems unlikely that oilseed rape causes more frequent or more dangerous symptoms to those living nearby than do many other crops. This is not to say that it does not cause symptoms; we think that it does in some people."
