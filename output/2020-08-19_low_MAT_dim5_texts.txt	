HOC HOC-MZ -0.05 " I am outraged that they would even consider trying to ban him, what sort of society are we living in people should have the freedom to listen to what they want just like having the freedom of speech if you don't like it don't listen but don't try and impress your views on everyone else this is the 21st century after all. Long live Eminem.      Elizabeth, UK I agree that Eminem's lyrics are shocking but that is exactly what they are supposed to be. Everything he talks about happens every day. Banning him would be banning telling the truth, shocking as it may be, and what kind of example is that setting to children? My argument is the problem is not with Eminem but with the society that gives him his material.      Are people not allowed to entertain fiction within music. If I wrote a song about violence it does not necessarily mean I am violent or that I really advocate it. Is this sort of fiction only allowed to authors of literature. If our children took more notice of literature would we ban them from reading certain books.      I'm 16, I love modern music and freedom of expression, but having listened to Eminem, I must say I was deeply disturbed, not by the language but the content. He seems to be becoming an idol for those younger than me, a fact which I am not comfortable with. Should Eminem be banned? No. But stronger controls on the music that young children are allowed to buy need to be introduced.      Eminem is a talentless offensive idiot but to ban him would just play into his own hands by giving him the publicity he craves. (Anyone remember Frankie Goes to Hollywood?) Much as I loathe his music and bigoted opinions you can't ban something just because you don't agree with it.      Thanks to this bigot, after being a citizen for 26 years in the US, his fans racially taunted my daughter. Thank you Eminem, but there will be backlash somewhere, I for one will stand up against hooligans like you.      I don't think his music should be banned. If parents train their children with strong morals and values, then they don't have to worry what they listen to in music or stuff at school. Kids are very smart, they know what's right from wrong. Long live freedom of speech.      Instead of banning Eminem, who has talent and originality to his works, can we please ban manufactured dross like Steps, S-Club 7 and that (ugh) new band coming out in ""Popstars""?      Whether or not he should be banned is a question I am uneasy with. However I would say that the popularity of this debate has given the opportunity for many of us to question our own beliefs on to what extent individuals should get away with expressing bigotry on groups in society.      It's the media again, stirring things up! Fortunately, not all people believe what the papers want us to believe. I believe in freedom of expression. If he had a difficult childhood it's good he can express it through song. Considering that most pop songs are really meaningless without any depth, this type is more interesting although not exactly run of the mill.      Yes - Eminem should be banned as he promotes and celebrates 'thug culture'. However, banning him will just guarentee his popularity, so we should not grant him the centre of attention that he so obviously wants. I suggest a media blackout.      Its a straight censorship question. We (nearly) all understand the sense in categorising films as 18,15, PG etc. and all understand the thinking behind the TV 9 p.m. watershed. There is no case for banning Eminem, parental control and censorship to protect the young and impressionable is required.      All this has certainly got my mother up in arms, that's all I can say!      The concert at Manchester was excellent, the albums are fantastic, he is just so cute, wears the most wonderful clothes and has got to be the most talented person to come out of the USA ever. Why does anyone want to ban him? The men who do are jealous, the women who do need to lighten up. On a more serious note, freedom of speech is a terribly important thing, and never ever to be taken lightly, whatever you believe.      I went to the show last night in London and it was amazing, you can't ban Eminem, so many people like him, it wouldn't be fair, you'd be depriving a large majority of people, just because some people over-analyse his lyrics!      Please don't ban him. I'll be forced to go out and buy the CD... and I don't like rap. I guess I could put it on the shelf next to the Sex Pistols and Spycatcher.      Since when did the state have the option to decide what music we listen to. On that basis, we should ban a whole series of controversial books, films, videos. Maybe we could have big bonfires to burn all the banned material, and find someone to blame, and persecute them! I think that the 'moral majority' should see this for what it really is - cheap, tacky publicity and sales promotion. And by calling for it to be banned, they are actually giving the record company some of the best publicity of all! Come on, people, let's not play in to their hands!      I have a 13 year old daughter who loves Eminem. Though a lot of his lyrics are his own personal thoughts and lifetime experiences, I took the step to ban her from playing the CD in the garden last summer as we have elderly neighbours and when my nieces (8 and 5) are around. You can't stop them listening to the radio and watching TV. I am surprised that Stan wasn't banned by the BBC completely. I don't think it is a real problem, after all we had the Sex Pistols in the 1970s didn't we?      Eminem is the best. Don't ban him from the UK.     I have always believed that music represents the era we are living in. We do not live in a nice Barbie world, we live among all those things Eminem sings about so why hide from reality? Why refuse that part of the truth Eminem sings about? Sad, hard to cope with, unjust, but still true.      After watching Eminem live in Manchester I was blown away by the sheer presence of the world's biggest music figure. Eminem is truly a lyrical genius.      Hitler used censorship to control Germany in WWII, and the European Convention on Human Rights guarantees freedom of speech. Alongside that is freedom not to listen. I am gay, and have also been beaten up for it, but music doesn't make people homophobic. I say let Eminem rock - I enjoy his music.      Most definitely not, shall we have a poll to ban free speech as well? The music is dull but the lyrics tell a different story of a man who has been ignored by the very people who need to open their eyes      I remember about 30 years ago a similar fuss about Alice Cooper's 'controversial' stage show - he used a guillotine on stage and faked executions. The shock, the horror! But did all of us who went to these concerts come out and murder people? I think not. Have some regard for the intelligence of the audience. My 15 year old daughter is a fan, but has the sense to realise that 'Slim Shady' is simply a persona, an alter-ego. For God's sake, everyone get a grip - do you really want to ban music you don't like??      I am at Sheffield Uni and believe the ban to be undemocratic, pointless and misguided. Yes he talked about 'killing faggots', then in another song said 'there's no reason a man and another man can't elope'. These songs are old fashioned morality plays that provoke discussion. Censorship is a morally bankrupt process that prevents discussion. Long live freedom of speech.      If Eminem had not released his singles. Then we would never have heard of Dido. So just ignore him and listen to Dido. Much better      Never heard of him before seeing this item.      Eminem is only expressing his thoughts and feelings through music. Maybe that's the only way for him to do so in order for the people to listen to his problems.      It is a sad so see yet another high profile bigot emerge and enjoy such seemingly blind widespread support from the many and justification for his apparent bigotry from the few. In April it will be the anniversary of the London nail bomber outrages that resulted in scores of injuries and in the deaths of two gay men and a pregnant straight woman who embraced diversity. I knew one of the two gay men who were murdered. The apparent misogynistic and homophobic ranting of Eminem in his lyrics gives succour to those who are filled with irrational hate and fear and who are the cause of countless gay bashing and male on female violence each and everyday. There is a fine line between freedom of speech and the freedom to spout hatred towards certain groups. It seems sad that we even have to worry about banning such a person in the first place.      Because he's white there are many offensive words such as the racist N---word that Eminem probably would never dare use in his lyrics! But it has been used by many other black hip-hop artists like Public Enemy, NWA and the Fugees. Some of these artists have used very racist anti-white comments in their music, and I remember one rap star commenting ""my music is dedicated to blacks only, and is not intended for whites"". Can you imagine the uproar if Eminem said that about blacks? I am not racist myself and I don't support any kind of offensive comments but if Eminem was black we would not be having this discussion!      Gosh, Guy Ritchie's films aren't terribly wholesome either. Could you please ban him too?      Am I the only gay Eminem fan? There must be more of us out there. His music is brilliant, Kim is an amazing track, it is really disturbing to listen to. The fact that a song enrages such emotions is definitely a good thing. Music (art) has so much more potential than the bubblegum pop that rules the charts today. Let him be, think of it as a performance and if you don't like him, don't listen to him. I will gladly turn off the radio if the all-so-familiar tones of Westlife start to play.      Martin Price made a good point but came to the wrong conclusion. Respect to his 12 year old son for finding the lyrics sick and vulgar and for choosing not to listen to them. But this only goes to show that the buying public are not zombies and can make up their own minds about right and wrong. Likewise I do not agree with the content of the lyrics but I like and listen to the music for its shock value.      In the 60's they tried to ban the Beatles for references to drugs. In the 70's they tried to ban The Sex Pistols for references to the Queen. Then, as now, people have a choice to either listen or to not listen. Eminem's controversial stance may have upset certain fractions of society, but the guy is speaking his mind. We live in a democracy and I believe if he has something to say, let him say it.      Ignore him and he'll go away.      No don't ban him. But his music is dull and his lyrics shallow and infantile. Rap is a subcultural cul-de-sac. I have seen him compared to real poets (Keats, Shelley etc) which makes me alternately cringe and howl with laughter.      Why does Martin Price allow his 12 year-old child to buy CDs with an explicit lyrics warning on the cover?      Moral outrage at Eminem's lyrics is misplaced. In truth they are an outpouring of despair and anger at the lack of love or meaning in Eminem's life. Eminem is a product of today's society - a society we all bear the responsibility for. If we wish to sweep Eminem's words under the carpet it is more out of a desire to hide the moral failure in our own hearts.      Definitely not banned, don't be silly, let the protesters protest as they are legally allowed to and let him write his lyrics as he's legally allowed to      What is the point in banning him when people will just listen to him on the Internet or by buying pirate albums, further damaging the music industry.      Why ban him? If you don't like his views or music you're not forced to listen. I personally don't advocate his views but at least they're invoking a debate.      Yes he should be banned. If this is music, then we have all been conned. Even my 12 year old son (who bought one of his CDs) agrees that the lyrics are sick, vulgar and total rubbish and that he is obviously just out for 'cheap publicity' by trying to shock everybody. Well unfortunately in this day and age it doesn't work. My son now uses his CD as a coffee mug mat which he says is the best place for it !!!      Wake up Britain! Have you never listened to the lyrics of songs by Tom Jones, Elvis Presley etc, all 'respectable' musicians? Try 'Delilah' for a start - it's about stabbing someone. Eminem is just more explicit and the current climate is more disposed towards self-expression. Violence has always been in music and always will be. You can always turn the radio off.      For the record, I think his music is no better or worse than the rest of the 'Gangsta Rap' genre, although I thought 'My Name Is..' was funny. He is no more a threat than Ozzie Osbourne was when the Parents Music Resource Centre in the US went after him. This is all about censorship, and people wanting a squeaky clean world with everyone having the same opinions. The world isn't like that. Get used to it.      I saw Eminem on Friday in London and was blown away by the whole show. He has so much talent and basically made a lot of people very happy that night. There was no violence or trouble at the gig and to be honest, if Britain became a country that was able to take that away from me then I wouldn't want to live here. Thank you Eminem, the memories will last longer than the controversy.      Sure, let's ban him. And while we're at it, well I don't like Cliff Richard, so ban him too. And boy bands, they really get on my nerves, so can we ban them as well? How about anyone who's ever had a lyric I disagree with - can we ban them too?      Well, let us all think for ourselves. I think he's great.      I think the sort of people that are offended by Eminem are all too easily offended. The likes of Tatchell have whopping chips on their shoulders and are continually looking for media attention. Much of Eminem's output is quite responsible, as well as displaying real creative genius. He is entertaining to those that like to hear it, and that ultimately is the business he is in. Anybody who has their prejudices reinforced by his lyrics will find approval for their views wherever they look.      Is anyone seriously suggesting that this horrendous stuff is music? It sounds so awful that I have to turn my radio off as soon as I hear it. I'd rather listen to my washing machine!      Believe me, there is a lot worse than Eminem in the world of rap. Let the man get on with his music and get a life!The rest of us have the right to listen and see what we want and that is thanks to that thing called FREEDOM.      To ban someone so minuscule and meaningless as Eminem is silly but to condone his spiteful contempt, just because we can't ""mirror his bigotry"", is simply irresponsible. We should highlight his primitive shortcomings in civilised public discourse instead, there is enough written of him. We cannot in any way give credibility to misogyny and homophobia.      In spite of what he says, the man has not committed a crime (unlike Mike Tyson, whom you did let in). Any nation that calls itself free cannot block anyone from entry simply because the words they say or sing.      Eminem must be laughing all the way to the bank. Whatever people have to say about him, good or bad, it's all publicity which is exactly what he wants. He's not the first artist to be controversial and the more he offends people, the more records he sells. He shouldn't be banned because he's not exactly a threat to society, just a rapper who everyone will get bored with eventually.      I believe that the university was right to ban him from performing, as there are opinions highlighted in his music that conflict with those set out by the institution. This certainly does not amount to censorship. Preventing him from appearing in the public forum is a different matter. That said it is difficult to see how his songs do not have a negative influence given the age groups of the children that I have heard listening to and repeating the lyrics in his music.      I think he is a superb artist and poet. The first rap artist to make me sit up and listen to what is being said. ""Stan"" and ""Kim"" on the latest album are quite exceptional pieces of art. Why shouldn't he rap about his own life? He is not telling you to do it. He is a musician/rapper/whatever you want to call him who paints pictures with his music. We all watch horror films, slasher movies, psychological thrillers, real life dramas....this is the soundtrack.      I think that too many people take Eminem too seriously. Many forget that not everything that is recorded on a CD is the truth. Do we really believe that S Club 7 can ""Reach For The Stars"", or that Britney Spears is actually ""Crazy""?      I think at some point or another you see a rising of a star profile ...which Eminem embraces proudly. Its the uniqueness of his music and lyrics that make people listen to it and relate to their own life ... another great speaker was the late Tupac; provocative lyrics about the society and injustices but true to certain extend. I think the rage in his music is the kind of inner instinct that probably everybody has it but afraid of letting it out.      If I stood in the middle of a city protesting how much I hate Gays/Blacks/Disabled/police, would I really be allowed to continue by a crowd who says ""oh, we live in a country of free expression, lets listen"" or would I be arrested for public order offences or would I just be beaten up? What do you think?      I think that banning Eminem is a terrible idea, his latest album was a best-seller in the UK last year. Also, banning Eminem will only encourage more people (especially teenagers) to listen to him as a way of rebelling. Finally, just because people listen to his music it does not mean they share the same views as him.      I thought we live in a free country with freedom of speech. Ban a musician? Then we are no better than Hitler.      While I personally find Eminem's music nihilist and atonal, I think banning his music is a knee-jerk reaction that belies the root cause of youth violence and rage. It is all too simple for the Government to ban music, art or writing that highlights the views of antisocial individuals. Such conduct allows them to maintain the image of taking action, without having to actually acknowledge and forge solutions to societal problems. The more things change, the more they stay the same.      Surely the mere fact we are discussing this means that Eminem has done a good job. For him all publicity is good publicity, if he believes what he says then good, but chances are he says it too sell records and he seems to have it down to a fine art.      The government's recent comments ring true here. We should ban a man (Eminem) who has committed no crime, yet we didn't ban a man (Tyson) who has. Banning someone because you disagree with his opinions is the first step towards totalitarianism, where perhaps people are barred from religious expression because they are Jewish? Let's stop the rot before it starts.      I don't like Eminem but that does ""not"" mean that he should be banned. If Eminem doesn't like homosexuality, as far as I am concerned there is nothing wrong with him voicing his opinion. We should be free to make our own choices about what we ourselves consider acceptable.      Censorship at this level is a bad thing because it could lead on to other stuff being banned too. This is the 21st Century, grow up! If it offends you, don't listen to it but, don't try to stop everyone else listening, and allowing them to form their own opinions.      He should be praised, not banned. My mother said to me a few days ago that he says ""disgusting things"". It's no more than would see or hear in an 18-certificate movie. His lyrics can be seen as offensive, but I prefer to think of them as challenging. He's just trying to express his opinion, and he has every right to do so. And anyway, if people don't want to listen to him, don't listen to him!      My 13 year old son listens to Eminem in much the same way that I listened to David Bowie. The last thing that will stop teenagers listening to this unsavoury character is people like me or the Government banning him. You may as well have him deified.      Stonewall claim Eminem doesn't rail against black people because ""he's scared of them"". Hasn't it occurred to them that he might be homophobic but not racist or is that notion too dangerous for them to contemplate? Let him play and let people be given the credit for coming to their own conclusions.      Certainly not until we ban Steps and all the rest of the boy/girl band ""fall in love"" lyrics that are doing far more damage to society than Eminem. I personally am sick of the politically correct brigade objecting to freedom of speech when it doesn't suit their cocooned little world....      Whatever happened to freedom of expression. Just because a person listens to something it does not mean they have to agree with it. If individuals mirror this bigoted behaviour then those individuals should be punished. Has Sheffield SU banned all literature holding racist or homophobic views from it's libraries?      To be honest, I would rather see a ban on the soulless and talent-free drivel from teeny boy-bands that pollute the airwaves. Here is a man who raps with an astounding lyrical dexterity and talent that is remarkably refreshing today. As for accusations of homophobia and sexism. I think Eminem is an equal-opportunities hater, his rage is directed at all groups - himself included. He is just very, very angry. Fortunately he creates awesome music from his rage. As for M Fox claiming he ""ruined"" Dido's tune: listen to the song, actually listen to the lyrics and you will see that they, combined with the story of the chorus, have a haunting tragedy that Dido is probably pretty proud of.      Should we ban Eminem? No because he has talent! He may have questionable morals but he does have ability. No one ever talks about banning the likes of the Spice Girls and Westlife and all these other ridiculous excuses for pop groups. So why ban someone whose famous because he is talented rather than because a faceless record company executive said ""make it so!""      And here I was, thinking that censorship was a thing of the past and that we now live in a tolerant and multi-cultural society. Oh well, guess I was wrong. I'm ashamed to admit that I did my degree in Sheffield as I was always proud of how the university claimed to accept all cultures and beliefs. I didn't realise that this was on the proviso that they didn't offend the ears of the chattering classes.      Personally I think that his attitude stinks and that he is probably a xenophobe. His music is awful - look what he did to Dido's song to turn it into Stan.     Make your own decisions, take your own risks, be responsible for the outcome of your own decisions. No-one is forced to do anything they don't want. If you don't like his music then switch it off but you have no right to force others to do the same.      Having actually been beaten up, just for being gay, I say yes ban him.      I do not think you can ban someone on the principle that you should never block freedom of expression. What saddens me is that people are willing to fall for Eminem's undoubtable skill for marketing himself and his image.      On behalf of the entire United States, I apologise to the UK for creating the market for Eminem. Unintelligence has become somewhat of a fad in the US these days and, of course, if you want to be stupid, you have to be smart. This is exactly why Eminem will never make fun of or write lyrics depicting African Americans in a negative light. If he does, his career is over. Listen with an open mind, but always remember what your own personal values have brought you.      While Eminem's lyrics might not be to everyone's taste, I do find this hysteria a bit disturbing. He's a pop artist - nothing more. If Sheffield SU can't see that for what it is then that's their business but I do believe that the rest of us can make up our own minds. If you don't like him, don't buy a ticket to his shows or buy his records.      I'm sure the same thing was said of the Beastie Boys when they first swore in an interview on national TV. The band were criticised as aggressive, their lyrics declared misogynist and their behaviour condemned as abhorrent and something to be discouraged for fear that our young may replicate the image. Eminem's music is simply representative of modern day images transmitted to our screens on a daily basis. Sad, but unfortunately true. To ban the US rapper from the UK would be highly hypocritical given the present state of the medium of television and cinema.      I think that Eminem is a fount of misplaced rage. He is so self-conscious about his own life that he sings about it to comfort himself. I believe that some of his work is very good but other bits are just mass produced over-commercialised songs with no meaning or thought about the effect that they may have on the audience which he operates in. I am sitting on the fence on this one but he would not be where he is if he wasn't talented would he?      Surely we learned something from the ""Frankie Goes to Hollywood"" fiasco some years ago, when attempts by DJ Mike Read to ban the song ""Relax"" caused sales to jump and the song to go to . Ignore Eminem and he will go away. Make a fuss and he's here to stay. (Gosh that rhymes !!!)      No! Eminem should not be banned. I believe that people have the right to express themselves through their music. It is up to the listening public to choose whether any viewpoint is a valid one in each person's belief system. If we begin to censor music then it will become less expressive as a result of musicians being scared of censorship. It is my view that music is a way of communicating your emotions without them being taken literally. It is when music IS taken literally that we see arguments and problems related to its message.      Of course it should be banned, along with all the other songs with naughty words. We should only listen to government approved music. Nanny knows best.      The only thing that should be banned is banning things.      What use will banning Eminem do? People already listen to his music, and have every right to do so. Banning it will make it seem 'glamorous' and therefore attract the more suggestible of the population. Also, we failed to ban convicted rapist Mike Tyson from fighting in the UK even though the law said we should - so why should we ban someone who hasn't even committed a crime? One law for all and freedom of choice and expression - that's what we need.      A little more publicity won't hurt now will it?      The best thing about the ban is that it has certainly got people talking about the issue. I think his lyrics are disgusting and highlighting them will show him up for the nasty little man he is. Remember Shabba Ranks - another homophobic bigoted rapper? No? Pop stars come and go and the quicker Eminem goes the better! I commend Sheffield for raising the issue. I have my own personal ban on my car radio.      No Eminem shouldn't be banned - the content of his songs are not for the faint-hearted I admit, but he's a performer - it's a role. Should we ban all press for Anthony Hopkins as ""Hannibal"" due to the extreme nature of the character? Let's give up on the ""nanny state"" and live in the twenty-first century for goodness sake! Many radio stations already bleep out or dip the sound on portions of the songs already as they break (or at least stretch) broadcasting rules and codes of conduct. My advice - if you don't like it, don't listen to it. Personally I find it some of the most interesting music I have come across in a long time.      Yes - but only because his ""music"" is horrible!      M and M's? They're only like Smarties and they haven't been banned!      I think that if we were all brain dead drones then maybe he should be banned. Since we are not and CAN THINK FOR OURSELVES, I believe that we can choose for ourselves too.      No, he shouldn't be banned "
HOC HOC-AH -0.12 " I don't think Saa has done the right thing and I don't think that Argentina's anger about habitual internal corruption and mismanagement will be so easily quelled. Regarding the IMF bleating about their lost funds: you can't get blood out of a stone. The IMF should have seen this coming years ago and done something to control the problem, instead of actively making Argentina's financial situation worse. I'm reminded of avaricious back street loan sharks who prey on the poor and then bay for their blood. The IMF's conduct and irresponsible contribution in Argentina's financial downfall is nothing short of an obscenity.      I think that President de la Rua should have been more diligent about ending Argentina's recession. On the other hand, if the Argentine people don't like how he's handling the recession, they could simply elect a new President at the next election, but rioting is NOT the answer.      Nothing ""should be done"". The interventionist impulse in the world is running amok and that is what we ought to do something about. We ought to tend to our front yards more and not mind the business of other people. This is an Argentinian internal affair.      I have lived in Argentina for the past two years, and I am very much saddened by the recent events in that country. What other contributors who say that 'Argentina needs to be taught a lesson' seem to forget is that there is a human side to this problem. The majority of the population of Argentina has been affected by the recession of the past three years. People in Argentina don't have the safety net of a social security system to fall back on.      I do not understand why country like Argentina, with such good natural resources and educated people is in this condition. This situation will come to other countries too, whose leaders are continuously borrowing money, without properly utilizing it.      I wish people would stop blaming the IMF. The IMF does not force its services on anyone. Argentina's troubles are of its own making - corruption and fiscal mismanagement. The country has lots of resources, a skilled labour force and excellent ports. It should be one of the most economically successful nations in the hemisphere. Only the Argentineans can solve their own problems.      The world is in a synchronised global recession. Countries such as Argentina have no possible way to service what is more than ever an excessive debt burden. Time for a clean default, no moratoriums, no restructurings. Without this the Argentine economy/society has no chance and will continue to play the role of carrion for what has - over the last decades - become a vulture capitalism.      As a Nigerian growing up in Nigeria I watched with pain how the IMF imposed its conditions on our government in order for the nation to be eligible for loans. I could not understand why this had to be the option chosen and always foresaw such conditions, which led to strict austerity measures, as harsh and inhuman. What has happened in Argentina is not surprising: it is a manifestation of the fact that capitalism would always fail in countries that are not prepared for it and countries should not be forced to develop capitalist economies.     I have lived in Argentina for the last 20 years. My job has allowed me to watch closely both the governments in place and the business community. I have seen time and again corruption, inefficiency, blatant disregard for all sorts of rights and incredible callousness. Certainly the IMF and the latest policies precipitated a crisis that had been boiling for a long time. But the seeds were planted well in advance by Peronists, military and radicals alike albeit in different styles.      The same thing will happen here in the US if the ""right-wing"" conservatives get their way in our government. For them, it's all about the rich getting richer as well as corporate welfare and everyone else can go to hell.      I am deeply saddened by the crisis. I have visited Argentina and a number of other countries in Latin America and I have friends who live in the country. The crisis has not been unexpected as I have been following local news there for some time and saw first-hand signs of the effects of the vicious recession when I was in Buenos Aires in June this year. The recent riots and looting have been a sudden and sharp aggravation in the problems that currently face the nation.      It is truly a crime that the financial world AND the people of Argentina let this happen. The IMF has to show some mercy and get these people functioning. The Argentines are going to have to make some REAL sacrifices and hard decisions to make the country work again as it did before World War Two. PLEASE get your act together down there. We want you to succeed as much as you do!!!!      We are trapped in here and sliding back to the Middle Ages. This incident has been fuelled by the sectors that wanted devaluation. The main problem here is unemployment (about 20 percent). It is a direct consequence of a lack of working capitals. You can't have a capitalist economy without capitals, can you? The main cause of capital scarcity is a government that is like a money sucking vacuum cleaner. It has spent more tax than it collects. To borrow money you have to pay 50 percent annual interest rates, so what legal activity could be profitable?      I believe that the international community must bear a large portion of the blame here. Argentina has been more or less forced by western neo liberal economists to privatise industries and end subsidies, yet if the west did not subsidise its own agricultural industries, Argentina's economy would grow at around five percent a year, given the vast natural wealth the country possesses. It seems that free market economics only count when they are in the west's interests. And yes, corruption is a problem, but why should the Argentine people carry all of the burden (my girlfriend, a teacher, has not been paid for three months) and the lenders none? They knew the risks when they lent the money.      Economic reasoning and rationale are the only viable options. The World IMF has a responsibility and just like Third World countries were made to repackage long-term debt, a similar solution here may well be applicable. Argentina needs to consider how it will self-engineer itself not by other countries contributing in enormous amounts of money in aid relief for a virtual bankrupt state but by creating markets for competitiveness and efficiency. From this will spring reduced inflation, prices, interest rates and unemployment. With global economics in a cycle of minimising the downturns at present after the September 11 attacks prudence is the key to establishing a more stable government with better fiscal and monetary policy.      Another country goes down the sink and the west is required to bail it out again. If we don't deliver a shining new economy with prosperity for all then we will as per usual become the scapegoat and Argentines will never look to themselves but instead will sink further into the mire blaming everyone else for their woes.      This world is getting more and more greedy. What has happened is no surprise. This is just the beginning of a world catastrophe unless we control our excesses.      Without wanting to sound too cold, if Argentines love their country, why are they trashing it? I doubt it is going to help the situation, especially when the clean up will cost so much. As usual McDonalds or Bill Gates and their capitalist ways will be blamed for this. If they want people to help them they should help themselves, and I don't see Argentina doing that yet.      It would be yet another platitude to declare that Argentina is now placed at a historical crossroads. It seems obvious to me that Argentina is unable to help itself unless it receives solid international support. The IMF should realise that the loan payment schedule it enforced upon Argentina impedes with the country's ability to counter the social destabilising effects of recession. I agree that the corrupt and inefficient political structure of the country holds most of the blame but the international apathy towards Argentina's tormented economic structure is also a major factor in the current crisis. The international financial community should offer unconditional support for Argentina, in order to avert a total economic collapse.      I'm really tired of hearing my countrymen saying that our situation is the IMF's fault. We are the problem here, our government and ourselves are ill. Our illness is the corruption. We are always looking for the easy way to do the work, but we'll never get any better until we change our minds and start to think like our ancestors, who came here running from war to build a new nation. They worked as hard as they could to make a great country and they reached their goal, and we are now destroying everything with our lack conscience.      A relatively poor country cannot tie its economy to that of a much richer country without depleting its resources. That is what has ruined Argentina and one notes the disquieting silence of the rich countries as the poor pay the price for the ridiculously high profits of the financial centres of the world. The next country to be hit will be Mexico because of its total dependence on marginal industries, the US sites in that country and the overextension of what remains of its middle class. The crisis could be even worse there than in Argentina.      If the good intentions in most of these messages are anything to go by, then there is still hope that our nation will be helped out by the economically rich countries, that now have a chance to prove their moral greatness as well.      I have been told by an Argentine that the crisis is fundamentally caused by Foreign ownership of argentine resources, production, services, etc. I don't know but it looks as if the people are suffering. I know that people have not been paid in months. I think somehow the people needs, not the multinational corporations needs should be addressed.      Having just visited the beautiful country of Argentina a few weeks ago, I am deeply saddened by the turmoil taking place in this proud nation. Perhaps some form of debt forgiveness for Argentina should now be considered, if a responsible and fair government can be formed.      President de la Rua's decision to resign may well have severe implications for Latin American stability as a whole.      The IMF must explain to the world why it insists on the privatization of public (state) assets while it at the same time insists on making private debt owed to foreign banks public. It is this aspect of IMF policy that creates crises like that of Argentina.      Yes, the IMF should give the assets promised. I think that such a thing could be of great help to the present situation.      Ultra-capitalism corrupts.      With whom does the blame rest for Argentina's dire economic situation? With everyone. There is definitely something to be said about not lending to fiscally irresponsible countries (IMF). However, you cannot reasonably expect to have solid, sustainable, and sound economic growth when you have to have astronomical rates of inflation, are always borrowing, and have to devalue your currency every few months in order to keep your economy moving (Argentina).      Fault also rests with the United States government. Although our backing of military regimes in Argentina thankfully did prevent the further spread of communism in the western hemisphere, the people of Argentina had to pay a tremendous price for this - mass disappearances, humiliating and unnecessary wars (ie, the Falklands), and haphazard economic planning conducted by said regimes come to mind. There was a huge human cost in achieving our anti-communist objectives, and for that, I feel we (the United States) owes Argentina a bail-out.      Sadly, de la Rua's decision to resign comes too late to help resolve economic as well as social problems. Now we will have to face even more struggles like devaluation and the lack of politicians with enough credibility. I think the IMF should reconsider as they want to drink out of an already empty bottle.      We are concerned about what's happening in our country. We are 17 years old and we've never seen such a horrifying situation. It has really touched our feelings because we love our country and we don't want to see Argentineans suffering as they are now.     The IMF's structural adjustment programmes have a history of exacerbating economic difficulties by forcing open domestic markets to more competition while exports are priced out of the big markets of Europe and US in part by tariff barriers, in part by the burden of debt repayments. The IMF and the government will come up with a plan and the working people of Argentina will be asked to pay a heavy price. The question has to be, will the riots proved to be an isolated protest or the opening shots in a prolonged period of unrest?      This was the last straw and people from all social classes, the rich, the middle class, and the poor defied the state of siege by going out peacefully with pans in their hands, making themselves heard. Fed up, at last, my people reacted and I swear I was up all night, proud to be Argentine, with a pan in my hand making myself heard.      If the IMF does help Argentina it will only buy some more time before the inevitable collapse, and that will be even worse. Can't the Argentine government see that the main problem is with the forced dollar parity? Why is Argentina keeping parity if it's not sure whether the economy is strong enough to sustain or even reach such conversion? If the dollar is left just floating, it will reach its natural level by itself, and will prevent recessions like this one. Devaluation is necessary to achieve competitiveness again.      I think that this is the moment to stop and think what will come next. The future of our nation is in a terminal crisis. It is not the hour to look for the guilty but to end the violence that is tearing our country apart. It is now the hour for Argentina to face its history and look to the future.      It's true that the whole situation in Argentina is the result of both corruption and the government's incapacity to rule. But let's bear in mind that if we go down the entire region goes with us!      Dirty governance is indeed the very reason for all of this chaos, and not just in Argentina. But indeed, while we westerners seem to often look at the national government's inability to tackle corruption or worse, to entertain it, we forget to look at who has corrupted them initially and keeps doing so in the name of the new world order. The poor will remain poor as long as the international financial institutions don't clean their own dirty laundry.      Our main trouble is the corrupted politicians that we have suffered with during our whole democratic history. We had one of the most beautiful and richest countries in the world but our political mafia is deeply oppressing our people. We need a completely new political structure that respects our country.      I think we have reached the bottom. But this should be the end of almost 50 years of corruption and injustice. This situation is out of the government's hands. Maybe it thought it could control everything but this kind of thing happens to the ones that aren't looking forward to future and the dig their own holes in the process. There was a change coming for a long time. Now it's time.      Globalisation and capitalism are to blame. The banks of the west take money from the poor. The privatisation of public assets is clearly disastrous and governments around the world should take heed, or their countries will end up being the next Argentina. How would American workers like to take a 13 percent pay cut?      Argentina is in a big mess. It is a country rich in resources and has an educated workforce. Ex-pats around the world excel in many fields. Their women are beautiful and their football playing style is admired by all. Whatever the blame is for this situation it has to pull out of it, pronto. It now needs a hand from the rest of the world. It will deeply sadden me if the international community does nothing about it and allows yet another nation to collapse.      This is a consequence of capitalism. Many countries throughout the world will suffer like this in coming years.      I understand that for the last several years Argentina has been running its internal finances according to models approved by the IMF and international financial community in general. For the IMF to wash their hands of this now - especially when the current government is sacrificing so much to try to rectify past errors - would seem unjust.      I agree with Joel UK. Here in Paraguay we have exactly the same situation waiting to happen. The government is rife with corruption and the social difference between the haves and have-nots is growing exponentially. Sooner or later we'll have exactly the same problem as Argentina, and probably sooner if the Argentines continue down this road to social meltdown.      Yes, Argentina should be helped. Not perhaps because it deserves it after so much mismanagement, but because the consequences of social chaos are the breeding ground for anti-US feelings and ultimately more chaos.      The real ran sackers here are not the starving people who are raiding the supermarkets, but Cavallo and his horde of bankers who follow orders from the IMF. It is about time the IMF made a ""mea culpa"" because everybody knows they have a huge responsibility for the present situation. There is no easy way out now, we will have to pay the consequences of this through long years of suffering.      The real problem in our country is the sense of stupidity that the educational system instilled in our people. No moral ground was ever taught. Our political class is corrupt. We embrace the economic model of a plutocratic world and we can't afford such a model based upon the suffering of the workers. We need a real and deep solution, based upon education, anti-corruption laws and IMF support to solve such a crisis. We are a good country but we need to build a solid social culture based on proper leadership.      This is a time of transition for all. We need to think the unthinkable to change our perspective in order to tackle our local/global problems. Cooperation is the answer. Argentina needs help. All rich and poor countries should lend material and aid. Let's start sharing all the world's resources with the underprivileged nations like Argentina.      When we Argentineans blame our politicians of mismanagement or corruption or whatever, what we're really doing is avoiding facing the fact that we are the only responsible for this situation ourselves. We the people are the ones who have the power to vote and to put in government the people that we really want to lead us. But we are not using that power wisely. We continue to vote for the same people and the same parties that have brought us to this situation. Argentina is an extremely rich country for its natural resources but is also an extremely poor country for the lack of wisdom that we Argentineans have when we have to decide who will represent us.      Just as in this country Argentina is managed by elite incompetents. For the UK, see: The Dome, Railways, Wembley. For Argentina, see economic mismanagement. All the people want is a bit of common sense and common justice. If they have to suffer, let the rich suffer with the poor.      Most of the preceding opinions sustain that Argentina has been a naughty boy and should be punished accordingly. The real culprit is the devaluation of commodities - the source of the country's income. The only real solution is the devaluation of the US dollar.      The combination of deregulation, privatisation and political corruption have all led to this situation. Getting rid of all public services and leaving the public unprotected results in this. Just look at Sabena.      I would just like the whole world know that the IMF loaned the money to a junta. It has been documented well by various judges that the debt is unlawful and was obtained through criminal means. We the people are effectively being held at ransom. It is not our debt. We live in a nation that has yet to come to terms with itself but this is primarily due to our diabolical treatment at the hands of most foreign companies and our own foul politicians.      I cannot believe that in the 21st century people are still rioting in the streets. Surely someone outside of Argentina saw this coming.      The IMF should bail out Argentina. #130bn is not really very much in global terms so what's wrong with missing a payment on this debt? Lots of people can't live up to their financial commitments at some time or another and usually receive some leniency from somewhere. What should be different in this case? It's Christmas, for God's sake. Steal from the rich and give to the poor!      Most Argentines believe that the IMF, as well as the local politicians, are responsible for the current situation. It is proven that IMF recipes do not turn people's sufferings into a better life.      Only Argentines know that this vicious circle started with corruption. They know there is no bailout that can help. The only solution is to drop trade barriers and deregulate the labour market. No IMF loan can help. Argentina could never pay it back it is unable to service the $132 billion debt it already carries. Argentina's reforms are crises- driven and her problems can only be solved at home.    Argentina's problem is corruption. My wife is Argentinean and I have visited Buenos Aires many times. I see now that everything is corrupt there. Many people work for cash-in-hand, so not many people pay taxes. The politicians arrange contracts for backhanders. I think, then, that we shouldn't help them as the country needs to learn that it cannot work in this way.      Argentina has played the wise guy for far too long, with its leaders paying lip service to IMF or World Bank demands but then carrying on regardless. The country's problems are a consequence of the incompetence and corruption of its past and present leaders (Menem and De La Rua) and of international bankers who knew perfectly well that they were helping drive another nail into the coffin of this once great country. They have all adopted a Marie Antoinette attitude, which is particularly shameful on the part of this corrupt, immoral, inefficient, dawdling government, which seems to see no need to reduce legislators and ministers exorbitant salaries while virtually condemning pensioners to death as their health service collapses. And to add insult to injury they are now asking Menem, of all people, for advice. Disgusting.      No more free lunch. Help shall come in another way. I am Argentinian, and I definitely know we deserve this situation. We have the worst and most corrupted politicians on earth. We choose them and let them rule! But the tragedy is that not them but the much larger and decent population is the one that pays. IMF help so far has only delayed the inevitable. The country is bankrupt, but there is no international process or mechanism for this situation, which will make everything much longer and complex to solve. The country is currently unable to pay its sovereign debt. We Argentinians have been paying and will pay for a long time. All debt holders must realise the only way forward is to renegotiate terms, accepting cuts of principal and interests to reduce debt burden, and eventually collect something in the future if we return to growth. Otherwise no one will benefit.      Permitting Argentina to fail will most likely cause a domino effect throughout the globe. It is up to the rich countries to render assistance to countries in difficulty.      The Argentines are learning the hard way the old proverb, you can't have your cake and eat it. The IMF need to withdraw all assistance until the Argentine government reflect this lesson in their policies.      Keep in mind that the IMF is controlled by wealthy, western nations. The failure of the IMF to act has been very politically destabilising. This brings into question the motivation of the IMF, as the crisis will undoubtedly benefit the conservative Peronistas over the ruling Socialists. Perhaps, a judgment has been made to forgo what would be a costly IMF bailout in lieu of short-term political instability that could yield a more business friendly political climate.      Supposedly, Argentina's troubles are microcosmic of the effects of a global economic collapse. With this in mind, but more so out of human decency, it's probably the moral thing to bail them out. It's inhuman to hold an entire nation to ransom because its leaders failed to budget properly. I can imagine a few too many international bankers will have adopted a Marie Antoinette attitude, however, preferring to eat cake whilst a nation is on the brink. Remember some day, heaven forbid, we could find ourselves in a similar situation and we would want help - would we not?      NO!!! or they will never put their house in order. The corruption that led, in part, to this crisis dates back to Menem. Every asset that could be sold was liquidated but the money evaporated. This must finish now or the whole region runs the risk of going under.      It hurts to see my country of birth in such disarray. I am deathly afraid that if this continues we could see a return of the military dictatorships. It is unbelievable that a country with such natural wealth can be brought to its knees by a bunch of corrupt politicians. We must be aware that it is these types of situations that spawn dictatorships. All it takes is one general to make his case to the people and he WILL have their support to throw out this present government. Remember what happened to Germany after World War One. I do not know what is the solution to Argentina's problems, but these problems will become much more serious if we do nothing and let Argentina fall by the wayside.      It is clear that the governments in Latin America are unable to efficiently run their countries. Every ten to twenty years another Latin American country defaults on debt or runs into severe economic problems. The IMF must not bail out Argentina. Latin America suffers from corruption and structural problems. These are things that only the people in Latin America can fix themselves. Let the ""invisible hand"" work.      The IMF could bail Argentina out only if this goes together with a sensible plan to re-structure the foreign and domestic debt, reactivate the economy, fight rampant government corruption and cut deficit spending in the provinces.      Economic and humanitarian assistance, yes; bail out, no. Argentina has too much debt. It will default. One more bailout will only delay the inevitable, do nothing to help the neediest Argentines, and add to the mountain of unrepayable debt. Sympathetic governments, above all the US, ought to be doing more to facilitate a negotiated default and program of debt reduction.      How could we tell from the information provided whether to bail Argentina out or not? What I mean is that people tend to make these decisions emotionally, e.g. rich should help the poor, not strictly on whether such a bail out would reasonably be calculated to make financial sense. If we could reasonably foresee a bail out benefiting Argentina and others then such a course of action makes sense, if not, it is time to cut the losses already incurred.      Three years ago my country went through the same-a financial melt down. The government collapsed and we were on the brink of a new military dictatorship. We got lucky...oil prices increased (40 per cent of the governments budget), a new government led by an efficient vice-president has led to a semi-rapid turn around. No one bailed Ecuador out, it was too irrelevant to the world community. Ecuador had to do it on its own, it taught us a good lesson (hopefully?). Now we have the fastest growing economy in Latin America at 5.2 per cent, partly due to a higher oil income, something Argentina doesn't have. I see their situation as more difficult- over four years of recession, 20 per cent unemployment rate, bank accounts semi-frozen, a major slowdown on industrial production and a lack of investment on agricultural production (their major source of foreign revenue.) For Ecuador it is the opposite, starting next year we will double our oil exports due to the construction of a new pipeline across the Andes. Argentina needs to put its house in order, as a nation five times the size of France, with only 38 million educated people and abundant resources for agriculture, mining, tourism, etc.....it reminds me of a beggar sitting on a chair of gold!      Globalisation should be played with a football, not a rugby ball. The rugby ball bounces as it fancies. The football one bounces equally 360 degrees around. Argentina is corrupt, inefficient and many other things. But you can't exclusively blame us for our debt nightmare when European, American, Japanese and agricultural policies prevent Argentina from acquiring legitimate resources in order to service our legal obligations.      I agree with Joel, UK, that the IMF and other international banks or agencies monitored the economy of Argentina and turned a blind eye to the corruption and now they are in a quandary as to bail out or bankrupt the country, more so the people who are the real sufferers. But who cares as long as you loan and want to have the interest paid back with the policies to be adopted according to you, but IMF has always been doing to many countries. That is the reason we see many projects have failed and common man suffers. As we have bankruptcy laws, it should be prevailed and make it easier to Argentina to reorganise their economy with tight control over corruption. We cannot overlook the fact that high inflation and a high rate of unemployment causes the dispute between the haves and have-nots and we see what we are seeing now.    "
HOC HOC-AK -0.0700000000000001 " The answer is, ""I don't know"" and if a referendum were to be held tomorrow I believe that 95% of the population would have to make the same reply if they are honest. We simply have not been given sufficient information on which to make an evaluation. In some ways I am in favour but in others (which have nothing to do with xenophobia) I have great misgivings. We need facts, not spin from both sides of the argument.      The common currency is just one part of economic union; the whole is a common economic policy for the entire EU. It'll mean the same interest rates, cuts in public spending, pooling of national gold and currency reserves and eventually a common policy on taxation. All this imposed upon us not by our elected representatives but by a body that is undemocratic, secretive and unaccountable. This is not my personal opinion but the findings of an independent report carried out at the request of the EU Commission in 1999.      The euro is a great idea - so long as we are not in it! The UK is better off BECAUSE we have maintained our economic sovereignty and can therefore make our own decisions as well as apply corrections and reforms when we need to. If we join the euro that simply will not be possible. The idea that 'pooling sovereignty' will lead to higher prosperity is the great lie at the heart of the euro debate and it is up to us all to expose that myth as well as our responsibility as good citizens to oppose the euro tooth and nail.      Europe is taking a big gamble and I am not sure she's up to the challenge. What makes the US a world power is its utter ruthlessness whereas Europe is more concerned with issues like the environment and world peace. Admirable and very brave this may be but it's not what is required in today's cynical times.     As a frequent traveller to the UK and many other European countries, I have been ready for the euro for years. It just makes plain economic sense to have one common currency. There's nothing I would like better but for our English friends to join the rest of Europe in this, it might help them to see what an incredibly expensive country the UK has become compared to the rest of the EU. Unfortunately, so far English politicians have left the debate to the tabloids. Most of the arguments they use to frighten people off are absolutely ridiculous.      I find it difficult to understand the attitude that the euro, in some way, makes us ""less British"". The Irish have accepted the euro as their currency but does it make them less Irish? I don't think so. In Wales, the strength of the pound against the euro has caused massive unemployment in various industries. We need to embrace the euro, for it may bring good news to areas like South Wales that are so desperately in need of it.      The euro as a common currency would be fine except for the political implications behind it. It is not just about having the same coins as everyone else - it is about handing over political control and our 'gold reserves'. Argentina has just seized private pension funds - when will the EU follow suit?      I'm ready for the euro as soon as the UK government sees fit to bring it in! I don't care what the currency's called as long as I have enough of it for my needs. In any case, I'm forced to use foreign currency every day of my life. The ten pound note in my pocket says ""Bank of England"" on it yet I live in Wales ... The euro - bring it on!      The euro is an irrelevance, what counts is that our country maintains its own destiny. The people of the UK do not want the euro so why does the debate continue?      I've had to change from Dutch guilders to pounds, back to guilders and now to dollars. In my experience, it is very easy to get used to a new currency. The biggest problem is figuring out which coin is worth how much automatically. I think the euro is a great development. I'm not an economist, but I think over 300 million people using a currency in their daily lives should give some measure of stability. I also hope the remaining EU countries will join in soon, not in the least because I speak English much better than French or German.      It's quite funny that they're doing the changeover on New Years day. Imagine waking up with a stinking hangover and going to the pub or shops with all this strange money in your pockets. Also as one euro is worth a lot more than one Franc, Guilder, Drachma or Mark then our European friends are probably going to all accidentally overspend in their hung over state. This newly found consumer confidence will be a good boost for the European economy.      You've hit the nail on the head, David from Ireland. There has been no proper intelligent debate in England. Our current sorry crop of so-called politicians do not have the ability to open this subject up to proper debate. All we get is a series of scare stories from various vested interests.      Well it won't matter too much as I won't have much money after Christmas anyway and it will be all over in a month or less. As for national identity, well we get to keep our harp on the back of the coins, the Dutch keep their queen's head, the Germans their menacing looking eagle and so on. In a couple of months it will all be forgotten, the hype won't matter and we will be better for it.      I see the euro as a currency of the future. I am just preparing myself for the euro, but it seems that I'm learning fast. No need to rebel against it when the decision has already been made in my country.      The euro will make life a lot easier - and probably cheaper. I went on a motoring holiday last year and needed French francs, German marks, Dutch guilders and Belgian francs - with all the commission and other charges, I spent a not inconsiderable sum in currency transfers. Also - how much does it matter what the currency is these days? Most of my spending is done using either plastic or direct debits/standing orders - I rarely need to carry money these days, so I really think that a unified currency is a good idea.      I'm visiting my friend in Berlin for New Year's Eve so I'll witness the changeover. I imagine it will be a little confusing at first receiving change in a different currency but I'm sure legendary German efficiency will save the day.      I am looking forward to the introduction of the euro as a tangible currency. I also look forward to spending my euro in Britain in the many shops and tourist attractions who have indicated that they will take it regardless of the ""debate"" (If that's what you call it) currently taking place in the UK!      I'm proudly English, but my national identity is based on more than the currency we use. My company, which trades extensively in Europe, will be disadvantaged by not being in the Euro Zone. The sooner we can get our currency weakened by around 15%, so that we can join at the right rate, the better!      The euro is going to affect us in a huge way anyway but whilst small countries like Austria and Luxembourg have seats on the European Central Bank, we won't. The euro is already a major currency along with the US dollar and the Japanese yen. What will happen if the G7 group of which we're proud to be a member of is replaced with a G3 group comprising these three monetary groupings? Where will our influence be then? Sooner or later we'll join up, so why not make a commitment to do so now?      I hope that the euro is a further step towards a United States of Europe!!! We need the UK on board as well.      The government will delay any referendum until the next general election where a vote for Labour will be a vote for the euro. With no credible opposition party at Westminster, I fear we may be dragged into the euro. The majority of UK citizens don't know enough about what the pros and cons of a single currency are because there hasn't been any debate. At present our economy is good as the Bank of England controls our interest rates. At what price the euro?      I think the euro is a good idea. It will make it even easier for people to see just how much the British Government is ripping them off with high fuel duty and taxes on cigarettes and alcohol      The pro-euro people seem to have no idea of the consequences of dumping the pound. Economically there would not be much in it, after we had forked out #30+ billion for the changeover. The real problem comes after that, loss of self-determination and taxation imposed by distant faceless politicians who would not have the UK as their main interest. Joining the euro could be the stupidest thing we ever do. So let's not do it.      Although it is 'nice' to have our own currency, pride in it can go too far. And pride comes before a fall. I am undecided about UK entry but the reality is that that the UK does share a land border with a Eurozone country - and here in Ireland we're adapting to it whether we like it or not.      As a retired European civil servant of 20 years service, by practical experience I know that if a nation gives up its freedom for commercial gain, it will lose both!      This euro can't be such a bad thing; they've just given us all complimentary starter packs in work! I don't care what Britain does, but the sooner the north of Ireland joins the better!      Surely the best policy for the UK is to sit back and watch what happens in the rest of Europe. A couple of years down the line, if it's working we join in, if not we can stay out.     I live in the North West and, frankly, I have had enough of local manufacturing being hammered every time things are going well in London. According to the governor of the BoE so succinctly put it ""unemployment in the North is the price we pay to keep inflation under control in the South"" A common currency with Europe, Hah! We would be better off with a different currency for each region of the UK.      The Euro will probably reach Britain anyway. Most cross-channel ferries will be using them, Irish ferries as well, shopkeepers in tourist areas will probably accept them also. Perhaps the Euro will creep in through the backdoor and surprise everybody!      Any decision on the Euro should be based only on economic studies and not anything as sentimental or foolish as ""national identity"". I am not little pieces of paper or little gold coins, I am not less British because I favour the metric system over old imperial weights and measures, or because I prefer the simple concept of pounds and pence as opposed to shillings, guineas, farthings and God knows what else. I am no less British because I happen to love curries, Chinese, Thai, Italian, Korean or Japanese food, or indeed because I have friends from many and varied ethnic backgrounds (who consider themselves no less British than I).      I would rather be known as a countryman of a nation that shows respect and tolerance for all it's citizens beliefs and cultures, than as someone who stubbornly clings to outdated ill-conceived ideas simply because they were British. I want to know what's best for our country's future, rather than reminiscing about it's past. We need informed rational debate about the issues at hand, not clouded emotional ranting brought on by jingoism and xenophobia in the media and elsewhere. The only real issue I have with the Euro presently is its incredibly naff name, as for its economic sense, we shall see.      I don't think there will be too many complaints from international travellers when they find out that they don't have to relearn the exchange rates as they travel between Eurozone countries. And the euro's current rate is similar enough to the US dollar, that it will make spending money even more inviting for American tourists. And yes, despite the recent doom and gloom, we still have money to spend. I can't wait for my next trip to Europe.      I bought my first euro starter kit last Friday and I was very excited! With the Euro, Europe will be a very powerful economy in the world and that counts! Before, using the same currency across Europe was just a dream; in 15 days time, it will be the reality! I am proud to live this event! Changing currency does not mean losing our identity: on the French coins of the Euro, we will keep the 'Marianne'! So, come on the UK! Join the adventure and you will not regret it! At the end, it is just money!      Personally I can't wait for the Euro to land on the British shores. I am tired of the old spiteful arrogance that dominates the relations with our European brethren. A new pan-European currency is another welcomed chapter in building a peaceful, prosperous and secure continent.      I cannot understand people who see joining the eurozone as giving up their national identity. I have never considered that it is a pound note or coin makes me British. We are just so stubborn in Britain when it comes to change, especially anything related to EU membership. We cannot even get metrication over and done with. I prophesy that if we do ever decide to accept the euro, there will be news reports of greengrocers in the north-east of England refusing to accept the euro, arguing it is an Englishman's right to trade in whatever currency he likes. Just mark my words!      For tourists and other travellers there seems a point to a common currency, and no doubt those involved in handling currency conversion will soon find alternative employment. As to prices I doubt it will make much difference even here in the UK as the price of almost everything changes from region to region.      The adoption of a common currency would affect much more than the notes and coins used. Our adventure into Europe started with too little information being provided by Ted Heath and other politicians in the 1970s and what we need is a full and honest provision of facts - especially on taxation and other financial issues. In particular I would like to know if and how the UK will be expected to contribute to the rising costs of social security costs in parts of Europe where it is expected that social security cost will soon swallow an unsustainable proportion of the GDP of some countries.      The sooner we have one global currency the better. Money in all its forms is a matter of trust and pretence. You don?t actually have 10 pounds sterling, you have an IOU from the bank. What form our currency actually takes makes no difference. What does matter is that we stop the currency speculators from operating? The fact that a handful of people have the ability to bet against a country's currency and ruin it has to be stopped. Also, a global currency would be the first step in highlighting and perhaps resolving the lack of financial parity in the marketplace around the world. A day's work is a day's work wherever you are in the world, so why should there be such a big difference between payments? A global currency would highlight this shameful act, and create a small first step towards resolution.      As a city trader you can be sure the financial markets are also preparing for the Euro and as we speak will be busy buying US Dollars, Swiss Francs and Sterling, whilst ""shorting"" the Euro to make great profits out of this ill conceived, incompetently run currency. Lets ignore the fact that political elites have inflicted this social experiment on their nations without the slightest degree of democratic accountability.      Mark USA, what you do not understand is that the beauty of Europe stands in her multi-language, multi-cultural and multi-ethnical combination. The Greeks will never give up their language as it is part of their heritage, the Germans as well, the Italians as well, as will the other countries. A common language is already unofficially English. The actual mixture and sometimes creative conflict of the cultures is actually an asset. Now the common currency, coins and banknotes, do not really affect the essence of different national identities, or way of lives. But it rather links them. Besides although I'm no economist, the positive impact on the European market and the citizens sounds solid enough to me.      The Euro makes good economic sense for mainland Europe, but given the different business cycles of the UK vs. the Continent, the UK is wise to stay out for now. It's funny to see that Europe, in its push for unity and peace is using a single currency as the first step towards a Republic of Europe. I wonder if the people and governments of participating nations would have been so accepting if the proposal had been for a single language instead of a single currency?      Everyone having the same money will not solve the problems that the EU was created to rectify. Only a common culture can create that kind of unity..      I do not want the Euro. The English pound is a strong currency, what is the Euro worth on the world market? Let Europe do what is wants to do and let England continue to enjoy good exchange rates when holidaying overseas.       What is needed now is a European cheque clearing system. As I understand it, if one writes a euro cheque in Spain drawing on a French bank account, you will incur bank charges above that usual in France. Also if you want a euro account, open one in the euro zone. Its a lot cheaper than the Brit banks offerings. "
HOC HOC-AO -0.02 " What I find most disappointing about the comments here is that the majority of negative response comes from people in the UK. I find it sad that as a nation we have not moved beyond the debate about art being an oil painting or a marble sculpture. This country is too overly concerned about the effort of the hands rather than the effort of the mind. Which is probably why Mr Creed doesn't live here.      If there is a power cut, does it cease being art?      Art is essentially a subjective matter. It's amazing how many people equate their opinion with fact. I happen to think that the works of Turner, Constable and their ilk are not ""good art"" but I cannot claim that view to be fact! I also happen to think that the winner of this year's prize is not ""good art"" though I have enjoyed the work of other recent winners. Whatever we think, the Turner Prize has once again achieved its aim, which is to encourage debate and raise the profile of modern art.      Next year I shall be putting forward my entry entitled - 'Extracting the Urine'.      I wasn't going to bother venturing an opinion on this until I saw a suggestion that we should take this ""art"" seriously. The Turner Prize has as much relevance to art as the contents of my dustbin. It is simply a device for selling the artefacts of the untalented poor to the gullible rich. Nobody with the slightest taste would touch this junk with a bargepole.      We have had a small spider living in our bathroom for the past month, ""weaving"" his way around the ceiling. Perhaps I should submit an exhibit for next year's Turner Prize entitled ""Spider Living in Bathroom""?      The Turner prize isn't intended to appeal to the mass population. We are not the target audience. People always ridicule what they don't understand. By laughing at it you're attempting to diminish its merit, therefore making you think that understanding it isn't necessary. It seems to me that the Turner Prize is very successful. It always gets people thinking about the subjects.      I can understand the modern art idea that art is defined by intention rather than skill. However Creed has gone further with his statement that he has no idea what his work means. So now the viewing public must also project what meaning they can think of onto the object. Art without skill is one thing, but art without ideas is pushing it.      I don't think it's fair to have a go at Martin Creed for trying it on. Instead, we should all enter a piece of art next time, and see what happens.      This can be summed up in just five words: What a load of rubbish!      While I like Creed's dodgy wiring, I get a sense of what it must be like to be in the room when the motion sensors in my office incorrectly decide I have gone out and switch off the lights to save energy. The Turner prize continues to ignore the winning speech given a couple of years ago by Brian Eno in which he attacked the art establishment for its inability to rival the explanatory power and teaching ability of so much contemporary science writing. Much of the science which is written about cannot be understood except by experts. Scientists, unlike artists it seems, are the only ones who bother to explain why they do what they do.      Throwing good money after awful art!!      Why assume that an artwork has to be a carefully hand-crafted object or painting? Art moved beyond that tired old notion over a hundred years ago. Neither is art necessarily the product of unique genius. Art is what happens when you, the spectator, perceive the work. Your reactions here are the art.      To Mark, UK. Why don't we get the prize money then?      I think this has become a total joke and I can't believe it commands respect from anybody. Instead of this annual farce, surely it would be better to donate #20k to an Arts College, thus investing in people who have artistic talent.      Bit difficult to hang an empty room with lights going on and off, above the mantle piece.      I wish I had known about the Turner prize during my student days. My university bedroom must have been worth a small fortune! When the national average salary is about #20k, and the Turner prize awards this sum for something that takes a few minutes to ""install"" (or less, if you've got some dodgy wiring), it certainly beats working for a living.      If an installation that turns a light on and off causes us to reflect - even for a few moments - upon the technology behind it, and the vast social achievements that electric light has enabled, then it would seem to have served its purpose. And if a Van Gogh is worth $84 million, then Mr Creed's piece is probably worth #20,000 on the same scale.      Reminds me of a fable I once heard as a kid: ""The Emperor's New Clothes"". To recap: he wasn't wearing anything, but his subjects and the emperor himself were too afraid to say this for fear of being branded stupid, so they kept on saying how beautiful the clothes were. Modern 'Artists' use the same methods. If we don't understand their 'art', we must be stupid. The tailors in the fable did this for money, hence the similarity.      As Edison invented the light-bulb and was therefore the first to switch it on and off - does this make him the first artist of this genre?      Why are so many people so upset about who the Turner prize goes to, when most of them probably don't even go to art galleries?      Perhaps we could submit this web page next year and split the #20k between all of us.     Martin Creed is an oversensationalist artist. His works do not move the viewer emotionally nor contribute anything to the art word. I feel Richard Billingham or Isaac Julian should have won due to their stylisation of society through film or photography. I particularly liked Julian's experimentation with the working of film through camera angles, colour and overall mood and atmosphere.     It could be titled: ""Expressing An Opinion"" and we could describe it thus: A marvellous work of art, reflective of today's modern internet world, where people of all races, creeds and colour come together to share opinions and ideas.      From what I picked up in passing he didn't even wire the lights up himself - surely if that's true he shouldn't even be allowed to enter. Maybe I could put some sunflowers on a chair and ask someone else to paint them for me. Who would take the glory for that?      A light flashing on and off? Half a dead sheep? An unmade bed covered in rubbish? I should have won at least 3 turner prizes last year alone. My bacon sandwich was truly an inspiring sight this morning, please send the prize money to...      Even I, as a former art student, was sceptical about Martin Creed's installation, but the Times art critic explained it in a way that must, I feel, be considered. He said you really have to be there and experience it to appreciate it and that the experience was oddly disquieting. For any installation to have an effect on someone like that totally legitimises it in my eyes and I won't pass personal judgement until I'm able to experience it for myself.      The Turner prize just shows that we can still laugh at ourselves and we are quite happy to continue throwing good money after bad. Good luck to the bloke, I wish I could get #20K for being rubbish at something! I hope he gives the money to charity (I bet he won't).      Creed is not representative of modern art, and not all modern art is brutal, ironic nihilism. The problem is that the general public sees it through the Turner Prize prism. This time they even hauled in Madonna so that more people would be taken in. If you don't understand modern art, then use the following rule of thumb: if it's endorsed by the likes of Madonna, it ain't art.      Flashing lights in an empty gallery? A gallery devoid of art... maybe that's what he was getting at.      Let's face it, it's a big joke right? It's rubbish like this that gives art a bad name. Why don't we celebrate real artists with real talent? The Turner Prize is the home of the talentless. It's nothing more than a cheap publicity stunt.      Congratulations to Mr. Creed for getting away with doing nothing and cashing in on it.      The trouble is, by even responding on this subject I feel that I'm contributing to a debate on art...which a light bulb going on and off clearly isn't!      I like it. You can stand under it and see the light bulb appear above your head when you finally realise what it's all about.      I am amused by the way we fall for the same old trick year after year! The Turner prize is nothing but an exercise in generating publicity through stirring up 'controversy'. The formula is painfully obvious - select the silliest work, get some glamorously vacuous celebrity to hand over the money ('spontaneous' swearing predictably adds to the 'controversy') and wait for tomorrow's tabloid rants against modern art. As for the short-listed works - it has all been seen and done so many times before that it isn't even refreshing, let alone controversial or challenging.      Perhaps for the philistines like me, who consider this to be absolutely ridiculous, the adjudicating committee could explain what precisely makes this absurdity art, let alone prize-winning art?      I've got an idea for a submission to next year's competition. It's called 'Void', the subtext of which is 'Empty space for empty heads'. If you haven't guessed by now the nature of this stupendous piece of artwork, just imagine a completely empty room with nothing in it at all. The space becomes the exhibit itself. Obviously. However, unlike the Emperor's New Clothes, this concept really does have a deep meaning. No, really it does. Why, don't you believe me? I suppose seeing is believing, then.      It is hilarious how people still take the Turner Prize seriously. The joke is painfully obvious and stale. So stale, that they had to get Madonna to swear to liven it up a bit. Why, even Collings' expression was a dead giveaway - half the time he looked as if he was going to burst out laughing any minute.      I'm inspired - next year I'm going to enter 'Garage Door', 'Broken Biro' and 'Who's Just Broken Wind?' Then I'll use the #20,000 to buy some proper art.      Art will eat itself.      Turner would turn in his grave if he saw his name being attached to what is now perceived as art.      By people talking about this they actually give it credence. The shock value and the amount of debate it generates is what fuels contemporary art of questionable merit. If we all shut up about it the contemporary arts scene would hopefully go away and produce something of merit. Though in a media-ruled society, where over-reaction is now the norm, I hardly think it likely that people will stop stoking the fires of publicity.      With apologies to the memory of Kipling if this is not verbatim but it comes from memory and was written by him about 100 years ago:      When the flush of the newborn sun fell first on Eden's green and gold, our father Adam sat under a tree and scratched with a stick in the mould. And the first rude sketch that the world had seen was joy to his mighty heart. Until the devil whispered behind the leaves 'It's pretty, but is it art?'      I stopped purchasing art ages ago but not because my walls and empty spaces are now all covered. Once, artists died and their work became priceless. Now, art is dead and artists are pointless.      Next year I am going to submit an entry for the Turner. It will consist of nothing and be entirely intangible but titled 'The Nation Striking a Pose Depicting the Attitude of Indifference'.      It may be art to some people but to me it's definitely rubbish! I just hope there's a sea-change in art school fashion sooner rather than later, with a return to more traditional media, and that this sort of 'installation' stuff gets consigned to the rubbish bin of history where it belongs.      If you reach the stage where anything can be art what has art become? If the exhibit had a title which provoked some deeper thought it would not be so bad. It really is the case of the emperors new clothes.      The Empty Room is a great metaphor for a post -Christian age culture and art - totally vacuous, devoid of meaning, hope and understanding.      I studied at Art College during the mid eighties, an experience which left me completely disillusioned with the art establishment. The tutors weren't interested in talent but in the personalities of their students. Those who were pushed forward and encouraged were those who had the loudest and most extrovert personalities, those who were the more confident self-publicists in other words. It didn't matter how amateurish and childish their painting and drawing techniques were; that, after all, wasn't considered to be the point of art. These days I find art galleries depressing places. The Art establishment is completely caught up in its own elitist and misguided sense of superiority over the general public. The best artists practising today are probably the technicians who create the spectacular effects on computer games and the animators of Manga films.      One would think that the term 'art' implied some form of craft, skill or expertise in the chosen form? Personally, I intend to take this morning's rubbish, put it in a box, label it 'Urban Detrius' and send it to the Tate. Who knows? I might be #20,000 richer by this time next year!      Call it stupid, call it pointless, or even call it clever. But just please don't call it art. We do not need to change the definition of art, it's served perfectly well for thousands of years. But we do need to think of a new name for this sort of nonsense, so that a new generation of people isn't put off real art forever.      Every time some Gallery pays good money for such tosh as piles of bricks, pickled dead sheep, unmade beds, empty rooms etc they should have the amount paid deducted from their next year's funding - or they should have no funding except entrance fees - then see how long they would keep these buying these exhibits if they had to attract real paying customers !      It's nice to know that in these troubled times, there are still those with a sense of humour! I take it that none of this is serious, is it?      Flashing lights: Fantastic! And in an empty gallery: Oh joy! Minimalist Martin doesn't need to explain the sense of his astonishing work to me! The great thing is that modern art has apparently advanced so far that anyone can be an artist! Even better, the Government can now cut all subsidies to artists and hand out discount vouchers for DIY stores. The money saved could be invested in the NHS, or the transport system, or foreign aid or....      I am pushed to think that ANY of the Turner prize winners are worth the cash! I'm all for contemporary art but I think all of these winners are really taking the biscuit! And don't give me any of that hogwash about self-expression and art for art's sake.      Everyone is missing the point. It's an excellent move on the gallery's part - now they have a large, nicely decorated, clean, well lit (some of the time) room that they will be able to put some nice pictures in when all the fuss dies down. And for just #20,000. A bargain I reckon...      Absolute utter rubbish, how can this be art? I am disgusted. There are people with no homes starving, who have done more to deserve #20,000.      I suppose I must be very old-fashioned, boring and conventional to think that a work of art should be something the artist has created, like a painting, sculpture or photographic work. The likes of Renoir, Monet, Van Gogh, Rodin etc will be remembered for many years to come. Can the same be said of works of art which consist of animals in formaldehyde, a rumpled bed, an empty beach hut and an empty room with faulty lighting?      I presume that the Turner Prize's job is to do as much as possible to alienate the general public from art? A job it does exceedingly well.      Art is not just painting, sculpting etc but also ideas.      A ridiculous empty space, what a farce. I work hard throughout the work day, and these 'artists' (?) with Willow the Wisp minds can't even describe what they've 'created'! No talent at all, apart from deception in trying, very badly, to impersonate an artist! Nearly all of the population will think of this 'art' as insulting!!      You get the same 'art' at any NCP car park.      I know that art depends much on individual taste etc. But I have to say I'm worried that there are people out there who consider a faulty bit of wiring to be anything other than a problem which requires fixing. When Martin Creed says that it is not up to him to explain what it means, it is because he doesn't have a clue himself. He's just laughing at the con trick he's just pulled.      The Turner Prize organisers have said it is not designed to show the best artists, but art that is most interesting at the time. I am therefore tempted to assume that the other exhibits were in total darkness.      Surely the whole point of great art is that it can only be created by people who possess a rare and unique talent. I could spend 10 years trying to paint a replica of the Last Supper and not achieve it, just as I will never be able to play football like David Beckham or play guitar like Hendrix. However, I have a whole load of things on my bedroom floor which could probably win a Turner prize. Someone receiving #20,000 for a lightbulb going on and off is a payout so obscene it makes the most unfair excesses of footballers and actors pay look reasonable. Have these people not got anything better to do?      If you don't like a piece of work, don't buy it! Simple. If you haven't got anything nice to say, then don't say it. Not everybody shares the same thoughts and opinions.      Is it art ? Of course it is. Is it good art ? No, it certainly is not. In modern art the statement is considered to be everything and skill is no longer part of the equation. Good modern art has a balance of both, yet we rarely see this when it's time for the prizes to be given out. Is this because there's no such thing as bad publicity? Blu-tac and unmade beds might not be good art but year after year they makes good headlines.      Art is anything that someone says is art. It doesn't matter that so few people see the value in some art but at the same time, why is the prize not going to a piece of art which communicates the most to the most people? Real genius is a communicative entity - if people don't get it - what's the point?      Sorry but this kind of thing just makes art into a joke. I remember the time when some esteemed critics were falling over themselves reading meaning and wonder from a mess of paint on a sheet of paper. You should have seen the looks on their faces when they were told it was painted by an elephant, completely at random. Sorry, but there is no skill or talent involved in this kind of modern art, and for people to be awarded amounts which are more than most people's yearly salary for what is essentially just a joke. The classic arts are true masterpieces, involving plenty of vision, skill and talent. A can of baked beans, or a light switch going on/off; any child can come up with.      At least with Damien Hirst's animals in formaldehyde you could appreciate the effort that went into it, even if you didn't appreciate the result. But, to win twenty grand because your wiring's dodgy and then not even bother to make up an explanation! I always thought with a lot of contemporary art the real genius was making up the spiel to explain your ""piece"", now it seems you don't even need to do that, I'm clearly in the wrong job!!      When is someone going to fix that light? After all, they could win next year's prize!      I went to the Tate Modern last year and had to laugh at all the pretentious people taking it seriously. How can this bit of garbage be worth #20,000? I have some lights in my garage that I could do the same with. And my version would be cheaper. Any offers?      As always people have misunderstood the purpose of the Turner Prize circus. The Prize isn't supposed to be about art - it exists for the sole purpose of generating a huge amount of cheap publicity for the Tate, and for its commercial sponsors - and to give the media a chance to fill space by reprinting the same tired clich?s that they used last year. The fact that this year's award was dished out by a pop star should have been enough to set the alarm bells ringing for most people. It's a gimmick - but then again so is most of what passes for British culture these days.      I installed a new three-way spotlight in my kitchen yesterday. Does that make me an artist? I could argue that as an installation it illustrates the futility of man's struggle against the consumerist society (I was replacing another light which fell apart) and on another level illustrating the success of technology over our primeval fear of the dark. On TV last night, I note that Mr Creed couldn't actually explain what his work was about. That's because it isn't about anything. It's a light. It comes on. It goes off.      Please don't forget that these 'installation' artists don't actually create the objects they call art. Specialists create them on request. All the artists do is come up with the idea. Obviously Martin Creed thought long and hard before coming up with lights turning off and on.      I wish I could do that. Now that's what you should say if you look at art. Not, ""I could do that"". The Turner Prize has become a type of weird side show where so called artists try to think of the most mundane thing and call it art. Empty rooms, unmade beds. I don't think it will be to long before somebody submits nothing as their art.      How do I enter for the Turner Prize? It sounds like money for old rope. Now, there's an idea for my entry - a pile of old rope!       My entry for next year will be ""The light's on but nobody's home"". Maybe I should be one of the judges instead. "
HOC HOC-BJ -0.00999999999999995 " I would suggest that those people chosen as MPs should be first and foremost able to manage their time. The number of hours spent on a given job, does not determine the results. In most team sports, there is a set time given to score the needed points to win. A golfer does not reduce his or her score by increasing the time spent waggling the driver before hitting the ball. Cut out the ""grandstanding"" in the House, set a time limit on debates and get results.      If my work was reduced to a 4-day week then I would get paid less. Will the Mps get paid less? No didn't think so. Typical.      Parliament says it cannot get through its agenda as it is, I can hardly see reducing the hours worked would help this. MP's already have perks way beyond the average tax payer, who incidentally is paying for their over indulgent life styles. I suggest they get back into the real world and do the job they are paid for. What will the next step be, a large cash sum, a house on a paradise island and a harem of mistresses for the duration of their term of office      I think it is a great idea. Certainly there are some members of the cabinet who I would like to see working a zero-hour week. At least that way they can't do any more damage. As for the rest of them, presumably they will forego a proportion of their salaries. I wish I could just decide to cut my own hours by 20%.      Are they taking a massive pay cut as well? Who wouldn't want a 4-day working week and a 7 hour day? They are supposedly running our country - late night debates are part of it, and they all new that when they decided to become MP's. Ask the police or doctors/nurses what they think about this.      Great, can I now ask that the MPs vote for the same hours for us ordinary workers (or will that be considered unproductive?)      What a surprise! Does this mean that the MPs are going to fund the rest of business so that everyone can work only 4 days a week? I doubt it. The rest of us have to work antisocial hours so why should they get out of it!      If it ain't broke, don't fix it!      An MP actually being in the House of Commons chamber is only a small part of the job. Unfortunately, most of the public think this is all they do. They also have committee work, true and shadow ministerial work, and of course their constituency work. Together, this makes it a seven-day a-week job. MPs have to put their constituency and constituents first, their country second and their family last. If a prospective MP doesn't like the idea of not seeing his or her family, or not having the family life they desire, then they have no place in becoming or being an MP.      No. They get paid enough (55k or so, plus perks and expenses) to do a full week's work. Everyone knows that MPs have to work late sometimes in debates and votes. They went for the job in spite of it. Let them take the rough with the smooth like the rest of us do.      I'm not impressed by these proposals at all. Running the country is a very serious business and office hours don't apply. I work in IT and I'm frequently expected to work late when projects need to be delivered or changes need to be made that can only be done outside of normal working hours. I'd like to think the job of running Great Britain was more important than anything I'm required to do.      Surely, the whole point about MPs' hours is that they should be scrutiny friendly rather than family friendly.      If MP's spent less time trying to score points over each other & more time concentrating on the business in hand then there would be no need for late night debates. It's high time they all stopped acting like juveniles & realised that the public, who are their bosses, expect them to do a real job, put the hours in and produce beneficial results for the country. That is what they are there for & their lack of perception in understanding that is why half the population cannot be bothered to vote anymore, because they don't take MP's seriously.      Working 4 days a week 10 till 5 is a great idea. Why don't we all do it?      MPs are paid a not unreasonable salary and allowances to both serve and help run this country. It has long been considered a calling, not a just a job. A change in hours should also entail a change in salary. I don't find it acceptable. The country must come first.      There is a lot more to being an MP than sitting in the House of Commons. If a more sensible regime in the House leaves MPs with more time to work for their constituents then that is a good thing. I have never thought it sensible that our laws are made at two o'clock in the morning!      My husband works for an American company, he often starts work before 8am and holds telephone meetings with America well into the evening. These are part of his job description. He knew this when he accepted the job, hence if he wanted to reduce his hours his pay would also be reduced.      A 28 hour week, long summer holidays, a job for life (in safe seats) and set your own rate of pay - with all these perks and privileges you'd think that we could attract some decent and capable people into politics rather than the bunch of baying layabouts we have now.      I don't think so, if everyone else works five days(and even longer hours in some cases) a week why not MPs? I think on the contrary their working days should be increased, so that they have more time debating things which effect the country(not their working days)      Doctors already work extended hours under a lot of stress, and we get told to see more patients every day by the government. I wish we could turn around and demand normal nine to five hours like everybody else.      If the hours are so bad how is it that a number of members have the time to be MPs, members of a regional assembly, and an MEP all at the same time. I don't believe a word of the government's argument.      Absolutely! Reduce MPs' working hours as much as possible. The fewer hours they work the less time they'll have available to do further damage to this country. It's a sad fact that the people who have the intelligence to run a country responsibly generally have better things to do than get involved in politics.      Do you mean to tell me they actually work a five day week now? I think not. Their working hours should be in line with everyone else's.      Well, if they need to shorten their hours, then presumably they will also be cutting pay in line with this? Where in any other line of work can you imagine people who are responsible for making tough choices that will impact millions of people saying ""okay it's five o'clock, lets all go home and not worry any longer about this"". If you want to be an MP, accept the life that goes with it. We need to get the best people in - those willing to work the long hours. If you don't want that life, don't stand for election!      Of course a shorter working week will allow our MPs to spend more time at their other jobs, William Hague being a prime example. Mind you, with their ever-diminishing powers with respect to the EU's increasing occupation of our law, they will not have so much to do anyway.       A 28 Hour week for MP's is all right if they only require that other public sector workers work the same hours. If not then they have no right to reduce their own workload. "
HOC HOC-CF -0.0100000000000001 " He has been a good king. People always loved to see the King and Queen together in every function for the past 3 years as if there is a magical attraction in their appearances. I will truly miss the King, and the best thing we can do now is to recite Al-fatihah for him. May Allah bless his soul in hereafter.      In this age of cruel and power- crazy individuals bent on unleashing mayhem and destruction it is indeed a great blessing for Malaysians to have been touched by a monarch who was kind, jovial and constantly beaming with uncommon sincerity in the midst of common people. May God Bless the King.      For as long as I could remember, Sultan Salahuddin had always been my 'king'. Growing up in the royal town of Klang, his presence was always felt whenever his birthday celebrations were held at the Istana Alam Shah, Klang. He gifted my late grandma with the Royal Selangor Crescent 'kerongsang' or brooch which she wore at every Raya/Eid celebration till the day she died. I shed some tears over his death; what with being so far away from home. His 'rakyat' shall miss him deeply.      The late Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Syah was a great and popular leader among the Malaysian nation. His spontaneous, caring and down-to-earth personality will be deeply missed by all of us.      I was really sad when I heard the news. He was such a caring king and I can see him visiting people and places all the time. May he rest in peace.      I could see that the people of Malaysia loved the king very much, especially when a large crowd of people came and gave their last respects to the king although it was during the Ramadhan month and the blistering heat.      The King Sultan Salahuddin Abdul Aziz Shah was such a People Hearted person with a very down to earth characteristic that made him a very respected King.      Farewell, our beloved Agong. May Allah bless His Majesty's soul. We will miss you.      Not until he was dead have I felt so attached to his late Majesty. He has indeed upheld the sanctity of the Malaysian monarchy system so that at times of political uncertainty we know who we can turn to. May God shower his late Majesty with his grace and mercy. The King is dead, long live the King.      A straightforward monarch blessed with the common touch, the Sultan of Selangor was one of the few who stood up to the dictatorial whims of Dr Mahathir, back in 1993 when the PM ultimately succeeded in limiting even more the powers of the king. A pity that he's gone, like his father in the middle of his 5-year reign.      The rapid development of Selangor into one of Malaysia's most modern states owes a lot to the Sultan's dedication. He was a firm believer in Dr Mahathir's capabilities, but at the same time provided critical feedback. He will be sorely missed.      The first and the only time I met the King was at a celebration in London held at the Malaysian High Commissioner's Residence. He came up to me and asked where I am from and what was I studying in Britain. That kind of warmth and laid-back charm you can rarely find in a royalty. He was talking to me as a person and not as his subject. He was the people's King.      The late King has been a very caring, helpful and friendly monarch. His death was a very great loss to Malaysia. We will miss him...      I've never been privileged to meet the King but I've heard many good things about him from those who've met him, including his not hesitating to skip over protocol to meet his subjects. That, I think, is one of the coolest aspects of our loving King. He will be sorely missed.      He was a very caring King who was also close to his subjects. He will be missed and remembered for a very long time. May Allah bless his soul.      The King's death is a great loss to all Malaysians. The people still longed for his attention on issues concerning social, religion, unity and poverty. From my point of view, he was a very sociable King. That's why it is so sad, and still quite a shock that he has passed away.      It is just a fitting tribute to bid farewell to the King on ThanksGiving Day. We thank God for his life. As an expatriate in this country for 6 years, I have observed on many occasions the Late King visiting even remote places to meet common folks. At the same time, he would take time to visit ""shrines of the modern world"" - like universities, world class factories, research and development institutions etc.      God Bless Malaysia. We will always carry fond memories of this country and the Benevolent King.      I would like to express our grief at the loss of a great king who was close to his people. May God bless His Majesty's Soul.      I met the late king only once but it was enough for an everlasting memory of the humble and loving king. The school choir performed at the Istana Alam Shah in Klang in 1997. When the king came to shake our hands, a brave soul asked for the honour to take photographs with him and the friendly king was more than happy to oblige. At that time, Queen Siti Aishah had not yet been formally accepted by the 'rakyat'.       Together with the feeling of excitement that overtook us, nobody remembered the courtesy to ask the queen to grace the photos with her presence and she was thus left standing aside. Almost instinctively, the king turned around and very politely asked our permission if the queen could join in the photos, ?Cik Puan boleh ambil bersama?? And I thought that was the most romantic and gallant thing to do. It showed how much the humble king feels he?s the same as everyone else having to say ?May I?? and ?Please?? and how much he loved and valued his queen and family. He was certainly the king with people?s heart and will continue to be in our memories.  May God Bless His Majesty's Soul.    "
HOC HOC-DV -0.02 " Attacking seems like a solution to terrorism, but it isn't. The world should try to work on the cause not the symptoms.     This war will only destroy people, it will not solve any of the existing problems. Terrorism should be uprooted, and its roots stem from Western attitudes towards Islam and Muslims. England created the problems around the world, in Kashmir, and Palestine. Did the Western allies consider using the billions they are going to spend on war to reverse terrorism and spend the same money on poor nations, to bring education and justice?  My word to the terrorists is simple, if you want to give, then you have to take, But remember this, You were prepared and ready for this, America was not. Therefore the USA and UK are not as cowardly as you are.  I want to thank the British people for their support. Now that Osama Bin Laden has admitted to the bombings and other atrocities in the US and abroad, I believe the time has come to bring this man to trial. I appreciate the UK's involvement and support and appreciate the friendship these two peaceful nations have.  This is not 1939. Covert commando operations would have been much wiser. An open attack will only mobilise Bin Laden's fellow halfwits and provoke them to act. Which certainly is not what I like to see.  I fully support the beginning of the military action. Moreover I like the fact that our country gave serious support to the NATO in war against terrorism. The only thing, that I wish for the coalition is to get support of the peaceful population of Afghanistan in case of amilitary operation on land.  The Western world and in particular the USA and Britain have no choice but to act. Continuing to allow terrorists and dictators to escape without justice merely serves to strengthen the resolve of others with similar extreme views to follow in their footsteps. By stopping the likes of Milosovich (admittedly belatedly) and now hopefully Bin Laden it may make other fanatics think twice.  I would just like to give an alternate view to this military stupidity. Notice that the only countries which the USA attack are the ones which are poor and have little resources. I mean, 89% of people in Afghanistan don't even know who Osama bin laden is.. let alone what he has done. Yet, these are the people who are going to die.  It was inevitable but necessary. All the Taleban has given since September 12 is double-talk. The success of the coalition depends on whether the basic aims of taking down the Taleban are achieved, since every ally of the US will be a target for al-Qaeda if not Bin Laden himself. Oh and wanting the American government to outlaw US funding for Northern Irish terrorism doesn't mean the people posting those views had no stomach for military action after the WTC attack. We're just waiting to see what we get in return for making ourselves target number two. A President willing to risk the Irish-American vote in this way would be historic, and certainly end my doubts about the war that's just been started.  Yet again the US proves that in international affairs, there is no right or wrong, there is only power. How many more innocent people will be killed in this unjustified war? Operation ""mindless revenge"" has surely begun.  We had to bomb them to show we mean it. I'd like to know if the Taleban is in contact with Bin Laden? Will Bin Laden strike again?  It's about time. I'm a democrat and a pacifist at heart, but when someone attacks my home, retaliation is the only option. I grew up in New York and the twin towers were a landmark to me. More than that my uncle, a New York police officer, died trying to rescue people from the crumbling building. I don't expect the rest of the world to understand. You can't possibly understand unless you were in the US when the attack happened. But regardless, this is what has to be done. I also think Osama Bin Laden saying this is all a result of the US backing of Israel is despicable, and his referral to this as a ""holy war"" makes me sick to my stomach. This is no holy war, the US has said that. For Osama Bin Laden to say otherwise is a cheap attempt to create warfare in an attempt to save his own skin. He is disgraceful.      The US, UK and all other supportive governments are holding their bloody hands together killing more innocent people before our eyes, and we see nothing, we hear nothing, we say nothing and we do nothing. We are all less than human. I hate myself for this and will never forgive myself or mankind.  I think that there is no need for the US or UK to take military action. By acting against the al-Qaeda network we can now anticipate retaliatory attacks. The government in Pakistan is likely to be overthrown. I don't think the coalition will stay together.  What concerns me most is that there is no set date for the recall of parliament. Without that, Tony Blair can continue to use British armed forces as he sees fit, which is apparently doing whatever Bush demands. As Marvin Gaye sang: ""War is not the answer."" Blair using this crisis to play world leader and to distract from the abysmal failure of policy at home, is disgraceful. Thatcher is no doubt very proud of him.  Like in 1939 we have right on our side. To defeat terror and inhumanity you have to resort to force because that is the only language they understand. My thoughts go out to allied servicemen and innocent civilians alike in these troubled times. There were setbacks in 1939 but we prevailed.  I have just read the posting by 'RL' in which he requests to see all documentation implicating Bin Laden and his network with the terrorist atrocities in New York. I hearby call on the US and UK governments to halt all military action until this person calling himself 'RL' has been fully briefed. 'RL', you are a clown.  While I can understand the US wanting revenge over the atrocious attacks last month I feel that they may have been over zealous in their pursuit of Bin Laden. I would have much rather seen all the documentation which leads to he and his group. History has taught us that politicians are not always trustworthy. I would be disappointed to find out months or years down the line that other groups could have been responsible for the attack. I also reject the notion that this is a ""war against terrorism"". If that's the case can the world assume that after the Taleban is destroyed, the coalition will go after the IRA, FARC and Basque movements? I thought not. I just hope that civilian casualties are kept to a minimum.  I think what we're seeing was well considered and planned. Some people have expressed fears about the US and its allies ""levelling"" Afghanistan out of a desire for vengeance. That's clearly not what has been planned, and that's not what's happening. I personally doubt that these strikes will rid the world of Bin Laden, but they are a start. For those who have complained and said the US should pursue diplomacy and try Bin Laden in a court of law, where have you been? The US has been trying that for years, based on concrete evidence of his involvement in previous terrorist attacks on American targets. For the US to stand around and continue to follow the same approach would be insanity. While the US has patiently waited for diplomacy to work, these people have had time to gather resources, plan, and execute more attacks. Bin Laden and his allies are a cancer, and it's time to remove the disease.  I wasn't initially sure where I could express my appreciation so I'll do it here. I am an American citizen who travels all over the world. I wanted the people of England to know how much I, as well as many others from the US, greatly appreciate your standing with us during this time. Thank You and may God bless you!  Let's hope the true Muslims of the world can see the attacks on Afghanistan for what they are - not an assault on Islam, but on a minority of barbaric despots who bring the name of Islam into disrepute.      Sad, stupid, senseless. This will create horrible problems for children, women and old people in Afghanistan.      The attack on Afghanistan is indefensible on any level. The alternative is very obviously to deal with the starving and displaced refugees, whilst continuing covert inquiries to locate Bin Laden. America and UK were, it seems, obliged to strike, because to have delayed would have given the anti-war lobbyists a chance to break the fragile coalition down. The British media has been censored in criticising the military action. ""Any Questions"" on Friday did not have a single question on the war or its consequences.      Blood is the same, as is pain, regardless of whether it is shed in Iraq, New York or in Afghanistan. We must learn lessons from history. Neither terrorism nor war is a solution to any problem.      If there is anyone in the world who thinks the USA wants to be involved in a conflict, you are greatly mistaken. It is because of the worlds in ability to bring swift justice to remote areas of the world that we are there in the first place. Those complaining about war hurting innocent people should have spoken up for the many Afghan woman executed unjustly...but where were you then? With or without the UK's or the worlds support we were going to do this.      Two wrongs don't make a right. I can understand the desire for revenge in the US, I have family in Manhattan. But why can't the perpetrators be sought out and tried in a court of law? I am sure that the US has other reasons to want to attack Afghanistan, after all, their political support and funding for various regimes is clearly entirely uncorrelated with those regimes' human rights record, and the same goes for US military interventions - for examples remember Nicaragua, Grenada, and blind support for Israel, blind eye turned to Rwanda and human rights abuses by 'friends' such as Turkey, Saudi Arabia? Even though the Taleban regime are appalling, it is a lie that they are being attacked in the interests of freedom, and ordinary Afghans and many other people are likely to suffer for this.      All this talk of striking terrorists in Afghanistan is nothing more than a decoy, the real intentions being to control Central Asia. Just as Iraq was targeted to get hold on Persian Gulf, the same drama is being staged by the same players.      Some of the people responding are, quite simply put, idiots. The U.S. should do this. The U.S. shouldn't do that. Ad nauseum. We are damned if we do. We are damned if we don't. Too bad we can't just sit around on our bums moaning about other countries failures like a lot of the respondents are.      War never was the solution and will never be and those who think it could be should always remember Germany in Second World War - what they thought of their power and what they had.      One had hoped that this war would not be a bloody one, but one of intelligence, stealth and compassion for human life already lost. Should any innocent people be killed, then we are no better than the terrorists. Justice is desired, not revenge.      Its about time. Those who have no respect for human values have no right to seek shelter under those values. The forces of good must use all the power at its disposal to decimate the curse of terrorism for all times.      I think everyone knows that the attacks will achieve nothing. The Taleban are well entrenched, and the women and children are out in the open. The only reason why the US moved ahead with the attacks is that it has nothing else to satisfy it's public with - they want blood, and Osama happens to be a convenient name. Bush badly needed a target, and the Taleban badly need an issue around which they can boost their position.      The Taleban regime was one of the most oppressive and destructive ones on the planet, and its ideology was openly hostile to almost everything. That there should be a new war in the region was inevitable. The events of 11 September are to this conflict what the death of the Austrian crown prince was to WWI. The important question is now what the purpose of this operation is. If it is merely to bring the Northern Alliance to power in Afghanistan, then we can only conclude that Western leaders have learnt nothing from history.      The US has demonstrated far more restraint that anyone could have reasonably expected or predicted, both in the planning and conduct of this operation. To those who still condemn it, at least be honest - if the US flew a cargo plane over Kabul and dropped 200 leaflets saying ""Please stop supporting international terrorism - if that's ok with you"", you'd still call it an act of blatant imperialist anti-Muslim aggression.      This is a very good move to control the terrorism. Unpredicted events can caused havoc to civilians. In the civilised world, every human should live comfortable life financially and other aspect without any threat in mind. Terrorism always keeps everybody in hanging situation. This is not a war against any religion. This is the war on terrorism irrespective of religion. In my opinion, people working with the terrorist groups are conveniently using or misinterpreting the religion theory. At some point of time we have to correct them. This is the right time.      I think that the Military Strikes may produce results in the short term. By Killing Osama and removing Taleban out from power. But in long term its objectives are not going to be that fruitful as the US and its best buddy the UK thinks. By killing Osama, he is destined to become a hero in view of many Muslims. I hope that sanity prevails and the US use other means to solve this problem. We must look at the root causes of all this terrorism.      I would simply like to say that the Americans have not put up a good show of there so called democracy because they should had provided the proof of the involvement of Bin Laden and avoided war. War has never brought peace in the history of any nation.      Terrorism must be defeated. The Taleban have had ample time to comply. They did not. This is not about revenge, it never was, this is about learning from history and not appeasing evil again. With precision, we shall remove this tumour of evil.      There should have been negotiations to get Bin Laden and his men on trial. No efforts were made to do this. The Taleban clearly wanted to avoid attacks. Now I fear that the whole region will become very unstable. The US unfortunately did not prove to the world that it was mature enough to avoid the obvious response to the Sept 11 attacks, which is retaliation.      It is proven that the west has become shameless. They know very well that they need to change their policies, but due to ego, and pressure from the Jewish community - the are not changing their policy.      Peace cannot be achieved by force it can only be achieved by understanding. (Einstein) No human being can understand terrorism. No human being can understand the attack on WTC. No human being can understand the reaction of the US.      History tells that suppress by whatever means, one will never be able to gain control/win.      I am sick and tired of hearing those who oppose military action. It is quite clear that we have tried to talk to the Taleban but it doesn't seem to process, thus military action is the only method left. Are we just to roll with the punches and receive blow after blow? I think not, you can continue to hide behind your little peace candles while the rest of us living in the real world will back our countries and allies fighting to eliminate terrorism. No one wants war, but sometimes there is no other option.      All of those with doubts about the validity of any and all measures taken to destroy the terrorists should come to New York to see what they did. TV pictures don't do it any justice. Then you should explain to all of us why they did it. It's fine that they are resentful, but what does that have to do with people working in downtown Manhattan. Remember that the terrorists sold their stock short the Friday before Sept 11. The real idea here is that terror is their business. The more people killed the better their financial support. It's too bad the Palestinians have these ghouls for spokesmen.      I feel obliged to include my point of view having read the negative attitude of many comments. The Taleban and the Afghan people were warned that this attack would take place if Bin Laden was not handed over. Bin Laden's attitude and comments towards the US have just affirmed why Afghanistan should have handed him over. Although undesirable, action is unfortunately necessary and precision strikes against Bin Laden himself seem at this stage impossible. Good luck to us all.      Pushing more people into danger is not a wise move. War is not a solution for terrorism. I strongly feel that the USA should have waited for some more time and let its intelligence networks do the groundwork. Moreover, Americans should have tried to improve the living conditions of Afghans after their war against the USSR, instead of supporting them with arms. If they had done that, the Taleban would not have supported Bin Laden and stood against USA.      This war will kill mostly innocent civilians. It seems to me that the lives of innocent Muslims are very cheep and can be very easily sacrificed for no clear reason. It has been happening everywhere. This is clearly what a new world order means.      This military intervention is wrong. What purpose will it serve? We want justice not revenge. How many innocent people will be killed or maimed tonight?      Let's just make one thing very clear. This is not an attack on Muslims. Whether you believe in military action or not this is in no way an attack on Muslim peoples of the world. Muslims play a large and growing importance as part of our society and the vast majority recognise very clearly who this attack is aimed at. How can it be? Islam certainly does not teach of terrorist attacks. We cannot let these people who have hijacked an honourable faith that so many respect and practice hide behind it and abuse it.      This war will not solve the problem of terrorism. It will merely cause more terrorist attacks. Civilians will die in Afghanistan and probably in other countries as well as a result of surgical bombing. The only solution lies in putting an end to the world supremacy of a handful of rich countries, the chaos created by the invisible hand of the market that has proved itself unable to provide a decent life for over two thirds of the planet's population. Terrorist acts are an expression of desperation, the result of worldwide inequality, and destroying part of the symptoms (terrorist training camps, for instance) does not constitute a cure. The US has, unfortunately, taken the side of ugly regimes too often.      Innocent people being killed by terrorism or by air strikes is totally wrong. I condemn both of these actions. I want to ask the people supporting military action against Afghanistan if it is guaranteed that these missile will not kill innocent people.      The US should extend it's attack until the end of the Taleban. And it should implement democracy in Afghanistan so that no new terrorist group will rule the country.      My jaw drops in amazement at some of the statements here - those who complain that these attacks have made themselves a target don't seem to have realised they are already a target. Airliners may not have been crashed into their backyard on September 11 but there for the grace of whatever god we worship go all of us. No rational government partakes in this sort of action without good reason and a great deal of thought - we should support our government, that of the USA and those of all the allied nations. At the same time we should hope the strikes will be short and effective and spare a thought for those who are attempting to ensure the future peace of the world as we sit pontificating via the internet from the relative safety of our own homes.      Military action has never been a welcomed objective of the US government. All I can hope is that this action severely weakens the Taleban positions and begins the most necessary downfall of this evil and dastardly regime. As for Bin Laden, he reeks of hypocrisy. His goal is to rid Muhammed's land of the ""infidels"" while he is supported by Islam's greatest enemy, the Taleban.      I think that the base for Afghan people to overthrow the ruling regime is already formed. If the US keeps on isolating the Taleban, then it will achieve what it wants. Now, once the US goes inside the country, they can never have any more peace talks and the result will be loss of many innocent Afghan civilians along with the soldiers of the coalition.      I do not understand how this bombing is supposed to stop things like those that happened on September 11 to happen again? Can anyone really believe that by bombing one of the poorest countries of the world, the US is going to be any safer?      Every British citizen should show their support to the troops who are risking their lives to make the world a safer place without terrorism.      Well done USA and UK. It is good to have allies and I am proud that my home nation the UK is behind our true allies. Those who are upset at this situation I say this - if the UK were attacked who do you think would come to your aid? The USA. Long live this alliance.      I hope this achieves world peace and not more violence in the longer term.      I am a Muslim Egyptian. I do not see that killing innocent people in the WTC is right or fair but we have all to remember that politics is a dirty game. USA is closing her eyes and ears on all the terrorist attacks on Palestinians that happen everyday. Terrorism will create more terrorism. Justice will bring peace to all of us, but no justice will bring hate and revenge no doubt. Let us put everything in its right place and everyone will be happy. Why did Europe and the US support terrorists before and now when they attacked them they are against terrorism? For political reasons. When you judge you have to be fair.      It is unfortunate that most in the west is now seeing that the insidious nature of terrorism must be aggressively addressed by means of a sustained and multi-pronged campaign, such as that now being spearheaded by the US, involving law enforcement, intelligence, and military and public vigilance. My support is with the US and its allies in the anti-terror coalition.      Retribution begets retribution. One cannot justify unilateral attacks on another nation just for the sake of revenge. In such attacks it is generally the civilians (in the present case, the impoverished Afghans) who suffer the most. One must not forget that Osama Bin Laden whom the US is so wildly pursuing is its own creation. Also the present military action by the US will not solve anything as the past has shown us. Solving the menace of terrorism requires a lot of far-sighted political will that the US lacks. Also its own double standards in dealing with Israel and the Arabs as well as its nonchalant attitude towards terrorism elsewhere such as in Kashmir have robbed it of a moral high ground. Nations like Pakistan that have sided with the US in the present conflict are going to face increasing domestic criticism and maybe civil war as a possible worst case scenario.      What has provoked the world to put aside morality and perspective to engage on a crusade so far-stretched and so well organised? This must be a question of religion and creed. What business does the US have in the Middle East, who invited them and why will they not leave? After WW2, the US were depleted of funding and the only way they could build their now 'superpower' empire, was by bullying, exploiting, manipulating and forcing their way into Arab state economies. No one condones the genocide that took place in the United States, but what would Ghandi make of us all today?      Although I believe action is necessary, this type of action is ill-judged. If Bin Laden is guilty, then he is guilty of murder, and is an international criminal. The reaction should have been one of a police reaction. This action seems to be more of a retaliatory reaction. Bin Laden should stand trial, is this action bringing him closer to it?      Military action on the terrorists was a completely necessary means of retaliation in the fight against terrorism. The attack by the terrorists was on the World Trade Centre. Hundreds of Britons lost their lives as well as more than a thousand Muslims in these attacks. Tony Blair once again spoke intelligently and coherently further proving himself as an excellent leader. I fully support his decision on behalf of our country.      The bombing that is taking place right now sickens me. How many more innocent people must die at the hands of the US and its puppet the UK. Saying that there will be no civilian casualties is just plain stupid. I have family in Serbia, and I have lost loved ones, but this is seen as ""collateral damage"". We have already seen that bombing doesn't solve problems, dialogue does. The people of the UK should cut the puppet strings and do what's right and just. We have already caused enough heartache to millions of people in Yugoslavia, Iraq, Palestine, and many other countries that we have bombed and exploited. Let's stop this madness.      America has no right to bomb innocent people in the Afghan capital, if they want Bin Laden then go undercover to arrest him, no more innocent people should be made to suffer. I for one am sick and tired of America assuming that they own everything and can control whatever they want. All countries should withdraw their support immediately, this is America's war not anyone else's.      I am horrified that Britain is a part of this mindless militarism. To say that the Taleban are harbouring Bin Laden and attack Afghanistan because they have not handed him over is to ignore the rule of law outside our own country. I can only express my sorrow for the civilians in Afghanistan and for all other civilians who will now be caught in the international crossfire.      As an American I would like to express my gratitude to the citizens and government of UK. The US could not ever have a better friend. As for the military action, the Taleban gave the world no other option!      This military action is wrong. Unless the USA aims to eradicate every fundamentalist Muslim sympathiser from the face of the earth. This war on terrorism is doomed to fail. Even if Bin Laden dies he will become a martyr to millions who resent the hypocrisy of the developed nations. The US, with the support of the pathetic Tony Blair is simply creating a new generation of anti-western fanatics. And what right has Blair to make every British citizen a target?      I am very pleased to hear that finally the US has retaliated against the terrorist network. But as the US government acts as the superpower of world. It has done very little in helping other countries like India and Sri Lanka in their fight against terrorism. But it is wrong to say things like this at a time like this.      The US has started this war and maybe right now it is under their control too, but once it is out of their hands, it could bring destruction to whole world. I think instead of military operations, it would have been lot easier to capture Bin Laden and destroy terrorist networks using intelligence forces and covert operations, if and only if this is the target. It seems like the target for military operation is not just terrorists. The target is far beyond the reach of our thinking.      Will this coalition attack the IRA? They say they will fight against those who train and harbour them. Will they attack American flight schools? Will they attack the UK, since terrorists got some of their training in there? If they can attack the Taleban they should attack these targets as well. I understand that evil can't be erased with evil deeds. They should look into root causes of the problem and try to resolve those. In my opinion this is the only long-term solution to global terrorism.      It was terrible enough to see the WTC falling down. It is just sad that the only way the US thinks of responding is by demolishing other countries and removing some of their precious human rights back home. I wonder if we are not heading towards old fashion witch-hunting? After all who is not with us is against us even if we are not right. Does anybody in US think that bombing Muslims in such way really helps to solve the problem?     I am only 13 years old and I am very scared by all of this. I just want to know, what is it going to achieve, involving the British troops?      Are we to sit back and turn the other cheek? I think not as clearly Bin Laden and the Taleban have no grain of human decency. However, the situation is vastly inflamed by confusing religion with terrorism. The outrage in the US and the constant struggle in Northern Ireland have nothing to do with religion but are simply a way of continuing their oppression, racketeering, and other illegal behaviour.      I think in some ways it had to be showed that the world does not stand for this sort of evil. However to someone saying that this is seen as an attack on Muslims. If so please explain why the USA are putting something like 28billion in aid to Afghanistan. Surely that is not a country that hates Muslims.      I'm scared for Afghanistan. Now the terrorists have even more reason to attack America again      Regrettable but absolutely necessary.      Tony Blair has now put all British citizens lives in jeopardy. Thousands of people have died in the last 11 years in Iraq because of sanctions and the Palestinian community is the oldest refugee community in the world. Look at our history - it is nothing to be proud of. This time we should keep out of it!      US-UK started today an inevitable action. They had their chance. I hope the innocent people won't be hurt.      The US has taken this step to keep its public silent for the moment. It would be more appreciated if they took more keen interest in tackling terrorist organisations in the rest of the world. They should not just rest with this Afghan episode alone. If you have started a crusade, stop only when the roots are uprooted. As for now all the best and good wishes to all those taking part in these operations and their family members. Care should be taken of their human rights record.      Anyone that attacks Afghanistan is a major terrorist.      Does anyone seriously think for an instant that this action will decrease the potential threat of terrorism? We already know that those responsible for the WTC strikes operated from western countries. There is little to bomb in Afghanistan besides people, failed crops and tents. I am all for the removal of the Taleban but much else needs to be done to bring peace to the region, the removal of landmines, for one thing. I fear that this is just a photo opportunity for Bush and Blair.      The Afghan people have suffered under the rule of the Taleban. The country lies in ruins, the people are hungry and oppressed. I respect all religions, but I cannot believe that this is what God wants for his children. The Taleban had its chance to bring about change and improvement for its poverty stricken people but they have failed. This war may be the only way to bring about change and give the Afghan people a second chance. They really don't have much to loose.      I think it's disgusting that Bin Laden plays on the vulnerability of the Afghan people by making them believe that God thinks the killing of innocent people is all right, regardless of any religion, because there is no doubt Muslims were among the 7,000 people killed. This is why religion has a lot to answer for. It divides rather than unites.      This is definitely not a war against religion as G W Bush said in his speech, but a war against those who use it to hide behind. God bless America and look after my brother should he be called by the RAF for service.      Now we have taken the first steps down what is going to be a long and dangerous path to bring the evil people behind the World Trade Centre attacks to justice. I hope that the Muslim people of the world will support the action that is being taken against an extremist minority. Only when people like Bin Laden are brought to justice by whatever means can the world rest and the Muslims of the world rid themselves of this cancer that is growing within their faith.      I wanted you all to know just how much many of us in the US admire and appreciate the actions the UK have taken to stand with us during this horrifying situation. I am also struck by the wisdom and the grace in which Tony Blair is handling this action. He is to be admired. Thank you and may we all find peace.      The Taleban was given nearly one month to comply with the demands of the world. They have manipulated the situation by reporting many conflicting stories as to the whereabouts of Bin Laden, speculation of his guilt, or if they would hand him over. There is no doubt that he is not only guilty but jubilant regarding the death of nearly 7,000 civilians. Having watched his recently taped statement wherein he claims the United States was hit by God and now it knows fear, whereupon he praised God for that, I am convinced that he is guilty. These are not the words of an innocent man. I fully support my nation as it sends megatons of food to the Afghan people and mortar to the Taleban! I thank the UK for its support, as well as Australia, France and my Canadian neighbors just 25 miles from me. All of the world has the right to safety, whether they be Christian, Jews, Muslim, Buddhist or atheist. I am in full support of our soldiers. Tony Blair you have the fierce loyalty and devotion of my fellow Americans! Thank you, UK.      I do not agree with your attack. I know that what happened in America is terrible, but I don't want to be a victim of another terrorist attack.      I wish somebody in Pentagon could understand that Afghans are as human as the American people are and have the same right to live. I was worried about America when WTC was attacked and I am more worried about American when Afghanistan is bombed.      Neither Americans nor the British have any moral right to attack another country, which has not attacked them. First of all, if US wants to be the world's policemen, then it has to treat everyone the same, and not allow one group (Turkish military) to exterminate Kurdish villages just because they are friendly, and bomb Iraq for Saddam doing the same. I say shame on our politicians, and even bigger shame on a very weak UN and Nato for allowing this injustice to proceed.      Albert Einstein wrote ""Peace cannot be achieved by force it can only be achieved by understanding."" I think we need to understand the role and impact of our foreign policy and military action. I am afraid that today's military strikes rather then liberate all of us from the terror of violence merely sows the seeds for future attacks, death and sorrow.      I think the Taleban regime should have handed over Osama Bin Laden if they should have had any chance of non-military retaliation from President Bush of the United States. Furthermore I'd like to bless all the leaders who participate in the attacks against terror.     Tony Blair is just a puppet in this war. He is being used by the Bush administration. I don't support terrorism, but I believe in justice, and justice means without reasonable doubt, and with concrete proof. I believe this is an economic war: the Bush family history in business speaks for itself.      My brother is in the frontline of this war. He didn't ask for it and from tonight he is risking his life. You might not agree with the war or it's aims but he and other like him need and deserve your support. So get behind the guys who are fighting and be glad it's not you!      The US is attacking Afghanistan out of fear and vengeance, in order to keep itself on top of the international food chain. To say that it's protecting the Afghani people against the foreign presence which is Al-Qaeda is to be disturbingly hypocritical. Now the US has sandwiched Pakistan between a rock and hard place.      In response to Mohammed Ansar, UK: If we had the support in the past that we have now, when our embassy was struck, we would not have had the events of Sept 11th occur. Nothing short of destroying the terrorist groups throughout the world will we have the freedom from terrorist fear and attacks. This is just the beginning of that long journey ahead to rid the world of these senseless horrors. What they have done is senseless, what we are doing is necessary. If you are going to criticize America for the actions of today and those to come then you need to criticize your own who joined us in leading this battle for all of us around the world.      Congratulations America you have just given the terrorists a bright future. These attacks will inevitably give new generations of terrorists and their sympathisers an excuse to retaliate in their own fanatical and morbid ways.      This is disastrous. Obviously nothing was learnt from Vietnam. Even if they kill Bin Laden and his men they will be far more dangerous as martyrs than alive. Every innocent civilian killed will just send more young men into the training camps of the extremists.      About time! Whilst military planning and reconnaissance was a necessity, it's good to see that for once our leaders aren't just full of hot air. Let's just hope that our retaliation is as meticulous, deadly and destructive as the cowardly terrorists' assault was.      As Muslims we appreciate that this mission is not an attack on Islam. Muslims like myself stared in horror as the carnage unfolded on September 11 and we immediately condemned these attacks as pure evil. Anyone conducting attacks in the name of Islam immediately loses his status as a Muslim.      This action will prove to all the doubters that the world is, indeed, prepared to strike and render the global threat of terrorism dead in it's tracks. Just remember that the fight against terrorism should also include the terrorist battles in Northern Ireland.      It is acceptable to isolate, surround, and blockade Afghanistan but to go in and interfere with their domestic policy will inflame the situation. This style of foreign policy is one of the reasons America is so disliked in the world.      I commend the patience and stealth of the USA. Winning the battle is in the plan making not the battlefield.      What a shame that the Taleban wouldn't hand over Bin Laden, they could have avoided this. What a shame that some innocent people will be killed. Hopefully most are well out of the way of specified targets. What a shame some people can't seem to grasp that these terrorists are going to continue attacking if we do nothing, they already have the plans and people in place, in cells around the world ready to commit further atrocities. Some people seem to forget that Bin Laden declared war on USA long before these attacks.      The people of Britain are strong in their will to assist our American friends. This is not bullying a nation because we don't understand them, this is much needed justice for the murder of thousands of innocent people. Godspeed to all involved and may only the terrorists be the ones that suffer.      I do not really see how world peace is increased by attacking innocent civilians and adding more suffering and pain.      I bet you that more than 6,000 innocent people will die tonight.      Why not show the world the so-called proof America has gathered. Why not let the world know the connection? Air Strikes will not solve anything. It didn't in the Gulf War and it's not going to now. Western leaders have repeatedly said that these missiles are very accurate. We'll see how accurate they really are.      The attacks on Afghanistan are disgusting. What right have we got to do this, and what benefit will it bring. It will result in the deaths tens or hundreds of thousands of innocent Afghans, largely due to starvation, because aid workers won't be able to get to them.      Bush says that this war will bring peace and freedom. But the actual result will be bomb blasts and more retaliations. If the US has the right to attack Afghan cities then the Taleban and other groups have the right to attack US and UK cities. The US and Israel are the world's most dangerous terrorists. They cannot be bothered respecting the UN. As Bush says God can only save US in the future.      America and Britain are effectively acting against Muslims. This will not be tolerated by Muslims. You will pay the price and you will know what it is. Soon the world will know what the reaction will be. America and Britain cannot defeat Muslims.      I think blowing the terrorists to hell will be vengeance for all British and American dead.      Tough action had to be taken. Let's hope the desired result can be achieved swiftly.       Blair has said everything would be done to avoid civilian casualties. This is the usual lie. He could not avoid killing innocent Afghans. With this barbaric action Britain and the USA have given the green light for retaliatory actions. What goes around comes around. May God have pity on Britain and America. "
HOC HOC-FD -0.12 " I think that Muslims are not responsible for the horrible event because this kind of action is against the sacred rules of Islam. We do not like terrorism. Now the super power will have to think to the sorrow and horror if someone destroys your homes in Kashmir, in Palestine,and in every where when you take action against Islam, the peaceful religion..      The recent terrorist attack on USA is a shock to us as much as anyone else. Anyone who commits such horrendous acts against humanity and innocent civilians does not work for any religion, but only for destruction. No religion in the world, especially Islam allows killing innocent people in the name of holy war.  We need this moment to mourn our dead. My prayers are for those who have lost friends and relatives. Our spirit, however, will never submit to the craven and debased fantasies of those responsible. This was an act of war, and we will respond at the time and place of our choosing. We will never give in to terror.  Although I live 2000 miles from New York City, this is a sad shock. I've spent most of my day staring at the horror on my television. But through all of this it's wonderful how so much of the world has offered aid and condolences to the US and as a citizen of the United States I want to thank the world for all the help that they've been offering. I'm just so excited to see so many countries working together amidst all of the chaos!  The shocks are even felt half way around the world as the busy morning traffic is just a trickle as every TV set has an audience and everyone is asking questions. Our daily lives and the worries we think we have in them pale in comparison today.  I am a 13-year-old boy and when I got home and saw the news I was in shock. How could people be so evil, do some thing that horrible for what? I am asking the people who are doing this to stop you are hurting many lives even people who live miles away. I know how it feels to lose people in your life and I don't like it at all. I want the world to live in peace, but I know that this will never happen. The question that every one asks is Why? There are many reasons but only pure evil people would kill others  I was watching the incidents on the television. The whole sky filled with ashes seemed to me as a miniature version of the atom bomb explosions at Hiroshima and Nagasaki during the Second World War. History repeats itself! But at the cost of innumerable human lives, every time. The group of persons who committed this condemnable act must know that, they are not going to achieve anything great by slamming down the two towers of WTC.  Our office is empty. Everyone has felt the impact of this disgusting act. I'm leaving now to go and hug my nine-year-old daughter and try and explain to her what makes certain people so evil.... but of course I don't have the answer to that question. To the victims... please tell the world what we can do to help you in your time of crisis.  The worst has been seeing pictures of Palestinians and Arabs dancing with joy in the streets. Do they think this is what we do when they are bombed? The problems in these regions existed for centuries before the US was even founded. It's not our fault these countries can't get along, but it is somehow our fault that we don't have the solution to their problems. This is the worst thing, knowing that somewhere out there people are watching the horrible pictures on CNN with glee. If you these acts will get you to heaven, you have another think coming.  I heard the tragedy as it happened over the BBC World Service this morning, then viewed the images on the web site. That this was not done by aliens, a la 'Mars Attacks' but by people you could have next to on a bus; human beings as yourself is the most terrifying part of this event.  It's a sad day for the World. I find it difficult to imagine how people could be so cruel. How does one cause gain from killing innocent people - not just here in the USA but anywhere in the World? It is time for ALL countries to band together to rid the World of dangerous terrorists.  Cowards. Only cowards would target innocent people. I realize that many people and countries have problems with the US and the focus of our government, but to commit such an act is beyond the scope of any civilized country or person. Whoever has masterminded this act of terror will pay, if not in a court of law then by God himself. Thank you to all the people sending their sympathy for those killed or maimed in by these disgusting individuals.      I heard that a man in California, evidently overcome with grief, left his vehicle on the freeway, climbed onto the overpass and displayed an American flag. No signs, no words, just the flag. The terrorists will not win.  I have a friend who lives and works in Long Island. She has family who work in the Trade Center towers (no news yet on them), and her fianc? works in Jersey and had a eye witness view of the second plane attack on the towers. He was shocked. She is shocked. Everyone is shocked over there. They're just to numb to react...  The border has been closed, our downtown has been evacuated as a precaution, all flights have been cancelled. I just pray there are no more attacks to come.  I was watching the coverage of the first plane that crashed into the World Trade Centre this morning on MSNBC Television. Then, I watched with horror, as I'm sure millions of Americans did, as the second plane crashed into the second tower. It appears that the plane was going full throttle. What a horrific event in our world history. The information that I'm hearing on television states that as many as 10,000 people are usually at work in the World Trade Centre during that time of the day. Add to that number, the vast numbers of police and fire rescue personnel who were on the scene when the towers collapsed, I fear the death toll may be in the many 1000's. I am stunned.  I am in the middle of the US. Everyone is watching the television, courts and government buildings have all been closed. All airports have been closed and planes forced to land in the middle of nowhere. I just heard that all major league baseball, America's past-time, have also been cancelled. Everyone is very scared and can hardly believe this has happened.  I see the stock markets around the world are collapsing as well. This is not just a collateral attack but also an economic one. Oil and gold prices are increasing. So well done to Gordon Brown for selling all our gold to buy worthless euro currency... Blair hasn't got a clue what to do, is holding ""meetings"". Meanwhile aircraft are still flying over central London. The pair should resign immediately, due to their useless handling of this outrage.  When I came to work my colleagues told me what happened in the US, I couldn't believe. My first comment was - this must be some kind of hacker's joke playing Orson Welles by the internet... My deep condolences to the American people.  I'd just finished my day at boarding school, came into the house where we sleep, went into the TV room and just burst into tears and went straight back out - those poor people. Again everyone in the board house is generally shocked by this whole episode and as a group we are going to raise some money for the families of the people that have died. I just hope the people that did this get what they deserve and hope this doesn't happen again.  Oh, What a terrible shock. The world should stand together strongly to stop the enemies of peace and love of human nature. Allah bless the people of all times.  I pray for those lost and for their families. The whole thing is so unbelievable.  Our thoughts and prayers are with the people of the US and in particular with those who have lost loved ones in this disaster. I just hope that those in power show the restraint of the wise.      It is absolutly asinine to suggest that ""It is undeniable that terrorist attacks perpetuated against the US are largely the product of the US' own making."". It seems to me that people have been fighting and dying over Israel for thousands of years. It may be ineffective, but US leaders have been trying to mediate in this conflict for many years. I find this callous and ignorant pontification an insult to our innocent dead.  I am deeply shocked to learn that two of the jets held passengers as well. It is awful just thinking of the terror they must have felt as they realised their fate. Deepest condolences to the families of those passengers.  We are shocked and terrified by this event. Those innocent people had died because of some fanatic and crazy individuals. We send our condolences to their families.  Since I fist heard the reports when the first plane crashed into the West Tower, I have been watching/ and listening in shock, horror and incredible sadness and pain for all the millions of people this will affect both directly and indirectly. My heart goes out to all the people and their families injured and lost in the multiple tragedies that have already occurred within a matter of a few short hours. Please know you are not alone in your pain and loss, and fear.  Our heartfelt condolences to the family members of those who have perished in this dastardly inhuman act. Those involved should be severely punished.  I watched the TV coverage and realised this is war. No matter which way it goes we lose. My condolences and sympathy go out to the American people. I will pray for you.  Whoever did this inhuman act should not be allow to go free. America should prove that the lives of her people can be protected. My deepest sympathy.  I feel numb. My best friend lives on Mile Square Rd - I need to know if he's ok.  In every lifetime there are 'where were you when...' moments. Unfortunately this is one of them. After today's horrors take a minute to remember how lucky you are to be here at all.  Words utterly fail me! This is the most horrible, heinous, evil crime! Those poor, poor innocent people who died and who were injured...and their relatives! My heart goes out to them. Shocking news!  Physically shocked. I feel like crying. My heart goes out to the people of America.      I feel that this act was an act of cowardice by those that have done it and also want to pay my condolences to all the Americans that were there. I felt very hurt when I saw the lady on CNN telling about her son who was on the plane. I am very sorry and hope that this doesn't happen again as whoever does these things is a coward.  All of North America is reeling. I am very anxious that we may see more violence. After all nobody has claimed responsibility yet...there may be more to this horrific plan. I truly hope that no ethnic group is demonised because of this.  Obviously, there was no political agenda behind this terror attack. The ""activists"" behind this act have one goal; to kill as many Americans as possible. There is a war going on against the West. I pray that Americans awaken to this fact. May the victims of this attack rest in peace, and may their deaths be avenged before long.  I do feel sorry for the innocent but remember that Nelson Mandela was jailed for terrorism. The only difference between a freedom fighter and a terrorist is whose side you are on. How far would go if your homeland was occupied by force?  I pray for all the families involved. I pray also that people don't do stupid things and we find who is responsible. Now's not the time to panic and shoot willy-nilly. To the countries where this originated (if not in the US) please I beg of you to extricate those that helped.  It is incomprehensible to realise that a relatively small number of terrorists can pose such a threat to a whole nation. This is an event with far-reaching effects on the whole world for who knows how long? I am not being disrespectful but I hope that George Bush does not go mad and seek revenge. Emotions are running high and the time is not right.  My sympathy goes to all those who will have suffered loss as a result of this terrible act of terrorism. With the grace of God those responsible will be brought to account for their actions.  I pray to God for everyone...this is an act of evil which shocked me.  There is NO, repeat NO excuse for these unspeakable events. I don't care from whose perspective. I pray for the helpless victims.  I work at New York University and was in a meeting when the first plane hit. We have watched in horror and disbelief as the buildings have fallen killing our friends and neighbours. Religion has been the cause of more death and destruction than any plague on this planet. When will enough be enough?  I live in Los Angeles. Our entire city is being evacuated. Our freeways are being shut down so the military can land to defend our Federal buildings. Despite the fear, sadness and anger that we're experiencing, most of L.A. is calm. Unfortunately, in my building we have nowhere to go. We have all the Federal buildings surrounding us, but the streets are packed with people trying to get out. So, for now we're stuck.      It has brought fresh tears to my eyes reading everyone's comments. As I stepped out of the office block in the commercial La Defense area of Paris where I work, and I looked up at the other tall buildings, I was scared. There but for the grace of God....We are all so vulnerable. Life is a balance and we are all responsible for maintaining that delicate state. When someone decides to act against that balance it is frightening to see the mayhem caused. My thoughts go to those people who are waiting to hear about a loved one and to those who have endured loss and pain through this senseless act.  I was on a bus heading into the city from New Jersey when I heard the report on the radio. I was actually listening to shock jock Howard Stern and thought it was a joke. But looking out the window of the bus I saw debris falling from the Trade Center and knew the bitter truth. My mother works in World Trade Tower 2 and I spent the next hour and a half thinking she was dead. Thankfully she is okay.  People were jumping out of the windows of the WTC - then the buildings just collapsed into dust  I saw live pictures on BBC TV and it shocked me to think this could happen. It's an attack not just on the USA but all of us in the Free Western World. I hope the Americans get tough with whoever did this. My thoughts are with the USA people.  This is the most unfortunate and unwarranted incident I ever witnessed.  My condolences to the American people over this shocking attack.  One should find out the root cause of what makes mankind so violent to attack others even at the cost of their own life.  I want to express my condolence to all people in US. It's the most terrible thing I have ever heard. God will help us to live through all these stupid acts.  A planned attack of this size has shocked the world not just the USA... countless numbers of innocent lives have been lost... No excuses, freedom, religious, civil rights, NOTHING can justify this.  I am deeply shocked. I hope our government will do everything possible to help the US recover from the tragedy and find the murderers responsible.  Absolutely disgusted, sickened, shocked and frightened. Why people have to harm innocent people for their beliefs I will never understand. I hope the American government can find whoever is responsible for the planning of this attack, although no amount of punishment can ever match the damage they have caused to so many people. We can't even begin to understand what the e people affected by this can be feeling right now. I just hope that we can salvage some good from it and rid our planet of extremist terrorists. No cause is worth the death of innocent people.      Being in New York at this time I was amazed by the strength and resilience of the people who live here. Almost everyone knows someone in the city at the time, but no one broke down, everyone in fact rallied a strength and a feeling of a common bond I have never before seen in my country.  Can we, as humans, not invest our time, money and efforts in building brotherhood all over world rather than the multilateral race to gain supremacy over others purely for selfish motives?  Absolutely unbelievable. While my heart at the moment goes out to those directly affected by the tragedy, I also shudder to think of the long-term repercussions of this disgraceful act.  Physically shocked. I feel like crying, my heart goes out to the people of America.  My condolence for the Americans.  I was watching BBC to see any new news on the situation in Afghanistan, when this news broke. The attack is senseless for all it did was kill innocent people, but I believe we shouldn't rush to conclusions as to who did this attack - we should all pray for the innocents who died in this shameful and cowardly attack.  I was told of this news by my friend when we chatted at 8pm local time - I thought he was joking. It is impossible to think the USA could be attacked in this manner.  Many of the buildings here in Los Angeles have been evacuated. America is shocked and in lock-down at the moment. This is the Pearl Harbor of our generation.  I just heard the news and I'm shocked. This is no military attack against a nation, this is an attack against people. Innocent people. I feel very sad for all families involved. Heads up, everyone...  What possesses somebody to carry out this sort of devastation. It can never be justified!  Shocked... what's wrong with mankind!      I would just like to pass on my deepest sympathy to America and hope that through all this death and destruction, America will find the strength and courage to bring the sick people responsible for this terrible tragedy to justice. My thoughts are with the families who have lost their loved ones.  I've seen the pictures on BBC site and I say that it's a devil action, people who lives with the devil on mind, cause a normal person don't do things like this... my God, how things like this can happen... My condolences to the American people.  I was shocked when I heard this. Why they do this. My condolences for the American people.      I want to thank those from abroad that share their deepest sympathies of the tragedies that have happened in New York City. Your kindness is well exhibited as I read the letters you have written. As citizens, we will overcome. As friends and allies, we will prevail. Thank you again for your warm letters of comfort in our country's time of need.      This is the day after and I feel numb. I fear that yesterday was the end of American innocence. It will be remembered as a pivotal day in the history of democracy.      As each day will pass, the individual stories of those who died and the families and friends who survive them will be told. It will be painful and emotionally draining to hear. But certainly, those who are directly affected by this trajedy are suffering more than I am. How they will live with this memory is beyond comprehension. My heart aches for them.      I watched in horror as the events unfolded this morning. It is almost beyond belief that anyone could have carried out such an act of unparallel terrorism. The world needs to hunt these people down and bring them to justice. Those who carried out such attacks must be made to feel the pain of what they have wrought on so many innocent people, and they must know that no civilized people will ever stand for such an act of barbarism.I don't think anyone can ever feel completely safe again until these people are caught and brought to justice.      I sat at my desk and heard a fighter jet zoom past the high rise I work in and my entire being shook.      My colleagues, friends, and family have all been touched by this tragedy throughout our entire country. The comfort that I find is in the outpour of love and support from neighbors on US soil and from around the world, reaching out with kindness and kinship.      The aftermath of this tragedy is likely to change the world as we have known it, both in the United States and elsewhere. There is no untouchable place on this planet for evil. Yesterday helped remind us all of that.      I have spent the past days in horror at the events that occured on Tuesday morning. The sense that America was no longer ""isolated"" from the dangers of the world became all to real. However that thought made me feel very much alone. When I read the sentiments of our good friends the British people I was reminded of the common bonds we share, love of freedom and love of country. It's good to know we are not alone.      Many people have rightly condemned those who participate in, and sponsor terrorism. Let us not forget that in the past, the USA has sponsored terrorism in countries such as Cuba and Vietnam. Bin Laden may well be responsible, but he was trained in terrorist combat by the CIA! In the wake of this terrible tragedy, the USA needs to examine its own foreign policy and prevent its president from taking sides in the Middle East. Walking out of the Durban talks and rejecting the Kyoto agreement are two acts which have angered terrorist AND humanitarian agencies across the world. Now the USA knows that, unfortunately, it is not immune to extremists and should act accordingly.      This has impacted all of America. This horrible event is simply unbelievable. I recently moved from New York City to Boston, and many of my friends were involved in this act of terrorism. I am surprised and overwhelmed by the amount of concerned individuals around the world. It comforts me to know that the world cares so much. Thank you all for your blessings, prayers, and thoughts. Thank you.      I am scared by the rage welling inside of me due to this. Sometimes I feel like I cannot speak. If there be anyone who can see the pictures of humans choosing to jump from 100 storeys up so as to not burn alive, and not feel as if the most horrendous travesty has taken place, let that person be the first to be punished.      This is the one of the most deplorable acts committed by humans against humans in the modern history of the world. What can be the motive so strong as to drive a person to this extent? Whatever the motive, the price paid for it was is way too much for humanity to bear. I'd still like to believe what I saw on TV last night was a part of a Hollywood movie rather than reality. My condolence to the families of those victims of the barbaric act. But please act with patience, and not with the feeling of vengeance. What is lost can't be undone by drawing more blood.      I have been in shock since 10:11 yesterday morning when I found out. My students and I watched the events unfold, unbelieving, as we watched the replay of the WTC collapsing. Retribution must be swift, sure, and unforgiving, but we must temper our anger with wisdom. We must never stoop to hate crimes, such as these the terrorists have dealt out.      One simple thing crossing my mind that could have prevented the whole disaster: Why is it possible to access the flight deck on any aircraft for literally anyone? This is obviously a major weakness in aircraft design enabling hijackers to easily take over control of the aircraft - has it never been considered re-designing the access to the flight decks of the commercial airliners?      It hurts to be an American. To know that there are people out there, with so much hatred in their hearts for people they don't know just devastates me.      I was in complete shock yesterday at the terrible events that took place. As a Muslim and an American, I am very upset at the loss of innocent lives. My sincerest condolences to all affected families. May Allah, the Almighty Creator, help all of us deal and cope with this horrible tragedy. Killing of innocents is not a teaching of Islam, nor the display of such cruelty.      This is really an unacceptable act of crime against US and the peace loving people of the world. All the culprits must be brought to book but care and emotions must be exercised not to kill innocent souls.      When there is so little that one can do, to bring back the dead, to turn back the clock, to strike out in revenge, how important it is to hear the common expressions of sorrow and sympathy from around the world - from Arab countries as well as Europe, Africa and Asia. The expression of feelings that are all so similar should remind us that there is something that we can all do right now to fight back. That is for the millions of us each to look around in our lives and find the opportunities to do the right thing, to help others in need and to reach out and build relationships with those around us. These acts can cut off the oxygen on which such evil feeds and heal its wounds in ways that little else can.      As an expat living here for the past year it has felt like the past 24 hrs has been like living on a movie set. Nothing can prepare you for the feeling of seeing the WTC in smoke and thinking there has been an ""accident"" and the next finding out it was an act of terrorism. Our hearts go out to those fearless firemen, police and all involved in the rescue effort as they put their lives on the line. Also those families who have missing loved ones. Violence has never solved issues and unfortunately I'm not sure that retaliation will be the answer as the casualties tend to be innocent women and children. There has to be an answer that this is the last time we see such an atrocity.      This is an abomination that my generation hoped it would never see. Those who lived through WW2 wished that they would never see the like again. We are closer to WW3 now than even the Cuban missile crisis. There will be many calls of retribution and annihilation, but I pray that those in charge see sense and use stealth and intelligence rather than all out aggression. There may be problems on our planet, but it is the only planet and the only environment we have to live in, and I don't want to see it destroyed or plunged into a nuclear devastation.      The 'reaction' should be swift, decisive and without mercy. A complete and utter destruction and obliteration of the country or countries (when proved beyond reasonable doubt), where these terrorists were harboured, trained, and sponsored. The only language these people understand is terror and violence so lets speak their language.      The ruins of New York have an uncanny resemblance to the embattled streets of Beirut. Civilian Americans have never really seen Beirut, and they don't have to. They can look at New York now.      I have been speaking to many people today and there seems to be a worrying tide of racism growing as a result of these attacks. Yes, they were terrible, and yes those responsible should be dealt with in an appropriate and if possible, diplomatic manner. However, I hope, even if this is proved to be the work of Bin Laden and his associates, that this does not lead to the persecution of Muslim groups within and outside Western countries. More violence is not the way forward. We should not sink to the level of those involved in this horrific attack. If we want to show ourselves to indeed be civilised nations we should stop this ridiculous talk of 'nuking the east'.      I am completely in shock. I've been watching the news since 7 this morning. My mother and I were talking on the phone remembering our trip to NY last year. We were on the observation deck looking over the wide expanse of twinkling lights, slick buildings, the Hudson. It's gone. It's just gone. I'm in complete shock thinking of all the dead. We are dealing with terrorists who may or may not be foreign. But they are ""foreign"" to our way of life, our culture, because this is inexplicable. I cannot understand this. God bless the families and the victims.      We are all stunned by this act of terrorism, the atmosphere at work is subdued and one of disbelief. Our hearts go out to all those who have lost loved ones, and to the rescue workers and hospital staff trying to help under extreme circumstances.      I really appreciate the kind thoughts and words expressed here - it helps to know that not all the world views us as an evil force that must be destroyed at any cost. Our thoughts and sorrow also go out to those innocent victims who were guests in our country.      The most cruel and cowardly act. I am really sorry for the suffering of the innocent people, who woke up to make the daily bread for their families. I am really feeling sorrow deep in my heart, I am sending my condolence to the families of victims and all Americans.      It is surely terrible loss of humanity; worse second to war. I would like to see this act of terrorism being punished so as to wipe terrorism from world. Death of so many innocent people must not be lost just in tears.      While the events that took place in New York City and Washington D.C. were unacceptable and completely reprehensible, we should consider that perhaps this is a reaction to our rather selfish, isolationist attitude toward the rest of the world that has filtered into our foreign policy. It seems that, in the collective consciousness of America, we have allowed the proliferation of this idea that we are immune to problems that concern the rest of the world, and therefore can treat other peoples as we please without fear of retaliation. Maybe now it is time that we realize our place in the global community and act in cooperation with its peoples, rather than force our will upon them.      This is the most awful act against civilization since WW2. My thoughts are with the victims and their relatives. These terrorists and murderers have attacked freedom, democracy and our way of life. The civilized world must overcome the countries and dictators who give these devils money, support and - most importantly - a safe haven to live. It's a sad time for humanity.      My only hope is that when these people who commit horrendous acts in the name of religion - whether it be Allah or Christ or whatever - arrive at the ""gates of infinity"", they find that their God banishes them to hell and all of a sudden, it becomes blindingly clear that all human life is sacrosanct no matter what. My thoughts are not only with the Americans, but with anyone who has been touched by terrorism in any form. President Bush, please think before you react.      In the name of God of the peace... I can't believe what happened in USA. I live in Iran and I'm 18 years old and I'm far away from USA and I'm so angry because I can't do anything for the people there. I'm alive with the USA dream - I didn't go to USA yet but I do my best to get there one day. I wanted to be an engineer for USA - now I want to be a security agent for USA. If the people in USA are in terrible disaster, I'm in terrible disaster. If USA was changed since yesterday, I was changed since yesterday. Please accept my deep sympathy and I'm sharing in your pain. With love of USA people and peace... and with HATE of terrorist....      I can't believe people are even asking if there should be retaliation. As a survivor of the Admiral Duncan bomb in London and someone who has spent a lot of time in New York, I can only ponder a guess at the true horror of what is unfolding around us. This attack was NOT a terrorist one it was an all-out act of WAR. The people in the Trade Centre were non-governmental civilians who were lucky enough to afford office space in such a premier site - they did not deserve to die.     Today we are in shock, but it won't be long before the clamour for revenge starts in earnest. Before we demand vengeance, we need to consider who or what it is we are fighting. The true enemy will most likely be a corrupt ideology rather than a particular group. The perpetrators of acts of terrorism are often indoctrinated with their ideals either by fanatical hatred or personal tragic experiences. None of this excuses their actions, but considering they like nothing better than to become martyrs to a cause, any violent retribution would play into their hands.      Retribution? Unlike Lockerbie, the protagonists are already martyrs. Punishing the identified faction would be very difficult without further innocent killing. I must admit I have found the internal US flight system very lax indeed. Last year, I had my boarding passes on an onward flight cancelled and the seats reassigned. Trouble was, my baggage was already on the plane from a connecting flight. Nice security hole there!      Liberal thinking and attitudes have created this and other similar problems and made the world a more dangerous place. If you give people with a grievance a sense that you will give into demands if they make your life uncomfortable then they will act accordingly, and this action will inevitably escalate.      Hatred and revenge cannot prevail - we MUST show we can rise above this death and destruction.      The First World War started with a single bullet and one death. It ended in the death of millions and the destruction of half a continent. Please don't let history repeat itself, let us not be at its mercy.      In the aftermath of the Bloody Tuesday terrorist attacks, people will inevitably ask how four commercial airliners could be hijacked, seemingly at will. My wife and I were two of the top managers for Northwest security at Metro Airport in Detroit during the early nineties, and the answer is very simple; real security would interfere with passenger convenience. Lord knows, we don't want to be inconvenienced.      The most effective form of security is a profile system, provided by ICTS and other security companies, in use throughout Europe, Israel and the Far East. But that would mean people couldn't board the plane if they weren't there an hour before boarding, and we certainly wouldn't want to inconvenience people who are too stupid and selfish to get to the airport early. The number of bags physically searched would increase by three to four times. Certainly a few terrorist attacks are nothing compared to the indignity of having our baggage searched.      Shock - horror and indescribable sorrow that man could behave like this and in the name of so-called religion. My heart goes out to all the people in the world that this tragedy has touched. America - we are all with you in your hour of need!      I am an emergency services worker and I watched the events in the USA unfold on television Sept 11th. This is a situation we all hope in our profession, that we would never have to deal with - the carnage; the senseless loss of lives of innocent people and the emergency services personnel doing their duty to rescue them. My heart and blessings go out to all those affected by this horrid tragedy. This is truly a day of infamy.      The eloquence of your Prime Minister moved me and many other Americans to tears. It is comforting to us to know that our British friends stand ""shoulder to shoulder"" with us in this time of tragedy.      There is nothing but sorrow; nothing but sadness. I remember the opening day of TWC, I was in NYC, and remember the talks about the lasting age of the twins; and now in less than 30 years I saw them collapse and I consider it ""the last day of an era"". And the era ends when the image of NYC vanishes forever and the remaining is a cloudy picture on the mind of my generation. As usual the common people pay the highest price; the least is that never-seeing-sight of twins.      How can people dance and celebrate at the streets just after thousands of innocent people have been murdered. That's sick!      Whilst I am horrified at the destruction of human life and the misery it will cause those who have lost loved ones, I hope that the US will show restraint in its response to the terrorist attacks. The US government must really look at its foreign policy, because it has taken them down this road with these terrible and terrifying results. Nothing can excuse these killings, but surely now is the time for the US to look at its relationship with much of the world.      I have lived in the UK for 13 years. I came from New York. Words have till now, failed me, as have done for so many other ex-pats and those who have followed these nightmares as they have unfolded. I'm sure the full depth of the emotional shock has not yet been realised by most of us.      This is indeed a tragedy. However, we should focus not only on what we should do from here, but on the conditions that allowed such a thing to happen. The actions of these terrorists were not unprovoked, as much as US citizens would like to believe they are. These atrocities were commited by people with extreme conviction to their beliefs. The world has to come to an understanding of what pushed them to this point.      I had checked in with my family who live North of the city while the events unfolded all are well although I have yet to hear of a niece and nephew who were due to travel from the east to west coast this week.      I have always been a person of moderate, considered views this is tested now. I can speak with confidence, I am not frightened, I am not questioning my values, I am angry and all Americans are angry. This is not jingoistic, flag waiving patriotism, it is outrage and Human pain in the face of the suffering of so many...too many. I now fully realise how my parents felt at the news of Pearl Harbour. These incidents strengthen the resolve of a nation and I hope that the UK shows their support, however they can, for all who have suffered such an evil and grievous wound.      Our stunned disbelief stems from the fact that such an attack upon the US mainland has not occurred since our Civil War, and not since the Revolutionary War has such an attack on the mainland come via a foreign nation. For other nations, this is a way of life. For us, it is a new terror -- and perhaps a wake-up call. My own personal concern is the potential longevity of any full-fledged war that may erupt. Enemies like this don't simply give up after a few bombings. This won't be the equivalent of hurling missiles at tiny nations until their leaders do what we tell them. This kind of enemy doesn't go away until the very last individual has perished. And that's a frightening thought, to say the least.      Like the rest of the nation I am stunned. I went to bed last night feeling safe and although I live in Kansas (in the middle of the country) my sense of security has been shattered. Already I know someone who knows of someone who died in the tragic events of today. These attacks will touch the lives of everyone, I know that I will never be the same.      It is absolutely sad and unbelievable to see what has happened in America. I strongly support what President Bush said during his address to the Americans that 'there will be no distinction between terrorists and those harbouring them' in the course of fighting against terrorism. May God bless all Americans with peace in this sad period.      Nobody here really understands what has happened. Everyone is in disbelief. I feel so sad, angry, and helpless. I want to scream, I want to cry, I want to strike at someone, I want to see someone responsible feel the pain that we feel, that I feel. I want those families that have lost love ones to not hurt. We have lost our innocence, the world has just lost innocence.      I personally was not in New York, I saw it on television like most of the people, but I did know some people who were heading to the World Trade Center today, who I have not yet heard from. The sight of the WTC building burning was horrible enough, but then to see a plane fly right into the second building was absolutely sickening. It was definitely the worst sight I have ever seen in my life.      There was an estimate of around 20,000 people in both of those building at that time. Also, an estimated 90,000 people pass through those buildings daily. The burning NYC skyline seemed like a scene out of a Godzilla movie, only it wasn't. Although I was in Philadelphia today, the effects were still greatly felt here and everywhere. City Hall was cornered off by cops with heavy automatic guns. The Philadelphia International Airport was completely shut down. There was major traffic all around the city and suburbs as schools got out early and businesses were evacuated.      Many are calling this worse than Pearl Harbor, and I agree. This is truly a ""day which will live in infamy."" The one thing this country really needs is the support and prayers of everyone around the world.      Got back from New York last week. Had my 41st birthday celebration in the Wild Blue restaurant on the 107th floor in the North Tower. Can only say I watched in disbelief at the pictures on TV. Hard to believe what I was witnessing. Shocked and depressed by the people that can carry out such attacks. To me religious bigotry is the most dangerous force in the world today. I suspect this is what is behind these events. Removal of poverty from the world and education is the only answer.      I am not an American but have lived here for two years. The behaviour of the American people in the past day has shown that this is a nation that will survive. The USA has shown its very best side under extraordinary circumstances. No terrorist organisation is going to subdue the spirit of this country. It is now time for the free world to take action to do as much as it can to prevent terrorism.      My brother Charles works, worked, on the 92nd floor of the South Tower. We presume he has died and still cannot contact any of our friends in New York to confirm. My one observation at this time is to express my complete incredulity at the lameness, the uninspiring and frankly pathetic response of the President of the United States during the day that has just passed. It seems he went from Miami, where he condemned the ""folks"" who carried out these attacks, to Louisiana, to Nebraska and is now, finally, apparently, returning to Washington. We will continue to seek word of our brother but must now presume the worst. That's all.      One of our co-workers was on the American Airlines flight from Boston this morning. Our thoughts are with his family, and those of all the others affected by this tragedy.      I am in shock by the devastation that has occurred in the US. I have friends working in NY and fear that they may not still be with us. It is all so surreal but yet it is well and truly for real. It's no dream, no nightmare even. My heart and thoughts are with all those whose lives have been lost and the families and friends. May the US Government deal with this in the correct way - what that is I do not know. Peace be with you all.      September 11th will mark history with one of the highest step in horror. The world will never be the same. Our hearts go out to all of you. Our hope is for a better tomorrow.      Why are we assuming so readily that Arab fundamentalists were behind it? Remember the Oklahoma City bombing. I am finding it very difficult to believe, that despite their so called open policy, the Americans failed to detect at least bunches of four Arabs times five, boarding a plane at the same time - correct me if I am wrong but I learnt it from Hollywood films that it takes at lest a foursome to take over the plane. Why nobody is talking about the Oklahoma bombing scenario? And the fact that it might have been done by the dissatisfied Americans? Or is it a scenario of an American or Americans doing this to their fellow Americans so inconceivable, even to contemplate as a possibility?      Well As a Muslim I am very very upset and shocked. If there is any involvements of Muslims it is a shame. But at this moment I am really shocked and amazed and as hurt as my American friends are. Patience is the best way for now..      I feel like our world has been raped. I can't get these poor people out of my head. This is a day I'll never forget. My thoughts are with every person affected by the tragic events of today.      May the Lord bless and comfort those in this time of pain and terror. Our most sympathetic condolences.      This is horrible day, my heart is with the American people.      This is worse than the attack on Pearl Harbour. Pearl Harbour was a military target, the World Trade Center was not. The words of your Prime Minister that Britain stands shoulder to shoulder with America are appreciated.      I hung up the phone five minutes ago. Two close friends - gone. This issue is no longer academic or abstract with me. God help me, but for the first time in my life I truly know what it is to desire revenge.      I'm just so far away from NY but it's just like happening next to me. It was around 10 NY time when I heard about the attack. I was working out at a gym. The woman exercising next to me was talking on phone, telling her friend that she has some colleagues working in the 1 WTC. It was about an hour later that we got the news about the collapsing. I can hear her crying.      I can't understand in the year 2002 how terrorists are able to board four or five planes with guns? Is security asleep on the job?      Seeing people jumping out of a 110 floor high building after a plane crashed into it makes one want to cry. Let's hope all people can come together to stop madness like this. Black, yellow, Jewish, gay, rich, white, poor, straight, man, Muslim, child... all of us      My thoughts are with all the American families suffering the horror and those of all the others affected by this tragedy. I can't but condemn this barbarian act. I have confidence in the resilient spirit of American people and their ability to bounce back from this outrage. God help all sufferers to overcome this tragedy.      It's terrible. I watched live WTC southern tower's hit and all that happened after that. Then I watched Palestinian's joy and elation in Jerusalem. I think the most terrible fact is that there are ""humans"" that can be happy of someone's pain. GOD bless America. And GOD bless this world.      I really feel sorry for Americans but that was a reaction against US foreign policy. That was like Newton's third law, opposite and equal reaction, may be more than equal. So, should we expect another Hiroshima?      Its simply unbelievable. No matter how hard I try, I still can't accept the fact that something so gruesome happened. I pray for the families of the deceased.      It's a great disaster ,all the world had shocked. We are all praying for the innocent victims and their families, the killer must be punished whoever they are, but also I think America must work hard in order to lessen the number of its enemies in the world.      I herd about this tragic event when I got to work this morning. My friends and I are all so shocked that for a while we could not say anything to each other. Our sincere and heart felt sympathy to the victims' families and we wish to wish all those brave rescue workers all the best. This is like it has happened here in Fiji. We are all so sad and worried. Those cowards need to be brought to task and should never be forgiven. We remember all Americans in ours prayers.      My uncle Charles works in the World Trade Center and is feared dead. We have made several attempts to contact him through his cell phone and home phone but have heard nothing. His wife has heard nothing. This is something America must never forget.      I think this is a real tragedy for the American people and I have family that live in New York and I don't know if they are ok. It's very upsetting.      I was in school when they announced over the loud speaker what happened. Everyone in the whole school was shocked, and stopped dead in their tracks. The one plane crashed in Somerset, PA, only 80 miles from where I was. That's scary. Knowing that there are still six or seven planes unaccounted for is even scarier. The school kept us until our parents could pick us up. I've been watching the news since I got home.      I'm from the UK working in midtown Manhattan. My company had a Customer support centre in one of the WTC buildings. We don't know what's happened to everybody. We know they were evacuating, and we've spoken to one of the staff, but he got separated from everybody else. There still aren't any realistic casualty figures.      Being only 13, this whole thing deeply frightens me. My Parents have a friend who lives in Manhattan, and Cannot Reach Him. I hope to God he's alright and my deepest thoughts go out to those injured. I hope the people who committed this horrible act of Murder realise that they will not get away with this.      This is the most serious event of my lifetime. My husband is on his way home from his job at a Military Base and reiterates how serious this is. My daughter and I are crying and praying together because this is so tragic and unbelievable! The pictures are horrifying.      I am waiting, terrified for my husband and mother to return home from their trip to the UK. They're now grounded in Gander, New Foundland. I haven't heard from them but the airline assures me they're are safe. Now they're saying this may not be the end of it. Please stop whoever you are if you have any humanity in you, just stop.      Most of my co-workers have gone home for the day (it is 4pm). I am sitting in the office hoping/praying/waiting for some news from my boss's husband who worked at the WTC. Like all of you, I can't begin to fathom the minds of the masterminds behind the attack. I hope that there will be a rational response to these irrational acts.      Here at our college on the West Coast, the campus is in mourning. We were going to translate Aeschylus this morning, but this tragedy is much harder, much worse. I hope that we -- I mean all human beings in the world -- can all use this as an opportunity to observe ourselves, to stay relaxed, and not to react violently and cause the world to erupt into war. This is the time to turn the other cheek. We are living in history; let us learn a lesson and move on, but be bullied into war, because that's obviously what the terrorists want.      I am out of words. I am a Muslim Arab, and if speculation proves right, I fully resent all such actions carried under the name of ""Allah"". No religion in the world calls for the assassination of innocent civilians. I sincerely hope that the US will carry out sever action against the culprits. Our world is not zoo, and humans are not animals to manslaughter. How can we live, if even the simplest daily habits, such as going to work, actually put our lives on stakes?      The world is reacting in shock and in horror to the devastating events of this morning. We probably all have had a moment of ""this could never happen here"" today but it has. My office in Ottawa is within 2 blocks of our Parliament Buildings and the U.S. Embassy - everything shut down in the downtown core by early afternoon. There was a bomb scare at Parliament and they were searching the government building across the street from us with a canine unit. We have colleagues in New York, Boston and our prayers go out to the victims, their families and all those working so hard to find any survivors.      All that has happened is very tragic and it makes one's heart ache. Thinking of all the loss of life and property. My condolences for the people of America ,those who have lost their precious ones. This terrorist attack is a thing the people of America will never forget. "
HOC HOC-IH -0.1 " Our infatuation with the ""ambulance chasing"" society created by America has gone far enough. It seems nowadays that no one is safe from it. Of course it is a fact of life that we all make mistakes and I do think that in some cases people should be compensated for major medical blunders, but it seems to me that if we had a little less litigation in the NHS, then we could save a lot of money which could be ploughed into recruiting new doctors and nurses and improving the overall service.      When are the courts going to start telling people they have to be responsible for themselves? Tripping in a front garden delivering junk mail does not constitute carelessness or neglect on behalf of the house owner but that of the person walking on it. Being honest and careful now becomes second best against greed and carelessness. She should have been sued for being clumsy and greedy. The law needs to wake up and leave the US ideas to the US.      It seems that hospitals are not flexing their administrative muscles and using the exception clauses open to them. They could ask on what grounds full records are required due to the disproportionate effort it would entail and then offer only to copy items specific to the enquiry. They should demand the return of expensive items such as x-rays by a given date - are there rules about the return and charges for non-return? I don't think so. I find it hard to believe that originals are being 'forced' out of the hands of the rightful owners. I hope the government implement a more suitable fee in plenty of time before the cap on costs runs out, too.      British law needs to be changed, to enshrine the concept that an individual has a duty of care to themselves. If they are stupid, or simply careless, no one else has to compensate them.      When will this litigation madness stop? Lawyers should have the personal integrity not to feed their clients' egos by encouraging them to file malicious and vindictive cases. Additionally, it's not just big companies that fall victim to this compensation culture we live in. The courts are increasingly being used as a venue for litigants to seek revenge against other individuals. It just has to stop! The legal system needs to weed out these nonsensical claims before they ever come to court. This is the only way that it will get back the credibility it used to have. All we want is for the courts to use common sense!      No win, No fee. Who scrapped 'Legal Aid'? Blame the government for the growing annoying adverts and claim people. But at the end of the day why shouldn't we claim if a company causes us harm through negligence or should we let them get away with it?      People who have a dangerous driveway or dangerous animals should install a post box at the end of their driveway, padlock their front gate and put notices up detailing the nature of the danger. If compensation payments are considered unreasonable both sides should have the right to appeal.      The compensation culture has certainly got out of control. Recently, I bought a bag of mixed salted nuts from my local supermarket. On the back was printed the legend: ""Warning! May contain nuts!""      When someone unsuccessfully sues a hospital, the costs of defending the claim cannot be reclaimed, no matter how outrageous it is. If a claim succeeds, the money comes straight out of the patient care budget. Where else could it come from? Litigation is hammering nails into the NHS' coffin.      The ""Beware of the Dog"" sign will give way to the ""Enter at Your Own Risk"" sign as more people try to protect themselves against malicious claimants. Clearly the person who fell over delivering mail had been inadequately trained and so I see a counter claim from the defendant - maybe under the Rights of Third Parties Act. God help us!      When lawyers apply for medical records they should be charged the actual cost plus at least #100.00, which is still not in line with the costs they would charge for a similar service. This would help to offset the cost and disruption to the hospital and would enable the original records to be kept where they are most needed, as only copies could then be forwarded.      Can someone please tell me how I can sue Blair for the emotional distress his forsaken election promises have caused me?      I think it's sad that people can't just accept that, just sometimes, life isn't fair. It doesn't mean someone else is always responsible and should be forced to pay out disproportionate amounts of money!      As a Brit living in the USA, I can safely say you have a long way to go before attaining the level of 'crazy litigation' over here. A glance in my local phone book reveals 160 pages of listings for lawyers and 60 for doctors. My colleagues in the medical profession now refer to three classes of drugs; carcinogens (which may cause cancer) teratogens (which may cause birth defects and litigens (which always result in law suits). The current litigious environment does make for some amusing product labelling. My coffee comes with a warning that it is hot, my iron bears a sticker informing me that it 'may be hot when set on hot'. Curiously, the only products that seem to lack a warning label are firearms.      Whilst there are many genuine cases the only people to blame for things getting out of hand are the ones who uphold the growing tide of crazy claims.      We have already gone too far in the direction of litigation at the drop of a hat. Witness all those tasteless TV commercials egging viewers on to make a claim for ridiculous amounts for what often are simply accidents. Too much litigation is destroying trust and goodwill between people, and increasing suspicion. We should stop now and not allow it to go further.      Everybody loses - higher insurance, more paranoia, more lawyers. I enquired about compensation in the UK when a motorist opened his door in front of me, knocking me off my bicycle and breaking my collar bone. I was told that a minimum would be #1000. The lawyer implied I would need to pretend to be unable to work for two weeks - so I didn't take the matter any further.      I think the whole system has gone crazy. Every other advert on TV now is for a claims company clawing for work. Are we going the way of the States and seeing ambulance chases on every street corner? I'm afraid in today's media-hyped and money-hungry world we will and that is far from healthy.      The Devil makes work for idle hands. There are too many lawyers already touting for this sort of work. When two of the most contemptible industries get together (Insurance and Lawyers) someone is ripe for a plucking.      It will be Joe Public or the ordinary taxpayer that gets hit with the resulting higher premiums as the actual productive people in society have to 'cover their backs' against increasing claims.      It is about time the law was available to all not just the wealthy. However, people have to realise that using the ""where there is blame - there's a claim"" brigade will lead to an increase in the cost of living, as insurance will go up, employers will need more insurance which will put the price of goods or services up. In the end we will all pay.      Here in the United States no one knows their rights, so we're constantly threatening each other with litigation. This is especially true with the murky intellectual property laws.      We must take responsibility for our actions and stop the ""It's somebody else's fault"" syndrome!      We're under the assumption that if your adversary can hire a more expensive lawyer, you're bound to lose, so we just try not to anger people more wealthy than ourselves.      People have to take a certain amount of responsibility for themselves. The cases of people successfully suing companies because their coffee burned them, or they tripped over a loose paving stone a ridiculous. If the coffee wasn't hot the same person would have complained about it.      These petty claims will only cause everyone to pay more on insurance.      My advice to people all over the world is not to take what your doctor tells you as if they were words of God - look at it critically just like you would if the mechanic were fixing your car. And when they say that giving explanations put other patients lives at risk, be very, very sceptical.      Where the Yanks have gone, the Brits are sure to follow. Every unsavoury bit of American life unerringly finds its way to the UK. This is just the latest piece of unpleasantness. Who do these litigants think is paying the bill? The insurance companies?      Not likely. The insurance companies simply pass it on to you and I in increased premiums. There is nothing like a bit of human greed to dull the senses.      It seems to me that the worst offender is the ""No Win, No Fee"" claims companies (which don't take on cases that aren't likely to win) who appear to be draining money out of the local county councils simply because someone tripped on the pavement.      Once they win they take a good percentage of the winnings as well as getting their legal fees paid as the council lost the case. This is fraud. I work hard and like most people pay my taxes. I don't like to see it handed out to ""No Win, No Fee"" scams.      Born and raised in UK I saw a reasonable National Health system. However, it has deteriorated over the years. I have lived in the US for 20 years and, although health care is expensive, it is better than the UK in many respects.      Legal action against doctors who malpractice is a good thing. It makes some of the ""would be"" quacks think twice before they act (or ignore). Not all, but some. You need that security too. Sue them when they do wrong.      People who trip over paving stones and the like should really watch where they are going, perhaps they have a responsibility too? Where a claim is false and malicious, and is proved so, then they should be subject to some form of censure never mind the ""no fee no win"" scenario. Before we descend into farce the whole legal morass of civil litigation needs to be examined by a Commission.      The only thing I'm worried about is that someone might sue me for their own misfortune. Having to fork out multiple thousands for someone who has simply tripped over a driveway is unbelievably stupid.      Too many people think that the world owes them something. Unfortunately in capitalist societies this something is construed as money. But why is this so? Why should you receive money when you trip and fall on someone's driveway? If someone is really damaged by such a fall, surely a solid network of counsellors and decent medical care is more appropriate. Get up, stop crying and don't be so greedy should be the message we put out.      In some ways, it is about time. For a long time legal action has been out of bounds for the average person in the UK. You get screwed and there is nothing you can do about it. The legal system in the UK was always about criminal and rich people. The US on the other hand has gone too far. It is so easy to file a petition and make someone else's life a misery. Min costs for an attorney start at 2k. Your choices are to either pay huge sums for insurance or risk being wiped out just because you made a small mistake and bumped someone else's car. More litigation in the UK is a good thing. We just need to learn when to stop. Something the Yanks never did.      As a UK radiologist, I am very worried at the requests we get from solicitors demanding copies of the WHOLE of patient notes, when clearly only a single item is possibly relevant. Most patients would not expect lawyers to do this, and do not realise that their most personal medical details are being pored over by non-health-professionals. There is clearly a case for an system of ""informed consent"" whereby patients should be told why records are requested, who will be poring over them, which records are to be retrieved, and any possible harm to themselves that might be caused.      It is just the nature of today's society unfortunately. If something bad happens to someone then someone else must be made accountable for it in a court of law. It's easy money really      Perhaps one way to end this lunacy is for the juries involved in assessing damages to take a long slow look at the claimant before awarding ridiculously high amounts in compensation. Although some medical awards MAY be realistic how can anyone justify awards of around #5000 per hour for wrongful arrest of someone with a string of convictions, no reputation to uphold and no income. If the profits on suing were not so high the practice would become less attractive perhaps.      If this litigation trend is not stopped before it gets out of hand like it is here in the US the cost of hospital treatment will become excessive like it is here. The reason of course is simple, the premiums for insurance against litigation are very high, and some patients are litigation mad, encouraged of course by greedy lawyers, they follow ambulances to hospital in order to drum up trade. Nip it in the bud now.      I wonder how many of the people currently suing for compensation would have had the medical treatment if they had had to sign a non-litigation disclaimer beforehand. I suspect the answer is: Most of them. The medical people in this country do the best they can under the conditions they find themselves in. EVERYONE makes mistakes from time to time. Why don't we just get off the litigation kick, get off the backs of these people, and just be thankful that we have such dedicated people to fall back on at the same time.      We are becoming more and more like the US. In the end, you and I will be paying for the claims because our insurance premiums will skyrocket. The only beneficiaries will be the solicitors! The government should step in before it's too late.      People with a genuine claim must never be discouraged from pursuing their case. On the other hand, vexatious claims need to be taken in hand very quickly before the legal, medical and insurance systems grind to a halt. My solution? Move to a genuine ""no win, no fee"" system, in which unsuccessful solicitors carry ALL costs, including those of the defence, without being allowed to force clients to take out insurance. I am sure that the spirit of moderation would prevail again in a very short time... "
HOC HOC-IQ -0.0399999999999999 " Khatami is definitely the best possible choice. The most amazing aspect of this general uprising to re-elect Khatami despite his rather poor performance in the case of student riots in Tehran University (summer 99) indicates that after all people do care about what is happening in their country and that is the best thing that could have happened. Reform is a matter of change as long as a peacekeeper is elected the reform pace can remain uninterrupted and that's good enough. The rest comes in time.      Every society needs reform. It's a constant process of improvement. If you reform the democratic systems of the world and remove nudity, materialistic attitudes that lead to social injustice, it will become an Islamic system. Unfortunately, no one cares for true human reforms. It's just a war between democracy and other systems. It's time we reform democracy.      Khatami is a coward, unwilling to stand up for the freedom of his people from the evil, twisted version of Islam that enslaves them. He is more pathetic than Gorbachev. Actions, not words are what Iran needs.      The Reform is noticeable in Iran when you walk, yet still when you walk in the streets you can't feel safe.      Khatami is the representative of Iranian eagerness to live in democracy. We have learned to be patient and take steps at a time. We honour him for his respect for Iran and Iranian culture. He has brought to us a sense of self-respect that was absent for a long period of time.      I don't think the election result will change any thing, people are still hungry and jobless and it is the last agenda on the minds of the leaders      Trade with the sovereign republic of Iran, do not demonise it. A literate, sophisticated and relatively homogeneous culture like Iran will certainly find its own long-term peaceful political solutions without our speculation or interference. Let us not forget that the reactive mullahs were brought on by western perfidy.      If all your enemies are happy with what you are doing, then definitely you are doing something wrong. Now all the West wants Khatami to win and bring reform. And what is this reform? Isn't it the culture the West is vomiting out? The countries which are backing Khatami definitely, want to see Iranian society destroyed.     Religion is no panacea for economic ills much less for social emancipation, though it may make excellent political sense. It is a choice the Iranians have to make: to build a modern, educated, liberal and prosperous society based on their ancient culture or continue to embrace rigid, dogmatic, medieval doctrines that have destroyed Iran economically and helped it to be further isolated in the comity of nations.      I think Reform is a general phrase. The reform movement will continue in Iran and June 8 is going to be remembered in Iran's history. I think Khatami as a president will have many weak points. But for sure he has a strong support in Iranian society now. I hope it will help. I agree reform is not possible overnight. So be patient, it won't stop, that is for sure. God bless Iran      1. Voting in an election makes the people more aware politically and this is a good thing in itself regardless of the outcome of an election.     Democratic reform is incompatible with Islam. A true Islamic republic is governed by Allah and not the masses as in a ""democracy"". Khatami and his stooges are handing Iran over to the West by stealth and therefore undermining the foundations of the Ayahtollah Khomeini's work.      2. Khatami is the only alternative for a sensible change in Iran.      Despite the label of 'reform', during Khatami's reign, we have seen more closures of newspapers, more jailing of journalists and in general more injustice against the citizens of Iran. Iranians suffer from an identity crisis; on the one hand cannot accept Islam fully and on the other have not been able to escape from it. Until they resolve this issue, the country will remain in turmoil, as the Persian roots are too strong to completely submit to the words of Allah.      Reforms are not possible now because of the strength of Ayatollah Khameni's forces with the determination to preserve and propagate Islam. Khatami has to buy time while the popularity of these pro Mullahs drops before he puts in reform. Otherwise the Imam at Quom is still calling the shots.      There is a lot of attention paid on what the young in Iran want in terms of reform. How about what the middle aged, parents and mature people want? Reform is good, but it must not violate Islamic values, principles and standards. If it does, then the supreme leader and the guardian council must do their constitutional duty and prevent it. With freedom, comes responsibility and limitations.      While there is no basic freedom and democracy, there is no accountability. When there is lawlessness and when there is no alternative to Mr. Khatami, I think Mr. Khatami is a good choice to drive the reform forward with wisdom and caution so as not to make the conservatives more aggressive and put them in a defensive position but beat them at their own game. I wish Mr. Khatami wins again with a bigger margin than the last election.      There is no basic freedom in Iran. The population is growing and there are no jobs. Most importantly, the only time Iran will truly come to its feet is when the people take charge of the country. Then the Shah, the Mullah or outsiders will not be able to destroy us. We have a lot of work ahead of us, we are still very ignorant about our own affairs but we are quick to judge others! I guess we deserve what we currently have: an Islamic dictatorship ran by rich mullahs that are worst than Shah.      While the talk about 'reform in Iran' sounds good, it is ultimately meaningless. In a country where the Guardian Council approves or rejects candidates, where the Supreme Leader's words cannot be challenged, where the fundamentals of the regime cannot be questioned or criticized, reform and democracy are meaningless concepts. This election is not about any of these ideas. It is merely about a group of state-approved candidates putting on a puppet show to entertain a very frustrated and rightfully angry public.      Don't be fooled by Khatami's spin. He is no Gorbachov. What is the definition of reform? Mr Khatami is not even mentally capable to imagine the reforms that most Iranians seek.      I want to say that Mr.Khatami is the best choice and he can do much better in the next four years. I believe that Iranian people love him and support him and want him to be the president again. And of course if he could get more vote than the previous election he can reform everything with more power. He should be patient towards the conservatives because conservatives just want to kick him away. I have voted for Mr.Khatami and I am telling you that he will again win with a big majority. And then only reform is possible.      What is the alternative? If there is someone willing to stand as a reformist, then the country has a chance of reforming - but only if the general public fully backs the leader. The alternative would be a total return to the old ways with the tacit agreement that reformation has failed and that the old, oppressive regime is the best way. So it's either put-up or shut up. Reform doesn't happen overnight, and the rest of the world can only pray that the Iranians get the reform they need.      I believe that reform is needed in Iran, but not at the expense of Islamic culture. What Iran should focus on is to move to a true Islamic way of living, and not to the materialistic Western way of life. It is all about being a genuine Muslim!      Iran certainly has been changing slowly in the right direction in the last several years, is much better to change slowly rather have a Revolution and go back to square one again. And of course you can have Democracy an Islamic society, the time when Islam was giving rights to human beings, other society were eating human body.      Does anyone remember Montazery or Taleghani, from an Islamic background or prime ministers Bazargan or Banisadr with western education? The fundamentalists suffocate and destroy anyone voicing reform or democracy. Given the experience of the past 20 years, Khatami is the best possibility, equipped and qualified to front the peaceful battle. His credibility and support of people for him is the best combination for a start, which may take another 4 year term in office for him.      I am just a little scared from Mr. Khatami win because there is a famous saying that if every one is happy then you are doing something wrong. And we know that there are a lot of people from Iran who left when the country was going through a big change. And all they have done from that day is to try their best to defame Iran by false propagandas and helping its enemies. And we know that they are the people backing Mr Khatami's win.      It is a puppet show. People have no real choice. What would you choose between bad and worse? I would not vote as I believe that Khatami is a pressure valve of this backward regime and helping him is helping the mullahs and perpetuating the suffering of Iranians.      The rest of the world, especially the USA, should learn from Iran's election. The strict rules allow for democracy to exist. Each candidate is given the same amount of money; no other income can be used to fund a campaign. Subsequently, each candidate has an equal chance to express his/her ideas. Furthermore, personal attacks against other candidates are not allowed. All speeches and slogans must deal with the issues. These rules provide a more fair and democratic election than many western countries.      My reason for voting despite my misgivings and pessimism? At least Khatami uses the right words and is humble. It is my right as a citizen to decide who leads my country. Unfortunately due to flawed nature of the Islamic Republic constitution, as a citizen I have no right in directly electing the most powerful leader of the country. An assembly whose elections are rigged selects him. But I want to use the opportunity to make my insignificant voice heard.      I believe that the push for reforms in Iran will eventually lead to open confrontation and violence. I do not condone violence and do not look forward to it, but when it happens I would be supporting a side that stands for openness and basic freedoms in our country. I vote today so that when I take sides in a violent process, I can do so with the knowledge that I personally took part in the process that was promising to reform the Islamic Republic and that I was one of the people who gave the Islamic Republic every opportunity to reform itself and to avoid violence.      No matter, whether Mr.Khatami returns to power or not, Iran will stand as an Islamic republic, overcoming all obstacles. After the Islamic revolution Iran survived 22 years defending all the conspiracies perpetuated by the US and its allies. I hope the nation will continue with the true Islamic principles.      Mr. Khatami is a very nice person but nice people are not always good presidents. Iran needs someone with no fear whatsoever.      What happened four years ago was a remarkable achievement towards hope for our country, Iran. All citizens of Iran must not forget the legacy of our Great Persia during thousands of years. Our people are peaceful, they don't want another revolution in the country. The safest way which will lead us toward democracy is to vote reformist on Friday. Most Iranians still believe in Mr.Khatami's determination to go ahead with his reformist goals. A second mandate for Mr.Khatami will provide him with more strength. Avoiding to vote will be a victory for all those who would like to make Iran a second Afghanistan.      How can there be freedom in a country where the laws of religion and state are entwined?      Is four years enough to reform and change Iran? How much change can any society achieve in four years? How long did it take for French, Russians, Americans and other people to substantially improve or change their lives after revolutions and independence? The short answer is many many years, in most cases. The last four years as well as the next four years will be just a blink of an eye for the Iranians. Mr. Khatami will be elected and there will be plenty of complaints from him and the public in Iran about the slow pace of so called reforms in Iran. However, it will be many years before real changes can take place in Iran. We have to be patient.      By participating in the election on June 8th we show to our enemy inside and outside of our beloved country that we care about our future and democracy in Iran. By not voting we just give hardliners more of an opportunity to have their way. After more than 3000 years of being careless to ourselves and our future, finally it's time for us to show we care and we want to survive. On June 8th we will go to the voting location no matter where we are and vote. Democracy yes; dictatorship no!      Reforms in Iran are irreversible. Iranians around the globe will go to vote once again on Friday to establish a civil society and more freedom in their nation. Even though Iranians are not happy with their social and economical situation in their country, this time they chose evolution rather than revolution and that is a blessing for all.      Let me tell all who are sitting and wishing violence and instability in Iran, because of their hostile attitude toward this great nation, that we have chosen our path toward a democratic Iran and will support Khatami and his programme, because despite all of negative propaganda against Iran, it is a democratic system and based upon people's wish.      The main obstacle of democracy and social development in Iran is that the traditional civil organisations have disappeared or weakened, while modern civil institutions have not established. The traditional clergy has tried to use this vacuum for its own interests, blocking possibilities for organisation of the civil and democratic institutions in Iran. This problem cannot be solved in any other way than a democratic struggle, through which democratic institutions step by step get organised and resisting traditional organisations successively get integrated into a modern genuine system of an Iranian democracy. This fight cannot be done by anyone else than the Iranian people themselves.      Khatami came to power last time with the ambition of activating democratic aspects of the constitution, and to be honest he did it. The reason of his failures was the lack of civil organisations that could support him, his ministers and the democratic principles that he fought for. With Khatami in office for another 4 years the Iranian people will have another historical opportunity to respond to the call of history, to build up democracy by experiencing it in democratic and civil institutions.      I think president Khatami will be chosen again in the coming elections, and he will try to do his best in making the reforms. It is not going to be easy for him, as he has to tackle major obstacles like the power Mafia in Iran. This Mafia is headed by really powerful men, who have greater authority than the president. Most people of Iran are familiar with these men and the things they do in the country. So far Khatami has tried to make contact with the young people and to use them as tools for his slow reforms. Khatami has to talk to people and say what is happening behind the walls. He has to give people information about his obstacles and progress. People have the right to know everything. On the whole Khatami is popular among the young, because he has given them some freedom compared to past years, but will teen power be enough...?      Khatami is the best person to lead the Iranian people. He is very honest man and well educated. He is cleric; an insider. He knows what he is doing. People from Yazd province know how to do business with others.      Khatami's most important goal has been and remains the institutionalising of opposition within the Iranian political system. Democratic evolution is completely dependent on his success in achieving this goal. Previously governments and oppositions in Iran have regarded the elimination of the other as the only means of establishing their agenda in the country. Khatami's achievements in quelling this view have been remarkable in the face of resistance from the conservative establishment. An important milestone in this way for Mr Khatami will be the fate of the recently arrested Islamic-Nationalists.      We have a window of opportunity which is honestly quite a historic one where a reformist has been allowed to rise to the level of presidency in this country; everyone should welcome this opportunity. In a way, we should give this our best shot. If the support for President Khatami doesn't happen to be as much as it was four years ago, then, as a nation, we have a big problem on our hands. That will show that as a nation we are not mature enough to approach the problem in a systematic manner and persist until we get what we want. On the other hand, the establishment should grasp this opportunity and submit to the people's will or else, very soon, the tone of the conversation between people and the establishment will change and instead of relying the ballot boxes, people will rely on riots and bloody conflicts to get what they want.      The election is over and it is not surprising that Khatami won a landslide victory. The choice for the people in Iran was to elect either Khatami who promised freedom and reform, or one of the hard-liners. Now he has to prove that he can deliver. As we have seen in the past 4 years, there will be a few superficial changes, but in order to remain in power the hard-liners and Khatami need each other and will continue the same game. Give a little to placate the masses and put on a friendly face for the West. The Pandora's box, however, is now wide open and the people cannot and will not be fooled.      Yes, reform is possible. For the first time the majority of Iranian people are purposefully and vigorously demanding democracy. Khatami has brought the concepts of ""civil society"", ""democratisation"" and reform to the general public in Iran. There is no going back.      Khatami is not and never been committed to reforms. If Khatami had not been elected president 4 years ago, we would have witnessed a complete collapse of the cleric rule in Iran. Khatami simply took the energy and enthusiasm from the freedom movement and ran with it in a ""legal"" and ""parliamentarian"" fiasco that not only resulted in more arrests of freedom fighters than 4 years ago, but rather demonstrated a total lack of leadership skills by failing to even bring a small legislative victory to his 75% electoral support. No matter how powerless a leader is, if one cannot negotiate a legislative agenda with the support of 75% of electorate, he is nothing but a wimp or worse.      A real democracy in the context of an Islamic Republic as outlined in the Constitution of Iran is practically impossible. It would be naive to bet on Khatami, as he showed in the last 4 years that he does not have the power to make fundamental changes.      Those who believe that achieving full political and social reforms in Iran will be a quick or indeed peaceful process should think again. The Islamic establishment will be backed all the way by conservative clerics the basij militia, the judiciary and ""families of Shohada""(war martyrs). They have dug-in deep within the country's power structure and they are not about to roll over for the reformists without a fight. Of course since they do not have a popular mandate they will be fighting back by abusing the power at their disposal rather than any due process. The key to Khatami's reform plans in the coming second term is the extent to which Ayatollah Khamenei would wish to be obstructive, without provoking mass unrest.      The people of Iran are not completely happy with Khatami, and they know that he is used as a puppet by the conservative right (Khamenei) as part of a public relation effort to cool people's emotions; but they still have no choice than to vote for him because he is the lesser of two evils. Until one day when a true leader can emerge, we must settle for Khatami, in hopes that he can temporarily alleviate people's burdens, and make small improvements. On June 9th everyone should vote for Khatami not because they want to support him, but to show the government that they dislike the regime, and want change!      What Mr. Khatami has initiated is the process of democratic evolution of governance in Iran. This process is new and will have its Iranian characteristics that are inherent in the historical, economical, and cultural identity of Iran. It is unrealistic and misleading to think that Iran will copy Sweden or say Canada in its progress toward democratic society. Unfortunately, some Iranians abroad are superficially fascinated with the environment they live in and want to see Iran from the West perspectives. This will not work.      The conservatives are inevitably losing their power. The only question is whether it is going to be peaceful or not. If it is not peaceful like the revolution in 1979 Iran like then will end up in anarchy and history has shown that no revolution (not even the French or Russian) has led to a democracy. The only way is to reform this system. People are simply tired of wars, revolutions and repression.      Mr. Khatami's so-called reforms is nothing more than a cosmetic makeover of an endemically corrupt and deteriorating system. While superficial social and cultural freedom is promoted by Mr. Khatami, Iran's economic infra- and super-structure, social coherence, and culture hegemony is crumbling due to extensive state mismanagement, corruption, and disregard to basic human values, let alone the rule of law. How can one talk about social and cultural freedom under a totalitarian system which is more than eager to brutally suppress the most basic human rights such as freedom of thought and expression. Mr. Khatami will most probably be elected for another term, but his tenure as the president, as well as the time of the Islamic Republic will undoubtedly remembered as one of the darkest eras in Iranian history.      How can you have reform and freedom within Islamic society? No matter who is elected.      To achieve true democracy, patience is necessary. Iranians need to learn democracy and that takes time. How can one expect to topple one regime, install another and have it be democratic? History has shown us that revolutions have good intentions but once a regime is installed through a revolution, it tends to become just as oppressive as the one it removed. It is a process. Unless people can learn to tolerate each other's views no democracy is achieved. Lets not forget that there are people within the system that support it. Denying their rights and voices is also undemocratic. Voting is the road to democracy.      The same reasons that caused the downfall of the Shah will hasten the decline of the hard-liners in the Islamic republic - arrogance, lack of foresight and increasing distance from the common man. It is bound to happen, sooner or later.      Even conservatives are focusing on national interests, not Islamic values. Is there a victory greater than this?      Yes, This is a legitimate right of our people and no one can stop this path. It may be interrupted temporarily, but it is progressing slowly but surely. We will see a new face of Iran in the near future with much more respect from the international community.      Yes, of course we have voted 4 years ago for Mr Khatami and his reformist programmes and we will vote for him on 8th June because we believe that the reform is the only way to build a democracy in Iran and at this time only Khatami can do this for us! and reformists will win because whole people want reform.      People in Iran have chosen to go with reform, no violence, no harsh reactions. I guess this is valuable and shows the will of people. They are just simply tired of extremism. Any soft spoken person, also honest, gets popular in Iran. This just shows that people are after reform and will get that because they mean it. I think they have got mature and do not intend to lose their lives for another politician to come and govern them. If they do not receive what they want, they just leave that country and do not go for any radical change. I believe reform will happen eventually but in a wise way.      It's an election, so individuals voice their views, but this has been taken out of context by the Western propaganda machinery as if there is a conflict in the making. The West needs to stop its demonic intrusion into other countries' affairs. I mean it! The Western vultures who through the centuries have enslaved humanity have the audacity to speak of fairness and human rights.      Of course Mr Khatami is not what the world needed to prove that a miracle is possible. We believe that no one can have a revolution in 4 years. So we don't care what the other parties or even the critics abroad say about our loyal president Mr Mohammad Khatami. We don't want to destroy what we earned after 8 years of war. So we want reforms but not in one night, not with war, but with a logical process. People are as enthusiastic as 4 years ago but in another way. On Saturday the 9th we will give a shock to the world and you will see the enthusiasm.      Better to try and then be disappointed than to sit back and do nothing. Khatami is the best choice for the moment. Let's give him our support.      Reform is not only possible but also inevitable. Having won an unexpected landslide victory on 2nd Khordad 1376 (4 years ago), Khatami has become the symbol of reform. Many will rightfully argue that Khatami has not done enough and has never taken any major step towards liberalizing Iran. However, the truth is that, under President Mohammad Khatami, Iran has witnessed many changes within the last 4 years. Writers began to openly criticise the Ministry of Information and accused its leaders of being behind a series of killings. Many newspapers emerged day after day criticizing the 'mohafeze karan' or conservative faction. Today Iran's parliament is demanding more rights for political prisoners and some clerics have started to openly re-consider the powers and position of the Valihe-Faqih (Supreme Leader).      Today in the election campaign even the so-called conservatives are talking about relations with the US and more rights for women. In the last few months conservatives have used all their power to stop this trend. They closed down dozens of newspapers, closed over 400 Internet cafes and arrested many opposition politicians. Further arrests will follow and the conservatives are certainly going to show a tougher line as they are realizing that reform is inevitable with or without Khatami.      I think Khatami has done a good job so far and he is the only one which seems ideal for presidency. His mission has proven difficult but good chance to make a difference at this stage of their history. Revolutionary behaviour (what happened 20 years ago, going to the streets and breaking windows etc.) proved a failure. I think hard-liners have realised that they stand no chance with people anymore. I think everyone who wants to avoid disaster happening again and wants a smooth transition should support Khatami.      Khatami is the best choice for the new generation of Iranians. He will lead the new generation into changes. The older generations are tired of wars and revolutions. The young are the uprising and voice of our nation. They will renew Iran and the world. Khatami wants to give us the young the opportunity of uniting and crushing the blood sucking mullahs in Iran.      My dear compatriots from abroad have commented that reform within the Islamic system is impossible. They may be right, but they have neglected one reality. If we had numerous choices then we could choose the best. But we only have one choice and that is reform. The most important fact is not the possibility of reform, it is the inevitable condition of reform as the unique way toward democracy. Please understand it.      The events of the past few years clearly show that the Iranian people are desperate for reform and a more liberal atmosphere. The vehemence with which the hardliners have reacted to this trend shows the extent to which they feel under threat. Khatemi will probably be unable to deliver, and even if he had a free hand, it would be too little. But eventually Iran will change and the pressure from the populace will be too great to ignore. It may take another decade or two, but we're talking about a nation that has survived for thousands of years!      I am exceedingly sorry for those individuals who believe that Mr. Khatami's first term was ineffective for Iran. Four years ago, Khatami being elected as the President of Iran, was not only an election for a new president, but Khatami's presidency was a reform, transformation, renovation, a defining moment, a memorable term for Iran's history and society that will not be forgotten anytime soon. I live in the United States, although I visit Iran at least once a year and the improvements and changes that I have seen in the last few years have simply amazed and astonished me.      Khatami may not have the right qualifications and education for being the president of one the greatest nations, though I do not see any one else at this time who could perhaps do a better job. I believe it is simply not fair to say that he has not done anything for our country. He is a reformist and his ideas and diplomacy are a commencement and foundation for democracy, egalitarianism, equality, peace, independent, union, and finally freedom in Iran.      Reform is possible only through revolution. The majority of the population does not remember the Shah. But they do know they are being suppressed and they see the stringent limits of their freedoms. And the people see the harshness and cruelty of their situation. Even if Khatami is re-elected, he will not be able to control the advancing paranoia of the real ruling party and the individuals who are striving to achieve the same freedoms they see in the West. I just hope that when the tornado of street protests hit Tehran, it will be so overwhelming, that few people will lose their lives during the transformation.      True reform is not possible in Iran under the current regime. Even if Khatami wins, he will only be allowed to give what the hardliners will allow him. A few breadcrumbs to buy them time while they plunder Iranian wealth into their Swiss and Luxembourg bank accounts.      The only way the Iranian people can have their freedom back is by evicting the current bankrupt regime. This can be done by culminating in a national referendum, beyond this system, and with international supervision, as a means to guarantee freedom and self-determination for the people of Iran. The current ""religious"" leaders are morally bankrupt and need to be removed in order for Iranians to enjoy what most democratic nations have. Freedom and not reform.      Reform will not come about over night and it will take time. Iranians in Iran and any part of the world should be patient as it is extremely hard to loosen up the paws and teeth of a power hungry group that has held Iranian society hostage for sixteen years until Khatami was chosen. We all know that the religious hard-liners will not let go easy, and since nothing matters to them except power, they will resort to any action to slow down the reform process. In the history of the mankind no democracy has been achieved without blows or setbacks, and the greatest democracies in the world did not come about easily.      Mr Khatami is not there for the reform, he is being introduced to the system just to extend the life of the regime and avoid an early collapse of the Islamic government. It is important to understand and remember the fact that if Mr. Khatami or anyone else was really about to deliver reform or bring about any danger to the (so-called) conservatives, he wouldn't have been qualified to be a candidate for presidency.      There is no such thing as Liberals or Conservatives in Iran and if there are some personal differences it's not really about different political groups. Both groups are actually one with just slight differences to their outward face, and that is just to grant legitimacy to the (Islamic) regime of Iran and just to show a more liberal face of the regime to push forward big contacts and projects with other countries so the regime can survive. Reform is not possible under Mr. Khatami or anyone in this system.      The real point everybody is missing here is that we are not talking about a person whoever he or she could be! Iranians must learn, believe and feel that they are the ones who are in charge.      A good reformation needs ingredients other than the election of one man.      We will eventually see a mass uprising in Iran, we can't avoid it. Let's face it, whether we like it or not, the people will stand up for their rights. We want the same rights as the average European. Why should the Iranian people's wishes for democracy be ignored? We don't want Islamic democracy, we want secular democracy like the rest of the world. And that Khatami can't deliver. May the winds of freedom reach Iran      Yes, of course. We voted four years ago for Mr. Khatami and his reformist programmes and we will vote for him on 8th June because we believe that the reform is the only way to build a democracy in Iran and at this time only Khatami can do this for us. The reformists will win because all the people want reform.      Mr. Khatami has proven that reform in this system is impossible and people going to the polling stations are not voting for reform and Khatami, but instead granting further legitimacy to a system where the electorate are at the bottom of the political system, and the ultimate voice rests not with the people, but with one individual that is no different than a monarch. Khatami has been effective, but his inability to deliver reform has placed the movement in a deadlock, and another four years will result in even more disappointment for people with the reform movement and activists.      Is reform possible in Iran? Yes, but the question should be, ""is reform possible under the present establishment?"" Then the answer will be no. Mr Khatami has talked of reforms repeatedly, but is yet to show any real signs of it in present day Iran. As he stands for a second term in office, he is yet to define clear-cut plans, for the economy of Iran, let alone reforms.      In the last 4 years economically not only things have not improved, but have taken a turn for the worse. The number of unemployed has risen and the young people are more determined to migrate out of the country, as they see no hope for the future. Mr Khatami says that so far he has been unable to go ahead with his plans, and has hinted that, this is because of the right-wing establishment. If he is to be taken at his word, then it is clearly time for him to stand down, and make it clear to people why he is doing so. If he thinks that the mode of the right wing establishment has changed and he can make a difference in a second term then he needs to make it clear, what those changes are.      On my part, I am inclined to think that for as long as a Supreme leader exists in Iran, real reform cannot be achieved, but if Mr Khatami and his supporters think otherwise, then they need to lay down a clear cut plan and explain it to the electorate. At this moment in time, many people will vote for Khatami because they see him as the lesser of the two evils, for me that is not a choice at all.      Of course reform is possible in Iran - it is in fact inevitable. If the powers that be try to stop liberalisation of the government and the religion then the place will explode and it will happen anyway. There is too big a differential between Iran and the rest of the world even though some neighbouring states are similarly retrogressive.      The elections are a game that the Iranian government is playing. We need to throw these Mullahs out of our country and send them back to washing carpets. "
HOC HOC-LQ -0.0199999999999999 " Having lived on the County Down coast for twenty years, power cuts were quite common mostly due to stormy weather so we always had a few candles or Tilley Lamps set aside for the occasion. Be prepared for the expected. Here in Canada the 'expected' means owning a snow shovel, burying water pipes twelve feet down and having a block heater on your car etc. The unexpected is always going to play havoc. The ice storm in Quebec caused power loss for several months for some people. Don't blame NIE.      I'm not criticising the efforts of the maintenance crews - rather I'm praising their dedication to patching up what is pretty obviously a network hopelessly lacking robusticity and resilience. How come telecoms companies can keep power flowing to business and household phones, and yet those whose supposed speciality this is cannot do so.      One answer, Keith - IN IT FOR THE MONEY!!! The only ones who actually CARE are the linesmen on the ground.      Regarding Keith's point, telecoms companies convey low-power signals which are far easier to handle than the heavy electrical loads of power transmission. Sadly, it's the old trade-off between price and reliability, as underground cables are five times the cost of overhead power systems.      Yet again Northern Ireland people think about no one but themselves. They don't think about the EMPLOYEES at the other end of the phone who have to listen to the grief that people give to them. We pay bills to keep a good service, and at the end of the day we can not blame an individual or an organisation for these problems. After all, anything made by man can be broken by man AND nature. At the end of the day we could be worse off and have no roads or electricity. I think we should be thankful for what we have, and in times with power remember those in worse off countries.      For a country that encounters bad weather on a frequent basis, problems always seem to arise! - Will the services ever be adequately prepared?      Maybe if people actually had to deal with the rantings of people on the phone they might be more understanding. As for the money you are right. Over here at the first sign of a problem the second question always is ""Will I be compensated?""      It doesn't make sense for us to be prepared for any possible weather conditions, it's all about balance of risks. Sooner or later despite our arrogance we will learn that man against nature isn't going to work and that we need to work with it not against it. It says a lot about how complicated our lives are that we can't survive without electricity for a day.      Welcome to the real world. I can only remember one big snowfall back in the 60's when we were snowed in for a week! I chose to come to Canada to live in the early 70's, and there is not much point grumbling about the snow and ice. You could say I am biased, working for a cable manufacturer, but here we put the hydro lines underground in and around the cities. So we don't get blackouts too often. Maybe when the system was revamped in NI, consideration should have been given to putting the electricity lines underground. It is more expensive initially to replace an overhead line with an underground line, but over the life span of the cable it more than makes up on this expense. Also, utilities in north America have massive tree pruning budgets and fulltime crews for cutting back branches and limbs away from power lines in the countryside.      I won't criticise Northern Ireland Electricity for the power losses - we cannot expect daily life to go on as normal under extreme weather conditions. And their laudable engineers did get the power on again fairly quickly, despite the atrocious weather. However, I am not at all impressed by NIE's call centre. I was sent a special ""winter information"" pack a few months ago with a phone number to ring if the power goes off. When I rang it, I only got an unhelpful recorded message and was unable to find out any information about the extent of the power cuts or when we might expect to be reconnected. What happened to the big investment in NIE's call centres?      We lost power in our house (near Larne) in the middle of Monday night and it was restored at 11.00 on Tuesday morning. Yes, it was freezing cold in the house and it was pretty inconvenient, but I think we have to expect these things when we have unusual weather conditions. Nobody can expect NIE to employ extra staff and resources above normal requirements, just in case we have a storm, and I was certainly impressed with how quickly they sorted out our problems. "
JOC JOC-15B-18N 0.96 "I feel there have ever been few opportunities to speak with my friends in English because I still cannot speak clearly and smoothly and it spend much time on changing what I want to become to tell my listener into English. But I want to tell you my feeling or opinion in English. So I will practice speaking English frequently.  I regret that there were a lot of points which pronunciation was awkward and that I couldn't respond appropriate comments to partners and return good words. Good points were that I could answer smoothly to the questions about the news thanks to reading the contents of the news carefully in advance.  I listened to every records I made in this semester. I think some of them are bad, but some of them have improved since the last semester. It is so hard to express what you really think in English and I know I have to practice a lot more. It will be necessary to be able to speak English when you are in the multinational firm. I think I need to study more and more to become what I want to be.  When I listen my recording, I felt that I am not good at English. It is difficult for me to express my feeling immediately. I tend to make proper English sentence.  I feel that I want to improve my English speaking skills. Especially, I want to speak English better pronunciation like native speaker. And, I have to learn more words that I don't know because I could not speak good sentences in English. I could not make words on the scene.  Opportunity hearing speaking of own English is rarely. After I tried actually listening, I thought my pronunciation and intonation were not very well. My speaking of English was like Japanese. I thought that it is not understood absolutely when I speak a native speaker of English. In addition, in spite of being some that I want to say, I did not come up with the word many times. So, conversation was not very well. I thought that it was important to replace my opinion with easy words.  I think that this listening system is very good system, because, I can become speaking english and hearing english. And, I can communicate other people, so we could make many friends. Sometimes, I feel heavy, but this lesson is important for me. I did not like English, but now I like English. Next year, I hope class like this class.  I think my speaking has improved since last semester. In this semester, I had more chance to express my opinions in English because I wanted to improve my pronunciation. As a result, I came to have confidence when I spoke English. What was more, it was very interesting to exchange the article which students choose each other. I am happy to have many opportunities to discuss with my friends.  I think my speaking wasn't smooth. I don't have the ability to speak with many words. I should memorize English words. I want to speak about my opinion smoothly.  I think, I could not speak in English well. However, what I can get the opportunity to talk with my friend in English is so useful to me. So, I'd like to improve my speaking skill more. In addition, I should have more information about the news in the world.  I thought that my pronunciation is hard to listening, and I should speak a little more slowly.  When I listened my recordings, I found that my English did not improve. I thought that I was poor at communicating with my partner. It was difficult for me to tell my opinion.  I think it's very fine for me about this recording system. Because it will be very good review to hear my recording. My English was not smooth at all.  This recording system is very good. There are two good points. First of all, this system can communicate my class mate. This system is very interesting because I don't know that who speak with me. However the conversation is very fun. I think that I was able to make friends. Next good point is that I can listen to my English. I can found improvement points. My English is difficult to hear. I should speak more slowly. This is my first time to listen to my English. I want to talk more slowly from now on because partner easy to listen to my English.  This recordings made my progress in speaking English. Until taking this class, I didn't have opportunities to listen my English afterwards. I would like to continue to practice speaking English.  I think that my speaking competence now gets better than that of spring semester. In this semester, we have chance to express our own opinions on our interested news. The chance made my speaking competence better. And I could know more news stories in this semester. I would like to make full use of my speaking competence some day.  I think that my a pronunciation is bad. My partner speaks English clearly. But I feel I can speak English more smoothly than at first. I try to do my best to improve my pronunciation continually! It was difficult for me to have a natural conversation with my friends in English. I learned that the natural conversation is not only repeating the questions and answers that are decided or reading the things we have written on our papers. I hope I will be able to speak more naturally. I also think it is necessary to ask when I do not understand.  I think recording system is very beneficial to improve my English. I can replay and confirm my speaking, so I can check the point that I should better.  When I listen my recordings, I think I must improve English skill more. This is not only speaking but writing and reading because one of reason is my speaking stopped on the way. I reconsidered learn it once again at first.  I never used Japanese words in all conversations. However I found that I'm not good at translating my opinion from Japanese to English quickly. It may be very difficult for everyone, but I want to speak more smoothly. I need more practice and want to expand my vocabulary.  Thank you for this record, I can listen to conversation and pronunciation objectivity. I tried to have a natural conversation, but I could not do it better than I thought. I feel that I have to improve English skills and I should always think about why I have the opinions.  Before this class, I have never heard my pronunciation in English.

I felt that some conversations were better than spring semester. However, other conversations were not good and it could be better. I regret I could not tell my opinion well because it was difficult to collect my thoughts.  After listening my records, I felt how my English is not fluently. Also, I noticed that I have used Japanese for several times. Some of my friends are really good at speaking. I will try to practice speaking it in order to be able to be a good speaker. Thank you for the class for one year. "
JOC JOC-12A-04N 0.74 "I was very impressed by this story. Even if she got to be able to walk by the support of the ""ReWalk suit"", it must be hard for her to complete a long-distance marathon. she could walked about only two miles a day, and it took 16 days to finish the marathon. If I were in her position, I could not keep running. Although she could not receive the official medal, she must be very happy to get the special medals which a dozen of other runners made.  I received impression in this tale. Her challenge is very amazing and I respect her challenge spirit. If I am same position as her I will be discouraged. so I think she is amazing. And I think surrounding support is important for her challenge. For the reason, it was able to obtain the medal which is not formal as for her Same as ID12063, I was very impressed by this story. To tell the truth, first of all, I felt the marvelous ability of the bionic suit. This ReWalk suit could prove that enable paralyzed people to walk himself/herself publicly. I thought that the stuff of the company that designed the suit had been enthusiastic about their works and done everything in their power for paralyzed people. I want to praise them. Also, I noticed Claire Lomas's great perseverance. As ID12063's opinion, Even if she got the suit, he must have made an effort and keep doing hard work for a long time. At this time she could not receive a medal. I think it is natural. However she should be considered to be one of the runners who could reach the goal. We ought to give her and her family a big hand.  and their family.  After reading this story, it made my heart warm because Lomas never gave up during the race and when she finishes her 26.2 mile marathon, other runners in the race gave their own medals which i think they were also cheering her to finish. and also i was impressed on advance in science that we know today. this story realize me how enormous technology is and technologies are upgrading every seconds and it is making our life affluent.  As ID12063 and ID12054 say, this news impressed me deeply. Her efforts and hardships must have been beyond my imagination until she completed the marathon course. I respect her efforts and achievement. I realized again that it was important to do it without giving up until I finish. In the future I hope that bionic suit will spread in the world and the people paralyzed below the waist will be able to walk as technology develops and bionic suit becomes cheaper.  I have three impression things in this story. First, Wearing bionic ReWalk suit enabled Claire Lomas to complete the 26.2 miles. I felt her will was very strong. Second, a dozen other runners in the race have given her their own medals in recognition of her achievement. I think that they would really look up to her in a way which she was trying without being discouraged by adversity. Finally, she raised more than yen 11 million for a charity which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. I think that since she had many support, she would repay to the handicapped.  When I read this article, I'm surprised that she decided to run long-distance marathon even though she became paralyzed. Most of all, I'm impressed by her toughness to accomplish the goal. I think this achievement will help other paralyzed people not to lose their hope.  As many students said, I was impressed and surprised by reading this story. I can't imagine how hard she tried to walk everyday. It must be very difficult time, however, she bore her hardship! She made it and succeeded in her life! I respect her. I think I am not able to try hard like her. I expect I should have desire to improve myself :) I was astonished at her patience and effort. She continually went on walking for no less than 16 days! It's quite true her bionic ReWalk suit made it possible for her to move her paralyzed leg more smoothly. However, more important factors in her achievement are her strong belief in overcoming the physical disability and her families' cheer. As she said, she sometimes worried whether she could finish the marathon, but she continued practicing little by little, encouraged by her families. Without these two factors, she couldn't have completed it. The disabled will be encouraged by her achievement.  I was impressed by this story. I guess it was hard to complete a marathon in a bionic suit but she did it. I think many people have encouraged by her.  I was happy after reading this article. It is recently said that science technology damage the Earth and threaten our life. It is also said that only think about convenient. However, science technology can help us such as Lomas. I think science technology will developed more convenient to us.  This story impressed me. I hope these technology will develop for handicapped person.  Re Walk suit was very useful to complete the marathon. However, I think her emotional strength was greater. If I were her, I gave up to run to the last. I learned the importance of challenging through this text.  I was very moved by this story. I can't imagine how hard she made efforts. But I can understand this challenge was very difficult to overcome. I wish that this success encourage other people who have handicaps. I was also surprised at science and technology. We can't live without it now. I hope technology develops and makes our lives more and more comfortable.  When I read this article, I was impressed about the bionic suit. There are many people who have handicap in the world. Because of some handicap, handicapped people have to give up normal life style. However, they also have rights to spend normal life like us. Thanks to this bionic suit, I think many handicapped people's dream will come true. I hope technology of bionic suits will develop as soon as possible.  This news so impressed me. This British woman's effort is beyond my imagination. Marathon is not easy for a person with a healthy body. With her handicap, she puled it off. Her action is worthy of praise. And, I also be moved new technology. I hope developing of science save all of paralyzed people .  In my opinion, the woman's success is greatly owing to her strong will. To be sure, she couldn't so much as entering this competition without ReWalk suit. But, no non-handicapped person could succeed in finishing the race only because of his/her normal body. It is ones will that leads to the person's accomplishment. So, the suit only helped her coming up alongside of other people without any disability.  I have read another article like this. A handicapped person is likely to contribute, make a fund which help people get over the difficulty. I think this is good! Having read this article, I was so impressed with it. I think people in this society should learn how to make great efforts from the runner. And she taught us that you can do anything if you try or challenge hard. Regarding the bionic suit helped the runner finish the marathon, I was very amazed by the fact the technology has actually grown this far. So, I look forward to that recent technology will keep growing and give people a hope.  I was pretty impressed by this article. I thought Technology could make an impossibility to be a possibility. This article is not only about the Technology but also about the Human Spirit. If she was not Lomas, or she didn't have the physical handicap, she wouldn't make efforts and be attracted our attention. Having handicap is not good, but she could succeed with it. Therefore paralysis had her to do well. I praise her courage and toughness I am impressed with this article. I feel Claire Lomas has a tough spirit. Of course, if there wasn't a bionic suit, she couldn't complete a marathon. But, I think that we need skills and a courage to complete a marathon. So, I feel that we have to have strength of mental and skills to attain a great thing. I want to be a strong man. And I don't want to give up if I face troubles like Claire Lomas.  I was surprised at and impressed by her efforts and strength. If I were her, I would only be sad about my handicap. However, she didn't so. She didn't lose her handicap, and she rather overcame it with her unimagined efforts. I think she would encourage many people who have handicap. I also think the bionic suit which helped her success is wonderful. I hope this suit will help more handicapped people to lead better lives.  I want to celebrate her achievement and also want to put emphasis on Amit Goffer's accomplishment. I hope that more technology for goods for the people like her will be developed. For that, people who study the technology should be supported by nations or groups like NPO. Especially, I heard that many Japanese researchers have abilities to develop the technology like this. We should support them. Also, we have to think about people who need goods but can't buy them because of the luck of the money.  I was amazed to see this article. Claire Lomas completed a full marathon although she has a tough handicap. I strongly appreciate and admire her great efforts and feat. I'm not one of the disabled but I cannot do such a thing. I think the technical innovations we didn't realize around 10 years ago made her wish come true. And I suppose she could not had got over her obstacles without many supports of her family, her husband Dan and their daughter Maisie, and her parents and this her great achievement will surely encourage the disabled all over the world.  I was so impressed with this article. I think it was not easy for everyone to complete. The strength of her spirit is so inscrutable. The more technologies improve, the more we forget importance of effort to achieve something. Also, her great achievement didn't consist of only fine technology, ReWalk suit. I think this news encourages everyone, including non-handicapped people and handicapped people.  I was encouraged by reading this news. I think everyone who read this news were encouraged too. Clair Lomas, who had disadvantages of becoming paralyzed, completed a marathon because of a bionic suit but I think that is not the only reason why she made it. She could not have crossed the goal line without helps of her family, her husband and their 13-month-old daughter Maisie, and her parents. What we can learn from this is that you can overcome predicaments if there are emotional mainstays you get from someone very close to you. Also, I was very impressed by her charity work which funds research to develop treatments for paralysis caused by a broken back or neck. She did not satisfied just with extending her possibility, but she is also trying to open up more possibilities for those people who are suffering from the same situations as she had. Maybe, we have to not only focusing on a bionic suit but also on the importance of relationships between human beings, when reading this news. Do not forget that ""what you cannot overcome by yourself can overcome with the help of each other"".  I was moved by this article. I thought she was so brave to have made a decision to attend such a hard sports like marathon instead of her difficulty. I think I can't do the same thing if I were her. Her guts was really great. And, because her husband, daughter and parents cheered her everyday, she could continue the hard exercise and success like this. I guess. Well, I want to be like Lomas. I want to success like her no matter how horrible adversity I will be faced to.  Whose success is the example like this? I think it is a human power. Of course, the person helped by technology strived very much. And the technology was invented by the people who want to help another people. Many technology successes were not technology's successes but human's successes.  I was very impressed about this story. If I were her, I would have give up running marathon. so I think she is very tough!!! When her husband was married her, he did not mind her handicap. He is very nice guy.  After reading this article, I made two remarks. First, I suppose it's important to have strong spirit and make an effort. If I lost my legs, I would give up even walking. In this case, though Lomas put on a bionic suit, continuous effort probably made her success, I think. Second, being supporters encourage people who work hard to do something. For me, parents and friends often cheer up when I feel sadness or stress, so I want to be a good supporter for someone at one time.  This article is moved me. I think that Claire Lomas has a firm belief. But in the world, however strong belief she has, there is a thing which she cannot do by herself. I think that there are three reasons why she could complete a marathon. Of course, first reason is that she made efforts to run the marathon. Second reason is due to bionic suit. Third reason, this is the most important reason, is that her family supported her. Probably, if she practice running a marathon alone, she may give up. But she achieve reaching a goal because her husband and her daughter continued to cheered up her. I strongly believe that there is a close bond of family. Furthermore, I think that we should try to develop links of the charity which support people with a disability and people who became paralyzed. It is possible for us to become paralyzed or have disability by accidents. However, someone who became paralyzed can enjoy sports by using advanced technology like bionic Re walk suit. But it cost them a lot of money to use advanced technology. So we need to increase the number of supporters who participate in charities for them.  Since I have an uncle who have trouble walking due to polio, I was deeply impressed by this news. I also heard of achievement in the study of artificial sight. This kind of achievement will be light of hope for handicapped people.  In this story, we can see not only an achievement of a paralyzed British woman, but also the development in science and technology. I think these technologies will help more and more people in the future. New scientific developments may be changing the world. But encouragement from others is also important. I think no matter how well-developed science and technology, the importance of the ties that bind people will not change.  I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity. she I was impressed by this article, and I admired her success. It is not easy to decide to run 42.2 kilometers though she is paralyzed. This achievement taught that importance of having ambition and making an effort to us.  I was very surprised when I read this news. Even though the body was crippled in an accident, I was very surprised that she ran 42 kilometers. I have not finished the marathon. I would like to finish a marathon someday.  Scientific techniques enables us things like we have never thought. A paralyzed person completed marathon. This is really amazing. To raise the convenience is of course, to bring out the dreamer in men is a part of scientific techniques too.  I was so impressed with her patience. If I were Claire Lomas, I would give up running a marathon. She didn't give up because people around her welcomed her from the bottom of their heart. I want to run a marathon someday, too.  I was so impressed by this article, too. And I thought her achievement was supported by not only the technology but her strong spirit and cooperation between her and people around her. So this is why this article attract many people, I think.  This article was surprising for me. I could not believe the first. . . but, this is the fact. I can't imagine her despair when she know that she can't walk by herself. However, she never gave up and walk and walk. . . in the end, she was able to achieve!! I was moved this story.  I think that the woman cheer people who has handicap. Scientific techniques enables us to do things like we have never thought. I want the handicapped not to give up anything because of their handicap.  I was very impressed to hear the news. And I received courage and felt a weight has been taken off my mind. Because one reason is that a handicapped person such as Lomas taught us importance of effort and never giving up. The other reason is that science is of use. It is often said that science technology damage the earth and our life. I hope that science technology is good for us.  I was very impressed after hearing this news. She completed the 42.195km course even she had difficulty in working. I understand that the bionic suit was good, but her heart was strong therefore I was so impressed. I tried half-marathon in April but after the marathon I thought that it is hard to finish the full marathon because I was so tired. I understand how hard the marathon is, so I think that what she did is wonderful.  I was extremely impressed by the story and also encouraged by what Claire has done. She has achieved such a great work in marathon not just because she was wearing a high-technology bionic suit, but also because she had her mind very set and tried amazingly hard. If I were running in the same race as her, I would have given her a big hug and told her that she should be very proud of herself. Also, it made me happy to know that other runners gave their medals to Claire for her great job. They probably felt the same way as me.  I was moved by hearing this news. Technology that helped her was very great. Nowadays, many people were bothered by physically handicap. So this bionic suits can help such a person. If many handicapped persons are helped by technology, the world will be better place. I heartily hope such a future made by technology.  This comment shows how great Claire is. I agree with this comment because I also think that her achievement is not only due to the bionic suit. Her continuous efforts made it possible. This comment is very understandable so I chose this.  when I was read this news, I was very impressed and surprised. I absolutely impossible for me to complete a marathon in the body paralyzed. If I were her, I would have given up. I think that they were encouraged when people of the same situation with her was heard this news. I want to develop more bionic suit.  For me, the article is impressive because the technology is used in a good way. I think technology is extension of human body. Thanks to high technology, human did a lot of achievement. This story is obvious example of that kind of achievement. These days, invention of high technology is always controversial thing among people. But I think technology is neutrality thing. People should not impede invent technology. But I argue applying of invented technology must discussion by people democratically.  I think ReWalk suit is very good thing! Because I think paralyzed people are helped by ReWalk suit, also ReWalk suit bring the joy of walking for paralyzed people.  I was very impressed by this story. She ran marathon even she had difficulty in walking, it's so unbelievable and admirable. I belong to track&field club in Keio university, so I respect her spirit. And the development of technology is also surprising. ReWalk suit is hilarious thing, and it's very useful for disabled people.  The development of technology sometimes cause bad effects like environmental pollution, but this news is a good example. The achievement of a woman with bionic suit makes a big hope for many people. I wish many more technologies will make our life much more comfortable.  I was happy to hear the news as the technology made it possible to do a thing that had been thought to be impossible. I've heard a phrase as following: things that human can imagine are the things that can be realized. I do not remember whose wise it is, but I realized it true.  I think Technology is important.  I also think if I were in her position, I gave up running. So her spirit was very tough! She received more important something than she could not receive the official medal.  Not only the high technology but also her patient spirit enables her to complete the marathon. I wanted to praise her brave figure.  I was very impressed by this story too. The bionic suit enable the handicapped to walk freely. What a hopeful suit it is!! However, as ID12054 said, if it had not been for their perseverance, they couldn't use the bionic suits.  I was impressed this news. The strength of the woman's will and the help of her family are very beautiful. I hope the society changed into more comfortable place for handicapped people.  I think evolution of medicine is amazing.  When I read this article I was impressed by Claire's family ties and encouraged by what she have achieved. She is loved by her family. I felt that their love and cheering for her encouraged her. That is why, I think, she can have made a decision to attend such a hard marathon and have achieved. And the story inspired me to greater effect.  I was deeply moved by this story. Claire Lomas completed a marathon in a bionic suit as she crossed the finishing line in London on Tuesday 16 days after the race began. Although she has a physical disability. If I had been her, l would have given up the marathon. She deserves to get a medal from other players. I thought she would have a heart strong enough to overcome adversity.  I was deeply moved by this story. She never gave up. It is hard for a person with a normal too to run a marathon. she achieved this without being discouraged by adversity.  I agree with her comment about a woman's marathon with bionic suit in Britain. This news made me happy like her and encourage that if I'll do things without giving up, any dream comes true. Also, I was surprised about bionic suit because I didn't know about it until I read this article. There are still many patients that want this new technology in the world. I hope this technology will help all people and everyone can make their dreams come true.  Since moving paralyzed body is very painful, although she complete a marathon with putting on a bionic suit, her try deserves to be praised. By the way, after reading this article, I wondered normal people putting on this suit. Since this ReWalk suit can mimic the response of whereas's joints, it would be a great energy to move. At once, I had became to want to wear a bionic suit too.  Her strong will that she didn't want to lose her disability made her run. And I thought she got a great sense of achievement. At the same time, a lot of people with a disability cheered up. Thanks to the progress of technology, she could try this race. Technology sometimes makes us happy.  At first I was surprised to hear this news and a little moved. And the thing that she could run to the goal is so nice for her cuz she wanted to run again. But at the same time, I'm a little scared. For, we human come to make everything we want and that means we can use something we made in order to pursue some bad things.  I really impressed by this story. I could felt people can anything if thy have a passion. The sadness being paralysis is huge I guess. She got over the sadness and trying to encourage other paralysis people. This action can be honor. I wish i have same passion to going school.  I agree with his comment because it is similar to what I wrote on the article. I was very impressed by this news. Although the British woman had difficulty in walking, she completed a long marathon(42.195km). His comment said that he could not keep running if he were in her position. This is what I thought exactly. She did it because she had a strong heart. In the future, I will try the marathon but I need to have strong heart like hers.  Although she was not rewarded with a medal, I think it was heart-warming that she made it to the end with the bionic suit. In future, I hope this bionic suit will become much cheaper so more people who are physically challenged will be able to use it in their daily lives.  I had pretty much the same impression and I was also moved by the fact that she made it to the end.  I thought this is really nice and heart warming news. But I also have other thoughts for this kind of news. I've heard of the news that man who has a artificial leg will participate in a Olympic because of his great performance at the last two Paralympics. When I first heard this news , I thought this is really nice news just like I read the news about British woman who run marathon in a bionic suit. But then I start to worry about the fairness. Maybe waring more expensive suite can make the runner run faster. Or maybe some player would feel unfairness to people wearing those things. But I'm sure that player wont be able to say so because it sounds immoral. I think it is really nice thing to give chance to handicapped people but I also think that this is not that simple problem.

JOC JOC-12B-09N 0.0399999999999998 "JT006 17, 2012 - 03:10am JST The Japanese people who voted for the LDP and Ishihara are living in cloud cuckoo land. Back to the bad old days of patriotic education, visits to Yasukini, changing the Constitution, building more airports in the middle of nowhere, denying The Rape of Nanjing, teachers being forced to salute the Hinomaru and stand for the Kimigayo, maybe even the return of the Thought Police? Japan getting the nuclear bomb. yes, a great day for old Japan. The beginning of the end. I think this comment is quite radical. I want to vote for PLD, but I do not have right to vote. I do not want to go back to the time like WW2. But Japan must power up military power in order to compete with China and North Korea. This general election is last chance to save this country. This comment is irrelevance.  I am totally agree with opinion of JT010. Even result of Japanese election had expected, I was quite surprised about the news that LDP - which overlooked 3.11disaster- won the election. Many intellectuals of Japan and another country expected Japan will have a big change because of 3.11 disaster. And actually, there was a change in Japanese society like democratic action. Even though That kind of democratic action is usual in another country, I cannot say that is little change of Japan. Compare with before, there was big change in Japanese society indeed. But what I want to say is, Japanese civilization could not make meaningful change. In democratic society, Only result of election have meaning. And I think this situation - Japanese citizen could not make their political will as a result of election- is crisis of Japanese democracy. An addition, Japanese should think about another country which damaged by radioactive gushed in Atomic generation of Fukushima. Damaged by radioactive is not only problem of Japanese. That is also harmful for neighbor countries of Japan. Finally, I think it is the time that Japanese should think about relation with another countries. Japan cannot get along with other asian countries with arrogant policy of LDP SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49pm JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). This comment shows the result of this election briefly. I guess many voters consider that DPJ was bad, it is natural for DPJ to lose. But they don't think that LDP is good, though they voted for LDP, and LDP won. Many voters still have negative image for LDP, but there is no other choice but to vote for LDP. The result was not welcomed. Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one.  I agree with ID12025. I think many voters didn't have any party which they want to support. The didn'T have any choice about voting, so they couldn't be helped to vote to LDP. I became 20th years old in this year, so I went to vote at the first time yesterday. I didn't have any interesting about Japanese government before, but now, I entered as an ""adult"" and I tried to watch News about voting or listen parties' speech. As Japanese, we should have more attention to Japanese government and change the bad economy as soon as possible with LDP.  JimizoDec. 17, 2012 - 12:18am JST An abject failure the first time around and then leads his party to a landslide victory in a choice between losers, nutcases and non-entities. I suppose someone had to win. I disagree this issue.  All of the Parties including the Liberal Democratic Party are classified in losers, nutcases and non-entities and all of them don't think about Japan. I think The Liberal Democratic Party is the Party which is not wanted to win but have to win.  Nathaw Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33am JST Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with Nathaw. Abe's economic policy is excessively drastic. Other than spending so much money on public enterprises, he also plants to revise the law of Bank of Japan in order to boost economic growth. Such a policy can rather give bad effect on Japanese economy by causing awful inflation. The law plays an important role in preventing extreme inflation by inhibiting the central bank from buying the government bonds directly from the government. If the central bank is allowed to issue limitless amount of money and compelled to buy government bonds, extravagant finance is also accelerated. The more finance deficit is accumulated, the worse inflation gets, results in default. So, even if this policy gives good effect on Japanese economy by leading inflation, the benefit is temporary. Instead, it can do harm to the economy. He should aware that there is enormous demerit in the economic policy.  I agree with ID12025. Comments and article itself shows that people are not accepting LDP, but because they don't want to vote to DPJ. There are people who oppose LDP in the comments. However, exclude China and Korea, many Asia countries and United States praise the election of LDP. To Asian countries, they fear China and Korea's rapid military expansion. LDP announce that they would create Self-Defense Force, that could collective defense with allies where Japan is not directly related. To Asian countries, Japan's military expansion are something helpful for them. To Unites States, once officer told that it's used to be said that elect of LDP would make Japan right-wing, but actually Japan used to be left-wing, and elect of LDP would make it neutral. As my opinion, I'm somewhat worried about Abe's Economic Policy. I think it's too optimistic. Many experts said that his policy would boost inflation. Japan's economy is not stable even now. To make such a big action would collapse everything. Also, it's not only about LDP nor DPJ, I want Prime Minister to complete at least their first term as Prime Minister. I think too many changes of Prime Minister and their policy made Economic worse. Economy used to be unstable and rapid change of policy are ruining Economy.  Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later.  JT004 17, 2012 - 08:14am JST Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought. I agree with this opinion. I was not so interested in this election, either. Especially this is caused by that neither interest nor expectation has a young man in the latest politics. Therefore, I think that this voter turnout is the somewhat higher one. In order to raise, future politics needs to be substantial.  Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27am JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion. I think a change of the party in power does not make a change for society. But, I cannot understand people who do not go to the election by this reason. Certainly, it may not make any change. But, we should not reconcile the government because I think this act connects an indifferent to the government. So, we should make use of suffrage.  I'm really happy that LDP got back the politic power again. Among this 3 years Japan got weak. I hope that Mr. Abe will change Japan. Some people mention that president change is a bad thing . In my opinion, I don't care. Because Japan is different from other country, there is an emperor in the middle. Although, I was worried that when the political power was in the DPJ. Because they don't care about the emperor. I think the mass media is horrible in Japan. The mass media has brainwashed many Japanese people so that many people can't judge the right way.  Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27am JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon. I disagree to his opinion because there are already a little signs of an economic recovery, which we can't see during (at least) the last 3 years. Even if it is based only on expectations for the new leader, the fact is that rising the price of stocks is making big benefits for companies and hole economy. I hope that this time he surely makes a difference for Japan.  Nathaw at Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33am JST Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with this comment. Japan has too many depts. PM Abe told that government would increase them and grow up economy. But if the plan fail, how will Japan recover? I'm afraid that Japan loses the trust of many other foreign countries.  After LDP took the control of Japanese Government, it was broadcast that strong yen stopped and gradually shifting to weaker yen, in addition the share prices are rising in Japan. These are necessary for Japan to recover from recent economic depression. We cannot say that good situation last forever, but at least we can find hope. I hope this fact will encourage people not to be disappointed about economic situation.  I expected that the Democratic party would manage Japanese politics successfully but it was a disappointment. I hope that Abe's LDP would manage economic policy more successfully and resolve diplomacy problem.  Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s).  I expect quite a few voters had no party for which they would stand. Many voters think DPJ was wrong, but they don't necessarily regard LDP as the next ruling party. There is no other choice, so they voted for LDP. In my own opinion, once Shinzo Abe resigned prime minister just because ""he had stomach ache "" irresponsibly. He do not deserve to be the next prime minister.  I thought that the Democratic Party divided into two factions over the question about a consumption tax. In 2011, finally, 14 assemblymen left the party. I agree with ID12055. I also expect that LDP would recover business conditions. For that, Mr. Abe should have a sense of a responsibility and LDP must act in a body.  JT005 16, 2012 - 09:03pm JST Now taking bets. . . . will Abe last a full year? I say 10 months. I am sad to see this comment. Actually the Prime Minister in Japan changes so quickly by turn. However, I would like him to have a hope. Liberty party has govern Japan for many times expect last two or three years. So i think Abe will not quit his position.  Her opinion is same as me. Mr. Abe take the relationship between Japan and USA very seriously. I expect that LDP get ""The Japanese key"" in this year.  Thomas Anderson Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:52pm JST 41% voted. . . pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE.  I think this result of turnout cannot be helped to be amazed by foreign people. The ""apathy"" to politics of Japanese people is serious. I think they should lower the age to obtain the right to vote, and to enable young people take interest to politics.  I agree with the ID12058's opinion. It is true that switching prime minister doesn't change anything. Actually it just making everything slow and worse, because every prime minister says and tries different thing each time, so they never finishes what they told to us that they are going to do on the first day of prime minister.  It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this comment. I don't feel any changes yet. These days, in Japan, the minister have changed many times, but I don't feel the changes. And I think because of it, almost of people can't expect too much of the minister.  This is less a vote for the LDP than a vote against the DPJ and their failure to live up to their promises in their so called ""manifesto"". One problem is that Ishinnokai, Ishihara's and Hashimoto's party very well could win more seats than the DPJ which is an even bigger problem waiting in the wings. I've talked to a number of people about this election and many see no option other than the LDP which will bring back an era of unbridled public spending. I also think there are a lot of vote against the DPJ, and many people seems to have thought there was no reliable party other than LDP. But I think the situation that Ishinnokai won many seats isn't problem. At the present time, Ishinnokai is unreliable party. But I think this party will stimulate other parties including the DPJ and the LDP. I think that appearance of Ishinnokai may be a chance to change politics of Japan. Though I don't know whether it changes better or worse.  JT009 Dec. 16, 2012 - 08:47pm JST Japan is its own worst enemy. When, when, when will they learn?? I was interested in this comment. Prime minister changes 7th times in 6 years in Japan. It is very serious problem. I hope Abe will conduct stable and reliable politics for people.  JT001DEC. 16, 2012 - 09:23pm JST I knew the the LDP would gain seats, but I thought that there would be a little more balance. Way to go selfish (older) voters. . . People over 60 already control 90% of Japan's wealth. This imbalance will just get worse as younger workers pay for older retired people (collecting on ave. an excess of ¥ 39,620,000 in pension benefits above what they paid in). Also who will fight the battles that Abe will hope to start? I think this comment is one truth of Japan nowadays. The most of people voted was over 60. So, old people have politician right more than young people. . . , but who lead Japan's future is young people. I would like Abe take the reins of government for not only getting many votes but also bringing up Japan's future. Of course, young people should vote more and more activity not to be ignored.  Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought I agree with this comment. I have no interest in politics and I know that recent young people have tendency to have lower interest in it. So this 59% was a little shock for me. I thought the turnout would be more low number.  Shamhei SakaiDEC. 16, 2012 - 11:37pm JST Chill guys. There'll be another election next year. . . and the year after. . . . and the year after that. . . . I reluctantly agree with this sarcasm. I wonder how many people in foreign country know who is the current prime minister of Japan. .  Dennis BauerDec. 17, 2012 - 10:27am JST It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion in terms of ""I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon"". In the election, most people didn't vote for the manifest of LDP. People voted just as the result of eliminating other parties. Also, the truth is that the LDP didn't make progression on increasing their votes rather the votes are split among other parties such as Ishinnokai or Democratic Party. Another realities we must face is that the voting rate of young generations are declining. Here underlies the problem. Unless the nations decided what direction they wanted the country to go on, we cannot improve our country and, in the end, it will become corrupted. So more and more people, particularly young people, need to have more interests in the politics, economics and social affairs and think more, discuss more for the future of Japan. Don't be passive. Be active.  Even if I didn't support all of Noda's thinking, there was some hope left, somehow. Not anymore. At least a lot of things are clearer now. Japan is on the wrong path for good. It's people will suffer even more and for nothing but the well being of the politicians and their amakudari friends. Sad day for Japan. I really wonder how the LDP voters will react in the next months. . . desperate and disillusioned. I agree with that comment. It has passed only 3 years form the Minshuto won the election. 3 years is too short to evaluate them. For changing the regime and systems and something else, 3 years is not enough. Above all, a lot of wrong things that LDP had caused for so long time needs more time to be cured. The only thing I do is to believing that LDP is changed.  It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon This comment seems a little radical, but I agree. Looking back on these years, what party and who assume the reins of government doesn't matter. I myself don't take side with one party. Whether or not the election was end in success is judged a few years later.  SushiSake3Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:49pm JST Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). I think it is very nice comment to the result of this election. I think also that it is the important problem that small turnout of young people. This is cause of disparity in the number of voters per representation. The government should do many efforts for the young people to vote the election, I think.  Dec. 16, 2012 - 09:10pm JST This is less a vote for the LDP than a vote against the DPJ and their failure to live up to their promises in their so called ""manifesto"". One problem is that Ishinnokai, Ishihara's and Hashimoto's party very well could win more seats than the DPJ which is an even bigger problem waiting in the wings. I've talked to a number of people about this election and many see no option other than the LDP which will bring back an era of unbridled public spending. The expectation of the citizen to the Democratic Party government was betrayed while distrust of politics rose in economic recession and territorial problem. I think the landslide victory of the Liberal Democratic Party while a new political party is full to be because there was not a choice rather than trust it in the Liberal Democratic Party.  Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 08:52pm JST 41% voted. . . pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. I agree with this comment. I was surprised this 41% voted. This percentage is the worst number after WWII. Recently, Japan have so many complicated problems. For example, island dispute, nuclear power plant, deficit financing, and revival of west Japan. But, people who participated in the election was only 41% of Japanese! This is regrettable situation. I am worried about future of this country.  I agree with JT001. Whether a party wins or loses depends on the old. So each party tries to attract them affection. Policy tends to ignore the young and they become indifferent. This is the problem. Young people should have interest and the government should strive to attract them.  Shinzo Abe was disappointedly lost his position. But he returned with strength and cleverness. I think he is the only person who can improve Japanese politics and strengthen Japan. I expect him for economic recovery that the other parties couldn't achieve.  Nathaw at Dec. 17, 2012 - 08:33am JST Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term. I agree with the opinion. LDP economic policy lean toward economic growth and employment. They believe that if Japanese economy grows such as rapid economic growth, we can escape the deflationary spiral. But it is really impossible. No developed country grows 10% GDP. In order to grow economy, LDP is about to redeem government bonds and increase the deficit. By now though Japanese government reduce the deficit, LDP will add to it with Japanese center bank. I am worried about Japanese future.  i expect him to succeed. i believe him. i don't know the details of politics, i hope his success, though.  Abe economic policy is Spend, Borrow and More debt. If he can not pay the debt, he will borrow more. Japan real debt is more than 200% of GDP. Unlike Greece, the debt belong to locals not foreigners. However it there is a default or does not meet the bond obligation, there will be a exodus of capital flight. His policy is fairy tale and can not sustain for a long term.  I agree with this comment. Japan has too many depts. PM Abe told that government would increase them and grow up economy. But if the plan fail, how will Japan recover? I'm afraid that Japan loses the trust of many other foreign countries.  I think low voting rate is Japanese big serious problem. To improve this problem, I think we should have more attention to Japanese government too.  Now taking bets. . . . will Abe last a full year? I say 10 months.  I am sad to see this comment. Actually the Prime Minister in Japan changes so quickly by turn. However, I would like him to have a hope. Liberty party has govern Japan for many times expect last two or three years. So i think Abe will not quit his position.  I think this result shows that Japanese people can be affected and change their mind easily. Because we chose Democratic Party to promote good economy. This Liberal democratic Party's victory caused by our expectation to promote Japanese economy.  wanderlust Dec. 17, 2012 - 02:11am JST Naoto Kan was PM for 14 months. I don't think Abe will last a year, the LDP are probably already deciding who will be next in the big seat, when the new PM's popularity will drop to around 20%, as it inevitably will. . . . I don't think so. The strong yen rate is being redressed and the price of stocks is rising. I suppose this fact proves that the policy or the executive power of LDP are expected. To be sure, Mr. Abe relinquished government about five years ago. But we should estimate the new government after seeing how they're working. There are, indeed, a little anxiety in my mind.  I'm in favor of ID12028. The Japanese finance debt is twice more than GDP and the largest in the world. Now most of government bonds is bought by Japanese people and they can continue to buy the bonds, so the bonds keep the trust in the market. But if Abe accelerates the issue of government debt, the bonds may lose the trust in market. More steady finance is needed.  JT008 17, 2012 - 12:16am JST unbelievable. . . . made me very worried with Japan's future. . . I believe Abe's Liberal Democratic Party's winning. Because I think Japanese politics system had been successful by the leading party ""LDP"". So our country has already been the specifications for LDP. I think the problem LDP couldn't resolve isn't able to be resolved by other party. So I'll aid the LDP.  UpgrayeddDec. 16, 2012 - 11:07pm JST I'm just glad that Japan isn't going to renounce nuclear power. Oh and the whole LDP inflation target thing is a pretty solid idea too. I support this opinion. Japan has so far been dependent on nuclear power. Now, it cannot be lost. It is little although there is also a method of alternative energy. So, Japan must depend on nuclear power.  i don't think Japan will change whoever would become prime minister. But I have little knowledge about politics in Japan so I cannot say anything about it. So I should study harder about it, and wanna be a good participant in government of Japan.  This comment is almost the same as mine in many points. Many voters had no party for which they would stand. They think DPJ was wrong, but they don't necessarily regard LDP as the next ruling party. There is no other choice, so they voted for LDP. ""Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one. "" I think that Abe Shinzo is very lucky. When he was a prime minister, he formerly resigned the job for his health problem reason. Regardless of his previous failure, he did the LDP leader and Japanese people voted not the DPJ but the LDP. It is very important for him and the LDP to solve the domestic problems such as the economic problem, the financial problem, the educational problem and the diplomatic problem. In addition, I think that existence of the third parties will be key. Cooperationing The Nipponishin party and the Minna party with the DPJ will enable the LDP stimulate.  It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this comment. I don't feel any changes yet. These days, in Japan, the minister have changed many times, but I don't feel the changes. And I think because of it, almost of people can't expect too much of the minister.  Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents. If they want to change the country, the people, and etc, they should keep the president for the time being. President Abe actually got the second chance to lead Japan, Maybe, he will be changed sooner or later. I agree this comment. In Japan president change like once a year and I don't understand why president change so much. I think it is meaningless even if the president change.  To be honest, I am not very good at politics and do not quite understand how the current system of the government runs. However, I can see a ridiculousness in frequent president change in Japan. Because of this, we Japanese citizens are always confused and worried about our country's future. Plus, It is a problem that every time we have a different one, he is somewhere criticized and demanded. I would like to insist here that the Japanese government does not have even a second to waste by disputing inside the country. Otherwise, Japan will definitely stop developing and be left behind by other countries in the world.  Frequency of the times the president changes in Japan is crazy. Where in the world changes the president seven times in 6 years. I think it is only the country, Japan. I do not see any good changes by switching the presidents.

In Japan president change like once a year and I don't understand why president change so much. I think it is meaningless even if the president change.  Shinzo Abe became the seventh prime minister in 6 years. This must be an awful number and to make Japan change, I think time is needed. You can't do anything that turns out to be positive in a short time and people must wait a little for the thing to happen. It isn't that easy to change the country we must know that. We don't know what would happen to Abe but we must trust him to make Japan change.  I voted on his party so I want him to go for it. He quit prime minister once in pass and now he has a second chance and he can not fail this time.  Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27pm JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced. . . China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I agree with his thoughts. First of all, diplomacy is one of the most important things that Abe should deal with, there are a lot of problems in Japan though. I hope that Japan will solve the territorial dispute between not only China also Korea. It is a frequent occurrence which one country has a dispute with neighbor country. So, I believe these three countries will get over the insignificant and meaningless dispute without any wars and without any blood. I don't know how, but I wish, just having a conversation. We have to have a conversation about the territory with honor and tolerance. Besides, I disagree with the policy which nuclear power plant will not halt even in the future. Although it is not good that just says ""Stop the nuclear power plant"", these people do not consider how to product huge power by other ways. If we want to halt it, we have to suggest the new way in the substitution for nuclear. However, this is very difficult question. There are a lot of earthquake and volcano in Japan. I think geothermal power generation is good for the substitution for the nuclear. Or I wish someone hit on a good idea. By the way, People who voted to LDP did not think LDP was good for the ruling party. They thought DPJ was too bad and they voted to LDP because they did not have any other choices. Recently, I have seen the new presidents in America and Korea and I think it is also better for Japan to elect a president. It is because there is no charismatic Prime Minister and people who became PM in these days would not decide anything. So, we are requiring a person who can decide various things.  Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced. . . China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan.

He declared to improve the market, and acted actually. I think the most priority policy is about the market. Many problem ; diplomacy, constitution, nuclear power, etc. should be put off. In place of DPJ, LDP have to advance Japan.  It doesn't matter which party you choose, the system is set in stone, the bureaucracy will mill on the same, whoever is in charge. I don't see any major changes happen anytime soon I agree with this opinion. I think a change of the party in power does not make a change for society. But, I cannot understand people who do not go to the election by this reason. Certainly, it may not make any change. But, we should not reconcile the government because I think this act connects an indifferent to the government. So, we should make use of suffrage.  I disagree this opinion. If it becomes like this opinion, we will be in trouble. Many Japanese are bored of the government. So, I think Abe can not make mistakes. There are a lot of problems because of recent a few years politics. But, I think the government must not become the Right Wing. And, I expect Abe to restore economic.  I'm just glad that Japan isn't going to renounce nuclear power. Oh and the whole LDP inflation target thing is a pretty solid idea too.  I support this opinion. Japan has so far been dependent on nuclear power. Now, it cannot be lost. It is little although there is also a method of alternative energy. So, Japan must depend on nuclear power. JT003 16, 2012 - 10:21pm JST Don't worry people. . . not much will change. Oh wait, that's what we should be worried about! Well, no good change is likely IMHO. Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China.  I disagree with this opinion. Although Japan may hardly change, isn't it required for the present people to believe change? I hope Prime Minister Abe causes some reform.  I think the Abe government will last long more than a year. People and companies and other country dislike frequent change of prime minister. In recent years, many prime ministers appeared and disappeared. And this made big loss of economy and politics. I want the Abe government to last long time. And abenomics is succeeding. His popularity will not drop.  The Japanese people who voted for the LDP and Ishihara are living in cloud cuckoo land. Back to the bad old days of patriotic education, visits to Yasukini, changing the Constitution, building more airports in the middle of nowhere, denying The Rape of Nanjing, teachers being forced to salute the Hinomaru and stand for the Kimigayo, maybe even the return of the Thought Police? Japan getting the nuclear bomb. yes, a great day for old Japan. The beginning of the end.  I think this comment is quite radical. I want to vote for PLD, but I do not have right to vote. I do not want to go back to the time like WW2. But Japan must power up military power in order to compete with China and North Korea. This general election is last chance to save this country. This comment is irrelevance.  I knew the the LDP would gain seats, but I thought that there would be a little more balance. Way to go selfish (older) voters. . . People over 60 already control 90% of Japan's wealth. This imbalance will just get worse as younger workers pay for older retired people (collecting on ave. an excess of ¥ 39,620,000 in pension benefits above what they paid in). Also who will fight the battles that Abe will hope to start? I think this comment is one truth of Japan nowadays. The most of people voted was over 60. So, old people have politician right more than young people. . . , but who lead Japan's future is young people. I would like Abe take the reins of government for not only getting many votes but also bringing up Japan's future. Of course, young people should vote more and more activity not to be ignored.  I think Abe's pledges can agreed by Japanese but not other countries. He said that he will magnify the Self-Defense Forces. In Korea, people are worrying about increasing Self-Defense Forces because they can be a threat to Korea's security. In fact, many Koreans are worrying about Abe's Conservative pace. I suggest him to be more ponder about international relations. Furthermore, I attend to the fact that he once inaugurated the Prime Minister just for one year. I want to say that Japanese political trends being stable as soon as possible.  Abe was picked by the Japanese Prime Minister, but I expect it as expected, and I think whether it is good. The Prime Ministers were changed in sequence these past around five years, and was stable; is because cannot govern it. Prime Minister Abe is the election of the second , but He carries out a manifesto, and can you accomplish a splendid great achievement?I pray as one of the Japanese citizens for the Prime Minister accomplishing a great achievement.  Certainly, LDP won the election and the party will roll Japan again. However, I doubt if People in Japan are hopeful about the party. I think they voted for it negatively. It means we can no more entrust DPJ with politics. LDP will be faced many problems to solve.  I think that the news which LDP won the election is good for Japan even though a great number of people including me think LDP would not change a lot. I did not want DPJ to continue anymore because it had not changed the things.  Even if I didn't support all of Noda's thinking, there was some hope left, somehow. Not anymore. At least a lot of things are clearer now. Japan is on the wrong path for good. It's people will suffer even more and for nothing but the well being of the politicians and their amakudari friends. Sad day for Japan. I really wonder how the LDP voters will react in the next months. . . desperate and disillusioned.  I agree with that comment. It has passed only 3 years form the Minshuto won the election. 3 years is too short to evaluate them. For changing the regime and systems and something else, 3 years is not enough. Above all, a lot of wrong things that LDP had caused for so long time needs more time to be cured. The only thing I do is to believing that LDP is changed.  41% voted. . . pathetic. No one cares about anything despite the big hullabaloo about the nuclear accident. GOOD JOB JAPAN, YOU WIN NO PRIZE. We have to be more serious about this circumstance that the rate of voting is too low. I think that this opinion is the very thought people around the world have. They look us like this. Japanese must not take it easy as we are not concerned about politics. Particularly young people should go to vote in this age of a declining birthrate and aging population. Like this comment, Japan will be ruined if things are going on.  I strongly disagree with the opinion that Japan must have the military power. we Japanese have the constitution especially, Article 9. we cannot have the military power. But LDP change the constitution and have great military power. Finally, LDP may be about to break into war. So this comment is contradiction.  Naoto Kan was PM for 14 months. I don't think Abe will last a year, the LDP are probably already deciding who will be next in the big seat, when the new PM's popularity will drop to around 20%, as it inevitably will. . . .  I don't think so. The strong yen rate is being redressed and the price of stocks is rising. I suppose this fact proves that the policy or the executive power of LDP are expected. To be sure, Mr. Abe relinquished government about five years ago. But we should estimate the new government after seeing how they're working. There are, indeed, a little anxiety in my mind.  There's a sentence said ""He would be Japan's seventh prime minister in six-and-a-half years. "", I think this shows one of the causes of Japan's recent political turmoil. No one can achieve anything in a short time. We have to trust the Cabinet we chose and made through the vote, and let them work more.  Thomas AndersonDec. 16, 2012 - 10:27pm JST Be interesting to see what happens between Japan and China. I think the good news is that Abe is two-faced. . . China is actually hopeful that Abe will restore the relation between China and Japan. The bad news is that he is pro-nuclear! And a whole bunch of other things that are not good for Japan. I am worried about the relationship between Japan and China. China has many people and these days develops. And now, Japan depends on America and China by every side. So Japan should make good relationship with China. I think Abe is being put to the test, with everyone waiting to see how the relationship is changing. Abe won the election the second time. I'm also interested in which results Abe leads Japan to good or to bad.  Honestly, I was surprised when I heard LDP won the election and couldn't believe that result. Thinking about the result of the last election, which LDP completely lost, and the LDP's activities after the election, I had no ideas to think that LDP recover the trust of Japanese citizen. But I've got it, when I saw the voting percentage. It is truth that LDP won the election but the number of votes that LDP obtained didn't change. After consideration about the decrease of the voting percent, the supporters of the LDP didn't increase. I am interested in the manner of the LDP after this election. Seeing the election returns, the winner can't think confidently that much of the citizens believe in them. To recover the trust, they should lend the ears to other parties , for example, the party of Ishinn.  I think that this result was good one for Japan and the Japanese. I don't know the details about Japanese politics, but know about Japan-China relationship. I have heard that a certain Japanese had gone to volunteer in China and killed. When I heard story, I was very shocked. In the future, I hope that Japan-China relation will be better.  Article says 59% voter turnout. Better than I thought I agree with this comment. I have no interest in politics and I know that recent young people have tendency to have lower interest in it. So this 59% was a little shock for me. I thought the turnout would be more low number.  I agree with his comment. I think that temporary restoration of economy is meaningless. The government has to keep the restoration. But, it is not easy to do that. Therefore, as he said, I hope LDP's election encourage people not to be disappointed about economic situation.  Last year, I became 20 years old, and I got the right to vote as an adult. Then, I am more interested in the politics. I think that economic policy is one of the most influence factors which control the election. LDP emphasized it, and the Japanese people expected. As a result, LDP won a victory in the election. After it, strong yen stopped and is shifting to weaker yen, in addition the Nikkei Stock average is rising. However, it is a pity that Voter turnout was around 59%. I think that Japanese must not forget that we have a duty participating in the politics. I want Japanese to be more interested in it. And, I hope that the government responds our expectation.  I was surprised this 41% voted. This percentage is the worst number after WWII. Recently, Japan have so many complicated problems. For example, island dispute, nuclear power plant, deficit financing, and revival of west Japan. But, people who participated in the election was only 41% of Japanese! This is regrettable situation. I am worried about future of this country.  I'm against nuclear power. I think human can't handle nuclear power perfectly. If we continue using nuclear power, sometime we will get terrible damage. Why don't LDP renounce nuclear power?I think human life is important than money.  I think so, too. The prime minister should be more careful for his remark. Japanese prime ministers had to resign due to their making a gaffe.  This news makes me happy. I don't expect democratic party's policy and members. But, LDP's policy will give Japanese economic good effect.  I do not think it is suitable for someone who has been president in the past to become president again. He was put down for a reason last time he was president. If Abe can change Japan he would have made it an even better place while he was president in the past.  I cannot just say it is a good thing. Of course there is a good thing. But there is also a bad thing like changing a constitution as he mentioned. We need to observe the situation seriously.  I agree with this comment. "" Everything happens for a reason, although not necessarily a good one(s). "" Abe became Prime Minister again, but public opinion was severe to him. First of all, anti-nuclear became popular in Japan today, but LDP is not supposed to stop nuclear plants. So many parties were established right before election, asserting abolish of nuclear plant. However, as an election, it looks dangerous to bet to new small parties. By failing of another big party DPJ, people had to choose LDP, another big party. You might not to be able to say that they really hoped LDP's revival. Abe is needed more effort than first time, from the beginning.  An abject failure the first time around and then leads his party to a landslide victory in a choice between losers, nutcases and non-entities. I suppose someone had to win.  I disagree this issue. All of the Parties including the Liberal Democratic Party are classified in losers, nutcases and non- entities and all of them don't think about Japan. I think The Liberal Democratic Party is the Party which is not wanted to win but have to win.  I strongly believe that TPP is not good for Japan never been. And also His victory is not always good for Japan because he supported TPP and Iraq war, it will be suffer Japan's economy. I have a hope to Obama's activity but we have also skeptics.  This election was a first time for me to vote and it was really confusing for me to vote because there weren't a person who I strongly felt that I want to vote. I hope that Abe can do something that will make Japan a better place but Im not really positive about that because his work as a president before was not really good. I hope that Japanese government settle down once to think what should be really done to Japan, not changing prime minister so many times. "
JOC JOC-13A-04O 1.15 "This news is very surprising for me. Most of old people who are about eighty years old are difficult to move smoothly because of lack of stamina. Besides, climbing a mountain, especially Mt. Everest, is pretty dangerous and hard for even professional alpinists. Nevertheless he succeeded to get to the summit, he should be admired more. Even if I were eighty, I wouldn't be able to climb mountains. Aging of the population progresses, Japan have been an aging society in modern times. And I've heard that many young people think that there are several demerits like the symptoms of age when they become senior, so they don't want to age. I'm sure that his achievement will mend these negative images for old people as much as possible.  Every one knows it is difficult climbing Mt, Everest whether young man or old man. Mr Miura was 80 year old, and had a number of operation on his heart and injury . So it is especially hard thing to climb it. But, he had achieved his goal. I cannot understand why he thought challenge climbing Mt, Everest after 80 year old with knowing many risk. And there were many things about bitter and painful experience when he had climbed Mt, Everest. After all he tried climbing it, so I think there might be waiting something which the only man who achieved to his goal know . And that might be far more marvelous than some hard experience. The news teach me importance about challenge Every one knows it is difficult climbing Mt, Everest whether young man or old man. Mr Miura was 80 year old, and had a number of operation on his heart and injury . So it is especially hard thing to climb it. But, he had achieved his goal. I cannot understand why he thought challenge climbing Mt, Everest after 80 year old with knowing many risk. And there were many things about bitter and painful experience when he had climbed Mt, Everest. After all he tried climbing it, so I think there might be waiting something which the only man who achieved to his goal know . And that might be far more marvelous than some hard experience. The news teach me importance about challenge and trying regardless of age and possibility, so I will make every effort to achieve my goal .  I think his challenge is wonderful. Even young people, to climb Everest is difficult. So. what person of 80-year-old climbed the mountain is really great. Compared with him, I am young. But, I am not aggressive than him. So, I have much things to learn from him. every day, since I spend vaguely, this article makes me abject, but I was able to think I should not be satisfied with the current situation.  I respect for his spirit. Of course his achievement is so great, but it's impressive for me that he decided to climb rather than succeeded in climbing. I was really struck by his eternal spirit, and I want to be a man like him.  I didn't know Miura until I watched news about him on TV. I think his achievement is the pride of human. The most surprising things is that he decided to climb up Everest in 65 years old. I learned that if we have strong will and never give up, we can start everything at any time.  I was surprised to hear this news. besides, I was encouraged by his achievements. I am sure we were learned that the age is not related whether we can achieve our each dream by this news. It is not easy for even young men, because I know Mt. Everest is most dangerous and highest mountain in the world. However, he could succeed in climbing Mt. Everest. It is unbelievable for me. I have read a book written by him. The book said that the life always starts from now. I can not forget this word. I respect his life and want to live my life like him. His style of life will influence many people in the world forever.  I was very surprised that an 80-year old Japanese mountaineer has reached the summit of Mount Everest, when I heard this news. I think that we should proud of him and we should be like him, because he overturned conventional wisdom. After I heard this news, I decide I'll never give up anything because of the age.  This news may give many people great courage. For myself, Mr Miura's great feat moved me profoundly. His daring spirit with which he tried climbing Mt Everest three times although he suffered from pelvis and left thigh injury taught us many lessons. For example, people can keep trying until they lose their fighting spirits even if people who want to try are at the age of 80. Nowadays, many countries are in aging societies. Especially, Japan is said to become a super-aging society. What may become important for people is not how long they live but how fully they live. It may be the pivotal issue that elders have something to live for. Like Mr. Miura, many elders should have goal which they are eager to achieve and they can enjoy their active lives.  As everybody know, It is really difficult to reach the summit of Mount Everest. However, Mr. Miura accomplished it when he was 80 years old. It is hard for ordinary old man who is 80 years old even to run fast. This is an amazing news. There is no doubt that Mr. Miura worked very hard to reach the summit of Mount Everest. He must have been had a hard time, but he continued his efforts. I think that it is terrific not only to reach the summit of Mount Everest but also to keep working very hard. I respect Mr. Miura, and I want to be a man who can keep working very hard like him.  I've never imagined 80-year-old mountaineer could reach the summit of Mount Everest!!!This news not only surprised me but also gave me my resolution. I swear not to give up anything because of handicaps. Though he had handicaps -age of 80 and several injuries -  to climb mountains, he challenged climbing. Of course, it is admirable that he actually reached the summit of Mount Everest and it was on record, but especially his courageous decision made a deep impression on me. I think his challenge encouraged people all over the world. I hope more and more people could find things worth doing like him.  I can't believe this great achievement. It is difficult for people 80 years old to do such a hard exercise like this. But he done. This challenge is not easy. I think there is big effort on his success. He proved that human age is not matter with doing anything. Through this news, I have learned that if I believe I can do, anything can happen and I want to be a man like him.  This is an unbelievable news! Commonly, it is a very hard and difficult for a person aged 80 to go to just a supermarket. Mr, Miura, however, succeeded to reach the summit of the tallest mountain in the world. I respect for his fight spirit and power to accomplish. I belong to a soccer club, so I'd like to aim for the top with ambition like him.  Reading this article, i was very impressed and feel motivated. Due to depression, more and more Japanese people, especially young one, tended to feel utterly abandoned and lacked enthusiasm at that time. You can't imagine how much people of that time had their spirits lifted by his great feat. In short, suffice to say that I think he is one of the all-time greats. Thanks for reading.  When I heard this news, I was surprised very much and got courage very much. In the first place this is because this one climbs Mt. Everest at age of 80 years old to be that it is difficult to climb Mt. Everest. And the point where he is going to challenge once again is splendid while the person that a record was established a new is 81 years old. I want to follow a point working together in competition each other while being this age. I think that it is splendid news to give courage in all.  I'm surprised when I heard Mr Miura had reached the summit of Mount Everest. Above all his age surprised me. If I were 80 I couldn't reach the summit of Mount Everest absolutely. His age of 80 is unbelievable and gives old people power and courage. Now Japan is aging society with fewer children, active old people will continue to support Japan in the future.  When I read this article, I was very surprised, and I can't believe that 80-year-old Japanese man reached the summit of Mount Everest. I was exhausted to even scale the summit of Mount Fuji (3776 meters), when I was 14 years old. In order to accomplish his great feat, it's necessary to have not only physical strength but also will power and ambition. It is very important not to forget the mind of challenge regardless of age, I think. His achievement will give power to many people in the world.  I was so surprised when I read this article first. I think Mr. Miura is a great person and what he did is incredible. He said ""Even at 80, I can still do quite well. "" This ward is impressive for me. I think he continued to challenge his limits even at such an old age. He gave me hope, brave, dream, and so on. I want him to keep challenging.  I was very surprised and proud of his great achievement as a Japanese when I read this article. I learned that oneself must not label one's limit from this article. So I want to challenge various things from now on.  I was very surprised when I heard this news for the first time. I think he might be able to achieve such a thing because of his own strong desire. For not only elder people but also young people, having an aim and challenging to it again and again is very important. Perhaps, this is the very thing that enjoying one's life. While I'm a college student, I have a lot of free time. So I want to be looking for my aim which I can dedicate myself to.  A man aged 80 reached the summit of mount Everest. . . unbelievable!Nobody would deny the fact that he is the strongest among the people of their 80s! I wonder how he keeps such a powerful body for this long time.  When I read this article, I was very surprised. I have thought that it is more hard to move their body as their will and there are more restriction to do something as people become old. However, he told us that the age is not the problem of doing something. Today, Japan has more people who are 65 years old or over. However, we can say the opposite that we can live longer. I think if we live having to will to stay alive as him, we can make our life more full.  When I read this article, I think that there is a lot of possibility to succeed very much if I do my best. It is more dangerous to climb the summit of Mount Everest at 80-year old, but Mr. Miura succeeded it. It is a result of the efforts not a miracle. It was realized by enough preparations, age-appropriate and careful plan, knowledge and confidence by the past experience, cooperation by surrounding people. As a result, he overcame the limits and excited and encouraged us. I think that it is necessary to have thought of a challenge, preparation and experiment to succeed, appreciation to surrounding people who cooperated with me. I want to be a person that touches heart of somebody by impression like him.  When I read this news, I was surprised at his strong mental power. People of all over the world must be encouraged by his great achievement. Though it is difficult to keep the challenging spirits like him, I 'd like to keep it .  It is wonderful that an 80-year-old climber reaches the summit of Mt. Everest , the highest place in the world . His challenge encourages many people in the world to challenge their limits . I respect him. So I think I have to try to deal with a lot of difficulties in front of me.  I think its really amazing that 80-year-old man climbed the Everest, because my grandpa is about to be 80 and he is on the wheelchair. He can't even walk. I hope he can make the record again later in his life!! When I first knew this news, I was very surprised. In Japan, aging society is unstoppable problem, but it is good thing for elderly people to live healthy. I guess they had better exercise well in order to live healthy and I would like to be a health people even I become old.  I was very surprised when I read this article. I think this is very wonderful news and I respect him. There are a lot of old people in Japan and almost them don't work. Therefore in the Japanese government, it is hard to pay a pension because there is not people who pay tax and there is a lot of people who receive the pension. This news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, so they can work. Therefore Japanese company should employ elder people.  I was very surprised when I read this article. I think this is very wonderful news and I respect him. There are a lot of elderly people in Japan and almost them don't work. Therefore in the Japanese government, it is hard to pay pension because there is not people who pay tax and there is a lot of people who receive the pension. This news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, so they can work. Therefore company should employ elderly people and give a working chance.  We have the problem of decreasing birthrate and aging population. so, I think that this news proof that elderly people can do a lot of things, too. They should challenge various things like him, not give up!! When I heard the news, I frankly feel what an 80-year-old Japanese man! Surprisingly, he completed the difficult mission that he had reached the summit of Mt. Everest known as the highest mountain around the world at the age of 80. I hope that I'm as fine as him when I become 80 years old. For the purpose, I should try to go to bed early and get up early.  This new is amazing. When I heard this news, I think Yuichiro Miura is very powerful old man. Common old people give up for their ages but he never gives up. He claimed Everest record and give all old people fighting spirit. I want to increase such old men.  His fighting spirit and his act change many old people. Not he but other old people should have fighting spirit and heart of never giving up.  First of all, when I read this news, I felt Mr. Miura was very tough and energetic. I will never feel like climbing Everest, let alone when I'm 80 years old. This news was certain to encourage the old. Now, we have a lot of problems about aging in Japan. But many old people are living healthy. i think young people should challenge many things after their example.  I was surprised too. The aging society has not only a bad side but also good side. We can learn various things from the old. I feel Japanese old people are very active.  I agree with you. This great achievement shows old people's power. It is said that the number of poor old people is increasing. If they can continue to work, Japanese government or companies should work on the system reform.  I was surprised when I read this article , too. He is a great man . So , I want to live after the example of him.  This is very great event and will give many people big hope. Even if we become old, we have possibility to try and do anything. This encourages old people, so now Japanese social will become better, I think I was absolutely stunned by this news of 80 years old Japanese man climbing mount Everest. I am very grateful as a Japanese and also as a same man. I love to play sports and exercise. I am willing to play sports until I die. That is why have so much respect for this man and I have respect on his mentality. Moreover, I expect him to be our model of man who have overcome the difficulty of age.  When I read the article, I was surprised at 80-year-old Japanese climber. I often went to mountains at high school student. I climbed only Japanese mountains (which are not very high mountains), but I know painfulness of the mountaineering well. Physical strength is important.  I was surprised at two things when I read the headline. First, it is the man whose age is 80 has reached the summit of Mount Everest. I can not imagine that I climb it even in a simple mountain when I alive at 80-year-old. The older we grow up, the weaker our bodies are. Furthermore, The neighborhood of top of the mountain has less oxygen than the place where we live, and the temperature is below the freezing point. Second, what I was surprised is the man is the Japanese. I have an image that the Japanese is weaker than foreigners. Therefore, this news is proud-hearted for a Japanese. We have to learn the importance to move the bodies from him.  I agree with your opinion. His act proved the power of old people. Not a few people think we will not be able to do anything such as an exciting. But his act made this idea change, and will become the motivation to challenge new things for many people. I think we have to learn the spirit to change if we age.  I was surprise too when this article read too. And I almost agree with your opinion. It is sure that Mr. Miura gave him courage to people who know it in the world not only mountaineer but also other people. My father is mountaineer and he said to me that ""when you climb mountain, you are alone, even if you are with your friends, team and so on. You have to save yourself and think about your life. "" His saying means people who reached summit is fought themselves and won themselves. So I think claiming mountain is fighting myself because opponent is nature not human, money and other. Usually we are have to study for future job and performance. In case of worker, have to work for living, social status. But if we enter a mountain once mountain climbing is for our life. We can depend on our skill that have gotten before. Way of life is represented up to then in mountain. So it is great that Mr. Miura reached summit of Mt. Everest. He believed him way of life and himself, does not consider the physical strength. He is 80 yeas old but we are so yang. We can do everything with believing ourselves and I think it!"
JOC JOC-13B-10N 1.07 "I'm impressed to read this news article. How surprising a person who had been in prison for as many as 27 years changed the country! Now I believe that important thing is not to give up anytime if something terrible happen, and not to look at the past but the present for the future to find what we really should do. Even if we stumble and lose our hearts, Nelson will encourage us not to give up by memory of his great achievement.  I admire Nelson Mandela's courage against authoritarian government. Thanks to him, the political system of South Africa changed. I think democracy is necessary to get rid of discrimination. So, now I want many african young people to try to bring democracy and freedom to the non democratic country. I know it is very difficult, but I think it is the people that changes the political system of a country and found a nation where there is no discrimination. Also other democratic nations should help achieve this. For example Japan can use its ODA to teach the way to change the administration systems or help countries do development of laws.  I didn't know Nelson Mandela well, so I read other article about him and I knew that he lived to be 95 years of age. I think it's enough. His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  I was surprised to hear that. ""When Mandela was finally released 27 years later, his biggest concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together. ""This is very positive thinking. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission (TRC). He is great.  Honestly, I didn't know Nelson Mandela and understand the greatness of him. However, I feel the importance of the will. In spite of the imprisonment for 27 years, his will didn't change. Therefore, his will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system. He taught us the greatness of indomitability.  I think Mandela can be said to be the person had South America been reborn. We will never let race discrimination like apartheid again. And we should strive for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. This word was introduced by Mandela. Recently, the news that a sign language interpreter had used inappropriate sign language at the Mandela's memorial service is focus much on, but we don't forget mourning for the late Mandela.  Many people might mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. I was also one of the such people because I had respected him for his brave action. During the time of discrimination, he had never given up opposing to it in spite of severe situation. Moreover, after he released, his biggest concern was making sure that the country remained together instead of revenge for his mistreatment, and he held public hearings, TRC. When I learned about this, I even more admired him for his indomitable spirit and tolerance.  I was very shocked because I respected him very much. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength. However, South Africa is one of the most differential countries in the world even though Mandela governed this country. I worry about the future of the country.  I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However, I also heard this news and became somewhat sad. A movie called Invictas became the cause for me to get to know Mandela. I would also like to become a great human being who can hand down a name to future generations like him.  I was so sad to hear this news. I learned about his achievement in the world history. He fought for racial equality in Republican Of South Africa. Now, in Republican Of South Africa, black and white are living together. His achievement is so great.  I was very surprised to read this article. He was a brave man. He protested against racial discrimination and make The South Africa equal country. Maybe he had many difficulties, however he overcome all of these. We lost great person.  i'm so sorry to hear this news. I do not know this achievement in detail. But everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. There is still this kind of discrimination now. So it is the time to remember his achievements.  I totally agree with you. We should respect him and eliminate racial discrimination.  I was shocked. The world lost shine. I think he was the greatest person ever. And I think he was loved many people especially reporter, because every article tell us only his greatness. There're no abuse in the article. Mandela R. I. P.  I told him thanks. He is a just and tolerant symbol in the world. He had appealed black persons' rights! And they could get rights. If I were him, I must seek revenge on white persons for something until now. But he didn't it. He had not had prejudice. So we should know his policy more. And I want to be a tolerant person as he. I pray that his soul may rest in peace.  I think him to be the one of the great man. Usually, even if we had a purpose like him, it is rare that we act as he did , and I think that there are some situations that can not improve, if there is not a person like him. I think he left big hope and achievement.  I do not know Mandela at all, but I know that he was a great man for the world. If I have a chance to know him, I learn about acts that he did.  I agree with your idea. The great thing of Mandela is that he had not had prejudice about white person. We should be a tolerant as he. I felt tempted to tell him thanks, too.  I think Mandela left a big achievement. As a South Africa's first black president, his action had great meaning. At the same time, other countries watch his movement carefully, so he took heavy responsibility. I think he had influence on all over the world, because he acted positively even after having been sent to prison. He became a good model for other countries where there are many black people.  I was very shocked to hear the news and mourned over his death. Many people must have been moved by his activities that trying to help those who had been horribly discriminated against. I believe that he contributed to make South African and African people be proud of themselves and gave them power to protest against apartheid policies. Now the great leader has gone. We must take over his will, and strive to get rid of segregation until all the people on the earth can live peacefully.  I agree with you. I learned that what truly makes people happy isn't revenge but pure spirit and effort for people or country from Mandela and Gandhi.  I know his name and achievement by studying world history , but I don't know what he exactly did. After reading this news , I researched his achievement and this effect deeply. I think Nelson Mandela is the best politician of all the times.  I think so. Mandela was the best person. As you said, South Africa has the gap between poor and rich. I think the current government have to face and deal that problem. If they ignore the issue, Mandela will be sad.  I thinks that South Africa lost the great person. He still has a big influence on the world. He was behind bars for 27 years, however he did not give it up. It point is that we should respect most. People like him what was to live a long life. I'm afraid it.  I was so surprised to read this article because I respected him. When I watched a legal drama, the hero said that the real devil is huge consensus. White used to control the world. So nobody can act for the solution of race discrimination, but he fought against race discrimination. Race discrimination is tempered as a result.  I felt so sad because I really respect him. I think that he is one of the greatest people in the world. He has achieved great things, for example, TRC. He is a person who has a strong sense of justice and he fought with ruling party in the cause of justice. Justice which depends on circumstances is not a justice, in my opinion. In that point, he could really take action for the justice. I admired him for his spirit and tolerance.  I think he was a one of the greatest men in the world. His name is known widely in the world. We lost great man. I'm so sad. We try to do anything like him. His death gave me motivation. I mourn the death of him.  I did not know him very well. I heard his name in the class of social study. So when I heard this news, I do not think more things. But, now I think his death is a big loss for the world because there is not any person who change bad system like apartheid. We have to follow his example and make better world.  I do not know him very well but I also want to admire him for his spirit and tolerance. I want to be a person who can fight with ruling party but it is very difficult because it means I also have to make a effort like him. And I need talent for it.  I pay tribute to Nelson Mandela. He was courageous to act in order to realize the world where anybody is equal. He challenged to eliminate racial discriminations. His activity was great and had a significant impact on the current peace. R. I. P.  I agree with ID13050. I did not know his achievements in detail. However, everyone knows that he is great and he did a lot to solve racial discrimination problem. We have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.  Nelson Mandela was a great person. We all have to mourn for him. To abolish racial discrimination takes an incredibly hard work and long time so most of us cannot believe or would not take some action by oneself to realize it though we all want the world without discrimination. I admire him for his resolution that he was willing to be arrested or in custody to achieve the big dream.  Nelson Mandera is honorable person. Almost all of us hope the discrimination would disappear, but we can't take some action to solve any problem. To a grater or less degree we also all have prejudice. So we can't claim that discrimination is bad in public in big voice , which Nelson Mandera did.  First of all, I mourn over Nelson Mandela's death. As a person in 21th century, we should strive more for making ""rainbow nation""that coexist with people of having a different skin color. He may live forever in our mind.  I know your feelings, because I was also shocked when I heard this news . I know him well because I learned about him in the English class and in the history class, and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man.  I think so too. He had big influence all over the world not only black people but white people. But he was not a special person. He was a normal people. All of black people are like him.  I also agree with you. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. Now he had passed away, but the people in South Africa should face the problems they have now and they should keep trying to make the better country for themselves.  There are various opinions against Mandela. However I think he is a honorable man. The fact that he fought against discrimination and that he made the first step to change South Africa is admirable. We must learn from him, I think. We must learn the spirit to fight against injustice even in a severe situation. However I don't think fighting or protesting is the only way to deal with severe situation, I highly evaluate his way of living.  I think that Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest person over the world. His speech and action changed South Africa. I was so surprised that he had been taken into custody to fight against apartheid. Therefore, I was shocked by his death.  I have read about him only in textbooks of History, but I know that he had fought for his brotherhoods. May his spirit stay in the land of South Africa.  Nelson Mandela is one of the most nice person of this world for me. He has really strong passionate, I have been respected him since when I learn about him at junior high school. When I read this topic I was really surprised, because he had been in prison for as many as 27 years! I can't believe that, and I moved his life.  I agree with your idea. I never know about Mandela up till now, however I learned about him in history class in the other day. He is very great person! I want to be man like him.  I am ashamed of my ignorance of history. I have heard about him a couple of times, but I didn't really know about him actually. Since he died, I came to notice how great person he is that he made an effort to stop discrimination at the time when that kind of insistence is disliked. From now, I want to study about not only him but also people who have done great things in the past. Then I want to be the person who can explain amazing stories of historical people to my future children.  I agree with you. I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination.  I was very shocked by this news. Nelson Mandela is one of the greatest people in 20th century, I think. His bravery and decision was second to none. I hope South Africa become more developed.  I agree with your idea. This is because we should more respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. I think for this he is really great person and his characteristic is special.  I agree with you. He is one of the greatest person in the world. I think that his death is a great loss.  I totally agree with you.  Nelson Mandela is great person. I work part-time at Fuji TV and I watched many news of his death. I learned what he did. A lot of dignitary from the world came to his memorial ceremony. It shows how great he is. May his soul rest in peace.  I agree with you. We should respect him because he abolished racial discrimination.  I guess not so any people in Japan know his achievements well. However we should know his achievements and we have to take over his belief and fight against racial discrimination A lot of people must prayed that Nelson Mandela would not die. He saved many people. He made many people be smile. He brought happiness to everywhere. He is a great person. I respect him forever.  I think so. I respected him very much. It is true that even if you have purpose like him, it is rare that you act as he did. I think that he was the most greatest person in the 20th century, too. I want to follow his bravery and mental strength.  I did not know Mandela's achievement in detail. However I was surprised to hear that Everybody knows he did a lot to solve racial discrimination. And Racial discrimination is not the past thing. I think he had influence on all over the world and Nelson Mandela is the one of the best politicians of all the times.  I was not surprised when I read this article because I had already known this news. I have known him by studying world history. By being these person like him, now we can live in the peaceful world. I hope the South Aflica more develop and prosper. I respect him strongly and forever.  I know too. He is very popular person all over the world. I want to be him. I want to be person written on textbook.  I agree with you. We need to respect him and eliminate racial discrimination. (I couldn't log in my account. ) Yes, he encouraged many discriminated people. I think we should respect his mind.  I was surprised at this news because he is great people all over the world, but in Japan, I feel, there're a few news. We should not forget him and apartheid.  There is no doubt that Nelson Mandela was one of the greatest people in the world and history. He told us so many things. We should greatly respect his patience to overcome the sorrows of many persecution.  I didn't know Nelson Mandela well His anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. President in South Africa said ""Our nation has lost its greatest son. "" Thank to his effort, many people was saved. In their mind, he will continue to live. I pray his soul may rest in peace.  I also didn't know about him. I feel some irony of world that a great person are become famous after they died like some writers and artist. I could know Nelson Mandela contributed much to make equality society by this article.  I agree with your idea. I respect him and I'm so sad to hear this news. He must be one of most greatest person in the world. We should take over his will.  He was a great person, and we lost a very important piece of human history. He had something that many of us don't have. He had a strong will to make a change, and never gave up even in the most severe situation. Most of us were born with many rights and take them for granted. To remember these great people's feats may get us to think about our lives again, and then we can live more beautiful lives.  I don't think his all achievements are great. He resorted to violence to get a Black Rights. He was not always great person. But he changed his thought and he solved the problem. Finally, he became a first president as black. So I want to praise not only his achievements but also his mind of brave to change his thought for peace.  Nelson is a very wonderful person. We the yellow-skinned races were also segregated by race from ancient times. It is difficult to fight with racial discrimination and to solve racial discrimination. I think that discrimination has decreased now, thanks to Nelson etc. It is the favor which we can also be committing overseas more globally than ancient times. We have to appreciate. I think that a difficult problem will also fight like him.  I was really shocked when I heard he died. I know him well because I learned about him in the history class and in the English class and I respected him very much. I was also worried about the future of South Africa, because this country lost a grateful man.  I was shocked to hear this news. As we learned in history classes, we all know Mandela is great. He has a strong sense of justice and he has achieved a lot of great things. We don't have to forget what he did in Africa and the world forever.  I agree with you. He was great because he never gave up resisting the apartheid, and changed the world. Despite his some mistakes, I totally respect him.  I learned his achievement in the class of world history last year, so I know how great he is. it is unforgettable that all of his actions that is not simply aimed at the liberation of Black people but aimed at the equality of all people. As a result, South Africa has grown rapidly recently. I mourn for his death and I never forget his achievements.  When I was high school student, english's text book said about him. So I know him before I heard this news. And I know that he is very important for Africa. So I was very sad.  I agree with you. He did not revenge, and moved in order to improve the world. We should respect this noble spirit of his.  I think your power of expression is so amazing!!! I totally respect him very much, , , , he was great person for us! Mandela R. I. P.  I agree with you. His great characteristic finally abolishes Apartheid.  I have watched a movie whose main character is Mandela! He was great in that he never gave up getting along with people who had persecuted him. Finally he became the President of the Republic of South Africa. Now he isn't in this world, his efforts should be praised by all people and handed down from generation to generation. .  When I was a high school student, I often found his name in the world history textbook. The textbook said he fought for human rights. If he didn't do anything , many black people were still treated unfairly. So I respect him.  When I heard this news, I felt very sad because I esteem him. When I heard the story of his life for the first time, I was impressed. I think we should remember his effort and achievement.  I feel very sad when I heard the news because I personally respect him. South Africa was famous for its racism which was called apartheid. I think Nelson Mandela gave us some hints to live peacefully with another race and I hope his will will never be perished and we will take over it.  Seeing this news article, I was surprised other countries regard the ANC as terrorist. Nelson Mandela was one of the politicians in 20th century. We never forget his achievement and apartheid. I believe that all people in the world should think about racial discrimination.  I respect him because he had the firm brief and withstood adversity as a representative of black people. I think Nelson Mandela encourage not only South African but also all black people In the world. Actually, the fact Mandela become the President of South Africa was the opportunity that the right of black people was improved.  I felt the same feelings of you. I don't have a strong will, so I try to take in Nelson Mandela's will. And also I will encouraged many discriminated people and changed the political system.  I was so happy about the fact that his anti-apartheid campaign was eventually succeeded. And I think it is great that someone tells you that you are the greatest son in the nation after the one is dead. I think we should pray for him too.  I was surprised to hear that. "", His big concern was not revenge for his mistreatment, but making sure that the country remained together when Mandela was finally released 27 years later. ""This is very positive. And he held public hearings, the truth and reconciliation commission . He is fabulous.  I knew Nelson Mandela as a historical figure. So when I heard this news, I was surprised to know him as a man of today. I thought I should be curious about what is going in this world now.  I was very surprised to read this news. The reason is that I had expressed great interest in the Nelson Mandela of thinking and behavior. That his death is very sorry for me, but I'm anxious that the people who inherit of his will and ideas appear. "
JOC JOC-13B-11N 0.65 "I didn't know this news and I was surprised. Because I thought North Korea hid all the accidents like commit treasons. I don't know the intention why North Korea released this news, but I think Kim Jong Un try to attract other countries' attention. I worry the action of North Korea.  I was very surprised at this news. Because Mr. Jang Song-Thaek was killed by the real nephew. In Japan, committing murder in relative is a grave offense. I cannot kill my relative whatever they did.  The execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly that I couldn't understand what had happened in the North Korean. Moreover its politics has been unclear. Those facts have made me feel fear. The whole world also have got nervous. I hope there will not be terrible happening.  I'm very afraid of North Korea. If Kim Jong Un hates someone, he (she) will be executed. We can't allow this behavior because of the democracy. Charisma successes the autocracy in smart way for better or worse. However, Kim Jong un is going to predominant by the violence. This nation will not survive much longer.  The present North Korea government won't be able to steady. Because the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought. The government will be excluded by someone who have different thought. So, forcible governance such this doesn't result in peace. It's not confined North Korea.  I did not know this news and I was surprised at this. Because I do not quite understand this news, I want to read up on this subject.  I agree with you. We cannot allow Kim Jong Un's behavior because we are living in a democratic society, unlike despotic society of North Korea. Knowing this news, I just felt the difference of political system between North Korea and Japan. The execution of political leaders without a fair trial. . how scary is that! I sympathize with North Korean people. All I can do for them is to hope that they obtain peaceful living in the near future.  I think this news has great influence on many countries. We can't know that the reason of execution of Mr. Jang is correct, because North Korea is one of the countries that others can't see the inside of the political circumstances. This accident might have been caused by someone's intention, but the truth can't be known. Not only other countries but also the nation of North Korea don't know clearly policy of that country. It is important that other near countries watch the situation carefully.  I'm afraid of North Korea will wage war. I can't imagine what do Kim Jong Un want to do. North Korea have atomic bomb and missile, so if Kim will take charge Japan will be attacked. We have to avoid the war. But I don't know what we have to do, because North Korea is so closed country. I want North Korea to accept a proposal of conference.  I think so. The most difficult issue is nobody knows the truth of this incident. We have to pay attention against North Korea's action.  The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on not only stability of North Korea regime yet the situation of its people living in poverty. The article says that Mr. Kim tries to strengthen his power by ""resorting to 'a reign of terror, '"" but I think this kind of internal power struggle will decrease loyalty to Kim dynasty, and weaken the whole country. When a person disagrees with you, killing him is the worst way to solve the problem. It isn't even a solution. Unless Mr. Kim accepts a variety of opinions when running the government, there's no possibility that people in North Korea will live a stable life.  I agree with you. In my opinion, he disclosed the news because he tries to attract other countries' attention and say that his power is great, because there is rumor that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated.  I think this incident shows that the Kim government is losing power to control and govern the country. Kim government is at the eclipse, I think. The practice of this forcible policy means that Kim Jon'Un is hasty to gain power and control the nation but the situation isn't favorable to him . Indeed Jang was the center of the government and the man to contact foreign countries , so I wonder what the loss may cause to the country and the surrounding countries.  I was shocked when I read this article. Political donation problem of Governor of Tokyo was uncovered last month, and Naoki Inose resigned. But it is no more than the scandal about money. There are many problem which is much more terrible problem than Japan.  I worry about the future situation in North Korea very much. Because Jang Song-Thaek who was executed suddenly was handling nuclear disarmament and economic reform, and Kim Jong Un is now rejecting an international perspective, this incident may cause a bad influence on Japan. The relation between North Korea and our country is very crucial to peace in East Asia. Therefore, I want the authorities act carefully.  I was so surprised to hear the news. This execution of Jang Song-Thaek will affect the stability and social cohesion of North Korea. We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. In Japan, this circumstance is not safety because North Korea is next to Japan and any other accidents in North Korea have some connection with Japan. This accident did not received front-page coverage, and so I think that Japan news medium should report the more Asia situation. Japanese people have to become sensitized to the situation in Asia, especially Korea, North Korea and China.  I agree with your opinion. The North Korean diplomatic central figure was him so far. After he was dead, we were not able to expect an action of North Korea. Japan should not overlook their trifling action.  Jang Song would have been determined to be a hindrance for the current power. I do not know whether he thought that the ""steal the regime"", but because he had a track record and experience, it would have been regarded as dangerous elements. Anyway, the situation to decide things in power is not desirable. In addition, information manipulation is horrible, too. I wonder people of North Korea believe the reason for his downfall. I feel this news represents the unstable political situation. North Korea should be stable in good condition. However, it seems difficult in the current regime.  I did not have an idea like you until I read this comment, but I agree with your opinion. I think indeed, usually, such a fact should be hidden, too. If not research capacity of neighboring countries was adept, I think what you think is a very fact. And, I worry the action of North Korea , too.  I don't know whether Jang Song-Thaek was really bad person or not, because the central government of North Korea is corrupt. I think that not only Jang Song-Thaek but also other mandarin commit corruption. I guess Jang Song-Thaek was punished in order to suppress North Korea's bad reputation.  I do not know about this news and North Korea in detail either, however we should know them well for Japanese national interest. North Korea is the neighboring country for Japan and very dangerous.  I agree with you. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. Also its central government have so many political scandal. I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention same as you. North Korea locates very close to Japan, so we have to pay attention to the North Korea's trend.  Now I am very fearful of North Korea. I cannot imagine the feeling of killing one of the nation's leaders. We don't know whether Jang song Thaek actually made a plan of terrorism or he was corrupt in the politics. However, even if he was vicious, why did they make such an easy decision to execute him? To banish him out of the political circle was enough. A lot of countries in the world will suffer a serious loss due to his death because many of those countries maintained the relationship with North Korea by contacting with Jang song Thaek.  The execution of the second-most-powerful man has a huge impact on stability of North Korea regime. We don't know what North Korea will happen in future. The biggest problem is that nobody know the inside of the its political circumstances. We should take care of their acts.  Whether he committed to trait or not , that something will happen in South Korea may be no doubt. South Korea is nearby Japan , so we must pay attention to its movement of future.  I agree with your opinion. Kim Jong Un's actions are difficult to anticipate. So we have to cooperate with other countries such as America and South Korea. And it is also important to restrain the nation which have the possibility of giving help to keep the non-democratic political system. If this could be happen, North Korea will have no choice but to accept a proposal of conference.  He wants to say that his power is great, because there is rumor around the world that he is respected less than his father and grandfather in North Korea's government. I'm also worried that this performance may be escalated.  I did not know this news and I was surprised at it. I reconfirm that North Korea is so dangerous. If the same thing happened in Japan, I can not live comfortably.  Maybe I remember this news was on the front page and Japan news media broadcast it a lot. I think Japanese media covers enough news in other Asian countries which is related to Japan politics, economy, environment and so on. If you want to get more information about adjacent countries, you should be more willing to get them. You can find them anywhere in the Internet.  This news shows that Kim Jong-Un tries to make North Korea more despotic. Although, even up to now, Kim Il Sung and Kim Jong Il sometimes executed some politicians for their treasonable acts, they never punished their relatives because North Korean was a Confucian country. However, Kim Jong-Un killed Jang Song-Thaek, his uncle-in-law, and furthermore, abused him by calling him ""a brutal ambitious traitor"" and ""lesser than dogs"". The detailed reasons why he was punished is not clear, but the certain fact that this news shows is that North Korea is becoming a dangerous despotic country and increasing military strength.  Can we interfere other nation's domestic politics when it is clear that its leader cannot govern the country properly? I think it is one of the discussion-provoking points of international law and politics.  Either did I understand what actually happened in North Korea and why. It's really confusing.  North Korea is not democratic country, so it is useless to criticize the country unless its political system changes. However, achieving this is very difficult. So democratic countries should cooperate and do economic sanctions. If these countries do that, North Korea may collapse or follow our direction and change political system.  I do not think Jang Song-Thaek was killed by his nephew. The central government of North Korea have so many corruptions. Jang Song-Thaek possessed powerful authority, so I guess this accident is also caused by someones intention not by Kim Jong Un.  I was surprised to hear this news, because Kim Jong Un killed his own uncle. This story is like in the age of wars. In Japan, a long time ago, there were struggle for power among the family. I knew again how outdated North Korea is!! I was very surprised at this news. I really think North Korea is dangerous because if Jang Song-Thaek is a really bad person, I will never kill blood relative person. And I feel that there is a lot of person who does an injustice in North Korea. I want to why.  I agree with your idea, this is because I think the government tends to exclude people who have different in thought too. I think the North Korea government is hard dictatorship. I think it is very serious problem and we need to think more seriously.  I didn't know this news in detail. However, when I researched about this news in the other day, I was very surprised. I think that it is a bad thing which he kills key person in government. I hope North Korea become peace country.  I agree with you. I am afraid of North Korea. I cannot forget the news that All of North Korean were crying when Kim Jong iI died. I don't want to visit that country.  I disagree with you. South Korea is the country dominated by the dictator. This kind of country , kill one's relative is usual I think.  I think this news shows that the government can't control and govern their country. However we cannot predict that what influence to the world the current condition of this country make. I hope a new war will not happen.  I disagree with you. I think Mr. Jang Song-Thaek was not killed by the real nephew. But I have no reason.  Kim Jong Un killed his uncle Jang Song-Thaek. That's so terrible. He killed his relative so easily. I cannot believe this. So sad. This news made me rethink of NK.  Kim Jong-Un was scared that many politicians of the North Korea highly trusted Chang Song-Thaek. Now he was executed, it is said that the dictatorship of Kim will get much bigger. The nation around the North Korea should try to monitor and put pressure on the country.  It's horrible to read this news. we can't see inside the country, but other countries try to solve this problem because if people in the country try, there will be many people to be killed. I hope that some people in the world will try after knowing the situation through this news article.  The news shocked me! And I don't know North Korean government will want to do. I think North Korea is a secret and hidden country. So I want to know the country more. The country is on my mind. I will want to check their actions from now on.  Now, I know this news for the first time. I'm worried about North Korea. There're some dangerous remark.  I disagree with you. North Korea is not democracy. So this country is not in use our common sense. It is very sad thing but it is the fact.  After I read this news, I think there is possibility that Kim John Un do something alike this incident. I don't know the real intention why Kim Jong Un killed his nephew, but I think he wanted to attract other countries' attention. I hope he won't do some terrible things for this purpose.  I can't understand why he can kill his uncle by himself. Probably, his intention is maintaining his power. If so, the action is insane or lunatic. In fact, the action is must be a failure. The North Korea lost confidence in China. Anyway, we must pay attention to The North Korea.  I agree with you. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world.  I think it is a horrible news. I heard that hundreds of people who have connection with Mr. Jang was also going to be executed. It is of course unbelievable to hear this kind of news now in 21 century, but actually most of us cannot see the things without the perspective of Western. So if we say something against the systems of North Korea, we don't and shouldn't have any influence on them.  I at first know this news by the internet. I can't believe this news. Everyone may be a traitor in the North Korea. In Japan, this news was seldom reported by TV. I think people should know this news more.  I was very shocked by this news and I also very interested in this kind of information. Considered by the fact that he often meet the Japanese governor instead of Kim, Mr. Jang was sure to be vital character for attacking the some problems of Japan-North Korea relationship.  When I heard this news, I was little shocked because Kim John Un killed his uncle . I don't know the real intention of him, but I guess he did this because he wanted to attract other countries' attention. There are possibility that North Korea do something dangerous to attract other countries attention, so we should continue to monitor situation carefully.  I was very shocked to hear this news. Kim John Un killed his uncle. It cannot be happened in democratic nation. I think unless North Korea is opened, there is no knowing what they will do next. I am afraid that they stand alone from the world.  I was very shocked about this news. This is because I also afraid about future of North Korea's government. If Kim John Un think he want to change or improve the country, he need to change and answer the attention from foreign country. North Korea is neighbor country for Japan so that Japanese government should attract North Korea carefully.  I think the government of North Korea is more fragile than China. The first leader of the North Korea won the people's popularity and was charismatic. The second leader succeeded the deification of himself and the nuclear experiment. However, the third leader, yet obtained big achievement like his father and the grandfather. Unlike the former leaders, he cannot rule the country by himself. I think the destruction of the Kim regime is near.  First, I couldn't understand what happened in North Korea. Because the execution of Jang Song-Thaek was so suddenly. From old days, their politics has been unclear. Everyone wishes that this country soon becomes peaceful.  Me too. Because the information is very few, we could not understand about that country correctly. "
JOC JOC-14B-04N 1.14 "I always hear this news recently. I respect these people and I am proud of them as a Japanese. I often use blue LED light at my house. If there is not this light, our life will become very inconvenient. Nakamura gets only a settlement of 84, 400 million yen though he did so splendid invention. The settlement is too small. Because Nichia Corp gained more money by his invention, I think that the company should pay the settlement that is suitable for Nakamura. Anyway, I hope that an inventor such as Nakamura appears again.  I didn't know the patent trial. However, I have heard that the conditions of research in Japan is not good. So I was not very surprised at the news. We are proud of them. But we should not be just glad. To keep up with other countries, we must change the current environment.  His invention is really splendid. I wonder why it took time so far until invention of LED was awarded as the Nobel Prize. We can decrease the number of times of replacing an electric bulb and it becomes much brighter than conventional bulb by using LED. I think that the invention is also very ecological. I hope that many people use LED all over the world and their lives become more comfortable. Mr. Nakamura should be acclaimed more.  It is quite natural that he should complaint of his reward. I think he is cool, and hope his desire will come true.  He seems a bit too extreme. He acts as if he made success on his own and the Nichia Corp is completely malicious. But I wonder if it is really true. There is the fact that the company's risky funding drove him (and his co-worker and subordinates) into the invention of the blue LED. Although his initial bonus from the company is very low and his resentment was surely natural, I felt it is not reasonable that he alone get paid as much as 844 million yen.  I didn't know the cruel treatment for investors in Japan. I don't understand Nichia Corp employ him under cruel condition in spite of the great invention, the blue LED. I was amazed he worked hard in such treatment. His pride would be hurt. Though now he is American, Japan should treat engineer well in own country because they are promising persons in the future.  I have already heard that the conditions of research in Japan is not good, too. I think that there is too little remuneration to Nakamura even if Japan is such situation. It was related, too, and Nakamura has gone to the foreign country. The development of the technology is indispensable for development of Japan. So, to leave a scientist in Japan, I also think Japan should change the current environment for scientist.  We think using LED is normal, but it is fortunate thing. Many scientists overcame difficulties and put forth unrelenting effort, so various technology have advanced and we live comfortably. We should express our thanks to any scientists.  Japanese government should take this opportunity for some reflection. Japanese government must prevent the outflow of technological to other countries. I think the protection of engineers is the issue of the future of Japan. It is necessary thing for maintain global competitiveness. We should guard the interests of the developer through patents. To the end, engineers need to receive reasonable compensation. Aggressive behavior in a Japanese company should not be overlooked. This bonus is too cheap. Mr Nakamura may well get angry.  At first I was glad to hear that a Japanese won the Nobel Prize. However, I read this article, and some opinions changed. Nakamura must have fought against a company to protect the thing which I invented. Japan should take right measures to protect an inventor like Nakamura.  I heard this news before. Needless to say, I think that it should be praised what he won the Nobel Prize. However, I think that you should attract attention about the hard distance that he walked so far. I think that the Japan support for the engineer is lighter than other developed countries. When it may look like it, they want to study it in other countries. It is obvious that this may lead to the outflow of the Japanese engineer. This news is happy, but I think that it is the news that can attract attention for the problem of Japan.  Though there are many great scientist in Japan, the condition of research is not good in Japan. In Japan, there are many scientists who want to conduct big research but they don't have enough money for that. I think if Japanese science research condition is improved and paid more subsidy for scientists, they can conduct big research in Japan and more nobel prize winner may appear from Japan! After I read this news, I thought how nice this plan is! Although quickly practicing may cause many trouble, but this plan will give us a big dream. If it is achieved soon, we can live in SF world. It will become more fun. For human, Flying in the sky freely is a kind of dream. Although now we can ride a plane, this car can make a big dream come true.  When I read this article, I thought scientists in Japan should receive a high salary if they accomplish greatly in their research. Japan has been said for a long time the scientific and technological powerhouse. If we have the vast research results of scientists, this country won't be developed. In spite of Mr. Nakamura played a great achievement , Japanese company did not pay enough salary. Although it is solved in the court, he left Japan by changing the nationality. If this situation continues, international competitiveness in science and technology of Japan will increasingly be reduced. I think it is important to evaluate scientists who has achieved excellent results correctly.  When Mr. Nakamura invented the blue LED, I was surprised that he received only 20000 yen. I can imagine how he felt about it. This shows that how little Japan government and companies support for scientists or engineers. He sued for the firm, after all, he received 844 million yen, however, he contributed it to other group of scientists. If he did not sue the scientists and engineers would have been ignored. I think his action was worthy of praise. After this chance I hope many Japanese scientists try to widen their sphere of activity.  I think this news suggest that the environment for people doing research of Japan is bad. THus I think the government should give money for research not to company but individual.  I think so too. Japanese government should support scientist.  I think so too. However, when I heard recent news, I changed my opinion. It is true that Japan has to cherish scientists , investors and researchers. But each environment of Japan and America has good points and bad points. So this is a difficult problem.  What Nakamura did for gain more bonus was meaningful. Knowing they will acquire more money whey they achieve something, they would work hard to invent so research. Motivation is extremely important in inventing new things. It seems to me that Japanese mass media tend to emphasize it too much when ""Japanese"" people won something or achieved something great. The reason for this is not very clear, but it might be because Japanese are very proud of their own nation.  Recently, I often heard this news. I suppose many Japanese are interested in Nobel Prize and they feel happy when achievement of Japanese is selected as Nobel Prize. However, I think we have to remember many Japanese scientists expect for Nobel winners are doing every research .  Now his nationality is not Japanese. As the proverb says ""It is no use crying over spilt milk. "" It is true that, his invention is so magnificent . The crux of this story is not that he won the Nobel Prize but which nationality he belongs to.  I was very impressed when I read the article, because I felt Mr Nakamura's passion directly. And I thought such a person would influence and change our society. There are many people who have complains to our society, but almost all of them would keep it only in their mind. This doesn't change any situation, so we should move as him actively. When many people move like him, the society must become better.  I agree with you. Japan's economy is based on engineers. Because our car industry and electronics are powerful. So they should be more respected in the system. More rewarded, more social status.  I agree with you. Japan's economy is based on engineers. Because our car industry and electronics are powerful. So they should be more respected in the system. More rewarded, more social status.  Good idea! The government should give money for individual scientists! I realized that Japanese researchers are more badly treated than foreign researchers. So, I think corporation should endeavor to assure proper treatment of researchers.  I agree with you. Their study cost enormous expenses and their valuable time. The company and the government should pay the settlement that is suitable for people doing research to bring up them. A certain investment is necessary so that big dreams come true. I hope that an inventor such as Nakamura appears again, too.  It is widely known that Japanese science and technology level is high. But I often hear that treatments of scientist is worse in Japan than in other developed country. To develop Japanese science and technology, it is needed to improve treatment of scientists.  I think so too. All over the world, there are many things that perform with blue LED. We use such a technology as common thing. But, Not only Nichia corporation but also we have to feel thankful for inventors such as Nakamura.  I agree with your opinion. I think there are still some people who encounter unjust treatment like Nakamura. So, the Japanese Government must consider a counter plan for this problem.  I really think three Japanese nobel winner is very awful! I respect them and they must be worthy of being honored by everyone. So, Japanese government and companies must strive for improving the environment of scientists. If they do so, the Japanese circles of science will more and more develop.  I think that the company in Japan should think a great deal of investors. It is true that the most important thing for a company is to make as much money as possible. However, they had not made any money without investors. Furthermore, international companies give investors more money than companies in Japan do because it is ""global standards"". We have to introduce this theory.  I disagree with you. The Nichia Corp should have treated him more considerately. The company could not have made a lot of money without him. It is true that the company supported him financially. However, money can not buy flashes of genius.  I agree with your opinion. There is not enough satisfied condition to research something for scientist in Japan. I wish the environment for research is improved in order to develop scientific technology in Japan.  I feel I could understand the suffering of scientists a little by reading this article. Indeed, Nichia's treat to Mr. Nakamura was improper and couldn't be justified, but it's interesting for me that he could get a Nobel prize due to anger and effort occurred from that misfortune.  I have heard this news before. I think that Japan's help for the scientists is bad. Scientists have developed Japan's science. We always need their effort and always thank them. But oppositely, an engineer has been taken the attitude which doesn't pay off for the thanks. We should thank them more and help more.  His invention is really splendid. I think that the company in Japan should think a great deal of investors. Though companies should make money as much as possible, they should make an investment in scientists.  I agree with you. The engineer deserves the credit for all the past development of Japan. So the government and the companies help them and should invest future engineers.  I completely agree with you. Japanese inventor should be given more money. Our life was supported by science technology, so inventor's contribution is bigger than we think.  I approve your opinion, too. I'm happy that Japanese wisdom is admitted by the world. Japanese rise of the scientific level would bring benefit to Japan.  I agree with you. Japanese government and company is not good. They must take measures to meet a situation of Japanese scientist.  I was very happy to hear this news and respect them. However I complain about the environment surrounding them. In Japan, environment surrounding them is not as good as in other countries. If this situation continues, there will be no Japanese noel winner. For scientists and Japanese development, we should improve this situation.  I think his opinion passes thorough argument. Certainly, they are amateur of law. But, it's possible to cover it with making education of a law. Not that this system is bad, but the case that the people have no legal literacies is a problem.  Although his opinion have a point, I still think that he think too much of ""a genus"". It may be true that money cannot buy flashes of genius, it can actually ""invest"" money and other workers in their ability. And it is ""the investment"" that enable Mr. Nakamura to invent the LED. His invention was accomplished not by his own, but by the company as a whole. It's a natural thing to gain profit from the investment. The Nichia Corp won the bet, after all.  If researchers weren't evaluated, they wouldn't motivate to invent new things. In Japan there are a lot of major industrial electronics manufacturers, Sony, NEC, Panasonic, and so on. On the other hand, Korean corporation, SAM SUNG, developed rapidly, because they hired away Japanese superior researchers from Japanese major industrial electronics manufacturers. So I think it important that companies treat researchers considerately.  This comment make me assent. Therefore her opinion about this problem has consistency, so for readers , it is easy to understand. I think most Japanese are not good at saying ""No"" or ""I can't"", too. This is a bad point. I also think we should learn other country's system. "
JOC JOC-14B-10N 0.24 "I think that his action is too rash. Participating in the war freely in Syria is bringing about confusion in Japan. Although Japan has the Self-Defense Forces, it never does such action. Also he participated as a combatant of the radical Islamic group which has had big influence all over the world so I think that it is unavoidable that he is recognized as a person antisocial by the Japanese government.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. Because the era is people can fight easily. He is so selfish at the point which he go back Japan as having a dangerous experience. On the hands sly loan people can't run away. He acted only the reason that he want to know what life and death were . He want to go and fought at Islam. As he was satisfied , next he go back to Japan. His action like that is careless. I was worried about having an effect on Japanese people who long to fight. He should do something to finish wars many things for Syrian people , making use of his special experience.  I think the happiness cannot be decided by anyone but the person himself. , so if a man seem to be happy because of his status or property, maybe he does not feel he is happy. In Japan, I think there are many people who feel unhappy despite of their objective happiness. The man in this news is one of such people, and he want the meaning of his presence. I want him to know that there are many people who have nothing and dread being implicated in war.  I cannot understand his action and thought. Participating in the war voluntarily means that to go to seek the death in danger. I think the era that he has been bullied creates him now. I was sad when I read this article. It is impossible for me that there is Japanese who want to participate in the war. The drift of Japanese is toward against war. It is because that Japan has experienced many hardships by many of the victims of the war. However, I think that his remark, ""Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world"", is not wrong. We talk about world affairs without knowing the real world. It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. I hope that there is no war from this world.  I cannot understand that he thinks. He proceeds to the battle front to fight naturally. It brings Japan confusion and will have some influences on the world. If there is the basic cause for bullying, it may be a serious problem. I don't know the small international situation, but the war may be taking place from the imminent place.  I agree to your opinion. There will be a lot of people feeling uneasy to hear this news. I will have an influence on the world by his careless action as well as Japan. Such an action is very dangerous in the world where does not know what happens. It hide possibility to cause big damage to not only oneself but also another person. I think that a careful action is demanded anytime when I have anything to do with the world.  I think Japanese should think the conflicts between Islam and Christianity. Japanese traditional religions do not have features of Monotheism. And Islam is not familiar in Japan. So what we must do now is to study the Koran and fully understand it. After that, Japanese would understand Islamic State is not based on the way of Islamic thinking. So it is suspicious the existence of IS itself. I want to ask him that he really understand Islam and what he does. I think he does not. when we communicate with foreign people. It is necessary to understand the ethos of them. And in their backgrounds, there are always religions.  I can not understand his feeling. The life is more important than any other thing for me. I think that Syria is a very dangerous place, so his action is unbelievable for me even if he has any reason.  When finished reading the article, I took his words, ""Japan is a Galapagos society. Most adults have no idea what goes on in the real world. "" very seriously. I cannot image his fierce experiences and the situation completely, but I can know these facts by reading books, hearing people and watching TV etc. We, live in a peace and Galapagos society don't seem to pay attentions to such situation of the world. However, we should do that to know the real world, and think what we can do for that.  I was surprised at there was the person who committed a crime of Preparations or Plots for Private War. Surely it is important to see what happens in the world by our own eyes, but he crossed a line that shouldn't be crossed. He should have choked back personal desire, and I think it is not for him to participate the war, but to embark on ridding the war.  When I read article, I was so surprised, and I cannot understand his action. Almost of people around the world do not want to take part in a war. Nevertheless, he tried to take part in a war. I really cannot understand his action and feeling. I think that he must respect his life in any circumstances.  I agree with your opinion. I think that there are a little people who can understand his action and feeling. He must respect his life in any circumstances.  I think his behavior is too reckless and too childish. In a war, not only soldiers but also civilians are in danger, so it's best if we can avoid such a dangerous situation. Nothing is more precious than human's life. However, he went to Syria, the belligerent nation and he would be helping to kill people. I can't understand what he thinks. Whatever he assert, I never agree with his action.  I was surprised Japanese person converted to Islam and fought at Islam war. At the same time , I feel so sad. I can't understand his actions and behavior. I hope that there is no war from this world.  I respect of Mr. Uzawa because he is really active and brimful of intellectual curiosity. Converting to Islam is little going too far , but I reconfirm that having much of life makes a person of great depth.  I was so surprised that Japanese man fights at the Islam war and I respect him. However, I hate the war so I hope the war will be vanish.  I read Asahi Shimbun, and learned about this news. When this article in a general news page, I was a lot surprised. It's because it wasn't believed that one ordinary Japanese youth goes to a trouble area personally. The behavior which doesn't think back to such danger threatens the life of the youths. I don't know whether the relief disposal is in Japan. But it may be the one which is when Japan thinks why the youths go to a trouble area.  He just should be the member of the SDF If he likes fighting. I cannot understand his idea. His action is illegal in our country. Why should he go to Syria? I think the root of this issue is the social structure of Japan. Japanese young people have few money. Young people cannot make dreams and disappoint with the society. I think this is not a personal problem but social problem in Japan.  I agree your ideas but please let me to mention my thought. I, you and also other people would not like to join the war. However he does. Though we cannot understand his ideologies, we should not criticize them.  This news was very shocking for me. We first surprised, it is that he could easily be in contact with the Islamic countries. This Tsu I indicates a problem that is happening in Islam that we also are familiar. Such a conflict in the Middle East was surprised to second longer it is that it has become not what religious. This means that I said to be a negative legacy was born by globalization. In any case, it must act accordingly to such incidents from occurring I agree with you. Young people today, including he and I, do not what a war is like, so it some of them do not understand how dangerous and misery a war is. This incident shows us that there is possibility that Japan will be involved in war. we should make effort to protect it! First, I am very interested in this article, so I have various feelings. His comment is the very comment which get my feeling. Moreover, as he said, ""It is the most important to face to the real world on discussing the international situation. "", this comment is very important for me.  Surprise and ""Respect"" that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination.  'Surprise' and 'Respect' that sums it up. To begin with, I wish the war will come to an end. His vitality and belief are beyond my imagination. "
JOC JOC-14B-29N 0.4 "I love British Royal Family's involvement in a wide range of activities that called ""Noblesse oblige. "" Especially Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge are popular and very influential among people. So their activities will make international relations be better one I think.  They are very popular around the world. Their activities are admirable. It is said that Americans like ""royalty "". Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. He devotes himself to government affairs. There are various opinions about royalty. But their attitudes is wonderful.  I like this kind of news very much, especially related to prince William and Catherine because I'm interested in Britain. They are very famous and popular even in Japan but I didn't have enough knowledge about activities by Royal Family's. Therefore, after reading this article, I wanted to search about their activities more and more and could get information! I knew about ""Noblesse oblige"" in detail and I found this idea very nice. Actually, I cannot experience their activities and feelings but I imagine that they have both good points and burdens. I think that ""what they do"" is very important and has a great influence on people all over the world, so in this article, I think it's very nice to visit a child development center and the happening that Catherine was mistaken for being a princess from Frozen made me laugh. As a lot of people pay attention to activities by Royal family, I think they are so admirable and have great meanings. I hope that they can help to promote relationship between countries.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much. I watched the TV broadcasting of their marriage ceremony in 2011. I felt so, so happy to watch it! And I am looking for seeing their second baby. I want them to come to Tokyo with their children. I believe that their visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  I think their visit to the U. S is not the one which is criticized because the U. S has no royalty and royal family is very popular among American. Indeed there is a serious problem about shooting or choking black guy by white police officer in the U. S, but it's quite irrelevant to the UK and duke and duchess are popular even among black people, for example Lebrone James mentioned above. Therefore, their visit made a good effect on the country, I think.  I also drink tea everyday and I think drinking tea is quite natural in Japan and I'm strongly proud of this custom. He says we have to cherish our custom and I sympathize with his attitude to our grate tradition.  I liked and agreed with your comments. in the era of international exchange, British Royal Familys attitude may become the model for viaduct of peace. Their popularity and sincere attitude will be the model which we should follow. Although some have negative opinion about them but I think they are wonderful and good symbol of UK.  When I read this news, I was very surprised. I am very interested in British royal family. So, this event make me glad. I always thought that people of the non-royal family did not associate with the royal family. By this matter, the way of thinking of people was replaced. Triggered by this, I hope that the relations of all the countries of the world become better.  I love Prince William and Catherine very much, too and I also felt happy. The second baby is born soon. This will bring joy in the world. By this matter, i hope the relationships among many countries become better and better.  This comments said that ""it's wrong for sure to invade human rights. "" I especially sympathized this. I also think Japan's attitude toward immigrants and asylum-seekers and PRAJ should change a policy. For these reasons, I strongly agree with this comment.  It's because his opinion is too extreme, that I can't sympathize with his comment. You can't agree to the comment which has only tea. When drinking too much even if it's good for a body, it's bad for a body.  The royal couple is very famous around the world. so, this activity make us happy. Originally, I like the British royal family. After I read this article, I like this couple more and more. They have very big power. So, I think that they should use this power for peace of world.

If their power is used to become peaceful in the world, I think that you should be used at many opportunities.  I very love this couple, and they loved a lot of people in the world. I can't wait to see their baby! I hope they will come Japan. And I think Emperor of Japan also do such activities too. Prince William and Catherine's attitudes is very wonderful.  I agree with your opinion. When I watch this couple, I feel happy! I hope they visit to many countries conducts relationship betweens countries to better course.  It is because I am same as her opinion ""drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking. "" I think everything is said excessive much as possible too. We should control myself.  The royal couple is very famous in the world and has an enormous influence, so they are being taken notice by the world all of the time. Superficially their life is simply magnificent and bright, not only that, but they live with struggling with a heavy feeling. Their word and action can have a powerful influence on the international situation in a positive and negative way. They are in the terrific position. I anew notice that by read your comment.  British Royal Family is loved by people all over the world. William and Catherine took the world by storm 4 years ago. This time they are given attention, too.

I want them to help restoration of diplomatic relations all of the world.  They are popular and famous all over the world. So they have a great influence on people all over the world. I believe that their visiting can improve relationship of many countries.  In this article, what is important is the easiness. Article says drinking tea in daily life is good. They doesn't mention about how useful it is. I think his comment is way off the mark.  I was interested in his comment. However, he said that he will drink tea only. I am worry about his health. And I want him to understand drinking too much tea is bad for your health. I want tell him that it is not good to be too in everything.  I think so too! Their work is the most peaceful to cooperate nations without any interests. Their actions are likely to be mistaken for easy work. In this case, they received the message ""You want to see our city, but do you care about our problems?"". But I believe their actions make good relationship between british and other countries. I want them to continue this event too.  It's a heart-warming news. Most of the news on this site seem to be very serious, so I was relieved, reading this article. I like them, and wonder when they will visit Japan.  Me too. I'm looking forward to seeing them.  First, I knew this fact before Iread. second, three cups a day is not ""only"" for me.  I am surprised at that so many classmates love Prince William and Catherine!! I also love them very much, too. Their marriage in 2011 was social event on a global scale. Of course, I watched the marriage ceremony on TV. I want Japanese Imperial Household to be loved many people in the world like them. If they have the second baby, I hope their visit to Tokyo with their children. Their visit to countries will make the relationship between the countries better, I think.  The royal couples are known around the world. Maybe, a lot of people love them. I am one of them. This couple has power to make people be happy. I think they can help to improve relationships of many countries.  I think so, too. This news make us calm. I hope they come to Japan! I approve your opinion, too. Behavior of a royal family can have a good impression very much. I'm interested in continuation of an exchange with non-royal family.  I like this news and the British royal couple. They are very famous all over the world and have a great influence of action. For the peace of the world, I want their couple to visit all over the world and contribute to the peace. "
JOC JOC-15B-02N 0.25 "I am against the laws because the laws haven't won sufficient public understanding. As Prime Minister Abe said, this laws have a close connection with our daily lives. So I think it is strange that citizens don't understand it well as sovereigns. I want Prime Minister Abe to explain it more carefully and give us more time to discuss it. The Constitution of Japan declares in its preamble that ""sovereign power resides with the people. "" However the bills have already passed into the laws, so we should think how to treat the laws.  I think these bills must help keeping Japan's peace, people's life, and nation. This bills will be able to make an offer many tactical options of political and military. For example, for these bills, Japan Self Defense Forces (JSDF) can rush to help private citizens when they are in combat zone. Until now, JSDF couldn't help citizens although native. Today, there are many risk of terrorism over the world and we can't know where terrorism occurred so if peoples are caught terrorism, we have to hold options to help these peoples. On the other hand, JSDF will be able to defense other countries forces, especially US Forces. Japan has the Japan-US Security treaty but this treaty is a little slanted. In recent years, Japan's security environment is being sharper and sharper so Japan government want to build up defense capability by strengthening relationship between Japan and USA. I can understand this thinking. I can supports thinking of these bills, but I oppose its because of the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution. These bills has many defect of consistency from the ninth article of the Japanese Constitution so if government want to get contents of these bills, we should discuss amendment of the Constitution and change the articles.  I agree passed this Controversial security bills because I think there are needs which collective self-defense in a limited way in Japan. Of course, I can understand people who are against the laws. I think Abe haven't won sufficient public understanding too. But I don't understand opinion that railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make dilutions of grandeur I had not have a good image about Shinzo Abe, because he didn't respect the opinions of Japanese and put the law of taxes into force. This time also he passed one law in force without Japanese's opinions, so I cannot come to like him. His decision about Japanese security bills must change its safety, so it is natural that the Japanese get angry. This Abe's eloquent but ambiguous speech had directed Japan to war again, I think. In addition, I think that Prime Minister Abe should make his opinion clearly for the Japanese. Probably, they aren't be convinced, but they can think a little that he has no choice in security bills. This his betting is so risky and might break people's life someday.  When I heard about the bill for the first time, I disagreed with the right of collective self-defense because it will lead Japan to be involved in a war. However, as I investigated about the right for myself, I could fully understand the right and the bill, I changed my idea to agree with the bill. I realized that the right will be used under limited conditions, so it won't lead Japan to be in danger and also it help to strength the connection between Japan and the USA for the world safety and that of Japan it self. In my opinion, the prime minister Abe should have explained more about the bill and the right of collective self-defense which it includes. If he explains detail about the bill to the public, more and more people will be convinced and stop to abject to the action of the Diet. I hope the prime minister Abe to consider more about his situation and be conscious about the citizen. Anyway, this bill changed the Japan's defense policy and is the turning point of its history.  I agree with your opinion. I also think that Abe should talk about his opinion more clearly for people's agreement. I don't like his action to pass the bill firmly without paying attention to the public opinion. There was demonstration in front of the Diet for several weeks to show their opposition to the bill, so Abe must have known about the circumstance in Japan. He has to deal with the public who still disagrees with the bill. It is the problem for entire nation, so it should not be ignored.  I agree with your opinion. It was strange that the governing bloc put the security bills to a vote before negotiations between representatives from ruling and opposition parties and gaining the understanding of the citizens. It was no exaggeration to say that the bills was rammed through the Diet. It is contrary to democracy. Prime Minister Abe were too hasty in passing security-related bills into law. The theme is very important because it will have a big influence on our future. So, I wanted Abe to listen to citizens' voices more seriously. I'm afraid democracy in Japan is becoming a mere name.  I was hearing on the spot the vote in peace special committee of the House of Councilors. While people didn't know what happened the bill passed. It isn't good that this important bill pass in this way. They should not submit together some bills in a hurry. They should discuss each bills carefully and pass them. They need to assess what Japan needs to do or not to do. But It isn't good to opposite simply. We should go next selection and express our ideas.  I don't agree your opinion because government explain the content of the law and also mass communications reported many information(put thought true or false). Even if you can't understand the bill's content, it is your shortage of studying. Now there are internet and there are many information about it, so if you can't understanding you should research in internet. Join the politics is the duty of nations. You should study from now I agree with you. This bill make Japan's security more safety and stronger. Japan self defense forces have more way them action and it means our security level will go up. Recently, Japan's security environment is going to be sharper and sharper especially in the East Asia. It is better that we have many way to be able to do military action. I also agree with your opinion about railroading of the 'war bills' that constitute a violation of the Constitution by critics. People should not be deceived exaggeration and make delusions of grandeur. Making the way to security stronger is the natural for nation.  I sure this problem is the most difficult recently and I cannot expect what happens from now on. In Japan, It was a pro and con but Because LDP forced a vote, LDP receive much criticism. To be frank, I think it is natural. I was not able to believe they forced a vote though the Diet is so desolate, you know. By the way, this security bill has the good aspect and the bad aspect, I think. Now there are various menaces in the world. So it is necessary to cooperate between countries, and to get over it. This bill promises it and It is convenient with the aspect. But the other hand, we may be rolled up in the war of other countries. Japan promise not to do not make war in constitution Article 9. However, we may break the promise by the security bills. There is no way for us to know what will happen to it. Young people must make an effort not to worsen. I think that it is up to us.  I oppose right of collective self-defense. It's because I think there is a possibility that a war starts with using this law. Prime Minister Abe denies its possibility, but I think you retaliate certainly when attacking a partner to protect the people. And I think that's repeated. Japan is very peaceful now, so I think I don't want to break this living. And I'm opposite to how to make them do formation of this law. I think the explanation to Prime Minister Abe's people and other councilors wasn't enough. I thought I wanted you to establish after I spent time and convinced the people and other councilors more.  I am not against this law but, they should have made the opportunity to discuss about this matter more. Prime Minister Abe cannot avoid being criticized, because I don't think he stepped the right process. I had a opportunity to talk with the professor Mr. Hosoya in Keio University. He is the professor in department of Political Science. He explained us the details about the security bill over an hour and I was pretty convinced by his explanation. So I think if they explain more explicitly for Japanese nations, there might have not be the demonstrations against the law. "
ACA ACA-A6U-002 1.83 "‘HER DRESS HANGS HERE': DE-FROCKING THE KAHLO CULT Oriana Baddeley The 1990s have witnessed a shift in the art establishment's attitudes towards art produced outside of its traditional parameters. The work of previously marginalised artists has become an area of rich speculation among art dealers priced out of the ‘modern masters’ market. Almost every year has witnessed the discovery of new artistic terrain — graffiti art, Soviet art, Australian art, the art of Latin America. The major auction houses have moved with the times and have found new ways of selling works which in both form and content would have proved an unstable investment a decade ago. The current status of the work of the Mexican painter Frida Kahlo is a dramatic example of this change. Once known primarily as the wife of Diego Rivera, her reputation outside of Mexico now far supercedes his: since 1919, sale room estimates of her work have risen from $40,000 to over $1 million, and in 1990 a work by Kahlo broke all records at Sotheby's New York for a Latin American artist. The enormous rise in the economic value of her work has developed in tandem with the increased critical and popular response to her particular blend of naive style and incisive content. While the first wave of popular interest arose with the 1982 Whitechapel exhibition instigated by Laura Mulvey and Peter Wollen, it was the publication of Hayden Herrera's biography of Kahlo in 1983 which has led to her current cult status. Since that date she has been the subject of TV documentaries, a feature film (‘Frida’ by Paul Leduc), a stage play, numerous publications and the inspiration for designer clothing. In May 1989 Elle magazine ran a 16 page feature on Frida Kahlo as the ‘spirit of Mexico’(Fig. 1), while in Vogue (Feb. 1990) there was a 10 page interpretation of ‘the romance of Frida Kahlo's Mexico’(Fig. 2). Almost as a logical outcome of this media blitz, it emerged in the summer of 1990 that Madonna, already a devotee of Kahlo's work, was commissioning a screenplay based on Kahlo's life. Fig. 1. Elle Magazine , May 1989, p. 18–19. As with most artists who have become mythical personalities in the popular imagination, such attention has focused primarily on the anecdotal and tragic details of Kahlo's admittedly fascinating life. The passionate obsession with her husband Diego Rivera, her flamboyant appearance, but most of all her physical and emotional pain have come to dominate responses to her work. While Kahlo's art helped her to deal with the vicissitudes of her life, for most audiences it is her life story which allows access to her art. In this one can draw obvious parallels to the appeal of Van Gogh, a traditionally popular artist recently made fashionable by the media attention generated during the centennial of his death. The archetypal dropout/spiritualist became an appropriate icon for the sixties revival of 1990's long hot summer. Yet despite the iconic status of Van Gogh's ‘tragic’ life, it is the appearance of his work by which he is ultimately signified, his thick impasto brush-stroke, his vibrant yellows, the urgency of his creative drive. In the case of Kahlo the popular image is of the artist herself, the characteristic brows, the elaborate hair, the Mexican costume (Fig. 3). It is primarily her appearance, not the formal language of her art, that has graced the pages of Elle and Vogue magazines. The Elle feature transposed the ‘Kahlo style’ to Kahlo lookalikes in contemporary clothing balanced around segments of Herrera's biography of  the artist. In the later Vogue piece only the style remained as the far more overtly sexual, Kahloesque models lounged and pouted in their ‘Mexican’ interiors. There is a poignant irony in the way clothing, which on one level served to hide Kahlo's broken body, falls or is lifted by the model to reveal a luxuriantly perfect physique (Fig. 4). The visual references in the two magazines are as much from photos of the artist as from her work. In both features she is also seen to embody a wider set of assumptions about Mexico itself; exotic, passionate, yet constantly struggling against pain and deceit. While Elle, Vogue and subsequently The Independent (Fig. 5), stressed different facets of Kahlo's public persona, they all shared the emphasis on ‘her’, as an encapsulisation of stereotypical images of Mexico, rather than her work. It is her body as the canvas, her appearance as art. The art of self-expression becomes self-expression as art. Fig. 2. Vogue , February 1990, p. 130–1. Fig. 3. Elle Magazine , May 1989, p. 28. Of course, the line between art and life is a particularly hard one to draw in Kahlo's case. The majority of her work is self portraiture; her aesthetic concerns grew from her fascination with the falsity of appearance. Dressing up, role playing and masquerade form the conceptual basis of Kahlo's work. In Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair (1944)(Fig. 6), she paints herself wearing Rivera's suit, challenging traditional expectations of femininity and attempting to appropriate his authority (while simultaneously) threatening castration). More disturbingly, in The Mask (1945)(Fig. 7), she throws doubt on too straightforward a reading of her self-portraits as revealing of her inner emotions. Where does the mask fall: Does not the ritual repetition of those familiar features ‘mask’ far more than it uncovers? There is, however, an inevitable logic to the appropriation of her meticulously constructed image, a process which the artist was mocking as early as 1933: ‘…some of the gringa women are imitating me and trying to dress ‘a la Mexicana’, but the poor souls only look like cabbages and to tell you the naked truth they look absolutely impossible.' The ‘impossibility’ stemmed from the failure of such followers to recognise the symbolic importance of Kahlo's choice of clothing, a failure also intrinsic to her recent magazine appearances. The particularities of post-revolutionary Mexico are frequently subsumed by the decorativeness of the ethnic, by the generalised attractiveness of the radical avant-garde. For Kahlo, however, choosing to don the costume of the Tehuana, as for example in Tree of Hope (1946)(Fig. 8), was to embody a powerful icon of cultural identity. Mexican Indian dress is extraordinarily diverse and by and large geographically specific, varying from region to  region. The Tehuana dress is by no means the most decorative variant or the closest to pre-Hispanic forms of clothing. It is the mythology surrounding the women wearers of the costume which directed Kahlo's choice. The ostensibly matriarchal society of Tehuantepec led to the adoption of the Tehuana, in post-revolutionary Mexico, as the image of the strong Indian woman; the undefeated counterpart to the despised ‘Chingada’, who, conversely is the female embodiment of Mexico's hybrid post-conquest culture. In a culture where sexual metaphors are frequently used to convey racial and political conflict, the Tehuana represents that aspect of Mexico's indigenous tradition unbowed by centuries of colonial and male rule. Kahlo's adoption of Tehuana dress, while being an attractive disguise of what she saw as a less than perfect body, asserted both a feminist and an anti-colonialist position. Fig. 4. Vogue , February 1990, p. 138. Fig. 5. The Independent on Sunday , 8th April 1990, p. 37. In Kahlo's work there is a powerful mix of these discourses, yet her role as an archetypal woman painter has come to dominate responses to her work. It is through her emergence as a cult painter of the feminist movement of the 1970s that her current reputation has evolved. Her work almost perfectly illustrates debates as to the nature of traditional exclusions of a woman's art. The fascination with functions of the body, the analogies between artistic  and physical creative processes, self-portraiture used to reveal the female body as the site of patriarchal aesthetic discourse; all of these mirror the concerns of many women painters of the 1980s. Fig. 6 . Frida Kahlo:Self-portrait with cropped hair , 1940, 40x27.9 cm. Museum of Modern Art, New York. Fig. 7. Frida Kahlo: The Mask , 1945, 40x30.5 cm. Coll. Dolores Olmeda. Fig. 8 . Frida Kahlo:The Tree of Hope , 1946, 55.9x40.6 cm. Coll. Isidore Ducasse Fine Arts Inc. In their formal language, Kahlo's works are exemplary of certain feminist arguments; the adoption of the decorative, the intimate and non-fine art mediums reveals the restrictive nature of traditional definitions of ‘high art’. This ‘appropriateness’ of Kahlo's aesthetic to contemporary debate has tended to remove her work from its historical context, to stress the collective and the cross-cultural. Although this is not in itself to be dismissed as a tactic, it has diminished the complexity of Kahlo's achievement as a specifically Mexican painter, operating within the particularities of her historical moment. More problematic is the way in which such a dislocation has led to the acceptance of her ‘Mexicanness’ as mere decoration of the essentially feminist themes of her work, thereby defusing a substantial part of the art described by Breton as a ‘ribbon round a bomb’. It is the ribbon that runs through the pages of Vogue , the glossy surface of the images in direct opposition to a work such as Kahlo's The Suicide of Dorothy Hale (1939)(Fig. 9). In this painting, a memorial to a woman's tragic death is transformed into an indictment of the culture which destroyed her. Hale's suicide became a poignant metaphor for the oppressive nature of the social values of New York and North America in general. The story behind Hale's death was one with which Kahlo obviously identified, and within which dress formed an important symbolic function. Before jumping from the window of her apartment, Hale had dressed meticulously in her most flattering dress, the corsage of yellow roses a gift from a male admirer. In Kahlo's painting, the figure falls from the fantasy world she has inhabited to the harsh bloodspattered reality of the street, literally coming down to earth. Hale's eyes stare knowingly at the viewer, a human sacrifice to an alienated and consumerist culture. The horizontality of her fallen body is juxtaposed to the vertical thrust of the apartment building. She leaps from an architectural monument to a phallocentric world. Although destroyed, she has also escaped. The painting, dedicated to Hale's mother, was commissioned by a mutual friend of Kahlo and Dorothy Hale, the managing editor of Vanity Fair , Clare Boothe Luce. The painting was agreed to by Luce in part to recompense for what she saw as her misjudgment of her dead friend. Having lent Hale money to pay her rent she had been angered to discover her spending enormous sums on an haute-couture dress, and refused to turn up to what, in retrospect, became Hale's farewell party. Later it was revealed that the money had come from a different source. A male friend had tried to dissuade Hale from seeking a much needed job and had given her a thousand dollars to buy ‘the most beautiful dress in New York’, telling her that what she needed was to find a rich husband. On one level this work deals with a generalised ‘woman's experience’, yet the metaphorical power of Dorothy Hale's dress derives from Kahlo's use of clothing in her own self-portraits. Dress not only covers and decorates the body but instils in the wearer its own characteristic strengths and weaknesses. Hale's black velvet dress is cursed because it represents the values of the ‘Gringolandia’ so hated by Kahlo. In those paintings where Kahlo wears European dress she is passive, weak and unable to control her own destiny, but in the Tehuana costume she is strong, powerful, hopeful. Unclothed, her body becomes yet more vulnerable, but as Jean Franco states: The unclothed body is not a ‘self but a socialised body, a body that is opened by instruments, technologized, wounded, its organs displayed to the outside world. The ‘inner’ Frida is controlled by modern society far more than the clothed Frida, who often marks her deviation from the norm by defiantly returning the gaze of the viewer. Kahlo's naked body becomes not just the tortured self of her personal biography but a visual counterpart to the injured and defiled manifestations of Mexico's colonised past: La Llorona ‘the weeping woman’ of popular myth and La Chingada, the raped and abused mother described in Paz's The Labyrinth of Solitude . Descended from an Aztec mother goddess, Llorona is a long-suffering mother figure, symbolic in a wider sense of the trauma of the  Spanish invasion. Driven mad with grief by the loss of her child, she is thought to wander the streets weeping and crying out a ghostly memory of the pre-Conquest past. At its most simple, La Chingada, as the mother of Mestizo culture is ‘the Mother forcibly opened, violated or deceived’. The female soil possessed and misused by the masculine force of the Spanish invaders. The Indian Mexico raped and abused by the conquistador yet bearing his bastard child. The rhetoric of the Tehuana opposes the nihilism of traditional feminisations of colonial trauma, and asserts the potential of a dignified cultural resistance. Fig 9 . Frida Kahlo:The Suicide of Dorothy Hale , 1939, 58.1x47.5 cm. Phoenix Art Museum, Arizona. A major, though often ignored, work by Kahlo demonstrates the cultural politics underlying her art. My Dress Hangs There (1939)(Fig. 10) is one of the artist’ s most formally adventurous works, mixing photographic collage with paint to produce a critique of North American culture. Kahlo does not appear in the work, her Tehuana costume hangs empty in the centre of the composition, suspended between a toilet bowl and a golfing trophy. On one level My Dress…is a coda to Self-Portrait on the Borderline (1932)(Fig. 11) of the previous year. This small painting on metal, in the style of a Catholic votive image, shows the artist poised between the technological inhumanity of a capitalist North America and the archaic fertility of Mexico. Interwoven with these images are subtler references to the metaphorical borderlines which separate Latin American culture from that of Europe and North America. This is done by a series of juxtapositions; the past versus the present; female nature versus masculine technology; growth versus exploitation; and in its very material presence, the traditions of fine art versus the popular. At the same time the ambivalence of her own, and modern Mexico's position is manifested in the figure of the artist. The paper flag of her homeland is contrasted to the modernity of the cigarette held in her other hand. The red and green of the Aztec necklace links it compositionally with the indigenous plants to the ‘south’ of the painting, the pink colonial-style dress tonally blending with the skyscrapers to the ‘north’. My Dress …again suggests a conflict, but the ambivalence is gone. Nature has been banished, technology and its concomitant values reign over a harshly masculine world. Three elements refer to the female presence, all of them dealing with an essential lack. The empty dress, a peeling poster of Mae West and in the far distance the Statue of Liberty. Fig. 10 . Frida Kahlo:My Dress Hangs There , 1933, 46x50 cm, estate of dr. Leo Eloesser. Although occasionally humorous, the work presents a bleak view of urban alienation. The Church, Wall Street, and Industry are joined by a network of telephone lines, forming a remorsely inhuman environment. Beneath this man-made mechanism of oppression are the people, literally distanced from their surroundings by Kahlo's use of photo-collage. In the forefront of this scene flutters the dress, incongruously vibrant despite its suggestion of loss. Dislocated from its political context, it hangs like a piñata above the teeming streets of the city; decorative yet potentially explosive. There is no place ‘there’ for the values the Tehuana dress represents, its folds are given meaning by Kahlo's search for a cultural identity. Within the confines of the painting it becomes a silent emblem of protest, a reminder of political alternatives. The physicality so characteristic of Kahlo's work is missing, no flesh, no blood, just the tawdriness of the peeling poster and the hollow reminder of lost Liberty. The inter-relationship of body and dress so self-consciously referred to in many of Kahlo's most polemical works (Fig. 12) has been strangely inverted by her current popularity. Her ‘Mexicanness’ has become a stylistic gloss, decorative, colourful, pretty, even individualistic. The colonised body which Kahlo clothed in revolutionary idealism has lost its function as a symbol of nationhood becoming instead an icon of female suffering. What is obscured by this process is that it was through clothing, in both art and life, that Kahlo attempted to redress the wrongs of history. Fig. 11 .

I These books are both related to the exhibition On The Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Period of Time presented at the Musée national d'art moderne-Centre Georges Pompidou, the Institute of Contemporary Arts in London, and the Institute of Contemporary Art in Boston, Massachusetts during 1989 — 90. The exhibition was conceived and realised by Mark Francis and Peter Wollen with Paul Hervé Parsy. Francis and Wollen have also contributed articles (one each) both of which appear in both books as introductory statements on the Situationist International. Both books are anthologies of materials by a large number of contributors. Their titles invoke the Situationists' rhetorical use of long and rhapsodic titles. They also denote deliberate obfuscations deriving from Dada and Surrealism. On the Passage of a Few People Through a Brief Moment in Time (henceforth ‘the Boston text') is a film title used by Guy Debord in 1959. The Situationist Scrapbook includes only two synoptical essays, the rest being made up of a selection of documents produced in various parts of Europe and Britain from the fifties to the eighties, some of which predate the founding of the Situationist International (henceforth the ‘SI'). These are followed by documents relating to the SI in Britain which include Ralph Rumney's Psychogeographic Map of Venice (1957), and brief statements by Michèle Bernstein which appear in the British press in the 1950s and 1960s. The greater part of the Scrapbook largely consists of what the editor identifies as ‘the British inheritance’ which covers the period from 1966 — 1988. The book is therefore very much an account of the movement's influence in Britain. The Boston text relates more exclusively to the movement itself and includes, along with historical material, a brief statement by Mark Francis which is intended to justify and explain the motives behind the exhibition (the Situationists did not give the event their blessings and none of the past members participated in its planning). ‘What we have sought to do’, claims Francis speaking for the organisers of the exhibition, ‘is not to reconstruct time past but to expose to the light things that have run the risk of acquiring the patina of nostalgia and the glamour of neglect.’ If this statement betrays a certain uneasiness it is perhaps not surprising given the subversive status of the Situationist project and their condemnation of the art world. Francis also implies, somewhat unconvincingly, that the event was conceived in a spirit of Potlatch and accepts the Lettrist belief in the legitimate use of plagiarism. The Lettrists and the Situationists had used ‘pre-existing elements’ for their own ends, and so the editors of the Boston text and the curators of On the Passage have, they feel, a certain entitlement to do the same. This legitimation in turn is related to the principle of détournement , a term which had been coined initially by the Lettrists for their neo-Dadaist practice of cannibalising pre-existent materials (in the manner of Duchamp's LHOOQ ) with subversive intent. My view of the exhibition and these complementary texts is that they seem for the most part to lack the critical motivation and the dialectical irony of the Situationists. They are normative representations, reverential in tone, recuperative in effect and the ideological positions which they reflect are conveniently distanced from those of the SI. Self-evidently these texts are strikingly different from original materials issued by the SI in the sense that they have the status of copyrighted property and have been funded by organisations which in the past may have supported progressive art but which do not sound like the champions of revolutionary causes. The Boston text, for example, is published with the assistance of the Getty Grant Program, Massachusetts Council of the Arts and the Humanities, and additional funding is provided by the Lila Wallace Reader's Digest Fund (the benefactor of the American Wing at the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York). The Scrapbook is also variously supported by Association Française d'Action Artistique, the Ministry of Culture, Copenhagen, the Instituo Banco San Paulo of Turin, Becks Bier, to name some of the backers, and also by the furtively named Friends of the Situationist International, whoever they are! More prosaically, the sandpaper cover (which, like the Jorn/Debord text Mémoires of  1959, is meant to damage your other books) was donated by English Abrasives and Chemicals Ltd. One of the first ‘political’ statements in the Boston text is the copyright restriction notice. It appears a few lines away from the plagiarised title of the book. The proscription is, of course, a legal convention which we would normally take for granted, but is, in this context, inconsistent with the SI anti-copyright policy and, in the light of the Lautréamont axiom: ‘Plagiarism is necessary — progress implies it,’ which Francis cites on page 19, is an unintended irony. The Boston text is more obviously an exhibition catalogue, if only because it includes a ‘checklist’ of the exhibition, which, ignoring the problematic identity of some of the works, distinguishes between works of art and other items (books, tracts, pamphlets, etc.) and also carefully identifies the status of individual exhibits by signifying their producer's relationship to the formally identified Situationist group. There is another category for Situationist wannabees, which was an additional and problematical area of both books and the exhibition. Some of the materials in this area seemed to have the purpose of padding out the exhibition, whilst at the same time fulfilling the traditional function of consolidating the achievements of the founding group whose significance it was the purpose of the exhibition to celebrate. Francis identifies the stages of the SI narrative as a chronological trajectory corresponding to (i) the Experimental Laboratory period;(ii) the detonator period (which refers to Debord's boast that he provided the explosive machinery that ignited in May 1968);(iii) the Fallout period after the SI disbanded in 1972. These stages provide the logic for the ‘diachronic structure’ of the exhibition. In the Fallout section are included artists, writers and others ‘who all had (sic) some contact with the SI’. Periodisation and classification present some difficulties which Wollen hints at when he comments on ‘the ‘simulationist’ art boom of the eighties and its debt to the dry husks of Situationist thought’. It is to be regretted that neither of these books examine the pluralism of the ‘simulationist’ period. To the extent that the Situationists raised questions about cultural hierarchies and the ‘supersession’ of art, how should we judge the Fallout period? The notion of progression is clearly important in assessing this work, especially as the temptation to isolate, or even dismiss, it as an epiphenomenon of the SI is strong. The materials displayed in the exhibition and reproduced in the Fallout section of the Scrapbook no doubt express ideas about which strong convictions are held. What are these convictions, and why are they not articulated? Why were the exhibits left to speak for themselves? It seems extraordinary that, given the political fervour of the Paris-based SI fraction in its post-Lettrist phase, the exhibition should have been so solemnly organised with little regard to Debord's caveat on auteurism and his contempt for the art market. Whatever objectives the organisers might have had, the exhibition turned out to be a quite normative curatorial project. The contradiction is perhaps a familiar one. As Debord has commented: ‘This society signs a peace treaty with its most outspoken enemies by giving them a spot in the spectacle.' It is noteworthy that the Situationists have produced nothing in the way of new projects for these texts, nor for the exhibition. Predictably they kept their distance. At the centre of the re-grouped SI in 1961 Bernstein and Debord refused any separation between artistic and political activity. It was at this time that Asgerjorn resigned his membership of the SI, although he continued to finance it through the sale of his paintings which were increasingly in demand in the 1960s. Thus re-grouped, the SI increased their political activity, eliminating all artistic production except in terms of agitational forms which meant, essentially, the use of détourné illustrations in their publications. The article by Wollen is an important piece of research and a major contribution to both anthologies. Despite its usefulness as an introduction to the subject, it does, however, judiciously avoid overt criticism of its subject and devotes little analysis to the SI in its mature phase. Nevertheless, Wollen presents a lucid account of the movement in its formative period and makes an interesting case for André Breton as a figure of some distinction in French intellectual history. He also traces the Hegelian, and Lukácsian influences on leftist theories in France in the heightened intellectual atmosphere after the Liberation which provided the aesthetic and political context for the Situationists. Apart from Wollen's historical and theoretical essay, the other major contribution in the Boston text is Thomas Y. Levin's ‘Dismantling the Spectacle: The Cinema of Guy Debord’. This is again a comprehensive and thoroughly investigated article and is probably the first extended account of Situationist cinema in English. Levin makes a special case for Debord as a film-maker whose aim was to contribute to the ultimate destruction of cinema as a spectacularist medium. Debord's cinema for Levin is a paradigmatic vehicle for the movement's ‘destructive creativity’. The main purpose of Levin's article, however, is to reclaim Debord for the aesthetic discourse of avant-garde cinema. For example, he identifies Debord as the source of Godard's innovations: ‘Indeed, well over a decade before Godard's Vent d'Est , Debord was producing a revolutionary, materialist ‘counter-cinema’.’ Not having seen Debord's films (he refused screenings at the ICA in London), Levin's arguments are in one sense untestable; nevertheless the article is not without difficulties. Defensively, he observes what he considers to be Debord's virtues and comments on the latter's avoidance of, as he puts it: ‘the various pitfalls — formalist essentialism, aestheticist myopia, politically naive fetishism of reflexivity, and so on, typical of certain avant-garde practices linked to radical political agendas.’ Nevertheless, Debord's place within a reified history of ‘political modernism’ is assured, more by virtue of what is claimed for the work than by its testing in public— Levin admits that screenings have been rare, especially outside France. Both the personality and the work remain famously obscure in a way which seems almost contrived. Further to this, Levin claims that Debord ‘does not disparage pleasure’ and yet argues elsewhere in the essay that his films deliberately refuse to make concessions to the viewer. An example of this is the early Lettrist film Hurlement en faveur de Sade , with its long periods of blank screen and extended silences. As far as one can assess the merit of Levin's text in relation to its subject, it seems somewhat implausible that Debord can be all the things for which he is proclaimed. Whatever defence is mounted, it is clear that these films, for Levin, exist as auratic objects, and Debord their auraticised progenitor. Hence the mythologisation of Debord by Levin, and others, has a significant bearing upon the reception of his work. His remoteness and the scandal and intrigue associated with the SI have significantly contributed to the enhancement of the movement's reputation. Levin's essay, interesting though it is, achieves little more than assimilating Debord into the spectacularised history of the avant-garde cinema. His hero-worship results in him reiterating the same claims that the cinéaste makes for himself. In the opening sequence of Hurlement , as Levin notes, Debord provides the audience with a reference to a cinematic tradition in which his own work is putatively situated. The tradition includes ‘great landmarks’ in film history from early ‘genre classics,(Levin's term), Expressionist, Dada, Soviet cinema of the 1920s, Surrealist, Chaplin, Lettrist and last, but not least, Debord. Situationist cinema is therefore important, indeed, self-important, not least because it provides ‘an alternative sort of cinematic activity, incompatible with the economy of the spectacle’. Levin earnestly considers Situationist film to be an effective oppositional practice. One of the attractions for Levin is the persistency with which Debord, like the Dadaists before him, continued to explore the medium, whilst contributing to its eventual destruction. Moreover, Levin claims that the Situationists never lost sight of their own contradictions, ‘by consenting to act in culture’ as a precondition of their co-existence in the present order. Nevertheless, cinema ultimately retains a relative autonomy in Levin's tribute. It is like Hegel's notion of the beautiful soul which denounces the world from which it has withdrawn to avoid having to recognise the extent of its participation in its disorder. Debord, as a film-maker, and Levin, as his apologist, take refuge in the transcendental space of autonomy where meanings have the illusion of self-regulation and independence of the totality they represent. Debord takes up his place (certainly in Levin's account) within the lineage of modern masters with its attendant construction of patriarchy, distinction and causal succession. In Levin's essay, avant-garde cinema is assimilated into the wider discourse of Modernist art despite their material and institutional differences. One of the pitfalls of this is that different audiences and different modes of consumption are contingencies largely ignored. Debord's apparent contempt for audiences has its counterpart in Levin's emphasis upon origination and prestige as paradigms of his cultural history. The blurring of art and film histories leads Levin into the murky waters of Situationist discourse on art. Suffice it to say that this discourse is generalising and intemperate, and lacks depth and clarity. Debord, for example, proclaims: ‘The critical position later elaborated by the Situationists has shown that the suppression and realization of art are inseparable aspects of a single supersession of art.' There is some sense in this comment which may well explain the position of the Situationists at a particular conjunction, but it is a sense which would also explain earlier avant-garde trends in art (if not cinema) since, say, Futurism. Moreover, the notion of art's ‘single supersession’, an histrionic claim, would benefit from some kind of historical and theoretical contextualisation. It sounds important but in fact is an impenetrable statement. Further clarification might also be required as to how the Situationist negation of art (and cinema) related to the wider sphere of cultural-political struggle. The critique of art as an institution is continuous with earlier formations (including early Surrealism and Russian Constructivism), but Levin remains unclear in his definition of Debord's avant-gardism. For Lukács and Adorno the concept of the avant-garde was a touchstone: for the one it was negative and decadent, for the other positive and progressive. In Levin's account of Debord, his subject appears to hold both positions at once. More specifically, on the issue of cultural hierarchies and class relations the Situationists tried to distance themselves from bourgeois notions of progress and their equivalence in the neo-avant-garde of the post-war period. The SI thus rejected ‘mechanical becoming, with its notions of progress, merit and causal succession’. This statement reflects the resistance of the SI to piecemeal historicism out of which lineages are made, but in Levin's history the independent achievements of Debord as a film-maker eventually collapses into it. In fairness it has to be said that Levin tries to isolate Debord from a purely formal Modernism, and from naive realism (the politics of the signified). He does this by proclaiming, a ‘third avant-garde’, which avoids the major pitfalls (of the ‘two avant-gardes') and secures some theoretical authority for Debord. However, because this is not adequately related to the political ideals of the SI there is no analysis of the projected  means (theoretical or practical) by which the sublation of art in the praxis of life might be achieved. The reverential tone of Levin's text poses a problem which the movement's survivors, I imagine, would be quick to condemn. It is, in short, uncritical in the sense of failing to site Debord's films within an adequate theoretical discourse. Levin objectifies his subject through the use of an argument which leaves the SI unexplained as a revolutionary organisation with the potentiality of reflecting, by its own methods, a radical social transformation. What he provides is the missing chapter in the secret history of the cinema, the missing link between Berlin Dada and postmodernism. As with other contributors, exaggerated claims are made for détournement (the communication which contains its own critique), firstly because it was an inheritance from Cubism and Dada, and secondly, because, as the exhibition shows, its deployment by ‘pro-situs’ has made of it a commonplace, popularised in punk fanzines, and ‘Biff’postcards etc. The Situationists' activities within the cultural sphere constituted an attempt to create a unified range of activities which functioned as a radical critique of the conventional boundaries between specialisations embedded in the institutions, practices and agencies of modern life. The fragmented appearance of their work, especially its Lettrist phase, their repudiation of conventional skills and scholarly manners (evidenced in their use of personal insults) have been absorbed by subcultural milieux and in due course adapted by the culture industries. The influence of the Situationists is clearly demonstrated (if overstated) in these books. If the historical trajectory of the Scrapbook is followed (SI through Fluxus, Heatwave, King Mob, Jamie Reid, Vivienne Westwood, and the Sex Pistols) the Situationist role for the intellectual as an informed but passionate critic gives way to philistine incitements to violence (typified by King Mob in Britain, the Motherfuckers in the USA, and also indirectly the punk phenomenon) but more commonly a laidback and philosophically weak critique of everyday life. The political and philosophical origins of Situationist thought to a large degree derives from Marx's critique of alienation and commodity fetishism, Lukács's development of this critique, and the Marxist-existentialism of Sartre and Henri Lefebvre. The rejection of liberal democracy and bureaucratic Marxism led the Situationists away from dominant political organisations and towards libertarian and syndicalist influences. The ideas of Anton Pannekoek which emerged with the publication of his Workers' Council after World War One provided a ready-made model of a non-hierarchical political system. The simple faith conveyed in Pannekoek's treatise recalls earlier utopian writing, and contrasts with the strident and acerbic tone of Situationist writing. With the exception of Wollen, the contributors to the Scrapbook and the Boston text convey little concern for the forms of political organisation espoused by the Situationists, and it is perhaps symptomatic of their interest in the SI as a purely aesthetic phenomenon. The SI clearly endeavoured to produce a revolutionary critique of modern life, and towards this end devised a convulsive rhetoric and an inventive vocabulary. The revival of interest in its ideas might be explained by this, rather than by its standing as a political organisation. The remoteness of the movement from working-class experience guaranteed the survival of its bohemian image. Its re-emergence as spectacle relates more visibly to its cult status and the nostalgic allure of fifties Paris; a marginalised and dissolute existence in the company of exotic friends and of romantic places with beautiful names. The Boston text reproduces old photographs of founding members. The gamine looks of Bernstein and the neatness of Debord have an aesthetic relevance which signifies a rather vague, but nevertheless compelling, reason for their inclusion in the text. They are not merely documentation. They are in fact significant elements in the story of ‘Situationism’ which is the subtext of the book. The political reticence evident in these volumes is indicated by a degree of randomness in the choice of materials and by implication a commitment to the more ‘expressive’ or irrationalist side of their work. It is, for example, revealing that there is no indication in either book of the Situationist commitment to political struggles in the Third World and their critique of imperialism. The introductions in both books are anodyne and brief. The historical significance of the SI is not questioned, and the importance of the movement is asserted largely on the basis of aesthetic innovations which derive from the Lettrist period prior to the founding of the SI. Détournement and dérive (drifting) are thus reclaimed in terms of their contemporary relevance, or rather for the extent to which they influenced punk and the camp and erudite artistic radicalism which exploited it. With the exception of Levin's extended analysis of film, neither the products nor any specific agitations of the Situationists and their epigones are subject to critical reassessment. The short commentaries and comic imagery in the British section of the Scrapbook are largely printed ephemera with unserious political pretensions. Some of it is amusing, some of it pretentious drivel. Clearly much of the material is unsupportable and there is a sense in which this is self-evident in that the Scrapbook is styled as an ‘anti-document’ which, like the films of Debord, is co-extensive with the equally unsupportable and qualitatively diminished world to which it relates. The temptation is to view these publications and the exhibition as a proliferation of surfaces which are in a sense pretty vacant reminders that despite the essentially teleological nature of the Situationist project, it is now immobilised and its documents merely a contribution to culture as the spectacular remains of an abandoned revolutionary ideal. The  tendency is to ignore value distinctions and to undermine qualitative difference so that popular and high art genres are presented side by side in a unified space or text. There is of course an inside knowledge which makes this ‘coherent’ for those in possession of it. This presupposes the same audience separations, the same hierarchies, the same educational and class difference as before. Frank Mort has commented on this kind of separation between the new intellectuals who are happy and confident to mix genre and ignore qualitative and semantic difference ‘because they already know the map of Western culture’ and are distinct from those ‘who do not carry with them those levels of cultural capital.’ He adds to this: ‘In that sense postmodern discourse with its relativism, its denial of grand narratives and its refusal of questions of value, is a world tailor-made for the new metropolitan intellectual cadres.' It therefore seems that ‘in a purely negative way’ the silence over the question of meaning in the Boston text and in the Scrapbook is perhaps not surprising —— it is an historically appropriate response to the disappearance of the SI. ‘There is a sorrow in the Zeitgeist’ bemoans Lyotard, an inappropriateness in the metaphor of the ‘avant-garde’, and consequently a kind of absurdity attaching to the belief in art as a prefiguration of a global collectivist future. That sorrow hangs over the discontinued struggles of the SI. The belligerence of their message and the violence of their appeal to negation and revolt is now passed over in silence and their works appear as if they were blank sheets to the privileged audiences of the present day. II What I have argued so far is that the Situationists are ill-served by these publications, and that this is partly due to the influence of a certain pessimism which haunts contemporary cultural politics. What I want to argue now is that there is a sense in which the symptom of this pessimism exist in the movement itself. The Situationists were idealists in the sense that they perceived themselves apart from the spectacle, always managing to be ‘other-than-spectacular’, as Levin puts it, so that this became a pre-condition of Situationist practice. Their self-image was that of the chosen few for whom the spectacle provided an inexhaustible supply of objects (and people) to hate, and whilst the apparent ease with which they targeted and disposed of their opposition often made good copy (the endless adventure, the scandal, etc.), there is a sense in which the hectoring tone of their documents became repetitive and wearisome. The effusions of Vaneigem have an air of mystical revelation which is even more intense in recent publications. Debord's political fatigue is less evident but his filmwork has finished and he refuses to permit distribution and screening of his work in this medium. Bernstein is now a journalist and works for a French newspaper. There are, I think, just three statements which count as unequivocally critical comments on SI in the Scrapbook. They appear in the documents section and therefore do not, we may take it, represent the views of the editors. Firstly, Art & Language's piece ‘Ralph the Situationist’ expresses considerable misgivings about the Situationist project: ‘The texts are effectively incorrigible and self insulating…’; ‘…bland incoherence — a self-contradictory absurdity — a moral ground to give up reading and remembering…’, and so on. Whatever gave Francis, or whoever it was, the idea that Art $ Language had anything to do with the Situationists? On what basis is this reference made? There is no evidence of SI influence in their work, which has quite different intellectual roots, and the article itself leaves no doubt as to the extent of their disapprobation. Furthermore, the inclusion of three early works by the group in the exhibition (dating from the late sixties) reveals a kind of make believe idea about an A $ L/SI connection. There was no such connection. As late as 1970 members of A $ L, to my knowledge, had never heard of Debord, and if they had were not the least bit interested. The arbitrary inclusion of artworks in the exhibition is further evidence of a curatorial effort to construct a narrative of ‘situationism’. The case for Merz, Pistoletto and Buren may be different, but it is not unreasonable to expect a rationale for the proclaimed indebtedness of Arte Povera and Conceptual Art to the Situationists. Nowhere in these publications are these connections argued for: they are merely dogmatically asserted. Given the withering contempt expressed by the Situationists for ‘prositus’, one shudders to think what Debord et al . are going to make of the ‘quasi-situationists’ discovered in America by Elisabeth Sussmann. On the basis of her understanding, it appears that any artist in the USA who uses the conventions of the mass media in such a way as to produce a critique of the media (and I can think of a good many) is veritably a ‘quasi-situationist’. The desire to create a pseudo-history of the movement's afterlife may be good for business, and may have provided extra material for the book (I refer to the Boston text, see pp. 10–13) but it is not in keeping with the purer aims of the Situationists outlined elsewhere in these and other texts. The second critical comment I came across in the Scrapbook was George Steiner's statement from the Sunday Times in 1967. Steiner accepted that the Situationists had identified and accurately described the emptiness of everyday life and even accepts their pleas for subversion, but was very sour about what he described as the ‘depressingly banal’ prescriptions of Debord and the ‘turgid creed’of Vaneigem. Christopher Gray, one of the small number of English members of the SI, is the third commentator I found to be not entirely sympathetic. His comments come from an anthology of Situationist writings he edited in 1974. Gray's comments evoke a kind of mystical disenchantment with the movement  which he found to be too focused on an intellectual critique of society. ‘There was’, he complains, ‘no concern whatever with either emotions or the body. The SI thought you just had to show how the nightmare worked and everyone would wake up. Their quest was for the perfect formula.' The history of the SI is in some ways a struggle for recognition (despite Debord's evasions) sustained by a radically negative critique which ultimately failed to find a middle way between Hegelian metaphysics and the dynamics of political organisation in the pursuit of its utopian objectives. The declamatory style of writing (which now seems dated) too often obscured the probity of the Situationist's critique of the alienating and manipulative effects of late capitalism and its creation of pseudo-needs. The movement's critique proclaimed a uniqueness and originality for its discoveries to which it was never entitled and which served only to reinforce the self-deluding image of its own power and influence in the world. Anti-authoritarian leftism and the critique of bureaucratic socialism had of course been well established before the foundation of the SI in 1957. The rejection of trade unionism was a common demand amongst anarchists and libertarian socialists. At the end of her life Rosa Luxembourg called for the abolishment of trade unions and promoted the view that workers' councils were essential organisations in the establishment of socialism. More generally the idea of the inseparability of cultural and political revolution has a long history within the libertarian tradition with its roots in revolutionary Romanticism. The more direct inspiration for the Situationists was the Dada-Lettrist connection which provided the aesthetic and political basis for their adoption of non-cognitive methods of expression (such as automatism, chance and other depersonalising techniques of production) and also led to the definition of some key terms in their vocabulary. The critique of scientific socialism and economism has a major place in Marxist debate in the twentieth century. The Situationists, contribution to this was negligible. The Frankfurt School's Marxian approach to cultural criticism, and production and the social effects of technology and the culture industries pre-dates the writings of Debord, and yet, despite its relative lack of revolutionary fervour remains a far more wide-ranging and thoroughgoing critique of the field. The conjunction of passion and knowledge, of libertarianism and planning, of feeling and thought are conventional oppositions in post-Enlightenment thought which have also bedevilled Marxism. The more orthodox theorists in this tradition have preserved this separation along the lines of a Romanticist/Utilitarian split. Others have sought a reconciliation of the positions that these terms represent, and there is an abundance of literature which examines this relationship in advance of the Situationists. If the Situationist project is flawed, as I believe it is, it is not because antecedent theories of libertarians, Marxists and Council Communists are ignored by them, but rather because they lacked the will to build on this tradition a systematic utopianism consisting of critique and plausible projections into the future. Like the Surrealists before them, their transcendence of alienation remains abstractly utopian. Despite revolutionary zeal, or perhaps because of it, they sought immediate compensations for the miseries of daily life, and spontaneous methods of attack which they mistook for political strategy. The Situationists' strategy consisted of an exploratory utopianism — a kind of heuristic projection of a future society. Raymond Williams has remarked that the danger of the heuristic utopia is that it ‘can settle into isolated and sentimental desire, a means of living with alienation’. Another Surrealist inheritance which distances Situationists from the more radical utopians is their blanket condemnation of work. ‘Never work!’ announced the Surrealists. It is an amusing quip (especially for those with private means) and makes joyful and nonsensical graffiti. But what does it mean? Obviously it is an incitement to refusal, and an indictment of alienated labour. The refusal is as understandable as it is naive, but seems to constitute at the same time what amounts to an abnegation of intellectual curiosity about human needs. Its political inflexion contests the middle-class work ethic which is the main purpose of its message. The aristocracy, for its part, has never needed to be convinced of the importance of not working. For other theorists such as William Morris, the concept of work is not considered negatively. Indeed; for Morris and other Marxists the nature of work necessarily changes in the process of social transformation. Marx defined labour as ‘human sensuous activity’. Lukács claimed that labour became the model for any social practice. The plea for an understanding of ‘totality’ in Situationist writing derives from Lukács and Marx whose critique of ‘separation’is directed exactly at the work/leisure distinction. Asger Jorn's interest in folk cultures and tribal societies which lacked a notion of ‘art’ as a distinct intellectual practice separated from the common culture, was based on an understanding of the extent to which the spheres of art and work have become conflicting practices within bourgeois relations of production. Despite this the common tendency in SI writing on most forms of directed or purposeful activity (other than agitation or ‘destructive creativity') is negative. The aristocratic disdain for manual labour has its counterpart in the Situationist’ attitude to the working class considered as the moronised victims of the spectacle. In contrast the Situationists' notion of pleasure is a negation of work in almost every sense of the word — a kind of involuntary idleness in the land of Cockaigne. Their notion of pleasure is indistinguishable from a sixties Zeitgeist. Its meaning is inadequately theorised and remains largely at the  level of common sense, a crude alternative to the repressive order of work. Now that Situationist texts are widely available (and with these publications adding to the list) it is ironic that they seem less crucial than they once did. Their appeal in the past was partly attributable to the popular texture of some aspects of the writing, its accessibility and its festive and irreverent politics. These writings appealed essentially to a generation of students bored with academic life and attracted by the street credibility of the Situationists, and often provided students with the dubious pleasure of being flattered and insulted at the same time. The Situationist lifestyle (in so far as it could be imagined) had some influence on the hippy sub-culture in the late sixties and punk ideology in the seventies in Britain. Situationist influence was more menacingly felt in France especially in the universities, although it has to be said that their influence upon the events of May 1968 has been exaggerated. For the most part, however, the legacy of the movement remained less obviously political, and restricted in its appeal to fairly specific audiences in the cultural milieu and especially the visual arts. Indeed, the extent to which the Situationist influence has flourished in the spheres of art and popular culture is noteworthy and contrasts with the absence of the movement's influence in other domains. The uneven profile of the Situationist group and its existential fragmentation together with the eclectic and impromptu formal character of the artefacts they produced, as I have suggested above, make it an ideal type for the postmodernist critic. The Situationists' rejection of the classical model of left-wing monumentalism, and their apparent lack of commitment to the historical overview or the grand narrative is consistent with postmodernism. Moreover, the freedom with which they juxtapose theory and humour, and plagiarise for artistic effect suggests strong affinity with the postmodern. The decline of the meta-narrative in favour of aphoristic models of philosophical expression (following Feuerbach and Nietzche) has been the favoured form of the Situationists. The fact that Baudrillard's name has been linked with the Situationists should not be held against them. Nevertheless, the de-Marxisation of their project by him and the ‘death of the social’ which he has announced should alert us to the doubts raised by Raymond Williams on the issue of certain types of Utopianism. The concept of the spectacle is an effective term which now has a wide currency, but perhaps only in a sense which approximates its use by the Situationists. The historical period which has seen its political devaluation is one in which political optimism has become unfashionable, which perhaps is one way of explaining the retrospective or merely historicist character of the Situationist exhibition, and the books I have reviewed. We have seen a shift from the utopianism of the 1960s to a culture of nostalgia and, as with the more dystopian elements in postmodernism, the exhibition and the books which accompany it look backward in a search for appearances as if they were compensatory fantasies substituting for a forgotten dream."
ACA ACA-ALP-002 1.15 "The Role of Residential and Nursing Homes in the Last Year of People's Lives ANN CARTWRIGHT Ann Cartwright, B.Sc., Ph.D., is Director of the Institute for Social Studies in Medical Care SUMMARY Almost a quarter of a random sample of adults dying in 1987 had spent at least part of the last year of their lives in a residential or nursing home; one in eight spent all of that year in one. The old, the unmarried. those with difficulty looking after themselves, the confused, the incontinent, the blind, the deaf, and the bad tempered were more likely to be in such homes than others. With their greater dependency. people living in residential homes received rather more consultations and home visits — although not night calls — from their general practitioners. But they did not get more help from community nurses and they were less likely to be admitted to, or to die in, a hospital or hospice. According to the assessments of relatives, friends, and neighbours who answered the questions, the quality of life of people who had been in a residential home for a year or more before their death was similar to that of others who died but had never been in such a home. It was those who were admitted in the year before they died who were perceived as having a relatively poor quality of life in that year. Increasingly, the quality of life during the year before death is going to depend on the attributes of residential homes and their staff. The marked rise in the number of residential homes, particularly the recent growth in the private sector (DHSS, 1987; Bebbington and Tong 1986; Laing, 1985) has drawn attention to the somewhat uncertain role of these homes (Judge and Sinclair, 1986). Two areas of concern are first, who should have residential care and second, the relationship between residential and community care. A recent study of people's lives in the year before their death makes it possible to examine the part residential and nursing homes play in caring for people during the   twelve months before their death. This paper then looks at the characteristics of the people who spent some or all of their time in such homes and at the care they got from general practitioners, community nurses and hospitals. Care and conditions in the homes and the extent of visiting are described and a final section considers the quality of people's lives as perceived by their relatives and others. METHODS The data come from a study of a random sample of adult (aged 15 and over) deaths in ten areas of England in October and November 1987. For these deaths we tried to identify and then interview the people who could tell us most about the last twelve months of the lives of the people who died. Someone was interviewed about 639 of the deaths, 80 per cent of the original sample of 800. Husbands or wives were seen about 36 per cent of the 639, other relatives about 43 per cent, friends or neighbours about 10 per cent , staff of institutions about 10 per cent and other officials about one per cent . Staff of institutions responded about 18 per cent of those who had been in residential homes for less than a year, 47 per cent of those in one for longer. In general, the answers from different types of respondent did not differ all that widely and the variations that emerged seemed, for the most part , understandable in terms of the characteristics and circumstances of the people they were telling us about, although there did seem to be a tendency for the staff of homes to put a more rosy interpretation on situations. For an analysis of these differences, and for further details about the study, see Cartwright and Seale (1990). TYPES OF HOMES AND NUMBERS RECEIVING CARE The ‘homes’ covered in this study include residential homes for older people, nursing homes and other institutions excluding hospitals or hospices. For convenience they are referred to here as residential homes. Fourteen per cent of the sample of deaths occurred in such homes; this compares with a much lower proportion, 5 per cent in 1969 (Cartwright et al ., 1973). A further 9 per cent of the people who died spent at least part of the last twelve months of their lives in such homes; so almost a quarter, 23 per cent, were in residential homes at some stage in the last year of their lives. The length of time they spent there and the types of homes involved are shown in Table 1. Those classed as ‘other homes’ included convalescent homes, a rehabilitation centre, an assessment centre, a holiday home for the disabled and rest homes which may in practice have been homes for older people (the classification was made on the basis of the information given by the person interviewed). A relatively high proportion of those in other types of home were there for less than a month. Sixty-two per cent of those in old people's homes had been there for a year or more compared with 47 per cent of those in nursing homes, but this difference might have occurred by chance. Of the old people's homes, 56 per cent were said to be run by the Council, 6 per cent by a charity and 39 per cent were private. In contrast the great majority of nursing homes, 83 per cent, were privately run. Nearly a quarter of those in nursing homes had not had to pay towards the cost of living there compared with only 7 per cent of those in old people's homes. The reason for the difference seemed to be that the DHSS paid for nursing home treatment in a number of instances: ‘They took the pension and attendance allowance and the DHSS paid the rest.’ Nevertheless the proportion for whom payment was thought to have been something of a problem was 7 per cent of all those in old people's homes (15 per cent for private ones, 6 per cent for others) and 17 per cent of those in nursing homes — further differences which did not reach statistical significance. WHO SPENDS ALL OR ANY PART OF THE LAST YEAR OF THEIR LIFE IN A RESIDENTIAL HOME? AGE, SEX AND FAMILY? People who lived longer were more likely to have spent some or all of the last year of their lives in residential homes. People have been counted as spending all of the last year of their lives in residential homes if they had lived in one for a year or more. (In fact, as will be seen later, a number of them were admitted to hospital during the last twelve months of their lives and some died in hospital.) Few under 75 had spent any time in such homes but more than half those dying when they were aged 85 or more had spent at least some of the last year of their lives in one. The figures are in Table 2 which also shows expected age related differences with sex and marital status. Further analyses by age and marital status showed that married people less often spent any time in residential homes than single or previously married people of the same age. The proportions among those aged 75 — 84 were 8 per cent of the married, 34 per cent of the others, and for those aged 85 or more 25 per cent compared with 61 per cent. Neill et al . (1988) found that few married people applied for residential care and those who did so were less likely to be admitted than applicants who were single or widowed. There were no significant differences in the present study between the never and the previously married although it might be expected that people with children might be less likely to go into a home than those without any and the widowed, divorced, or separated are much more likely to have children than the single: 75 per cent compared with 6 per cent. An analysis by marital status and number of children showed that for the married the main difference was between those with no children, 17 per cent of whom had been in a residential home, and those with one or more, for whom the proportion was 5 per cent. For the widowed or divorced there was no difference between those with and without children nor any significant trend with the number of children. So it would seem that children may assist one parent to care for the other who might otherwise go into a home, but apart from this they have   to residential homes for some while caring for and thus avoiding the admission of others, and that these two influences cancel each other out in the statistics. An analysis by the sex of children showed no significant differences between those with a son or sons only and those with only a daughter or daughters. An earlier study (Cartwright et al ., 1973) found that those with a daughter or daughters were more likely to die in their own homes than those with just a son or sons. Data in Table 2 suggest that those with living brothers or sisters may be less likely to be admitted to a home. Part of this is an age effect: the proportion with such relatives falling from 86 per cent of those aged 45 — 54 to 41 per cent of those aged 85 or more. Among those aged 85 or more a similar proportion of those with and without living siblings had been admitted to a home at some stage but among those aged 75 — 84 more of those without any such relatives had been admitted: 30 per cent compared with 17 per cent. These variations reflect the fact that siblings themselves age and die and therefore become less of a source of support as people grow older. CAUSE OF DEATH People who died of cancer were less likely than those dying from other causes to have been in such homes, 7 per cent against 29 per cent. The difference remains when the age at which they die is taken into account. (Cause of death was taken from the death registration form as coded by OPCS.) When the type of home was taken into account, those dying of respiratory disease were more likely to have been in nursing homes — 14 per cent compared with 6 per cent for those dying of other conditions — whereas those dying of stroke were more likely to have been in old people's homes: 27 per cent against 12 per cent. SELF CARE The proportions reported to have had difficulty with various aspects of caring for themselves (getting in and out of a bath or shower, dressing and undressing, going to the toilet, washing and shaving, feeding themselves, making a hot drink, or needing help at night) for a year or more before death was 87 per cent of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more, 60 per cent of those in for a shorter time and 25 per cent of those who had not been in such a home at all. (People who had been in a hospital for all the year before they died have been excluded from these comparisons.) But many of the symptoms asked about were reported for similar proportions of those who had been in residential homes and those who had not; these were pain, trouble with breathing, vomiting or feeling sick, drowsiness, sleeplessness, dry mouth or thirst, depression, loss of appetite, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, bed sores, an unpleasant smell, and backache. However, for a number of these symptoms, more people in residential homes had had them for a year or more: the proportions were 31 per cent against 20 per cent for drowsiness, 22 per cent against 14 per cent for dizziness, 19 per cent against 11 per cent for loss of appetite and 4 per cent against one per cent for bedsores. Only one symptom, a persistent cough, was reported more often for those who had not been in a residential home — 24 per cent compared with 10 per cent of those who had spent some time in such a home. When deaths from cancer were excluded the difference remained: 22 per cent against 9 per cent. SYMPTOMS The symptoms reported more frequently for those in residential homes are shown in Table 3. Several of them — constipation, confusion, urinary incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing — have been shown elsewhere to increase with age (Cartwright, 1990a). Some of them, such as mental confusion, incontinence and difficulty seeing and hearing, may have contributed to them being admitted to such homes. They can certainly make it more difficult for people to look after themselves. And among those people with confusion, constipation and incontinence, those in residential homes were more likely to have had the symptoms for a year or more. The figures were 81 per cent compared with 39 per cent for confusion, 78 per cent and 52 per cent for constipation, and 54 per cent against 36 per cent for incontinence. Bad temper might result from being in such a home. Another explanation for the relatively high proportion of those in residential homes reported to be bad tempered could be that relatives, friends or neighbours were less likely to report or perceive the person who died as being bad tempered than staff of institutions. Among those in residential homes the frequency with which bad temper was reported was 31 per cent when the respondent was a relative, friend or neighbour, 45 per cent when he or she was a staff member — a difference which did not reach statistical significance. But if the comparison between those who   had been in a home and others is confined to those for whom relatives, neighbours or friends were interviewed, there is still a difference: 31 per cent against 19 per cent. Bad temper could be either a cause or effect of being admitted to a residential home. Other studies have found that caring relatives are more likely to favour residential care as a solution for the elderly confused if the old person exhibits difficult behaviour (Levin et al ., 1989). So the evidence suggests that because of their age and frailty those living in residential homes will have needed more care during the last year of their lives than other people who died. CARE FROM GENERAL PRACTITIONERS People in residential homes remain under the care of general practitioners. The numbers of consultations, home visits and night calls reported for those in such homes for a year or more before they died are compared with those for others under the care of a general practitioner in Table 4. As expected, those in residential homes had more consultations and more visits from their general practitioners than others. But, if anything, they had rather fewer night calls. Of course night calls are usually made in a crisis and the help normally available in residential homes may make it easier to cope with a minor one without calling out a doctor. In the minority of homes (a quarter) where all the residents had the same doctor, visiting rates were higher (16.8 a year on average) than in the majority (three-quarters) where the residents could have different doctors (9.5). However, the proportions for whom the general practitioner was described as reluctant to visit, or for whom it was felt it would have been helpful if the doctor had visited the person who died more often, did not vary significantly between the groups. So it would seem that people in homes where they were free to have a doctor of their own choice were not seen as being more deprived of visits in spite of having fewer of them than people in homes where everyone had the same doctor. Those in homes where everyone had the same doctor might receive less individual attention at visits if general practitioners saw several patients on the same visit. The mixture of praise and criticism for general practitioners' care of people in residential homes was similar to comments about their care of others during the last year of their lives. Although most respondents praised, or were satisfied with, this care the study identified a number of inadequacies. Home visits were much appreciated when they happened   but failure to visit was one of the more common and significant criticisms (Cartwright, 1990b). The matron of a residential home, talking about a doctor who she felt was reluctant to visit said it would have been helpful if the person who died had been visited more often: ‘It would have given her a lot more comfort and the staff a lot more confidence.’ When asked why she thought the doctor had not come more often, she replied, ‘The doctors feel the residents are in a rest home to  save them working.’ The doctor had not been asked to come more often ‘because we're resigned to the fact that, unless it's an emergency, he won't come out.’ The matron also told us that this patient had to go into a nursing home ‘towards the end’ because ‘she needed morphine injections which the doctor wouldn't give otherwise she wouldn't have had to move to somewhere strange. She had to leave her room, her furniture: that's why she gave up.’ CARE IN HOSPITAL People who had lived in old people's homes were less likely than others who died to have gone into a hospital or hospice during the last year of their lives or to die in one. This can be seen from the figures in Table 5 which also suggest that the longer the time they had lived in an old people's home the less likely they were to go into hospital. But those least likely to have spent time in a hospital or hospice or to die in one were those who had lived in a nursing home for a year or more. This lower use of hospital inpatient facilities was not accounted for by the older age of the people in residential homes although fewer of all those aged 85 or more had spent time in hospital — 64 per cent against 80 per cent of those under 85. Among this older group 46 per cent of those who had been in a residential home for a year or more were admitted, 75 per cent of the others. There were similar differences when people   dying of respiratory disease and of cerebrovascular accident were considered separately: the proportions admitted to hospital were 25 per cent and 47 per cent of those in a residential home for a year or more, 76 per cent and 89 per cent of others among the two causes of death groups respectively. The numbers dying of other causes were too small to analyse separately. The only source of information from this study of any possible reluctance to admit people from residential homes to hospital relates to those who were admitted and respondents’ views on whether they should have been admitted earlier. This showed that in practice relatively few, one in ten, of those who had spent any time in residential homes were thought to have been admitted ‘too late’; this proportion was a quarter for those who had not spent any time in a residential home. Residential homes, and long stay nursing homes in particular, appear to cut down the use of hospital care during the last year of people's lives. What of the nursing care given by district and other nurses to those in old people's homes? HELP FROM VISITING NURSES Just over a third, 35 per cent, of those who had lived in an old people's home for a year or more had had help from a nurse who visited the home in the year before they died. This was similar to the proportion receiving help from district and other nurses among those who had not spent any time in such homes once sudden deaths and those who had spent all their last year in hospital have been excluded. They also received similar numbers of visits. Given their age, symptoms and frailty, it might have been thought that the residents of old people's homes would receive more care from visiting nurses than people in the community, as they received more visits from general practitioners. But some of the less skilled tasks undertaken by district and other nurses for people living in their own homes were probably done by staff in the residential homes. The next section looks at respondents' views of the care given to people in residential and nursing homes and the conditions there. CARE AND CONDITIONS IN THE HOMES Almost nine tenths, 88 per cent, of the people who had spent some time in a residential home were said to have had access to a telephone where they could make calls and people could telephone them. Among those  who did not have this facility, two-fifths were thought to have wanted it. Ninety-two per cent of those in old people's homes compared with 82 per cent of those in other sorts of homes had this amenity — a difference which fell short of statistical significance — but more of those in old people's homes had a room of their own, two-thirds against half. Overall the proportion with a room of their own was three-fifths and again two-fifths of those without one were thought to have wanted one. If the respondent was a relative, friend, or neighbour, they were asked to say whether they thought various aspects of the home were good or not so good. The replies of those who felt able to make these assessments are shown in Table 6. Clearly their views may have been different from those of the people who died, but respondents are likely to have taken into account the reactions of their relatives and friends, and how these respondents felt about the care in the homes is also of interest and concern. The most frequent criticism was of the food, and over this there was a difference between old people's homes for which 26 per cent thought the food ‘not so good’ and nursing homes for which it was 7 per cent. There were no differences between Council homes and private ones on any of these assessments, nor in the amenities available. And the overall assessments of the homes were similar in the two groups and between nursing homes and old people's homes. Altogether 50 per cent were described as ‘excellent’, 31 per cent as ‘good’, 9 per cent as ‘fair’, 6 per cent as ‘poor’ and one per cent as ‘dreadful’, with 3 per cent making other comments. A number of criticisms were exacerbated by feelings that people were in the wrong type of institution. A son whose father had Parkinson's disease and had been in an old people's home commented: They were not equipped to deal with a progressive condition, they were not that kind of establishment. The degree of mental stimulation was absent. It was a very distressing time for him. The whole point of his being there was because of his condition. He could have been in a hotel, had he not needed care and supervision which he blatantly did not get. The daughter of a woman with Huntingdon's chorea who had been in a nursing home described the care she got there as Limited — not because they didn't want to care, they just didn't know how to care for this type of patient…. It should not be registered as a nursing home. The one ‘dreadful’ home was thought to have contributed to the death of the man admitted there: It was an awful place: dreary, badly furnished and he wasn't as clean as he'd been in hospital — food all down his clothes and he hadn't shaved, he really looked unkempt. I don't think the staff cared. I'm sure the fact of moving to the home contributed to his death. He was so well when he left hospital…and the deterioration within a week was unbelievable. I just feel he gave up when he got in that home. (Died of Parkinson's disease and pneumonia aged 73 within 24 hours of being readmitted to hospital after being in an old people's home for less than a month.) A number of respondents commented on the lack of stimulation: ‘They sat in the front room and didn't move. Just sat there, no t.v. and no-one seemed to talk to them.’ When asked about the other residents in the homes, respondents' views were roughly equally divided about whether the person who died had on balance found them helpful (25 per cent) or tiresome (22 per cent ). Most of them, however, 53 per cent, made other comments, generally to the effect that the person had had little to do with other residents: ‘Her mind had gone so she was not able to socialise., Many of the relatives and friends who rated the homes as an excellent place for the person who died to live towards the end of his or her life made rather perfunctory comments: ‘I can't fault the home’; ‘It was very nice, no qualms about it.’ Others were rather more forthcoming: I would say that, instead of‘spoon-feeding’ the residents, they tried to make them independent. The staff were always there to help but didn't impose themselves. This was very good. And they kept her there when they could have sent her to hospital. (Friend of woman who had had a number of strokes.) A wife whose husband had had multiple sclerosis and went to a holiday home for the disabled for two weeks to give her a rest said: It's a good idea, gets them away from home to meet new people. They deserve a holiday like everybody else. He had a good time, said he really enjoyed it and would like to go again, and I had all the washing done for me — he didn't bring anything home dirty except the previous day's clothes. Sometimes relatives and patients had obviously had different views of the home. One daughter-in-law who rated the home as excellent went on to explain that her mother-in-law: hated everything about everything. We thought they were angels in the home and that everything was marvellous. The staff told us she was the most difficult lady — as far as she was concerned nothing was right. She had to share (the bathroom and lavatory) much to her annoyance, but they were just next to her room. You get what you pay for. The views of people who had previously looked after those who died sometimes reflected their gratitude and admiration for the people who took on this task. A friend of 30 years standing who had previously cared for a woman with senile dementia described how: I thought she was just being awkward until she slowly went downhill and became incontinent. I got help from the social services for this: they brought sheets and pillowcases from the hospital. The crux came when she became doubly incontinent and her mind had got to the point where she had forgotten how her body functioned. It was winter and I was changing her clothes three times a day and my self-control snapped and I shook her very hard to stop her sitting down without her pants and was so upset by my behaviour and frightened by what I had done that they agreed to put her in a home. The young nurses were very kind and would kiss and cuddle her. VISITING How much contact do people in residential homes have with relatives, friends, and neighbours outside? This question is considered for people who had been in such homes for a year or more. The number of different visitors they were reported to have had during the last twelve months averaged 5.0. Seven per cent had none, 52 per cent had one to four, 33 per cent five to nine, and 8 per cent ten or more. The number of visits was much greater: 11 per cent had 300 or more — almost one a day, 33 per cent between 100 and 300 — two or more a week on average, 19 per cent 50 — 99, between one and two a week, 4 per cent 20–49 — between one a fortnight and one a week, 14 per cent 10–19 — less than one a fortnight, 12 per cent had less than 10 or less than one a month. The number of visits was strongly related to the number of visitors: of those with less than five visitors, a quarter had a hundred or more visits, but this proportion was three-quarters for those with five or more visitors. Of those who were visited, 44 per cent had only relatives to see them, 11 per cent were visited just by friends or neighbours and 45 per cent by both relatives and friends; the most frequent visitor was a relative for 78 per cent and a friend or neighbour for 22 per cent. Three of the five who had no visitors were said by the people we interviewed to have had no relatives. Neither of the other two who had no visitors had any children; one had elderly relatives abroad, the other, in the opinion of the deputy officer in charge of the home, only had herself to thank: Because of her awkward manipulative ways she just didn't get any visitors. She did get visits from other visitors but they wore off because of her awkwardness. …She went out of her way to be unpleasant to people. Isaacs and his colleagues (1972) found that relatives' failure to provide basic care for elderly people was often associated with their previous rejection by the elderly person. However, for one in five of the people in residential homes for a year or more, our respondents said that there were relatives who they felt might have visited more often. This compares with one in four of those living in the community who were felt to have relatives who might have helped more — a difference which might well occur by chance. QUALITY OF LIFE Respondents were asked whether they would describe the quality of life of the person in the year before they died as good, fair, or poor. Two things appeared to affect this assessment independently. One was whether the respondent was a staff member or a relative. Those spending any time in a residential home were less often described as having a poor quality of life if the respondent was a staff member than if he or she was a relative: 10 per cent compared with 42 per cent. This probably reflects the perceptions of the respondents rather than a real difference in the actual quality of life of the people who died, although staff members may have been more willing to act as respondents for residents they had got on well with, and those residents may have had a better quality of life because of their relationship with the staff. The other factor that was related to assessments of quality of life was whether people had been in a residential home for a year or more or for a shorter  time. Taking all types of respondents together their ratings were similar for people who had not been in a residential home at all and those who had been in one for a year or more, while those who had only spent part of the last year of their lives in a residential home were generally felt to have had a worse quality of life: for 39 per cent of them it was rated as poor compared with 27 per cent of the other two groups. The difference between those spending all and those spending some of the last twelve months in a home persisted when the analysis is confined to those for whom relatives responded. This can be seen in Table 7. In addition, among those for whom a staff member responded only one in twelve of those admitted during the last year of the life was felt to have had a good quality of life during that time compared with nearly half (46 per cent ) of those who had been in a home for a year or more. One possible explanation for these findings is that people take time to adjust to living in residential homes. Another possibility is that those going into residential homes shortly before their death do so in a crisis situation. Weaver and his colleagues (1985) found that residents most able to come to terms with admission were those who had exercised some degree of control or choice in entering residential care. Findings from the present study suggest that once people had become established in the homes their quality of life, in the opinion of their relatives, was similar to that of other people who died and had never been in such homes. DISCUSSION Most of the people, just over two thirds, who spent all the last year of their life in a residential or nursing home were 85 or more, and it is this age group which is predicted to increase most rapidly in the next twenty years (Central Statistical Office (CSO), 1989) so it is likely that increasing numbers will spend the last year of their lives in such homes. But this increase may not be as great as the rise in the numbers of older people if there is an improvement in their state of fitness as Jefferys and Thane (1989) suggest. The symptoms that were more common among those in residential homes, particularly confusion, incontinence, and bad temper, indicate some of the problems in making these homes attractive and stimulating places to live. The description of one man of ninety-four illustrates many of the difficulties: He wasn't ill, it was just general deterioration. He was still quite active for his age, but his mental deterioration was the problem — he'd lost his sense of direction. He found it difficult to accept his own failings. Memory loss was the worst aspect, the fact that he was unable to complete a crossword puzzle in ten minutes as he once could troubled him. He was suffering from frustration. He was worried because he was deaf, worried because of his bowels. He worried a lot. He was, I think, unhappy and tired. He often said he'd had enough of living and was ‘ready to go’ was how he put it. (Died from falling down a flight of steps and fracturing his skull.) That man was admitted to hospital after his fall and died there within a week without regaining consciousness. But in general people living in residential homes were less likely than others either to die in, or to be admitted to, hospital during the last year of their lives. Residential homes seem to cut down the use of hospital care; they probably also reduce the need for it, but this is less certain. They may also reduce the demand and need for night calls from general practitioners and, taking into account the age and frailty of residents, the pressures on the district nursing service. Because of the nature of the sample this study could not ascertain the views of residents themselves. Others who have done so have argued that elderly people are often faced with a choice between an unpleasant battle to survive in their own homes and an equally unpleasant enforced dependence in the institution (Wilkin and Hughes, 1987). In this study relatives and friends generally thought conditions in the home were ‘good’ rather than‘not so good’, although a number of their comments and descriptions indicate that circumstances were sometimes far from ideal and analysis of respondents' views of the quality of life suggest that  the initial period after admission may be particularly stressful for residents. While most residents were in fairly frequent contact with relatives and friends from outside the home, one in five of those who spent all the last twelve months of their lives in a home had either no visitors at all or less than one visit a month. Becoming old and frail can be distressing; to be also isolated from relatives and friends seems dire. The task of relieving avoidable distress and creating a caring and heartening environment in residential and nursing homes is going to be of increasing importance in determining the quality of the last year of people's lives."
ACA ACA-EA7-003 1.77 "FORMATIVE TRENDS IN TWELFTH-CENTURY POLITICAL LIFE (a) The revival of royal power In naming his son and heir Louis (Louis = Ludovicus = Clovis), King Philip 1 had consciously aspired towards the glories of the Carolingian and Merovingian past. Had Louis been inclined to forget the destiny his father had mapped out for him, he would have been forcefully reminded of it in the last decade of his reign, when his chief adviser was Suger, abbot of St Denis between 1122 and 1151, a man of humble birth consumed by a passionate devotion to the cause of monarchy in the Carolingian mould. A letter Suger wrote for Louis's son to the bishop, chapter, and people of Beauvais began: ‘Heavenly and earthly peace from the king of kings and the king of the Franks’. Charlemagne himself could hardly have matched this confident assumption of harmony with God's will. In the century inaugurated by the Investiture Conflict, Suger's greeting was doubly remarkable. Only the head of an ancient monastic house, confident of his standing with the Pope, would have dared to pen it. The appointment of a Benedictine abbot as chief adviser to the king was sufficiently unusual to call to mind Benedict of Aniane's position in the early years of Louis the Pious's reign. Though Benedict's austerity and reforming zeal were missing in Suger, his twelfth-century counterpart, there was perhaps a similar commitment to abstract political principle, to the notion of undivided imperial or royal power. In Suger s case, this power was given sharper focus by its place at the apex of the terrestrial hierarchy; for, as he had learned from the presumed patron of his monastery, Pseudo-Dionysius, this was the proper ordering of earthly political authority. What marked Suger out from other pseudo-Dionysians was firstly, that he translated his abstractions into concepts directly  relevant to French politics in his own time, and secondly that he proclaimed his views in the influential Life of Louis VI , written in the early years of Louis VII's reign. As Suger saw it, the French king was feudal lord of the princes. In his Life he made William X of Aquitaine protest against Louis's meddling in the Auvergne, with the words: ‘If the count of Auvergne has committed any fault, it is my duty to present him at your court on your order, because he holds the Auvergne of me as I hold it of you.’ Behind these words lay the belief that all offices and counties were fiefs held of the king, whether directly or through an intermediary. Here again Suger was reasserting royal supremacy in a world which had long been deaf to such claims. He was also prepared to grapple with the practical consequences of his view. Clearly it was illogical that the king, chief lord of all, should be vassal of any. So Suger persuaded Louis to begin the task — not completed till the reign of Philip Augustus — of extricating himself from the bonds of homage which bound him to various bishops in the realm. Historians have considered this step as an essential preliminary to the later evolution of French royal sovereignty. But in depriving the king of any earthly lord, Suger risked isolating him. His solution to this problem showed his creative intelligence at work. As abbot of St Denis, Suger was in charge of one of France's oldest and most revered houses, whose connection with the ruling dynasty went back to Merovingian times. It had long been the traditional burial ground of kings; all Louis's royal Capetian ancestors — with the exception of his father Philip — were buried within its confines. Suger devoted many years to rebuilding the great abbey church (in i style which was later to be hailed as the prototype of Gothic architecture) to make it a fit royal mausoleum, as well as a place of worship in which mere men could obtain a brief insight into the grandeur that surrounded the king of kings in heaven. For Suger, in common with the monks of his house since the late ninth century — and challenged only by the foolhardy Abelard — regarded St Denis, the apostle and martyr of the Gauls, as the author of those writings produced in fact by a sixth-century Syrian mystic, now known as Pseudo-Dionysius. The most famous  of these writings, that on the Celestial Hierarchies , provided the abbot both with his theory of the function of ecclesiastical architecture, and with a means of integrating the earthly power structure into that of heaven. Under the abbot's influence, Louis recognized St Denis as his patron saint — a traditional enough step. More surprisingly, he also saw in his patron a feudal lord. This second relationship arose from an ingenious cover-up to a less than wholly honest piece of political self-enrichment. Among the lands earlier ceded to the abbey of St Denis was the Vexin français, that natural bulwark between the French royal demesne and the now hostile Norman duchy, which had been held as a Norman fief, had formed part of Simon de Crépy's state (see p. 216), and finally was reclaimed for the French crown by Philip I. The Vexin had had a comital family, in origin probably the advocates for the abbey; but Philip had bypassed their claims, granting the territory to the young prince Louis, who met with such opposition in the area that it was not until 1119 that his possession was secured. When Suger became abbot of St Denis in 1122, he reinterpreted the relationship between the abbey and the new count of the Vexin, to the profit of both. Louis became the liegeman, not of the abbey, but of its saint. In 1124, when the king summoned the great army to meet the threat of the Emperor Henry V's invasion, he bore the standard of St Denis at the head of his troops. As Suger said much later, the king recognized that he held of St Denis and that, if he were not king, he would owe the saint homage.’ Here was a new dimension in the essentially Carolingian view of kingship that Suger restored to the centre of the French political stage. Scepticism as to the historical importance of this highly personal view of monarchy seems in order. Our dependence on Suger's Life as the chief source for Louis VI's reign makes his interpretation inescapable for us, as it was not for his contemporaries. It is possible that twelfth-century laymen regarded his outpourings with an indulgent smile. Nevertheless Suger was no cloistered academic. As chief adviser to Louis VI in the last decade of his reign, and as Louis VII's most trusted minister until his death in 1152, he had many  opportunities to impress his theories on princes and lords who would not dare to scoff. And for the crown itself, Suger's doctrine was timely. The ecclesiastical reform movement had drawn a new, sharp divide between temporal and spiritual, forcing all temporal authorities to redefine their self-image. The Emperor Frederick Barbarossa, the kings Henry I and Henry II of England, had abandoned theocracy to develop the secular potential inherent in their offices. The French king, with fewer resources, was reluctant to go so far. Suger offered the vision of divinely inspired harmony, a place for the king below the saints and martyrs of the church, with his vassals the princes on the rung below, and other lesser men in their serried ranks below again, all enveloped in St Denis's protection, fulfilling their roles on earth until they took their place in heaven. It offended no one; it preserved at least a whiff of the old tradition. As vassal of St Denis, Louis enjoyed special spiritual favour which marked him out from those whose lord was a mere mortal. Yet there was nothing in this relationship to gate against the susceptibilities of the reformers, for it implied no set position in the ecclesiastical hierarchy. Naturally the monks of St Denis, who had most to gain by it, were happy to keep Suger's tradition fresh. They imitated him in producing histories of the Capetian kings — the earliest being Suger's successor's work on Louis VII's crusade. Suger and Odo of Deuil between them established the norms for the house's long tradition of royal historiography; of these the chief was that whatever the Capetians did should be presented in the most favourable light possible. The image projected was consistently conservative; to the end of the dynasty, the kings remained the pious and holy defenders of Mother Church, the preservers of the kingdom's integrity, the faithful battlers against local tyrants. The good press they obtained was no doubt deeply irritating to their rivals. Louis had another method of attracting the devotion of those to whom abstract hierarchies were mere nonsense: he touched for scrofula, as Guibert of Nogent attested in a work written before 1124. Many churchmen may have disapproved of the practice; but to those who flocked for  cure, it was a proof of the king's holiness, and a sign that Helgaud's miracle-worker king had not been entirely forgotten. But if royal charisma continued as a dominant pillar of kingship, it was now well bolstered in more mundane ways. Royal charters bore witness to renewed vigour outside the demesne as in it. Louis's annual average production of charters — 12.1 — was a notable increase on the 3.6 of Philip's reign. The new charters were likely to have been written in the royal chancery rather than by their recipients, permitting greater uniformity, a more dispositive note, and the regular appearance of only a few royal officials as witnesses. At the same time, the geographical area within which royal charters were sought expanded again, particularly in the south, including the county of Toulouse, where the Capetians had never granted them before. Louis VII's marriage with Eleanor, duchess of Aquitaine, meant more royal charters for Poitou and Gascony; his own political endeavours resulted in an increase for Berry and the Auvergne. And thirdly, among the grants and privileges traditionally produced by the royal chancery, there appeared again regular records of judgements made in the royal courts, and royal letters of command,mandements , like the English writs absent since the reign of king Eudes. The chancery had returned to Carolingian practices, but with an energy which outran its model. If Louis VI's reign was decisive for the revitalization of the chancery, his son's saw the dramatic extension of royal visitations across the realm. Louis VII's pretexts for visiting were many and various, but his aim was always to emphasize the specifically royal nature of his authority, to reclaim the Carolingian right of hospitality. As was said: He began his reign with a splendid procession into Aquitaine as Eleanor's husband, in the course of which he arranged an inauguration ceremony for himself — either a repeat coronation for the southerners or a service to mark his accession as  duke of Aquitaine — in the city of Bordeaux, where no king had penetrated for at least three centuries. He used the opportunity to issue charters for places across the whole duchy, he rave judgements and established lasting friendships with one or two important lords from which he was later to reap benefits. His journey through Toulouse in 1155, on his way to Compostela, was equally unprecedented, and equally fruitful. Louis renewed contact with Raymond V, by now his brother-in-law, and met almost all the bishops of the Narbonne province; their subsequent requests for his assistance strikingly increased his authority. In 1173, for example, he issued a diploma bringing the church of Agde under royal protection. His interventions in Burgundy were more forceful. The royal expeditions of 1166 and 1171 were undertaken in order to protect Cluny and to suppress ‘schismatics’— the supporters of the imperial anti-pope Victor IV. They met with little armed resistance (which must have been a relief to Louis, who had little confidence in his own military skill), and gained considerable incidental profit: the king's person was seen in an area unvisited since the reign of Louis IV; the counts of Nevers, Chalon, and Mâcon were brought to heel; Burgundian lords appealed for the king's mediation in their quarrels (he also sought theirs); the count of Forez, hitherto only a vassal of the Emperor, declared his most important castles to be held as fief of the crown of France, the first step in the integration of Forez into the French realm. All these benefits were acquired by a wily diplomacy. Louis was perceptive enough to gauge the degree of royal influence that would be welcomed in the great principalities. He avoided the bullying tactics his son was to employ; yet the results of his modest pursuits were in their own way as remarkable as those of Philip Augustus' domineering interventions. To expand the circle of their fideles was a regular objective of both Louis VI and his son. They recognized that a return to the Carolingian situation, in which, in theory at least, all free men were bound by oaths of loyalty to the crown, was an unrealistic aspiration; and they did not even succeed in asserting their lordship over all French rear-vassals, on the lines suggested by Suger. But they did dramatically increase  the number of persons and groups of persons who recognized a bond with the crown through fidelity. Their most notable achievement was their insistence that, for the safety of the church, all bishops not yet under the protection of a powerful prince should enter the king's garde . As the bishops of Clermont, Le Puy, and Mende fell into this category, the Massif Central was opened to royal influence. Then Louis VI claimed the bishopric of Arras for his patronage in 1128 — the only gain from his inglorious intervention in the Flemish succession. By 1180, more than half the bishops of France were again royal fideles , with the consequence that they sought royal justice against their local oppressors. Closely connected with fidelity was liege homage, which the kings were equally determined to extend. Louis VI's reign began inauspiciously, with the refusal of some great princes to do homage, on the grounds that it was not customary. Though their scruples were overcome, their objection pointed to their awareness that the ceremony was changing its meaning. In 1106, after the death of his brother Geoffrey, Fulk of Anjou was recorded by Orderic as having received the county of Anjou from King Philip I; his homage therefore implied feudal subordination. In the course of the century, Louis VI and Louis VII succeeded in imposing this interpretation on all their princes' homage. In 1158, for example, Henry II swore to Louis VII: The Angevin lands were recognized without equivocation as fiefs of the crown. This new precision allowed the king to capitalize on his princes' territorial consolidation: when William X took homage, both Aquitaine and Gascony were included in the contract; when Raymond V became Louis VII's man, the Rouergue, Gothia, and part of Provence joined Toulouse as fiefs of the crown of France. Thus effortlessly the kings extended their realm. One royal prerogative never to be revived in its full Carolingian glory was the holding of assemblies for the whole  military aristocracy of the realm. Ironically, this was a source of strength for the dynasty because, unlike its English counterpart, it did not have to face the potential opposition a corporate body of the great magnates could provide. But both kings did benefit from public gatherings of bishops and great men, largely though not exclusively from within the duchy of Francia, on the model of the assembly Philip I had called to Orléans in 1077. The most famous of these meetings — that held in 1155 and attended by the count of Flanders, the duke of Burgundy, the counts of Troyes and Nevers, in addition to the lords of the royal demesne — provided the occasion for Louis VII to come as close to legislating as any twelfth-century French or English king was to do. Here he proclaimed the Peace of God for the whole regnum (realm — an ambiguous term, which may mean simply his demesne, or the old duchy of Francia), in accordance with the twentieth canon of the Second Lateran Council (1139), and established penalties for the violation of that peace. The princes present consented to the extension of the peace to their dominions — though not necessarily in toto or without alteration. The action lacked that forceful superiority which had characterized Carolingian capitularies, at least in the time of Charlemagne; but it revived the tradition whereby the crown was seen as the author of society's moral norms. A commoner function for assemblies was coordinating plans for war. When, in 1124, the Emperor Henry V planned an invasion, Louis summoned his nobles to Rheims to debate tactics and draw up the battle-lines. Along with troops from the royal demesne and from those towns which relied on royal protection, the dukes of Burgundy and Aquitaine, the counts of Blois, Troyes, Nevers, Brittany, and Anjou, came in person with their men. The assembly was so formidable that Henry V decided to abandon his campaign. 1124 found the French princes unusually united; assemblies to discuss wars against Normandy could never command such support. Excuses for failures to attend abounded. Yet though irregular both in incidence and attendance, assemblies provided a golden opportunity for the dissemination of royal propaganda, to insist on the notion of ‘public’ war (see p. 288), and to depict royal campaigns as undertaken ‘for the  defence of the realm,’rather than simply for the king's self-interest. One further return to Carolingian precedent occurred at the very end of Louis VII's reign, when coinage from the king's mints and bearing his image began to circulate outside the royal demesne for the first time since the late ninth century. Admittedly, its circulation in the kingdom was small, its rivals powerful. Nevertheless it marked the first step — though only that — in the restoration of royal coinage inside West Francia. As judges, Louis VI and Louis VII were far more impressive when operating inside the demesne (see p. 296) than when acting, in their royal capacity, beyond its frontiers. The difficulty was the standard feudal one of failing to get both parties to appear. In 1153, for example, when the bishop of Langres brought a complaint against Duke Eudes II of Burgundy in the royal court, all four royal summonses to the duke met with excuses; in the end, therefore, the royal verdict was given by default to the bishop, but without much expectation that a long-term solution to the conflict had been achieved. Still, the case was important, because Louis had summoned Eudes for a breach of the peace, in accordance with the Second Lateran Council's definition. The crown was thus establishing its right, even before the 1155 assembly, of prosecuting violence beyond the frontiers of the demesne. And with lords of lower rank, the king dared more. As early as 1108–9, Louis VI had led a campaign into Berry to force the lord of Bourbon's submission to the judgement of the royal court. Where there was no breach of the peace, the kings continued to arbitrate, employing persuasion or pressure according to the standing of those involved. In the 1155 peace between King Henry II and Louis VII, it was agreed that Henry's quarrel with Thibaud of Blois should be ended by arbitration. To increase the chances of success, Louis offered Henry two teams of mediators; if he did not like the methods or conclusions of the first set, he could turn to the second. But Louis was prepared to take a much tougher line with the count of Nevers to resolve his dispute with the abbey of Vézelay: although relatives of the count were allowed to  participate in drawing up the terms of settlement, Louis insisted that, if it failed, further aggression against the abbey would be treated as aggression against the king and punished accordingly. The dispute could not be allowed to drag on. So the reigns of Louis VI and his son proved a decisive turning-point in the history of the French monarchy. After three centuries of decline, the first steps had been taken on the path to restoration. A royal letter to the people of Limoges c.1137 ended, ‘You know that those who despise our orders lose our favour and incur our displeasure.’ This might seem a rather feeble threat. But at least the people of Limoges had been reminded that royal favour and displeasure were worthy of consideration. It is inevitable that the kingship of the Louis should be discussed in terms of a return to the past, for this was the way they themselves justified it: their innovations were resumptions. Nevertheless behind the traditional concepts there lurked a marked change. For Carolingian royal rights had applied everywhere except where a grant of immunity blocked them; but Capetian royal rights were respecters of strongly entrenched vested interests. On the other hand, whereas Carolingian rights had been static, therefore subject to attrition, Capetian rights were elastic; with skilful manipulation they grew. An example of this can be seen in Louis VII's second Burgundian expedition, already mentioned. The occasion, in 1171, was a complaint by the monastery of Cluny against the count of Mâcon. Louis's duty to respond arose from the fact that in 1119, Cluny, caught between its need of lay protection and fear that the local lords would seek to violate its famous immunity, had turned to the distant but pious Louis VI and placed its whole order in his guardianship. So his son, no doubt unwillingly, was compelled to mount an expedition to discipline the count. The king's appearance in the Mâcunnais revived ancient memories of Louis IV's visit in 950, which his successor exploited effectively, stressing the justice of his cause and the royal obligation to suppress evil. Having subdued the count, Louis toured the castles, to remind castellans of the long-forgotten doctrine that fortifications were the monopoly of public authorities. But while reasserting the old, he also broke new  ground in the claim that he was rightful lord over all men in the area who had hitherto had no lord. And for good measure, he entered into an important pariage agreement with Cluny and the bishop and chapter of Mâcon, that resulted in the creation of a royal enclave within the county. From this nucleus, royal territory was in the future to expand to the point at which, in 1239, the whole county could be annexed to the royal demesne. In an area of weak lordship, Louis was prepared to capitalize on a simple right of protection to claim an old public obligation, a new feudal lordship, and a new territorial stake. The innovative character of Capetian kingship is unmistakable. The same point can be illustrated from the solid profit which was derived from the expanding royal protection of bishoprics. On the face of it, Louis VI's claim to be lord of all bishops not already under effective protection looks a modest attempt to regain only part of the Carolingian inheritance. And in one sense so it was, for by 1150 almost half the bishoprics in France still escaped crown control. But there was nothing conservative about the way in which Louis and his successor exploited the bishop of Clermont's complaints against the count of the Auvergne to secure a foothold in the county; it was their preparatory work that made possible Philip Augustus' annexation of the Auvergne to the royal demesne. Equally, Louis VII's intervention in the disputed election at Langres in 1138 prepared the way for his charter of 1179, taking the city and the whole episcopal fief under crown protection. As caries sets in at a weak point in the tooth's enamel and spreads to rot the whole tooth, so an appeal to the crown could trigger the decay of local autonomy. A different view of royal opportunism can be seen in the confirmation of charters for leading monasteries outside the demesne. In 1146 Louis VII was asked to confirm the privileges enjoyed by the great abbey of La Trinité de Vendôme, under the patronage of the counts of Anjou. In return for his good offices, the king inserted into the charter, after a clause designed to deter his own servants from causing depredations, a reservation of the ancient Carolingian rights of hospitality, procuration,ost , and chevauchée which no  Capetian king had hithertofore enjoyed there. It was a lavish quid pro quo . Less dramatic but far commoner was his habit of inserting a prohibition on religious houses trying cases of arson, rape, murder, and theft. The motive behind this may have been the desire to assist monasteries in living according to canon law; for the Second Lateran Council of 1139 had forbidden churchmen to participate in justice de sang (the trial of crimes punished by corporal or capital penalties). But if Louis's intention was high-minded, his own profit was well served; for the gap left by disappearing ecclesiastical jurisdiction was to be filled by the crown and its officers. The extent to which Louis VI and Louis VII had consolidated royal powers was masked from their contemporaries by their policy of pushing hard only where they knew that resistance was weak. Therefore the greater aggression, the more systematic pursuit of self-interest which characterized the reign of Philip Augustus seemed a decisive break with earlier Capetian trends. Yet Philip's methods were those of his father and grandfather; and although he had a clearer notion of feudal lordship and a broader canvas on which to exploit that lordship, even here he drew on his predecessors' achievements. Symbolic of the change that the Louis had effected was the increasing use during the twelfth century of the term corona , the crown, to describe the body of royal rights to be kept intact from generation to generation. The impersonal and durable character of these rights was highlighted during the last years of Louis VII's reign, in the use in charters of the phrase corona regni (the crown of the kingdom), a phrase which marked out royal rights from princely by asserting their value to the kingdom as a whole. This pretension was to be dear to the heart of Philip Augustus. Walter Map, reflecting on the changed character of French kingship in the twelfth century, saw the period between Louis the Pious's reign and the accession of his namesake Louis VI as one of deep depression, with 1108 marking a decisive turning-point. Louis VI   There were those who might doubt the beneficial character of revived kingship; but no one could quarrel with Map's view that Louis was responsible for a major change of direction in the history of France. (b) Communities For one school of distinguished late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century historians, led by Luchaire, the twelfth century was essentially the century of the communes — those sworn associations of burghers who, spurred by economic change, challenged with violence the feudal ordering of society, and brought about a new world. Few would now concur wholeheartedly in the terminology or the arguments of Luchaire and his school. Yet they were surely correct in their fundamental premise, that what distinguished the twelfth century from its predecessors was above all the proliferation of new political communities, juridically defined by their consuetudines or coutumes . For their appearance broadened the context of French political life, previously confined to the military aristocracy and the higher ranks of churchmen; and in the process of broadening it, changed its nature. The roots of the new communities must clearly be sought in social and economic change. As the swelling rural population cleared land and settled new territory, the isolated tillers of the soil acquired new neighbours; as lords, both lay and ecclesiastical, colonized the countryside to maximize their profits, villages replaced hamlets, towns villages. La Rochelle, for example, established by a pariage agreement between Duke William X of Aquitaine and Louis VI of France in 1130, grew in the second half of the century into the chief port for the export of Gascon wines to England; the prospect of employment attracted immigrants, the settlement became a substantial town. And old centres expanded as rapidly as  new. The great abbey of Vézelay, dedicated to St Mary Magdalen, was so thronged with pilgrims in the early twelfth century that a rebuilding programme was carried out, resulting in some of the finest Romanesque sculpture to be seen in all France. To satisfy the needs of monks and pilgrims, the small settlement beyond the abbey walls expanded into a town, its inhabitants including innkeepers, victuallers of all sorts, mercers, and some prominent money-changers. Similarly the old Roman cities in Languedoc, Burgundy, and the Loire valley regained a truly urban character, after centuries of being pared down to walls, cathedral church, and market place; townsmen outnumbered clerics, new streets were built for their houses, roads inside the walls began to be levelled to prevent rubbish from blocking the entrances to new stone churches or entrance gates, trades diversified, immigrants poured in. In Flanders, where the cloth trade provided an urban-based industry, the transformation of small centres like Ghent, Ypres, and Lille into the greatest cities of northern Europe was startling. In themselves, congregations of people do not necessarily form political units; social and economic bonds may suffice. But the inhabitants of some twelfth-century towns and villages moved last to associate for the protection of their interests against those of their overlords — bishops in the case of most ancient towns, abbots or castellans for newer foundations. The most famous, and one of the earliest, associations made its appearance in Laon in the early years of the century, as a consequence of the expanding wine trade in the area. The merchants of Laon, irritated by servile taxes, offered a large sum of money to the ‘the clerks, the archdeacons, and the nobles’ of the town for the privilege of having a commune — a sworn association for self-protection. In 1112, however, the bishop Gaudry bribed the king to suppress the commune. Guibert of Nogent, a distinguished raconteur, was in the city on 26 April, the day on which the burghers' resentment boiled over into rebellion, and left this account of events: In the slaughter which followed, the bishop himself was slain. From the burghers' point of view, his death was a serious blow, for it forced Louis VI to punish them. As a consequence, it was not until 1128, and then in return for a very substantial sum, that they obtained royal recognition for their association, now called a peace confraternity rather than a commune. The charter legitimated some degree of self-government, limited the charges on serfs, guaranteed justice; it therefore formed the foundation of the town's liberties. Revolution was only one, and not the commonest, method pursued by burghers; taking advantage of political disturbance could bring more speedy results. Here the classic case was that of the Flemish towns' exploitation of the succession crisis on the death of Count Charles the Good in 1127. We are well informed about this by Galbert, a notary of Bruges, who wrote his account of the events as they occurred, betraying a humanity and reflectiveness rare among men of his generation. The two most influential men in Bruges, the castellan and the dean of St Donatian's,ex officio chancellor of Flanders, were both members of a powerful new family, the Erembalds, which had risen from servile origins to prominence by the route of comital administrative service. Their exploitation of this recently opened path aroused jealousy among the knights, one of whom refused to answer a charge levelled against him by the Erembalds in the court of Charles the Good, on the ground that his accusers' lowly social origins barred them from comital justice. This allegation threatened the Erembalds' whole social and political position; so, when it appeared that Charles the Good was sympathetic towards it, they murdered him. Chaos followed, for Charles  had no direct heir; and several of his cousins had roughly equal claims to succeed. Louis VI intervened on behalf of one of them, William Clito, son of Robert Curthose, and therefore a claimant also to the duchy of Normandy; for some months it looked as though Clito would establish his right. But his candidacy was naturally unacceptable to Henry I of England, who feared that the wealth and military power of Flanders would give Clito an unassailable advantage in Normandy; and the risk of antagonizing Henry was not one which the cloth towns cared to take, because they feared disruption of the wool supply. So, in 1125, when Clito's violation of the Ypres fair peace provided an excuse, the burghers of Ghent sent to Bruges for support in pressing the claims of Thierry of Alsace. Despite Louis VI's military aid, Clito died of wounds received in battle, and Thierry's claims to the county were upheld. The outstanding lesson to emerge from this story was that comital succession, hitherto a matter determined within the comital family, could now be affected by interests from outside, even from outside the military aristocracy as a class. The precocity displayed by Ypres and Ghent in securing a candidate favourable to their industrial future was not to be imitated in the rest of France in the twelfth century; still, other rulers, particularly those of Champagne, learned from it of the profit to be derived from allying with the increasingly powerful mercantile or industrial classes. The part the Flemish towns played in the crisis of 1127–8 not only highlighted their importance, it also guaranteed their liberties. For, in his endeavour to secure their support, William Clito began his reign by issuing charters to Bruges, Ghent, Aire-sur-Lys, and St Omer. Of these, only the St Omer charter survives. It included, along with clauses concerned with tolls and mercantile rights, a grant of freedom for the town and all dwellers in it; the abolition of the judicial duel, unpopular with merchants; the use of inquest in its place; and an enlarged competence for the échevins or boni homines , the successors of the Carolingian scabini , re-established in the town at the very beginning of the century. It was the échevins who were to represent the towns in all the proceedings of the following year; and once Thierry of Alsace was  safely ensconced as count, he could hardly subvert their position. Until his successor Philip moved to establish greater uniformity in urban law, the échevins of Bruges (and probably of other towns as well) were free to fix the customary law of their own community, which implied a remarkable degree of emancipation from external control. In the south of France, other cities achieved as much independence by slow, steady accumulation. In Toulouse, for example, while episcopal jurisdiction shrank under the Second Lateran Council's prohibition on justice de sang , the boni homines emerged before 1120 as important judicial figures, their competence enhanced by their control over the salvamenta established as a consequence of the peace movement. The count of Toulouse, who had succeeded in uniting all areas of the town under his domination by 1119, was happy to allow the boni homines day-to-day management of the town's legal affairs, provided that the profits of justice remained largely his, and his rights to talage, unlimited military service and forced loans at will were preserved — as they were until 1147. In practice, the count's absence in St Gilles and Provence allowed the boni homines gradually to accumulate powers and the town to acquire liberties, to a degree that shocked Raymond V after his return to the city in 1180. His attempts at resumption provoked rebellion in 1189, which facilitated the establishment of the consulate in the city, the final step towards true urban independence. The Flemish cities, Laon, and Toulouse were all commercial centres of more than local importance before they launched their campaigns for privileges; and if their leaders were not highly educated men at the beginning of the century — it has been suggested that the reason why weaving was concentrated in towns in Flanders was that illiterate merchants could not keep the complicated records necessary for a scattered cottage industry — then they rapidly acquired learning along with their corporate awareness in the course of the century. In 1196, the dowager countess Matilda, confirming Ghent's privileges, ensured that no barriers would obstruct any competent person who wished to open a school in the town. The church's monopoly of formal education was broken. Before this was achieved, where the new town  governors' literacy proved too feeble to cope with challenges, it could be supplemented by the skills of notaries like Galbert of Bruges. Thus the complex administration necessary for repairing and extending city walls, channelling water supplies, ejecting waste, hearing legal cases, punishing offenders, policing the streets, could all be supplied. The culminating symbol of so much diverse activity was to be achieved in the thirteenth century, when the independent cities, led by those of Flanders, erected fine belfries so that their bells should rival those of the churches in summoning the flock to meet. However the movement for some degree of independence, some autonomy, was not confined to substantial towns. It is true that the privilege of smaller towns was generally couched in more negative terms: by defining their consuetudines they prevented other powers — usually castellans — from arbitrary exactions. Yet very rapidly a list of prohibitions or limitations on the overlord's power could become a guarantee of the citizens' rights. In a letter to Suger, Robert of Montfalcon declared that a case over whether or not a certain man was his serf should be tried either in the royal court or before the archbishop of Bourges, provided that the proceedings were in accordance with the customs of Bourges; for him, the consuetudines of his native town had assumed the status of a law binding on outside authorities. Bourges was a community in a vital sense, bound by rules of the inhabitants' own making. Both Bourges and Laon were wine-growing areas. A contributory factor in their campaigns to secure charters was that the peasants who grew the vines around the outskirts of the town found arbitrary and unpredictable seigneurial exactions an intolerable burden on a form of agriculture for which long-term planning was essential. Rural pursuits as well as urban required the protection that written and confirmed consuetudines could bestow. In 1155, the customs confirmed by Louis VII for Lorris on the royal demesne established that no parishioner should have to pay taxes on food intended for his own consumption or on grain grown by his own labour; he should be exempt from tolls when he took his produce to the neighbouring towns of Etampes, Orléans, Milly, or Melun; if required for a chevauchée , he must be allowed to return  home at the end of the day; the only labour service he owed his lord was in carrying seigneurial wine to Orléans twice a year; and the burgesses of Lorris as a whole were exempted from seigneurial tailles . These concessions, ideally suited to promote the interests of an agricultural community, ensured widespread publicity for the customs of Lorris;, they were therefore sought and obtained by a number of other rural communities, particularly within the royal demesne, in the second half of the twelfth century. The appearance of privileged communities was not quite as haphazard as it may seem. Where lordship was strong, as in Paris, the degree of self-government was strictly limited. The same was true in Normandy, where Henry II's concession to Rouen between 1160 and 1170, soon to be a model for other cities across the Angevin empire, permitted internal self-government by a mayor and town council, but also allowed the duke to choose the mayor from a list of three names submitted to him by the council, and protected the ducal right to military service. Elsewhere, the degree of urban independence varied with the amount of pressure the community could exert, its ability to exploit political crisis, and the condition of its neighbours. The interplay of these factors was complex; the two areas where the most advanced urban institutions were found were Flanders, where comital control was tight, and Gothia, where by contrast the count of Toulouse's authority within the great cities was almost negligible, and where the clashes between vicecomital and episcopal powers facilitated independence. On the lower rung of legal self-determination the grant of customary franchises might be in a lord's interests, for it could secure his revenues in perpetuity, even as it barred him the chance of arbitrary exaction; besides, an early concession might prevent more explosive demands later. Some castellans and bishops were therefore amenable to bargaining; but others needed forceful persuasion. Again, where local lordship was strong, above all in Normandy, the chances of concessions were small. Those communities which did not receive franchises seem to have suffered a greater degree of extortion, as their lords strove to recover some of the profits they were losing elsewhere. As a consequence, the condition  of the peasantry in twelfth-century France varied markedly from community to community', the extremes of contrast coming between those villages on the royal demesne protected by the customs of Lorris, and those in Champagne where serfdom retained its original rigours, where peasants remained the property of their lords, their labour services heavy, their safeguards against exploitative lordship non-existent. On a pragmatic level, the pressure for self-government or franchise complicated the aristocracy's game of preserving their own lordship while subverting that of their rivals. It could offer opportunities for embarrassing independent lords, as Alphonse Jourdain of Toulouse showed when he assisted the rebellious inhabitants of Montpellier against William VI; but his own financial losses when the right to take tallage or forced loans from Toulouse escaped his grasp in 1147, outweighed any advantage elsewhere. No lords appreciated the possibilities inherent in the movement so clearly as Louis VI and Louis VII. Their consummate skill in limiting demands for independence on the royal demesne, while favouring them elsewhere where a royal confirmation might create allies, has often been remarked. But the clearest example of royal skill was found in Louis VII's cynical suppression of Vézelay's revolt against its abbot in 1152. The rebels, provoked by Ponce of Vézelay's unyielding determination to maintain a monopoly of justice within the town, won much self-interested support in the neighbourhood; from the bishop of Autun, who wished to subject the abbey to episcopal control, from Cluny, which hoped to reabsorb the abbey into its order, and from the count of Nevers, who resented the legalistic and literal interpretation the abbot put upon his charter of immunity. On the other hand Ponce was strengthened in his intransigence by a papal letter forbidding him to make concessions on the immunity. But when his isolation rendered him vulnerable, he turned to Louis for assistance. As a price for his reduction of the rebels, Louis forced from the very reluctant abbot the recognition that in temporal matters he was subject to the decision of the royal court. Louis's behaviour betrayed no interest in abstract justice: he was prepared to force modifications of the  immunity in his own favour, but not in those of the count of Nevers or of the rebels; moreover, his opposition to the commune was inconsistent with his behaviour at Rheims or Amiens, and with long-term royal policy (by the end of the century, Vézelay had won its liberties). But in the short term, the king was the only party to the dispute who benefited by it; for it allowed him to display vigorous royal action within the county of Nevers. For all princes, the communal movement raised a rather different problem: each privileged community, whether fully self-governing or merely franchised, constituted in enclave subject to different rules from its neighbours; it was not therefore easily absorbed into the administrative framework of castellanies which the princes of the north were seeking to clarify and define. Indeed, towns were as anomalous as the independent lordships the count of Champagne was bent on integrating into his castellan network. Since what distinguished communities was their legal customs, anomalies could be reduced by greater legal uniformity within a whole castellany or, better still, a whole province. There was no problem in Normandy, where, by the middle of the twelfth century, one customary law obtained virtually throughout the duchy. Elsewhere in the north strong rulers, the kings, the counts of Flanders and Anjou, increased standardization by modifying customs when they confirmed them, or by persuading new communities to accept wholesale already existing customs. But though the patchwork of random entities slowly yielded in places to more solid blocks, nevertheless between them many separate customs survived. Later in the Middle Ages, the pays de droit coutumier , the land of customary law, was reckoned to consist of more than three hundred different customs (though only sixty of these were important and there were considerable similarities across blocks). In the far south, Gascony, the Saintonge, Toulouse, Gothia, and the southern fringes of the Massif Central, things developed differently. There the eleventh-century proliferation of consuetudines and castellanies had been modified by the survival (in places at least) of the old administrative framework, and by the tradition that serious offences were justiciable in  a court higher than that of the castellan. The growth of independent towns in the twelfth century lent force to the revival of public courts on the Carolingian model; while Mediterranean contacts ensured a warm welcome for the learning of Bolognese Roman lawyers in the early decades of the century. Although the academic study of Roman law took a long time to have practical effect, by the 1170s and 1180s it was occasionally cited authoritatively in some at least of the courts of the south. The pays de droit écrit (land subject to written — Roman — law) was emerging, encompassing castellan and communal courts within its framework. By this means the south was to achieve a rather greater legal homogeneity than the north. (c) The emergence of government What distinguishes government from personal control is its unremitting character. To be governed is to be subjected to the regular pressure of an authority operating according to fixed rules. In the full sense of the word, it is arguable that nobody was governed before the later nineteenth century; it would certainly be foolish to maintain that either royal or princely government in the twelfth century operated according to fixed rules or without intermission or over all the inhabitants of a defined area. Nevertheless, the perception that this might be desirable was reborn, whether for good or for ill, among the twelfth-century rulers of France. What provoked it was in part the ecclesiastical reform movement. For the reformers' vision of a fully-developed hierarchy, each man with his own sphere of competence, all subject to canon law and all beneath the discipline of the papal rod, evoked a mixture of admiration and envy in those laymen, accustomed to deference, whose position in the ecclesiastical scheme was lower than they would have wished. They neither cared nor dared explicitly to challenge this picture, as the pro-imperialists among the Germans had done. Rather they contented themselves by pointing out that, if the secular power was now confined to the rather lowly role of protecting the church's interests with the  material sword, that sword was in practice essential to the well-being of the church. So Baldwin VII of Flanders, confirming the privileges of Zonnebeke abbey, declared: It was powerful pragmatic argument. But it did involve the acceptance of a spiritual authority beyond his control, to which his ancestor Arnoul I could never have bowed. And those among the princes who refused to recognize that authority — notably Duke William X of Aquitaine in the Anacletan schism — suffered a weakening of their secular power. In returning to the old imagery of the prince as the bearer of the sword, the reformers had in fact triggered off an important set of associations. They recalled the Augustinian view of political authority as established not merely for defence against external enemies, but also for internal peace. Thus far, French princes — with the notable exception of the Norman king-duke — had been wary of claiming for themselves the peace-keeping function within their lands. It was no accident that Baldwin VII of Flanders moved to a new repressive interpretation of comital justice at just the same time as he claimed the superior advocacy over all ecclesiastical houses in Flanders. His successor Charles the Good increased his own powers of coercion to protect the weak and the tillers of the soil, while limiting those of others through prohibitions on weapon-carrying in markets or towns, and on the lighting of beacons to signal the start of a private war. For if the princes were to take seriously the one task the church now allowed them, they could not achieve it without also enlarging their criminal jurisdiction. The epitaph on Geoffrey le Bel's tomb: As ecclesiastical reform refocused ideas on the prince's function, it also had an effect on the way he fulfilled it. In 1140 the monk Gratian in Bologna produced his Decretum or Concordance of Discordant Canons , in which he demonstrated that, given the proper techniques of critical examination, the authoritative statements of church fathers and ecclesiastical councils could be harmonized to yield fundamental principles of church law. This approach, in which lay the seeds of later scholasticism, revived the notion of truth as an objective reality, attainable in the end by human endeavour; its appeal to the optimistic humanism of the twelfth century was therefore strong. And its implication for the conduct of trials in ecclesiastical courts was that the processes of human inquest could yield objective facts which human reason was competent to judge. Law could become once more an intellectual's chess-game. Canon law was a practice as well as a theory well before 1140. Bishops in every diocese in France could be seen sorting out conflicts in ecclesiastical organization according to its principles; parish priests and laymen were drawn into the processes, whether as parties to disputes or as witnesses. For secular courts, the consequence was a revival of inquest proceedings on a much more extended scale than had been common in the eleventh century, causing a demand for documentary proof that chanceries and monastic scriptoria were hard pressed to satisfy. Slowly it sapped at the roots of the kind of justice which had been dependent on the judgement of God; ordeal — in any case a last resort — grew rare; though trial by battle continued as a privilege of the military classes (in some places till the end of the middle ages), it too became somewhat of a curiosity. Oath-helpers were still employed to swear to the good character of the accused; but everywhere evidence as to the facts of the case grew more significant. Self-governing towns were swift to embrace this  new — or rather revived Carolingian — form of trial; for disputes between merchants were hardly susceptible of solution by battle. And the areas of greatest urban expansion — Flanders and Gothia — were also those where Carolingian judicial forms had survived longest. Their example inspired others. But inquest necessitated a professionalism long absent from castellans' courts. Boni homines or échevins ousted them in the self-governing towns; and slowly the day-to-day work of running courts in the non-franchised areas was taken over by knights or clerks with special knowledge of the law, leaving castellans to revert to their military role. That this did not happen to princes was a mark of their ability. Thibaud V was held by John of Salisbury to be one of the most learned lawyers of his day; Philip of Alsace was a man of rare competence; other princes gathered around them their band of learned advisers, their counsellors on whose pronouncements they could depend. So all were seen by their subjects in their role as peace-keepers, and also as upholders and definers of customary law. Only where the demands of the Anglo-Norman and then the Angevin empire dictated it was there regular delegation of the prince's judicial rights to an official; even then, this delegation was revoked when the king-duke visited. Elsewhere, though crusading might cause a temporary break, the link between the prince and his court was close. When Geoffrey le Bel was unable to arbitrate in person between the seneschal and the monks of Baugé in a quarrel over tithes in 1146, he insisted that his part in the case be acknowledged. The charter setting forth the terms of the agreement ends:. Princes were happy to exploit those elements in the intellectual ferment of the twelfth-century renaissance, which exalted their position as executors of justice. Geoffrey le Bel would have been flattered by John of Marmoutier's comparison of his judicial aims with those of ancient Rome. The study of the classics, even when unfortified by specific reference to Roman law, was a potent weapon in strengthening princely jurisdiction at the expense of others. Equally, the theologians' new concentration on the literal meaning of the Bible produced a new view of the judge's obligations which Charles the Good of Flanders exploited for himself: So behind and above the person of the prince, there formed again the abstract concept of ‘the public person’, the punisher of the wrongs and injuries, the bearer of peace, the mighty distributor of justice and equity. Yet the scholarly energy which reinvigorated abstract concepts of political function was identical with that which satirized them. For to believe in abstract principles of justice was to face a long series of disillusionments in everyday life, as the Goliardic poems, written by scholars trained in the new learning, amply demonstrated: Having raised quite unreasonably high expectations, the intellectuals were among the first to invoke God's judgement against those very processes they had so recently emancipated from God's direct intervention. Now, in the absence of ordeal, they could only await the final vindication of their cause in heaven. The roots of disillusionment — in so far as they were the fruit of twelfth-century conditions and not merely the natural response to too high or too vaguely expressed expectations — lay in the intellectuals' belief, stated by John of Salisbury. But even when princes did strive to fulfil this ideal, there were considerations which might subvert their intentions. Thibaud IV of Champagne defended his decision to hang a criminal by asserting that he was the devil incarnate; yet the prince could not prevail against St Bernard's cry ‘I will hang this murderer myself!’ And though for St Bernard incarceration at Cîteaux was the equivalent of perpetual crucifixion, the criminal's reception into the monastic order may not have satisfied everyone's sense of justice. The temperance of justice by mercy was therefore random in incidence when the criminal was not of aristocratic birth; when he was, political considerations entered into the verdict. For though princes might now punish delinquent vassals or officials (see pp. 360, 286), there was solid political sense in not subjecting them to the same penalties as lesser men. When Philip of Colombière's nephew killed the niece of the bishop of Bayeaux, King Henry II's court behaved as it would have done in the previous century in reconciling the parties by arranging a settlement between them. On the other hand, princes felt free to vent their own anger in ways which they now blocked to others. So Geoffrey le Bel, who would brook no interference with the privileges he had granted, tore up one of his own charters when its beneficiary, Gerald Bellay, had infuriated him. A prince's treatment of his fideles was not susceptible to rules of impersonal and eternal justice; and no attempt was yet made to make it so (see p. 349). Yet because a prince could now justify his coercive authority by reference to his peace-keeping function, those who failed to obtain what they saw as justice at his court, and who now stood to suffer punishment if they disturbed the peace to vindicate their rights, grew embittered. Gerald Bellay's rebellion against Geoffrey le Bel, with his appeal for support to Louis VII, were significant presages of future developments. The intellectuals' contribution to the practice of government was, at least in the short term, less of a mixed blessing than their political and legal theorizing. It lay in producing  those written documents — charters, writs, letters, accounts — by which hitherto spasmodic personal contacts between princes and their officials and subjects could be regularized, and in inventing new ways of increasing efficiency. The evolution of a rudimentary bureaucracy was, by 1180, the distinguishing feature of royal and princely administrations. Again the example of ecclesiastical organization was formative; but by 1180, lay bureaucracies had acquired a momentum and an approach all their own. Shortly after the middle of the century, John of Salisbury finished his famous Policraticus , a discursive and unanalytical work devoted to criticizing the contemporary mores in the ruling circles of church and state, and to putting forward a higher code of conduct. Relying on the Bible, Roman law, and the classics to explain what ought to be, John also drew on his own experience to describe the contemporary scene. Though primarily a commentary on Henry II's government in England, the Policraticus used the terms of Roman law,princeps for ruler and provincia , province, for the area of his rule; these suggest that John also intended his book to be relevant to France, the land in which he had been educated and to which he was to return as bishop of Chartres. The most famous chapter in the Policraticus is that which sets forth the organic image of the commonwealth, the prince the head, the church the soul, the senate the heart, the soldiers the arms, the peasants the legs — a classical cliché brought up-to-date. The importance of this image in the history of western political thought has long been recognized; indeed it has been hailed as the rebirth of the concept of state in the Middle Ages. Its most striking feature is the importance attributed to princely officials: judges and provincial governors are the eyes, ears and tongue of the body politic; officials are the hands; and financial officers the stomach and intestines. By the middle of the twelfth century, John's French readers would have had no difficulty in making the necessary identifications: castellans and viscounts,baillis and prévôts , household officers, the clerks, knights, and chamberlains of princely courts abounded. Bureaucracy, long absent from the country, was making a rapid return, both at central and at local levels. And John  of Salisbury was not alone in believing that the administrative class was in dire need of instruction, lest it subvert the common good in its own or its master's interests. The social origins of the new administrators have interested historians. The Erembald family, of which the chancellor of St Donatian's and the castellan of Bruges were members in 1127, was alleged by its opponents to be of servile origin; that its members chose to murder Charles the Good rather than dispute the allegation suggests its truth. If this was so, their social ascent was uncommonly sharp. But a recent study of the Capetian kings' household has traced a growing reliance on knights of lowly birth and clerks whose claim to prominence sprang solely from their usefulness. The Cleer family in Anjou were of knightly status. And in Normandy, both Henry I and Henry II favoured ‘new men’, some at least of whom were of modest families. How their absence of social distinction affected the performance of their duties can only be guessed. But it may be that, as men of little social consequence, they lacked that sensitivity to personal relationships on which the aristocratic society of the tenth and eleventh centuries had depended; for the newcomers, what was sauce for the goose was likely to be sauce for the gander. Because they saw the world as composed of groups rather than of individuals, they found it easy to articulate rules of general application, to which exceptions required specific dispensation. But of course this viewpoint was liable to emerge in any case at a time in which government was extending its reach down the social scale, to affect towns, privileged communities, and even on occasion serfs. The schools springing up all over France in the twelfth century probably had a formative influence on the administrators, though this can rarely be proved. At the court of Louis VII, there was Mainier, a lawyer, whose name was prefaced by the title magister , meaning that he had received a licentia docendi , a licence to teach. Elsewhere, it is uncertain how many of the clerks and knights of princely households obtained from schools the pragmatic literacy on which they called in their day-to-day business. It is rather more likely that clerks had benefit of formal education than knights. But courts themselves were places of education; ‘With the king of England it is school every day’, as Peter of Blois remarked. And literacy, at least in the vernacular, could certainly be acquired without the aid of schooling. But whether directly or indirectly, the incipient bureaucracies clearly owed much to scholastic methods, to the categorization of information, the use of abstract nouns, and the search for system, that the schools had pioneered. Because administrators depended on their lord's favour, they devoted themselves with vigour to Promoting his interests. Here lay the spur to innovation, as can be seen in the Norman and Flemish accounting systems, which combined the techniques of survey and inquest with the new arithmetic to protect and increase the revenues available to the duke of Normandy and the count of Flanders. The Norman exchequer (probably instituted in the early years of the century, at the same time as its English counterpart) used the tally, the chequered cloth, and the abacus to provide records for the illiterate and to overcome the considerable problems posed by the use of Roman numerals in addition and subtraction. These were not new expedients; but their regular and systematic application to the ends of government effected a solid gain in efficiency. The aim of the Norman exchequer rolls was to provide a complete record of the debts and revenues due from each administrative unit of the duchy. The aim of the 1187 Grote Bref in Flanders was a little different: in adding all revenues and expenditures together, it offered a rough estimate of the count's total income (though in fact there were resources not mentioned in the account.) A less exciting but equally innovative characteristic of princely officials was that they now existed in sufficient numbers to be used to check up on one another. Henry H noted threateningly at the end of a letter of command addressed to one of his prévôts : ‘If you do not do this, William of Vernone or his servants will do it; and if they do not do it, my justice shall do it.’ Princes were at last within reach of achieving their ends — or some of them — without having to resort to lengthy persuasion, to bribery or to the use of force. Hardly surprisingly, officials were unpopular, both with sophisticated men like Walter Map and the Goliardic poets  and with ordinary peasants. So despite the enormous gains they conferred un their masters, they were often cheated of the loyal support they deserved. There were few things more calculated to endear a prince to his subjects than a display of stern retribution on unjust officials. John of Marmoutier tells the legend that Geoffrey le Bel dressed up as a rustic and listened to complaints about his prévôts ’ rapacity; on his return to court, he paid back the sums they had extorted, and threatened them with death if they continued to defraud the peasantry. Though almost certainly untrue, the tale succinctly illustrates the prevailing princely ambivalence: they distanced themselves from the servants on whom they relied. (d) Warfare and crusades The poet Marbod of Rennes celebrated (in Latin) the vengeance which would befall a wicked castellan and his troops: The poem highlights two important twelfth-century developments: the use of force in punishing aristocratic crime (the fruit of princely peace-keeping), and the increasing significance of siege-engines in warfare. Intellectuals claimed a formative influence in the second too: John of Marmoutier declared that monks from his own monastery had read Vegetius' De Re Militari to Geoffrey le Bel when he was investing the castle of a rebellious castellan, and ascribed  his success to their advice on firebombs. But common sense may have been more important than learning in perceiving the vulnerability of most castles to — battering-rams and catapults; for even in 1100 they were, as a rule, primitive structures. Siege-engines demanded on the one hand skilled operators, and on the other a plentiful supply of unskilled labourers to move the necessary materials. This effectively restricted their use to the wealthy and to those whose claim to assistance under the ban was incontrovertible. Equally, the improvements in fortification needed to withstand their effects — thick stone walls, inner as well as outer defences — required incomes greater than those of simple lords. The net effect was that, given dedication, princes — Louis VI, Geoffrey le Bel, Alphonse-Jourdain — could subdue rebellious castellans within their own demesnes, and could build castles of their own which were impregnable to all but lengthy and sustained attack. Henry II's castle at Chinon, where the treasury of Anjou was situated, was the model for its generation, with its halls, upper chambers, tower, and curtain walling, set on a high point above a strategic crossing of the Loire. It could be copied only either by those of nearly equal wealth or by those who could concentrate their resources chiefly on defence — princes, great bishops or, in the south especially, towns. All others became vulnerable. John of Salisbury's comment that not only the towns but also the fortresses of Gaul feared Henry I of England was revealing of the new situation. Similarly, campaigning in the field imposed an increasing financial burden. The treaty between Robert II of Flanders and Henry I of England, renewed by their successors, stipulated that each knight supplied to the English king should bring three horses with him — this at a time when a horse represented a major investment. Then knightly armour grew more elaborate and costly throughout the century. And though some knights might be supplied free by feudal service, household ones had to be maintained by their lords, mercenary ones needed pay, and those with money-fiefs constituted a regular charge on the treasury. Besides, away from their home base, knights were useless on their  own. In open battle and in the plundering expeditions that constituted the normal form of aggressive warfare, they needed the backing of archers, both mounted and on foot, and of numerous infantrymen. The usual source of supply was town militias — Suger mentions those of Rheims, Châlons, Laon, Soissons, Orléans, Etampes, and Paris in the royal army of 1124. But they might have to be supplemented by mercenaries from Flanders and the Low Countries, where the rapidly expanding population forced large numbers of young men into military careers. In the eyes of the faithful, these ‘Brabanters’, with their freebooting and lack of discipline after the end of campaigns, were as dangerous as heretics; in 1171 Frederick Barbarossa and Louis VII agreed to expel them from their lands. Their value in battle, as shields behind which the knights could shelter before they launched their charge, ensured their continued employment by those who could afford them — notably Henry II of England. But the hatred they aroused meant that they were liable to be brutally slaughtered if captured afterwards. Inevitably, therefore, war on the grand scale as fought by princes bore little resemblance in practice to the feuds of lesser men. The divergence was sharpened by the application of a theoretical distinction, the fruit of Augustinian theology, amplified as the century went on by canon and Roman law reference; princes pronounced their campaigns just wars (fought against aggressors with the aim of re-establishing peace) or public wars (declared by a competent authority in the public interest), while they condemned the wars of lesser men as infractions of the peace. Geoffrey Martel had perceived the propaganda potential of public war as early as the mid eleventh century; later it enabled Henry the Liberal of Champagne to claim the military service of all lords within his county, a reapplication of the Carolingian ban . So it could be a powerful weapon. Yet the logic of the definition suggested that it would benefit especially kings, whose competence to declare war could not be impugned: thus Thibaud of Blois failed to persuade the monks of Marmoutier that they owed him service when he fought against Louis VI; they claimed discretion in the matter; and in 1184, the mighty Philip of Alsace hesitated to commit to battle the army he had summoned against Philip Augustus, through fear that its ranks might melt away. The contrast with the united front Louis VI and his troops presented to the emperor Henry V in 1124 was marked. A royal banner now bestowed respectability on a cause; kings' wars were assumed to be for the sake of peace, even when cripplingly expensive and increasingly savage. This goes some way to explaining why the complicated campaigns within Toulouse in the second half of the century were largely fought out under the banners of the Angevin, Aragonese, and French kings; and why the revolts of Henry II's sons had widespread ramifications. The twelfth century was characterized, therefore, by fewer but more protracted wars, which smouldered for long periods between short, sharp bouts of conflict, like the war that covered must of the reigns of Henry I of England and Louis VI of France, the one inaugurated by the great rebellion of 1173, which outlived both Louis VII and Henry II, or that against Catalan claims in the south. Into these large numbers of local conflicts were subsumed. The pattern caused problems, in that the circumstances which might trigger off renewed fighting were unpredictable; yet the moment an opportunity offered, princes had to be prepared for invading their enemies; there was no time for lengthy preparation. The usual tactic was to march troops across the enemy's territory, plundering and looting; to take fortified places if the task was easy; to obtain allies among the lords of the locality; and to retreat without fighting a battle if at all possible — in effect an application to a wider canvas of the some technique of warfare which had earlier made castellans formidable in the immediate environs of their castles. It necessitated the rapid mobilization of auxiliaries to join a core of highly-trained troops kept constantly, at the ready — the princes' military households, which became the linch pin of the system. John of Marmoutier's life of Geoffrey le Bel offers a glimpse of how strong bonds were created between the prince and his followers within the household, and how a high level of training was maintained at all times. Geoffrey was brought up  from infancy with the sons of neighbouring Angevin lords, on whose companionship he relied. When it came time for him to be knighted by Henry I in Rouen, he set off for Normandy with a crowd of these young men about him. In Rouen, the occasion was celebrated with pomp, elaborate dress, and a great feast, and then the youths all demonstrated their military skill at a grand tournament, at which Geoffrey naturally won the highest honours. It was within this kind of environment that chivalry flourished, that young men learned to identify, their vassalage towards their lord as a symbol of their honour, that they debated the relative merits of Roland's and Oliver's way of displaying loyalty; and that they learned the finer points of jousting. Tournaments were disapproved of by ecclesiastics, for they could be both bloody and dangerous. Yet they supplied real needs:. that of an instruction in the martial arts compatible with the maintenance of a prince's peace; that of an outlet for competitive instincts within the claustrophobic confines of a court; and that of display to maintain princely social status. So they flourished everywhere. They offered opportunities for men of skill to acquire great position in the world — Arnoul of Ardres caught the eye of Countess Ida of Boulogne through his exploits; and they also conferred lustre on the great — Geoffrey le Bel and Philip of Alsace were renowned throughout France for their distinguished performances in these show battles. All this formed a background to the first century of crusading; and it goes some way to explaining the more secular aspects of the magnetism which drew French knights to take up the cross in their thousands. Urban II, launching the First Crusade at Clermont in 1095, presented it as a natural evolution of the peace movement: warriors were to forget their petty feuds and squabbles in a campaign to promote the interests of Holy Church. The war, declared by one whose moral authority was unimpeachable, was to free the Eastern churches, to end Muslim guardianship of the holy places, to restore Jerusalem to its proper state. As princes saw it, it was a just war in the fullest sense of the term; those who were slaughtered in its battles were regarded as among the martyrs of the church. When Raymond of Toulouse, Robert II of Flanders, Robert Curthose, Stephen of Blois, and Hugh of Vermandois responded to the call, past and present members of their military households fell almost automatically into rank behind them, to test themselves against terrible dangers, but also to enjoy the companionship in arms, the adventure, the deeds of daring which were the stuff of the chansons de geste . That they shared, along with all other participants in the crusade, a fervent devotion, a conviction that their sins would be forgiven, is certain. Yet for them crusading necessitated no large leap of the imagination, no millenarian vision; it was simply a challenging and a deserving extension of their everyday activities. In French eyes, the hero of the First Crusade was Robert II of Flanders. While Raymond of Toulouse remained in Outremer, Stephen and Hugh disgraced themselves in escaping from the siege of Antioch, and Robert Curthose, no matter how gallant, at least in his lifetime failed to impress, Robert II's prestige soared to the skies. He became Robert of Jerusalem to his contemporaries; his deeds were recorded in the Song of Antioch ; his pious bravery totally expunged the memory of Robert the Frisian's usurpation; and after his death his son Baldwin VII harped on his father's achievement to justify his substantial use of coercion against the enemies of the church. Outside Flanders, Robert's sister's marriage to Roger of Sicily was a mark of his new position in the world; like Louis VI's sister's marriage to Bohemond of Antioch, it stretched French kinship connections into the new Norman colonies, ensuring that travellers from the homeland would find a welcome in those distant parts. Robert's example was a potent one. After the next change in dynasty, Thierry and Philip of Alsace strengthened their shaky claim to the comital position by attaining for themselves the prestige attached to being the outstanding crusaders of their generation. Thierry's remote connection with the family of Godfrey de Bouillon, along with his marriage with Sybilla of Anjou, Fulk V's daughter, gave him some claim to the throne of Jerusalem; as a consequence, the aristocracy of Outremer viewed him and Philip with mixed feelings, expecting much of them, yet fearing their ambitions. In the end, it was not in Outremer but in the newly conquered  Byzantine empire that the Flemish crusading achievement was crowned with the elevation of Count Baldwin IX to the imperial throne in 1204. But in the twelfth century, the house of Alsace could afford the high costs of their expeditions — Thierry went to Jerusalem four times, Philip twice — and the counts' repeated absences in fact promoted administrative reform; the baillis and the Grote Bref were as much the products of crusading as the English and Norman judicial system and exchequers were the product of the king-duke's divided attentions. But if, on balance, the Flemish counts benefited materially from crusading,— as, arguably, did the Angevin — they were far from typical. For other French houses a commitment to Outremer often represented a sacrifice of domestic political interest. The achievements of Raymond IV St Gilles in consolidating his authority within Toulouse were threatened by his departure in 1095, especially since it was known that he had no intention of returning home. Then his example lured his elder son Bertrand to Tripoli in 1112, and his younger son Alphonse Jourdain there in 1147. Had not his grandson Raymond V fulfilled his crusading obligation in his early youth, thereby freeing himself from the necessity of interrupting his career in the county, the principality of Toulouse might have disintegrated altogether. William IX's crusade of 1101 brought about serious financial problems in Aquitaine which caused rapid devaluation in the hitherto stable currency; and Robert Curthose's decision to mortgage Normandy to William Rufus in order to cover his crusading expenses exacerbated a conflict over the duchy which was not settled until the death of his son William Clito in 1128. All in all, it was not surprising that Suger, mulling over the precedents of early crusading, tried to dissuade Louis VII from embarking on his Jerusalem journey in 1145. Yet the appeal of crusading was, if anything, even stronger to those aristocratic houses just below the level of the princely: it was, after all, the house of Boulogne which produced the first two rulers of Jerusalem. The counts of Nevers, the lords of Montpellier, the lords of Amboise and Lusignan, the Trencavels, were fervent devotees of the ideal; so the problems of absences, shipwrecks, death abroad plagued them as much as  their princes. On occasion, their determination to sacrifice for Christ played directly into their overlord's hands, as when the count of La Marche, who had no direct heir, sold his county to King Henry II in 1177. When it did not, accompanying their princes in a joint crusading venture, as the lord of Amboise accompanied Fulk V or Hugh VI de Lusignan William IX, created new personal links. The political spin-offs from crusading are therefore more difficult to calculate than at first glance they might appear. Nevertheless it is clear that the chief gainer was Louis VII. The irony of this lay in the fact that the Second Crusade was counter-productive in Outremer, embittered relations with Byzantium, and resulted in the deaths of enormous numbers of its participants, particularly those drawn from the non-aristocratic classes. Yet it consolidated the king's position within France, partly through the skilled regency of Suger, but also because, in taking on himself the leadership of the expedition, Louis re-emerged as a credible ruler of men. His noble gesture appeased those churchmen who had been appalled by his early obstinacy over the archbishopric of Bourges. The disasters that befell his army paradoxically heightened his personal charisma: even the barons of Outremer continued to look on him as their one potential saviour. His friendship with Raymond V of Toulouse, a fellow warrior, reversed the trend of history since the middle of the tenth century, in bringing the princes of the far south back into the king's mouvance . The crowds of Burgundians who accompanied the king learned to respect him; on their return, they sought the arbitration of the royal court in their disputes, and they welcomed Louis's intervention within the counties that fringed the duchy of Burgundy. As William of St Denis put it, Even as early as 1147 it was apparent that the crusading movement had provided a new sense of aristocratic cohesion  in the realm. The great joint expeditions, the combined leaderships, although not without friction, had been justified by their outstanding achievement, the conquest and maintenance of Jerusalem. They were the Gesta Francorum , the deeds of the Franks, or the Gesta Dei per Francos , God's deeds performed through the Franks, as two of their earliest chroniclers entitled them. But what was missing before 1147 was a clear sense of who the Franks were. The Second Crusade, however, was launched with St Bernard's ringing appeal to the count and barons of Brittany: In taking his place at the head of the Second Crusade, the Rex Francorum decisively hastened the transformation of the Franks into the French."
ACA ACA-EW1-001 1.19 "Revival under Law, 1911–1914 Few contemporaries would have expected Balfour's retirement to lead to a Unionist recovery. The party was in a mutinous condition in November 1911 and there was no apparent successor who would have even half of Balfour's political gifts. Nor was it clear that Balfour's departure was universally desired: at the National Union Conference a few days later, Leo Maxse was booed off the platform, and constituency parties everywhere passed resolutions regretting Balfour's decision. A great many crocodile tears were shed, for, since Unionists had such an elevated view of the principle of leadership, they were unable to accept that they had just driven their own leader from office. The shock caused by Balfour's going thus did something to steady the party and it certainly produced a real determination to settle the affairs of the party with less friction than had been fashionable of late. The main contenders for the leadership were Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long, representing the two different establishments of the Edwardian Unionist party — the opposite worlds of Birmingham and Wiltshire — but the situation was complicated by the intervention of two outsiders, Edward Carson and Andrew Bonar Law. Two strong groups emerged behind Long and Chamberlain, about equal in numbers, but there were few backers for Carson or Law. Carson thereupon fell out of the contest — or rather announced that he was not standing, for no official nominations had been made. The party officers and Whips were solidly behind Chamberlain, but Law drew off some of his support among tariff reformers and, urged on by Edward Goulding and Max Aitken, he refused to withdraw unless his continued candidature would allow Long to win. Against Chamberlain it was remembered that he was a Liberal Unionist (as was Lansdowne, who led the Unionists in the Lords) and that he had not been entirely loyal to Balfour since the referendum pledge. Long was supported by the bulk of the English county members but by few of the party's men of talent. By the morning of Friday 10 November it was clear that neither Chamberlain nor Long would secure a majority and that some supporters of each of them would not contentedly follow the other. A party meeting was to be held on the following Monday and the Whips were making preparation for a vote to be taken. Chamberlain provided the way out by suggesting to Balcarres that both he and Long should withdraw and so allow Law to be elected unanimously; he also turned down  Balcarres's remarkable advice that he should allow Long to be elected since Long would make such a mess of things that Chamberlain would be bound to succeed within the year. Faced with Chamberlain's proposition, and without a majority of his own, Long had no option but to agree. Bonar Law, backed by fewer MPs than any of the other three contenders at the beginning of the week was now to be the unanimous choice. Robert Sanders reported the ""election"" meeting on 13 November with evident satisfaction: The Carlton meeting on Monday went off quite admirably. Harry Chaplin in the chair a very great success. A good many men came into the room by no means inclined to acquiesce in the proposed arrangement. Walter Long proposed Bonar Law. His speech was one of the best things I have heard. Manly and rather touching. The country gentleman at his best. He spoke and evidently felt strongly of the degradation that it would have been to the parry to have elected a leader by secret ballot. Austen followed. When Austen sat down Chaplin suggested that he had better put the question at once and on getting an affirmative shout did so. A clever way of stifling discussion and few could have done it so well. Motion carried unanimously. Bonar Law then sent for… His speech struck me as the feeblest of the day. He was evidently moved and nervous. The meeting separated in great content with the Conservative Party all round. It was certainly creditable. The urgency of the events following Balfour's resignation was due to the need to find a new leader before the National Union Conference. So within a few days of his grudging acceptance by his parliamentary colleagues, Law's leadership was ratified by the throng of party notables at Leeds; here he received a reception more typical of what was to come in the future. In 1911 Law was known — in so far as he was known at all in the parliamentary party — as a spirited debater. A.). P. Taylor has noted that Law was trained, if he was trained for anything in his early career, to be a debater. In Glasgow he had picked up many of the skills that a more highly-born politician might have acquired in the Oxford Union or at the Bar, but skills that were very different in appearance. His concern was solely with effectiveness rather than style; he rarely spoke with more than brief notes and left it to the occasion to furnish the words. (When he became Chancellor of the Exchequer this practice caused consternation at the Treasury, when he used only a page of notes to assist him in moving complicated resolutions on wartime finance; he relied successfully on his memory to provide details and figures.) As an extempore speaker he was able to tailor his words to his audience's reactions and so convey the impression of personal conversation even when addressing thousands. In parliament he was wont to abandon an argument half-completed if he sensed that his point had been made; the speeches that appear in Hansard were touched up by his staff, and his speeches in the country were given to the press in advance. In debate he was a formidable opponent, and one that Asquith was never able to master, for all his forensic skills. Again Law succeeded by unorthodoxy; he was quick to grasp the essentials of an opponent's argument and quite prepared to be rude  or direct if the situation demanded it. In the long debates over Marconi in 1913 and over the Curragh ""mutiny"" in 1914 Law was able to nail Asquith's evasions where a more polished stylist might have been foiled. Occasionally, in the onrush of pursuit, he gave commitments that were later regretted, but these were a small price to pay. The Unionist recovery was built around Law's leadership, but what Asquith called the ""new style"" of obstruction, threats and offensive behaviour did not originate with Law. The beginnings are to be found in the diehard campaign against the Parliament Bill. It was in June 1911 that the first scenes of disorder were mounted in the House of Commons, led by Lord Hugh Cecil. In August 1911 the diehard peers used language as violent as any that Law was to use later, and in the crucial decision on the House of Lords Law sided with the hedgers rather than the ditchers. Ulster's opposition to Home Rule long pre-dated Law's leadership and he had rarely even spoken on Irish affairs in parliament before becoming leader. Before he succeeded Balfour then, Law was not associated with any of the features that were to characterize his party leadership; his contribution was to use the leadership in the service of all of these causes, to make himself the spokesman for the most spirited sections of the party. Law conceived of the role of the leader in an exactly opposite sense from Balfour: he sought to foster unity by placing himself at the head of the discordant elements where Balfour had thrown the leadership on the side of restraint. Their respective positions explain this in part: as ex-Prime Minister and a considerable figure in his own right, Balfour had the confidence to believe in his own judgement even when isolated from the bulk of the party; as the tertium quid in the recent contest, Law had neither the weight nor the confidence to take such a detached view. His strategy was rather to canalize the enthusiasm of the diehards into party channels, to articulate their views, and to create unity from the sense of movement. In his characteristic phrase, ""I am their leader, I must follow them"" — but he determined to follow them from the front. As a result of this he was labelled as a diehard and a bigot, when he actually distrusted the diehards and was himself distrusted by the bigots. Much of his leadership was thus a form of pragmatic extremism, extreme action and the threat of more extreme action to come, but used in the cause of more limited objectives. He certainly held deep convictions as to the absolute wrongness of the Liberal policies that he opposed, but at least a part of his apparent hostility was assumed for the occasion, a hard line that might secure a better compromise in the end. So in his first major speech as leader in parliament he wasted little time on the customary compliments and warned the government that he intended to play hard. In private conversation he told Asquith""I am afraid that I shall have to show myself very vicious Mr Asquith this session. I hope you will understand."" In later conversations about Ulster, Law was frank enough to point out that bloodshed in Ulster would be the best way of ensuring an electoral landslide for the Unionists. There was then an  open toughness about party tactics; before the Buckingham Palace Conference in 1914 he had Central Office work out the electoral effects of excluding nine, six or four counties of Ulster from an independent Ireland the concern of a calculating pragmatist not of a bigot. From the party viewpoint Law's methods were successful but dangerous; expectations raised when the party was in full cry were not easily set aside for an eventual compromise, and the only outcome that would fully vindicate the methods was the recovery of power. The basis of recovery was then Law's fighting capacities as leader. In parliament there would be a carefully organized campaign of resistance that would at least slow the government down and raise Unionist morale. Improved morale would also make possible organizational advances outside parliament, all linked to the issue of Ulster, and with the sights fixed firmly on the next election, an election that would make or break the Union, the Empire and Law's leadership of the party. All was linked to the sense of a new departure, a ""new style"" , a ""new regime in politics"" and a new team at the helm: as well as a new leader, the party had by the middle of 1912 a new Chief Whip, Party Chairman, party treasurer, principal agent, press adviser, and an almost entirely new team of Whips and organizers. Party organization provided the easiest advances because it was the only area entirely under the party's control. No general election was fought by the organization set up after 1911, but there is little doubt that there was a massive improvement; criticisms that were commonplace in 1910 were not to be heard by 1913. The space available to Central Office was increased by the acquisition of St Stephen's House as well as St Stephen's Chambers, which had been occupied since 1874; the new office cost $3,000 a year in rent alone. The quality of the senior staff was improved by the appointment of three specialists. John Boraston took over as Principal Agent in 1912, having been a professional organizer all his career and latterly chief agent to the Liberal Unionist Council. He joined William Jenkins, appointed chief organizing agent in 1911 and previously district agent for the Midlands Liberal Unionists. The party was indeed handed over to Birmingham. Finally, Malcolm Fraser, ex-editor of the Standard and of the Daily Express became first honorary press adviser and subsequently was employed to run the press bureau at the colossal salary of £1,200. Steel-Maitland, Boraston, Jenkins and Fraser made up a team of experts, all of sufficient status to deal with politicians who might call into the office; the work of the office was departmentalized for the first time and the heads of department brought together into a supervising board. The influence of Central Office toned up the rest of the organization. A new canvass system was introduced in 1911 so that all county constituencies would operate the same system and so that duplicate records could be kept at area level. This was important at a time when outvoters were a larger group in many constituencies than the size of the majority and when the outvoters were overwhelmingly Unionist. In 1914 a register of car owners was  compiled, also important when some voters could cast several votes in an election when polling went several days. By November 1912 only fifty-one constituencies in Great Britain were without candidates, a much better position than the position at dissolution in either 1909 or 1910; few of these fifty-one constituencies were winnable, but in any case most of them had candidates by the end of 1913. A programme of speakers for a general election was also ready by 1913, with both constituencies and politicians told in advance what they might expect. The financial mismanagement that had reigned before 1911 was ended with the employment of professional accountants. Expenditure on Central Office, district offices and the London office doubled from £32,466 in 1909–10 to $68,957 in 1913–14; the total expenditure of the party organization from central funds also doubled from $73,000 to over £150,000. To pay for this outpouring, a great drive was mounted for additional income -by Farquhar and Steel-Maitland. In 1912 ordinary subscriptions still brought in only £12000 a year and it proved difficult to raise them to anything like what was needed. The method adopted was to canvass for capital donations that could then be invested to bring in a regular income, and both Balfour and Law were used to raise the wind. Steel-Maitland told Balfour that""Farquhar and I are endeavouring to raise more money. I think we are likely to succeed — thanks in part to the very generous example set by Lord Rothschild. But I would b, e very glad if I might see you on your return to ask you to help me in two cases. Systematic collections were made from peers and from the City; by the outbreak of war the invested funds amounted to $671,000 — twice the sum in 1911 and worth four years""expenditure — and there was a special cash deposit of £120,000 for the coming election. In three other areas, as much political as organizational, advances were made towards the management of the press, the coordination of the heterogeneous collection that made up the party, and the fostering of modern attitudes in the local parties. Under Malcolm Fraser the party began to make effective use of its support in Fleet Street. It had been recognized that Liberals had been more adept at handling the press because they were more ready to stoop to newspaper practices, as Sandars had reported in 1909: I told Northcliffe that if his people would make enquiries at our Central Office, he would find that our nightly regiment of speakers was at least as well worth reporting as the Radical contingent, but that I realized that from the Press point of view, no doubt, our speakers did not play up to the reporters by handing them their speeches in advance, and by other tricks of the kind to which the Radical orators have recourse. This was the essence of the problem: the press could only be managed by someone who knew their methods and who would not expect them to come round to Central Office to search for news. The UOC found that""it is patent that some feeling exists among the Unionist Press that, while in the past they have done much for the Party, the Party has not assisted in their work. In  many quarters it is asserted that the Unionist Press are treated with greater courtesy by the Radicals than by their own side."" Fraser dealt with this problem without difficulty and explained to Law in 1913 that""the importance of getting important speeches in advance is shown in concrete manner by your Wallsend speech on October 29th. The verbatim reports reached most of the newspapers in places such as Aberdeen at one o ""clock in the morning of the 30th.""  He went on to quote the response that had been received from editors: Manchester Dispatch: I hope you will continue this form of enterprise. You fully know as an old pressman the difficulty of dealing with a big speech late at night… Daily Express: I am much obliged to you for the precis of Mr Bonar Law's speech last night. It was a great help to us. The speech came over the wires so late and the sheets were so confused by the Post Office — which is usual in these cases — that without the precis we could not possibly have got the leader through in time for the first edition. So in the supply of information to newspapers predisposed to support the party, much was achieved merely by employing a specialist. The other side of press management, depending on informal contacts, is less easy to assess. In 1911 Steel-Maitland invited Blumenfeld of the Daily Express to Central Office for a two-way exchange of ideas and advice. He also used Law himself to impress editors who were on less familiar terms with Fraser, as with Marlowe of the Daily Mail, and Law took a direct interest in negotiations with the most difficult of all the Unionist editors, J. L. Garvin of the Observer. Law personally conducted the negotiations with Gardner Sinclair over the sale of the Observer and the Pall Mall Gazette in 1914; this negotiation also demonstrates that, as well as producing information and nursing editors, the party had to work hard to keep some of the newspapers in business. Sinclair did buy the Observer and the Pall Mall in the end, but not before he had been given a $45,000 guarantee from party funds. Such investments had a double purpose, for they could bring in income and provide a political bonus. One such scheme involved the purchase of the Daily Express by Max Aitken with party funds, but the party was also propping up the Globe, the Standard, and a wide range of provincial dailies. All these transactions were secret, for there would be little use in keeping a paper alive if it were known to be owned by a political party. The papers were therefore bought through nominees or bank loans backed with party capital. It was usual to extract some form of guarantee in exchange for party support but the secrecy prevented such undertakings from being enforced. Sinclair thus gave an undertaking that his papers would always remain Unionist, but Steel-Maitland doubted if such a promise had any value. The later history of the Daily Express suggests not: when the Express became hostile in the 1920s, Younger raged ""when I think of the large sum of money this office has put into that gutter print it makes my blood boil"" . The justification for pouring out large sums without a certain return was the even greater cost  of any real alternative. The support for the Express in 1912""provides for the introduction of £50,000 or $60,000 to retain the only half-penny paper the Party possesses in London, and no less a sum than $700,000 to £1, 000,000 would be necessary to start a similar paper if the Daily Express were allowed to go. The struggle therefore went on to keep the Unionist press alive, and in 1912 and 1913 both Aitken and Northcliffe stood by the party and gave valuable support in their papers. The coordination of competing party bodies was carried out with surprising ease. The National Union was merged with Central Office in 1911 and fusion with the Liberal Unionists followed in 1912. Joseph Chamberlain retained his preference for independence but allowed himself to be overruled by Austen and by the overwhelming wishes of the Liberal Unionist Council to merge. To cater for all susceptibilities, the party became the ""National Unionist Association of Conservative and Unionist Associations"" — a decision that allowed some local parties to go on calling themselves Conservative, but the name ""Liberal"" was at last dropped. The Liberal Unionists were admitted to the Carlton Club and a longstanding source of tension was eradicated. This was in itself a striking commentary on what had already been done: Liberal Unionists who had resisted amalgamation under Balfour and Acland-Hood in 1911 acquiesced meekly under Law and Steel-Maitland in 1912. Other organizations could not be absorbed but could still be brought within the Central Office orbit. So in 1911 Steel-Maitland offered to join the Halsbury Club in order to guide it on to safer lines — and was immediately accused of disloyalty by Walter Long. Long helped though by placing both Steel-Maitland and Boraston on the Executive Committee of the Union Defence League for the same purpose. Steel-Maitland also explained to Lord Robert Cecil that ""it has been arranged that the National Conservative Union should send out leaflets produced by several of the ancillary organizations, such as the Tariff Reform League, the Anti-Socialist Union, the Primrose League, the London Municipal Society etc.""  The Central Office attitude was flexible, for outside bodies would always exist and could even be made use of: They represent a time when either their objects were not the same as those of the official organization, or the CCO was not enterprising enough to suit them. But some caution should be observed. It may be wise, while retaining or regaining control, to trade under different names. In some cases additional subscriptions may be obtained, in others full responsibility may be avoided. With open allies like the Primrose League, the case for collaboration was strong; for the first time in thirty years of existence the Primrose League formally linked itself with the party in 1914. On the other hand, the independence of the Tariff Reform League was a positive advantage: after January 1913 the party supported the tariff policy but was not including them in its immediate programme, so that Central Office could continue to distribute tariff propaganda from the TRL without compromising party policy. In general, efforts to ensure better coordination were a matter of the  patient building up of contacts, although the improved party morale and the greater efficiency of Central Office had removed their justification for existence. It was the First World War that finally killed off the ""legion of Leagues"" , but it had ceased to be a problem before 1914. Modernization at the local level was also a matter of patience: The difficulty of all this work is trebled through the face that the Office cannot say ""go and he goes, and come and he comes"" as in a factory. It is always ""by your leave and if you please"" , and the influence in controlling, which might be very great…is only exerted through position, knowledge and willingness to help."" Steel-Maitland's method was the systematic collection of information by the Central Office district agents in constituency books that recorded all income, expenditure and political activity. The National Union and the Whips were used when necessary to exert pressure for reform, but the main influence was the Central Office agents: I propose to make proper local centres of the Central Office Agents. If they are to get full influence for the purpose of bringing constituencies up to the mark, they can only get it by being the channels for help. I propose therefore that speakers in a locality should be supplied by the Agent in charge of it; and that grants of literature and money to organizations be made through them. By 1913–14, over £25,000 was being given away in this manner and in return the Central Office agents were able to ensure the appointment of suitable constituency agents and the choice of good candidate The outlay constituted only about a tenth of the whole of the local parties""expenditure, but a much higher proportion of the expenditure of the backward parties most in need of reform. The First World""War interrupted the process, but it is clear that much had been done by 1914. In the political world there were issues that Unionists could always exploit against a Liberal government such as defence policy and the administration of the Empire. The threatening international situation gave new impetus to demands for a larger navy and a conscript army, both taken up by Unionists. The National Service League ran the campaign for conscription and the Navy League the campaign for faster naval building, but both were led by known Unionists. In 1912 the Conference gave its support and condemned""the criminal failure of H.M. Ministers to maintain the British Navy and the British Army at a standard of strength adequate to National and Imperial needs"". In the following year an even stronger resolution on the navy was passed unanimously, but a resolution calling for national service was conveniently not reached at the end of the order paper; there was an undoubted commitment to a stronger army and navy but some doubt about the wisdom of a party commitment to conscription In peacetime. In any case, all this helped to prepare for the militarist attitude that the party was to take when war came, when it could advocate conscription without any fear of the electoral consequences. Individual Unionists pursued the defence issues even  more strongly than the leaders. Lord Charles Beresford continued his campaign against the Admiralty that had originated in his personal feud with Admiral Fisher, and he made the most of Churchill's unhappy relations with his admirals. The Morning Post joined in when the First Sea Lord, Sir Francis Bridgeman, resigned in 1912 and Bonar Law took up the issue too, suggesting that Bridgeman had been ""brutally ill-used"" by Churchill. The Secretary of State for War, John Seely, was also a favourite target, for he too was a renegade Unionist. In 1913 he came under pressure in the Commons for his failure to promote an air force; Samuel Hoare demonstrated the ineffectiveness of the government's policy by visiting the air bases to see them for himself. Unionists had easy openings on defence issues, for many Unionist MPs were ex-officers, but the experience of the country in the first two years of War suggests that their criticisms were not exaggerated. Defence was linked in the Unionist mind with imperial consolidation through tariffs: the new policy of 1901–2 had followed directly from the military weakness revealed by the Boer War and the approach of probable European conflict reinforced the same cause. The tariff reform camp had a bonus in 1911 from events in Canada: Laurier's Liberal government had negotiated a Reciprocity Agreement with the United States that cut across all of the arguments for imperial preference. Liberals saw this as evidence that the dominions were more interested in going their own way, but Unionists retorted that Canada like Britain had been led astray by a radical government and that Canada's decision was the result of Britain's failure to offer preference. Unionists were therefore beside themselves with joy when the Canadian electorate removed Laurier from office in September 1911 and replaced him with a Conservative, Sir Robert Borden, who now repudiated reciprocity. Unionist associations passed resolutions of support and the Unionist press hailed Borden as the hero who had saved the empire. This boost did much to wipe out the effect of Balfour's referendum pledge, which had been made a month before the Reciprocity Agreement and was erroneously believed to be its cause. It was now of the utmost importance for the Unionists to clarify their own position; Balfour's pledge had been a conditional one and was not in any case binding on his successor, but the unpopularity of food taxes remained. The shadow cabinet decided in April 1912 that it would abandon the referendum idea and return to the full tariff policy. The decision was not an easy one and was criticized by many who feared the consequences, as Salisbury told Law: ""If it may be said to have finally made possible the destruction of the constitution, the prostitution of the Prerogative, the Repeal of the Union and the Disendowment of the Welsh Church, it will probably rank as the most costly policy in history.""  Salisbury was supported in his attitude by his brothers, by Curzon and by Selborne; he would certainly be supported by Derby and by the weight of opinion on Lancashire. The shadow cabinet therefore took its decision in the clear knowledge that it would have a fight on  its hands, but it did so with the support of Lansdowne and Law. Replying to Salisbury, Law urged the positive side of the tariff policy for the economy and the danger of a party split if the referendum were not repudiated; there was a minority of free-traders, but there was also a vociferous majority of tariff reformers. The real reason though went deeper than tactical manoeuvring: I really believe, and it is here I think that I differ from your that there is a great deal in Tariff Reform; and I believe also that there is a great deal even in the food part of it. I do not now allude to preference though of course that comes first. In fact my real belief is that in the troubles ahead of us connected with labour we are moving very fast in the direction of revolution; and though you will consider my hope a baseless one I still entertain it — that it is by Tariff Reform that we might, so to speak, get the train at least shifted on to other lines. These two motivations are worth considering on their merits, for they reveal Bonar Law as a thinker of some insight. The imperial preference aspect was important because it might arrest the trends pulling the Empire apart; reciprocity had shown the danger and there was little time left to halt the slide. In retrospect it may seem that the trend was already irresistible — the First World War certainly made it so — but who is to say that a positive imperial policy pursued energetically in 1902 or 1912 was inevitably doomed to failure? This was the pure gospel of Joseph Chamberlain, especially real to Law because of his Canadian connections, but the real significance of the decision was felt by few in Britain, even on the Unionist side. We can at least now see how important a policy it might have been, how great a shift in the tides of history that it was attempting. In the domestic sphere the policy was equally fundamental, for tariff reform was seen as the antithesis of socialism. The Bismarckian social policy implied by tariffs, the success of the policy in places like Birmingham where it was properly advocated, and its attraction to social engineers like the early Fabians, all lend a certain plausibility to the idea. If something drastic were not done, then British politics would drift into class antagonism such as could be observed in France. The elections of 1906 and 1910 had shown the danger to the Unionist party from a Liberal-Labour alliance on class lines; the budget of 1909 had shown how far that alliance might threaten the social base on which Unionism itself rested; and the encroachments of the syndicalists suggested that there might be dangerous forces yet to be released. The only hope for a pessimist like Law was to ""get the train on to other lines"" — to focus the attention on the national unity of Britain rather than on internal divisions; in other words to emulate Germany rather than France. Again this hope seems set against the tides of history, but again we cannot be certain that a positive policy of Empire and tariffs could not have turned back the tide in 1902 or 1912. The infant Labour Party was just building its strength, but it was not yet capable of winning seats on its own, and it might have been checkmated for a generation by a positive social policy financed from tariffs. The tariff policy therefore  carried with it the last hope of consolidating the Empire and the last hope of reversing the drift into class politics; as a pessimist, Law saw further ahead than most of his contemporaries, and events proved him to be more nearly right than they were. In deference to the opposition within the party, the abandonment of the referendum was kept secret until Law had been able to consult with Borden, who of course insisted that tariffs without food taxes would be no value to Canada, but who also refused to make a public intervention in British politics. Fortified by assurances that confirmed his own views, Law pressed ahead, and the Tariff Reform League was mobilized for another great campaign. Lansdowne announced the changed policy at an Albert Hall rally on 14 November 1912, and Law gave his support at Ashton-under-Lyne on 16 December. The only modification offered by Law in response to the outcry from Unionist free-traders was that food taxes would be imposed only if requested by the Dominions; after his talks with Borden, there was no doubt about this anyway. By Christmas the party was in a furore, with the Cecils and Stanleys agitating against the new policy. Derby found a means of holding his leader to ransom : a meeting of Lancashire Unionists which threatened to disown the new policy was adjourned for three weeks at his suggestion. He protested to Law that he was doing everything possible to hold Lancashire steady, but he was actually doing all he could to keep the issue alive, including the sending of a questionnaire to all the Lancashire constituencies. Law was thus besieged with demands that he should retreat to a compromise position as Balfour had done in 1910, and again these demands came from tariff reformers as well as free-traders. The leaders would now have to resign, to change their policy, or to see their policy rejected by Lancashire Unionists early in the new year. Both Lansdowne and Law opted to announce their resignation at a party meeting, which would revive the open warfare over tariffs that had existed before 1906, and this would ensure the defeat of all the other party causes too. Long was now unwell and Austen Chamberlain could hardly become leader if Law had resigned over food taxes, so that there was no credible successor to Law. Law had indeed already done enough as leader to make his departure unthinkable and so a memorial was drawn up by Carson and signed by almost all the party's backbenchers, stating full confidence in Law and begging him to stay on with a revised tariff policy. Lansdowne and Law could only accede with as good a grace as they could muster; the party was therefore committed to a full policy of imperial preference, but food taxes would be excluded unless approved by a second general election. Law was bound to give way but in doing so he sacrificed the only positive policy he had. Without food taxes, he would have nothing to offer the Dominions to induce concessions in return and it would be impossible to advocate the policy with the fervour that would alone enable it to challenge the distribution of wealth as the central political issue of the future. In the urge to protect itself for the  negative battles of the present, the party thus pulled back from its only truly positive policy for the future. This dispute was the only major internal wrangle between Law's election and the war, but it illustrated the fragility of his achievement as a flash of lightning illuminates a landscape. Relations with Austen Chamberlain were never quite the same and although only a handful of MPs refused to sign the memorial they included personal friends of Law like Amery and Aitken. The unity of the party survived and was even strengthened by the clearing of the air, but the crisis left a bitter taste. Behind the scenes efforts were being made to broaden the party's appeal by strengthening its policies for social reform, the essential counterpoint to the theme of tariffs. This had been the intention of The New Order in 1908 and many of its contributors were enthusiastic backers of the Unionist Social Reform Committee when it was set up in 1911. This was always an unofficial research body, but it employed full-time staff, was housed at Central Office, and used the full machinery of party publicity to make itself known. This may have been due to the support of Steel-Maitland who was a founder member before he became Party Chairman and who later served on its committee on mental health. The purpose of the USRC was explained by its secretary to Lord Willoughby de Broke in August 1911: ""I still remain convinced as I have always been that unless you put yourself straight with the people on Social questions all your Tariff Reform, Home Rule or Constitutional thunderbolts will be discharged -in vain. You have to establish your bona fides before you can be listened to."" F. E. Smith was chairman of the new organization and announced its formation in a party magazine in the previous month; the range of subjects being investigated then included such diverse topics as police, aliens, asylums and railway clerks""compensation. The committee ""had secured the services of some of the best experts available"" and had sent observers to examine social legislation abroad.  ""By this means we hope to place at the disposal of our party in Parliament and in the country a trained body of fully formed critics, able not only to expose and correct the usual crudities of Radical-Socialist legislation, but to give form to a comprehensive policy of social reform.""  The USRC was therefore set up to play a role like that of the Conservative Research Department after 1929, but more unofficially. The committee's main concerns reflected the interests of its keenest members: the law of aliens covered by Edward Goulding, the poor law covered by Jack Hills, and rural housing covered by Arthur Griffith Boscawen. By 1914, Maurice Woods was able to announce that the committee had completed its immediate programme in every field but one and had therefore embarked on several secondary projects. The most successful project was on housing, which was exploited by the USRC in parliament and by Central Office in its propaganda. Griffith-Boscawen introduced in 1912 a Bill to make improvement grants for rural housing, a proposal that provided a Unionist response to Lloyd George's Land  Campaign. Unionist MPs made much capital from the embarrassment of Liberals who had to vote the Bill down and from the ineffectiveness of John Burns, one of the weakest of the Liberal ministers. Our Flag covered the debates in detail and three leaflets were published, the last with the pithy legend""The Housing Problem — Radicals block Unionist Action. The aim of the USRC was to create just such an impression as Disraeli had done — that Unionist action would be worth more than Liberal words — and they often quoted him with pride. The greatest difficulty for the USRC was within the party, for any commitment to a positive social policy would be resisted by those whose vested interests were threatened, as Robert Sanders noted over labourers""wages: George Kidner came to me in a great state of mind because he has been asked to appear before a committee consisting of C. Bathurst, Peto & C. Mills & sitting at Central Office. This committee suggested to him a policy that included a tribunal to fix the labourers""wages. Kidner much perturbed at such a suggestion. St. Audries actually wrote Bonar Law on the subject & got a reply saying the policy was quite unauthorised. The USRC therefore made only a limited impact; most of its members sat for industrial seats and its propaganda was concentrated there for their benefit. Bonar Law was prepared to make the right noises — in 1913 at Manchester he called for a positive social policy in Disraelian lines for ""the swing of the pendulum is not enough"" , but he would give no more active support. The value of the USRC was thus of an indirect kind; by involving more than seventy MPs and peers in social research the Unionist belief that the party was a party of reform was re-established; it began the trend towards research for political action that was to accelerate after the war; and it affected much later policy by influencing those who were to make it. Baldwin, Steel-Maitland, Hills, Griffith-Boscawen, Ashley, Ormsby-Gore and Baird were all members of the USRC, and all ministers after 1922. When in 1918 the party needed a social programme for negotiations with Lloyd George, it was to the work of the USRC that they turned; in 1922 Griffith-Boscawen was able as Minister of Health to do some of the things he had attempted in 1912; much of Neville Chamberlain's work as a reformer of the Poor Law was presaged by a USRC report of 1913 written by Hills. (Neville Chamberlain was not himself a member of the USRC because he was not an MP but worked with it.) The value of the USRC lies in its long-term contribution to Conservative policy and in its re-creation of the tradition of Conservative reform that perished with Randolph Churchill. Paul Smith has argued that Disraeli was no great reformer but was of enormous value to the party because he was believed to have been one; in rediscovering Disraeli, the USRC rediscovered the myth too. Little of this positive side of Unionism was visible in 1912 and 1913 for it was submerged in the negative task of weakening the Liberal government and  resisting Home Rule. More typically, the Unionist belief in the Empire was set against the Liberal plans to break up the United Kingdom, as in the leaflet Under which flag? of July 1914: this made the comparison between Unionists who had fought in South Africa and Liberals who had been pro-Boer and who would now shoot loyal Ulstermen. This stark contrast provided the basis for Unionism's last great campaign. The parliamentary battle had an air of shadow-boxing about it, for the ultimate outcome was certain from the start and the timetable could be predicted almost as easily. Under the Parliament Act the Lords could bold up legislation for two years, so Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would both become law in 1914, at least a year before an election need be held. There was no doubt that the Liberals would press on with this timetable, and little doubt that the Labour and Irish MPs would support them; Unionists could not therefore stop Home Rule becoming law. Their tirades in parliament were designed for consumption outside, to be read in the constituencies, in Ulster, and at the Palace. The anger of the Unionists was based partly on the old political frustration of government by log-rolling, and partly on a new constitutional point. In 1910 few Liberals had argued for Home Rule in their election addresses or speeches, so they could not be said to have a clear mandate for it. Nor had the Liberals said clearly what sort of reform they would impose on the House of Lords, and the reform that was passed in 1911 left a serious constitutional problem. Asquith's reform had been presented as an interim measure and the preamble to his Bill stated that the Lords""powers were being curtailed pending the introduction of a reform of their composition. The government made no effort to redeem this promise but Unionists believed that they were in a temporary phase pending the reconstruction of the upper house, and that it was therefore no business of the government to bring in other constitutional Bills before they had settled the constitution itself. For the time being the constitution was as Bonar Law argued ""in suspense"" , and so unconstitutional opposition would be justified. The Unionists also had two other arguments in their case. In the first place it could be argued that a democratic government would not impose unreasonably on minorities; this exposed the party to Liberal charges that they were indifferent to the Irish Nationalists, but it also exposed the weakness of the government's position, as Law explained to the Commons in January 1913: If you say that the Nationalists of Ireland have a right to claim to go out of the united Kingdom as a community if you say that five or six per cent of the whole of the United Kingdom have that right because they wish to have separate rule for themselves, how can you say that a body in Ireland, not five or six per cent, but twenty-five per cent of the whole population, has not an equal right to separate treatment? That argument has been put by many of us, and by myself many times, and it has never been answered. The second argument had a more practical flavour and consisted simply of a  demand that the issue should be put to the test of an election. Since there had been no clear mandate in 1910 and since the Lords could not now force another election, Unionists would have to resist until the government called one themselves. Asquith replied that the question of mandates was not so simple, but he was opposed to an election for the same reason as Unionists wanted one:— both knew that Home Rule was not a winning policy outside Ireland. Law taunted Asquith with this in March 1914: I said to the Prime Minister: Make certain — and surely, in face of all this trouble it is worthwhile making certain — that you have the will of the country behind you, and, so far as the Unionist party are concerned, we will absolutely cease all unconstitutional opposition to the carrying of your measure. Note Law's own use of the word ""unconstitutional"" to describe his actions and the extent to which all was pinned on an election. At bottom then there was some democratic basis for the Unionist case, for the government was pressing on with a reform that they knew was not backed by the electorate. It may be alleged that such Unionist arguments were specious, that their concern was solely to exploit a winning issue at any cost to the nation, but this would be to misunderstand the Unionists themselves. Many believed that the Liberal Labour alliance was a threat to a system of government built up over centuries and they were not prepared to see this done without at least a clear decision by the electorate. And it is vital to see that there was a real Unionist case against the government, for this alone explains the popular support that was mobilized and the impression that was made on the army and the King — the only forces left to stop the government. There is no doubt that Unionists believed in what they were doing or that they saw the government's actions as justifying their responses. In 1912 Walter Long accepted the phrase ""the new style"" and flung it back at the government: ""The New Style consists in the cynical violation of the honourable traditions of public life. Government in the New Style consists in gambling with the interests of the nation to propitiate the various mutinous factions which hold the balance in the House of Commons."" Law also charged the government with being under the control of Redmond: I am not going to say anything about the subserviency of the Government. There is no need to tell the country about that. Everybody has seen it. It is impossible to look at any of their actions during the past three years without seeing that they are carrying Home Rule at the dictation of the Nationalist party, but that in order that Home Rule may be carried they are turning up everything in the country. These statements spoke for the whole Unionist party in their vigorous tone, in the denial that Unionists were responsible for the state of things, and in the laying of blame on the Nationalists. In Parliament there was non-cooperation that became almost a guerrilla war between the parties. Exchanges between Bonar Law and the government became ever more abrupt, as the following example from March 1914 shows: Mr Churchill: It is admitted that a misunderstanding on the point arose. Mr Bonar Law: Rubbish! Mr Churchill: Do I understand the Right Honourable Gentleman to say ""Rubbish"" ? Mr Bonar Law: Yes. Meanwhile, the Whips pursued the government in the hope of catching them out in a snap vote; at the least this would disrupt their progress and there seemed an outside chance that the government would tire of the interminable pressure and throw in the sponge. It might not succeed in stopping Home Rule, but it could certainly take up enough time to stop a Plural Voting Bill from getting through. The government's full majority of over a hundred was difficult to muster because of the absence of Irish MPs, and the effective majority was gradually reduced by constant harassment. In February 1912 the majority was down to fifty or sixty; in June the Unionists made their first real attempt to ""snap"" the government and got the majority down to twenty-two. At the same time Unionist speakers filibustered all other Bills and pairing was stopped. In July the government majority fell to three on one vote but this narrow margin produced better attendances on the government side; Unionists therefore sent their MPs off to speak around the country ""with an occasional rush to London to keep the Rads. there"" . These wearing tactics led to the government's defeat in November 1912. All was carefully organized, not only for the debate and the vote, but also for the disorder that would follow when Asquith moved to rescind the vote: Ministers were shouted down, a copy of Standing Orders was thrown at Churchill, and the Speaker had to suspend the House until the following week because of the danger of actual fighting in the House. After the weekend, the Unionist Whips decided that they had taken things far enough, having wasted an entire week of parliamentary time and given their supporters a sign of the vigour with which the fight was being waged. For the rest of the session and in the spring of 1913, the Liberals took no risk of further defeat, but this required constant attendance at the House by Liberal MPs; the result was that there was no autumn session in 1913 and no Plural Voting Bill was passed. It would now be too late to force the abolition of plural voting on the House of Lords before the next general election; something at least had been achieved. In 1913 the Unionists found a new line of attack through the Marconi Scandal. This has to be seen against the Unionist belief that Asquith's government was corrupt as well as irresponsible and radical. At the Albert Hall in January 1912 Law had made this point with characteristic bluntness: Liberals were expert only ""in electioneering, in the small trickery of politics"" . They had given rewards and favours to their supporters, especially in Wales, and""have succeeded in six years in creating a political spoils system which already rivals that of the United States. If we have a few more years of Georgian finance, the only attractive, the only lucrative profession left in this country will be that of a Radical Welsh politician."" Steel-Maitland wrote to The Times in 1913 to accuse the Liberals of corrupt practices at the Wick  Burghs by-election, and Sanders noted that at Taunton they had given away half-crowns wrapped in Liberal leaflets; both contests went against the trend, so there may be some truth in the allegations. In April 1914, George Younger wrote in Our Flag about ""Radical"" Buy ""Election promises"" and cited ten cases from the past six years when Liberal by-election candidates had made promises to local groups of voters on behalf of the government promises of a change in policy to benefit local crafts or industry or employment. Such actions did not infringe the Corrupt Practice Acts but they did make them virtually inoperative. Unionist publications also devoted much attention to Asquith's Honours Lists, and in October 1912 Our Flag listed thirty-nine ""Radical Plutocrats"" , of which twenty-three had been ennobled by the Liberals — ""so far"" . The allegation that the Liberals were selling honours in return for political contributions was brutally clear. It was in this general context that the Unionist attitude to Marconi was set. In October 1912 both Rufus Isaacs and Lloyd George denied that they had engaged in dealings in Marconi shares, but a Select Committee was set up to investigate the allegations of sensationalist newspapers. Only when it became clear, through a libel action against Le Matin early in 1913, that the government had misled the Commons did the Unionists move into action. The Liberals secured the majority report of the Select Committee but the Unionist members under Lord Robert Cecil extracted ever more damaging evidence from the witnesses interviewed. Debates followed in parliament with the Unionists in full cry, for the Liberals seemed to have been caught out in a case of open corruption. In the end of course the government's majority triumphed and the whole affair died away, but Marconi remained a favourite cry of Unionist hecklers in 1914. It must be noted first that the Liberals really did have something to hide over Marconi, but it must be. noted also that Unionists were not being very honest in their more general allegations. The misleading of the Commons by ministers, the deliberate absence from Britain of the Master of Elibank (so that he could not be questioned), and the evasions of the Prime Minister all created the suspicion that something was wrong and Unionists were perfectly justified in their attempts to find out what it was. On the more general point, charges of corruption were disingenuous. The practice of selling honours had been increasing under all governments and it was becoming more marked in both parties. Lord Hugh Cecil doubted if his father had dealt in such things but suspected""that both Asquith and A.). B. know quite well that honours are sold"". In 1913 Lord Selborne tried to mount a campaign against the sale of honours but he had a lukewarm response: Salisbury thought it would not achieve anything useful, Lansdowne urged that the views of the party organizers should be sought, and Law urged him ""not to obscure the Marconi issue"" . Law knew that ""a year's peerages have been hypothecated"" even before he became leader, and he probably knew that the party could not do without this source of income. It was also useless to pretend that corruption at  elections was one-sided; the scale was far smaller than thirty years earlier, but it went on just the same in both parties. Marconi thus had a special importance because it provided an issue of corruption that could not be turned back by Liberals against the Unionists, and for this the Liberals had only themselves to blame. Asquith's appointment of Isaacs as Lord Chief Justice just a few months after he had narrowly escaped (and actually deserved) parliamentary censure, was a brave example of loyalty to a colleague, but it also demonstrated exactly the insensitivity that Unionists had denounced. This ambivalence towards public morality was crucial when set alongside the Unionists""extra-legal activities over Ireland. It was the campaign out of doors over Ulster that was the centre piece of the whole Unionist campaign. For all the noise and fury, the Home Rule Bill was passed by the Commons in January 1913 and again in July, and would become law in the autumn of 1914. If it were to be stopped at all, then it could only be by means that fell entirely outside the constitution. The first such means involved the King and the second the army, but both rested on the assertion that Ulster would not accept Home Rule. It was argued that the King might intervene either to persuade Asquith to call an election or to refuse his assent to Home Rule until there had been one; this was certainly within the theoretical Royal Prerogative, for the King had an undoubted right to advise his ministers and — by the Unionist argument at least— his power of veto had been necessarily restored by the removal of the powers of the Lords. Only the King could now give his people the right to vote on a divisive issue, a situation that naturally appalled the Palace. Law pessimistically told the King that he would in any case alienate half of his subjects, Unionists if he gave his assent to Home Rule and Liberals if he did not. Such warnings succeeded in bringing the King into the negotiations; by 1914 the King was trying to secure a compromise settlement, in itself a major advance for an opposition. It was the second Unionist lever against Home Rule that helped to involve the King, for it assumed that Home Rule would become law, would be repudiated in Ulster, and that then the army would refuse to enforce it. The resistance of Ulster had not been created by British Unionists and could hardly be said to depend on them, but the knowledge of support was certainly useful to Carson and Craig in giving their plans for rebellion an official look. At Blenheim in July 1912 Law spoke to a mass rally of English Unionists, including over a hundred MPs, and made his commitment to Ulster absolutely specific. Categorically, he argued that force in Ulster would overthrow parliamentary majorities if necessary and he assured the party's support in advance with no limitations. In a similar rally in Belfast in April he had taken the salute from over 100,000 Protestants in military formation. He went on to commit the party in support of the creation of the Ulster volunteers, of the formation of a Provisional government, and of the gun-running at Larne in April 1914. Again and again he spelled out his commitment — almost always  linked to the question of the mandate, as in the Commons in January 1913: Suppose we submit it to the electors? I say that, so far as I am concerned. if that is done we shall not in any way, shape or form encourage the resistance of Ulster. I say that without hesitation. [MR WINSTON CHURCHILL: Are you encouraging it now?] I rather differ from the Rt Hon. Gentleman. I am never ashamed to say exactly what I am doing. I have said before, and if it be any satisfaction to him I repeat it now, that if you attempt to enforce this Bill, and the people of Ulster believe, and have a right to believe, that you are doing it against the will of the people of this country, then I shall assist them in resisting it. Not only would Ulster be right to resist, but so would army officers who refused to enforce the decision of parliament: Put yourselves in the position of an officer. He believes in his heart and conscience, as I do, that the Government are doing this thing without the consent of the country, that in pressing it forward without the approval of the country they are as much a revolutionary committee as President Huerta who governs Mexico. That is really my position and, unless I believed in it I would not feel justified in the course I have taken. Unlimited support was promised, and unlimited support was given; that was indeed the only way in which the strategy of stopping Home Rule ""out of doors"" might succeed. Behind the scenes though, neither Law nor his party was so sure of the grounds and there was certainly some fear of the consequences. Austen Chamberlain represented such fears when he told Willoughby de Broke of what might be yet to come in November 1913: Civil War is an awful thing, not to be lightly encountered, but it is not the greatest evil which confronts us if the coercion of Ulster is tried. For if that is done, the House of Commons v. the Amy will break in the process. If officers throw up their commissions and troops refuse to fire, Home Rule is dead, but a great deal else is dead too. I won't dwell on the dangers of foreign complications, real though they be, but how will you meet another general strike on the railways or in the mines? It is not civil war that is the greatest peril but anarchy. And despite his public utterances Law too was ready to take up a more pragmatic attitude when negotiating; if Ulster could be excluded, he was quite prepared to abandon the rest of Ireland to Home Rule; Carson shared Law's view and was kept in touch with the negotiations throughout. Two problems intervened though to prevent a compromise, both in the secret negotiations of 1913 and the Buckingham Palace talks of July 1914. On the Unionist side men who had been fed with the heady talk of absolute resistance mobilized to resist what they now saw as the sell-out of the Southern Irish Unionists. The diehard peers began to organize another revolt, and the threat of a split like 1911 loomed. This gravely restricted Law's room for manoeuvre and made it impossible for him to accept the only compromise that Asquith could offer. On the Liberal side, anger at the illegal campaign against Home Rule had made it equally difficult for Asquith to compromise, and he too could see no other way forward. By 1914 the terms of a possible compromise were emerging, by which Unionists would accept Home Rule and Liberals would agree to exclude Ulster; argument continued over the exact size of an excluded Ulster and the length of time involved in exclusion, but the logic of the negotiations pointed to this settlement in 1914 just as it was to do in 1921–22. The tragedy of 1914 was that neither side could accept this obvious compromise because neither could sell it to their own followers. Law had indeed brought Asquith to the point of conceding all that could be hoped for from Ulster's resistance, but he was unable to seize the fruits. He believed that Asquith ""is in a funk about the resistance of Ulster, and I am convinced that he will not face it when it comes to the point"" . Compromise having failed, there was left only force. The final Unionist weapon would then be the army and the last political tactic was the scheme to amend the annual Army Bill in the House of Lords. As this was a Bill that was passed for one year only, the refusal to pass it would effectively restore the Lords' power over the government by taking away its legal control over the army. In the early months of 1914 the Unionist leaders prepared for this desperate throw, and the plan was only abandoned when the ""mutiny"" at the Curragh showed that it was unnecessary, for the officers would not in any case agree to coerce Ulster. The Curragh incident was a sad case of panic, bungling and hesitation by the Liberals, for which the Unionists bear only an indirect responsibility, but once the crisis broke the Unionists were quite convinced that it was the result of a plot against loyal Ulster an ""Ulster Pogrom"" . Movements of the fleet, secret meetings at the War Office, and the equivocations of the Prime Minister all lent some credence to this view, but there is no doubt that the Unionists themselves believed it. Unable to accept concessions in negotiation, Law now saw much the same deal offered in public by the Liberals themselves, when Asquith announced an Amending Bill to satisfy Ulster's fears of Home Rule with a period of exclusion. There remained doubt about the length of the exclusion, but it would certainly go past the next election and so allow a Unionist government to make it permanent. The campaign of resistance had then succeeded, but few Unionists were celebrating; Lord Winterton in Sussex and Willoughby de Broke in Warwickshire were among the Unionists who were preparing to spread an Irish civil war to England by setting up ""commandos"" of diehards among the yeomanry — but it was not clear whom they would fight if the army refused to support the government. With the failure of the Buckingham Palace Conference in July 1914 the party prepared to redeem the pledges to Ulster of the past three years. From this grim situation the party was saved by the First World War. The verdict on Bonar Law's first three years as leader must be a two-sided one. From the national viewpoint there are some credits and one massive debit. It was Law's achievement to keep the extreme right within the mainstream of the political system when it might have felt the need to  abandon party politics altogether. It is the particular genius of British politics that the major parties have always managed to hold on to their respective extremists and so to draw their teeth. This was never more threatened from the right than in the years before 1914 and a leader who had respected constitutional niceties at that time would have driven them out of the system where they could have been far more dangerous. Law's campaign against Home Rule also brought the Liberal government face to face with power politics and showed up the hollowness of the reasoned optimism that underlay Edwardian Liberalism. The First World War provided a similar test and again only the Labour and Unionist parties were able to meet it squarely, but the battles of 1912 and 1913 had given advance warning of what was to come. The imperial and defence campaigns perhaps did something to prepare the nation for war and they certainly prepared the parry to take the lead when war did come in 1914. Against these points must be set the fatalism with which Law watched his country drift into civil war; the patriotic party became begetters of rebellion, the party of order suborned crime and mutiny, and the leader of the opposition in parliament approved and supported the destruction of both the practice and the authority of parliament. It should not be thought that Unionists enjoyed such a situation, for they certainly did not, but nor can it be suggested that they saw any real alternative, for in truth the basis of agreement on which parliamentary government""rested had all but broken down. So Law said of the Liberals in 1914: ""They have become revolutionaries, and becoming revolutionaries they have lost the right to that implicit obedience that can be claimed by a Constitutional Government.""  In this Law shared the view of his party, but it would have been substantially the same without him. It is indeed hard to see how any Unionist leader in these years could have acted against such firm convictions to put the national interest first. From the party point of view, Law's leadership had been a considerable success. He inherited a party that was weak and unsure of itself, he raised its morale, gave it purpose and pulled it together. Without this revival before 1914 it is difficult to see how the parry could have survived the ten turbulent years that followed. By 1914 Unionists again really believed in their cause, as few had done in 1911. By 1914 the Liberal party was on the ropes and the Unionists could look forward confidently to the election that could not be long delayed. Debate has been fierce between Liberal and Labour historians as to what can be proved from the by-elections of 1911–14 about the relative strength of the two Progressive parties; it is an indecisive argument in its very nature because of the confused pattern of results and the lack of any truly comparable figures for 1910 or 1906. What cannot be doubted is that Unionists, who had drawn level with the Liberals in 1910, had made up more ground on them since. By the outbreak of war, the party had 287 MPs, thirty more than the Liberals and almost as many as the combined Liberal-Labour vote. Of these by-election  gains more than half had been in straight fights, the implications of which were unmistakable. An article in Our Flag in November 1912 pointed out that the average turnover of votes in by-elections had been about 1,300 votes per contest and that only 250 votes per contest was needed for an overall Unionist majority. So in straight fights the Unionists were apparently on their way to a big win and the Labour-Liberal battles in three-cornered contests were merely an added bonus. Local elections confirmed the trend and their historian has interpreted them as showing that ""by 1913, the Conservatives had rarely been stronger in the Councils of the land, or indeed more poised for success in the forthcoming general election"" . Much would depend on the exact state of affairs in Ireland and something would depend on the success of the Progressive parties in patching up a new electoral pact (although after the events of 1912 and 1913 it could not be expected to work as well as in 1910), but all of these factors would operate in the broad context of a probable Unionist victory. So in saving the party from a desperate situation in Ireland, the First World War also robbed the Unionist party of a return to power. Bonar Law's Party Bonar Law was a startling choice for the party of the ""Hotel Cecil"" , for he was a self-made and almost self-educated businessman from the outlying parts of the Empire (Scotland, Ulster and Canada provided his roots). He was inexperienced and little known before he was propelled into the highest office by his friends' ambition for him and by the deadlock between Long and Chamberlain in 1911. He had entered parliament in 1900, twenty-six years after Balfour, he had held no Cabinet post, he had taken no active role in party institutions, and he had not involved himself much in the social world of Westminster. However, his candidature in 1911 had been aided by three factors: he was a Conservative rather than a Liberal Unionist, but he was the sort of Conservative who would be acceptable to Liberal Unionists as well; he was a diehard in opinion, but he had remained loyal to Balfour's policy throughout the recent twists and turns; and he had staked a claim by his abandonment of his safe London seat to fight North-West Manchester in December 1910 (at no real risk, for an alternative safe seat was always available to him if and when he lost). Law's claims were therefore substantial, but they were known to few outside parliament, Glasgow and Manchester. In welcoming him, the party thus welcomed him as a stereotype. One thing about him that was widely known was the fact that he was a businessman, and so it was as such that he was welcomed; the party could even claim some credit for being the first to elect a businessman as its leader — much as it claimed credit in 1975 for electing a woman, although Margaret Thatcher had certainly not been chosen for that reason. At the National Union rally at Leeds the week after Law's election, a local delegate called John Gordon remarked that Law was ""a man of enormous business capacity (Hear, hear)"" , and suggested that there should be more such men in parliament. On the previous day, Alfred Hobson of Sheffield had told a party lunch that they had been fortunate in securing a businessman, whose qualifications in that respect would certainly appeal to men in the North of England. (Hear, hear). At present, we did not pay the same attention to the commercial development of our country that other nations paid to their development on those lines. We wanted more businessmen at the head of affairs. Others who were less impressed by what they knew about Law were  surprised by what they discovered of his actual abilities, perhaps because his anonymity had prepared them for the worst. Lady Dawkins, who had never heard him speak before, surprised herself by her reaction when she heard him speak at the Albert Hall in January 1912: It was a splendid meeting yesterday and they gave Bonar Law a magnificent reception. His delivery was extraordinarily good and, though he spoke for an hour and a half I should think, his voice never failed him and every word was clear — and bold. It wasn't brilliant oratory, no flowers of rhetoric à la Curzon, or subtle ""nuances"" à la Balfour, but it was good hard sound commonsense and the way he showed up the government was admirable. What I liked about it was that though it was biting sarcasm, the way he spoke it gave you the impression not of a man who was bitter in any way, but of a man who pitied the members of the government for being so rotten and pitied us for being governed by such scum. He held his audience all through his speech you felt he was in touch and in sympathy with them and they with him. He was so extraordinarily quiet and self-possessed, it was almost as if he were chatting to us confidentially about it all instead of making an elaborate speech. I am bound to say that his personality and his voice with his Glasgow accent were a little disconcerting at first(I felt rather as if I were being addressed by my highly educated carpenter), but he inspired me with such confidence as he went on that I forgot that, and of course one has to recognise that a new era in political life has dawned for England, the old aristocratic school is practically swept out of it, it is the dawn of the new ""regime"" . As long as we are in safe hands, while we are with a sincere man like B.L. we are safe, but I am not sure that it is a good thing on the whole. Still, I suppose we must move with the times. This account sums up much of Law's appeal and explains his quick success as leader. He combined a cold approach with references to emotive issues like the Boer War, he spoke in a matter-of-fact way, he made clever use of sarcasm at the expense of opponents, and he recognized the value of a decisive attitude that would be firmly grasped by a party audience. His unconventionality, his unorthodoxy and his accent all helped the party to feel that it had made a step forward: ""the dawn of the new regime"" . As Lloyd George perceptively remarked in 1911, ""the fools have stumbled on the right man by accident"" . Bonar Law has usually received a bad press from historians, who have portrayed him as a hard, dour, humourless fanatic. The balance was righted by Robert Blake's biography, a book of great judgement and insight but still without great sympathy for the man. For it is the personality of Law that has remained as elusive to historians as it was to his own contemporaries. He remained a very private individual during his twelve years at the top, rarely venturing into society and always preferring a quiet dinner alone or with chosen friends to an elaborate occasion. After the death of his wife in 1909 he took no interest in the society of women, he had little interest in food and he was a teetotaller. As leader of the party he gave the usual dinner for colleagues at the start of the session but he was happy to leave the rest of the social management of the party to Lady Londonderry. He was obliged to  attend some party functions and to receive the chief guests along with the hostess, but he received little pleasure from such occasions and rarely attended them outside London. His lack of social. graces could be an embarrassment, for he had no polite small-talk and did not pretend to any; his visits to Windsor were an ordeal for guest and hosts alike, to him because he disliked formality and to his hosts because he was so difficult to entertain and because he did not mince words with the King. He thus remained an enigma, a man who could not be known as most politicians were known and who seemed to shun such contacts. The outward appearance of gloomy taciturnity was therefore taken for the whole man. To friends, though, Law appeared very differently, and the people who became his friends provide testament to the fact; he was very close with both Max Aitken and David Lloyd George, neither of whom was very likely to enjoy the company of a gloomy boor. Indeed, when Law left the government in 1921, Frances Stevenson noted in her diary that Lloyd George had ""lost an ideal companion with whom he could laugh and joke and enjoy himself"" . Both Aitken and Stanley Baldwin had an admiration for Law that bordered on veneration. Others never managed to penetrate his reserve, for he had a deep suspicion of others who could turn out a compliment at will or turn a barbed shaft with a sally of their own, and above all he hated pomposity and egotism; this goes far to explain his view of Churchill and of F. E. Smith. When offered the leadership for which he had fought so hard, Law almost lost It by his apparent doubt; in his speech of acceptance he spoke at length of his unfitness for the job; when told that he was now a great man and must learn to behave like one, he replied ""If! am a great man, then a good many great men must have been frauds.""  Indeed Law determined not to try to look like a great man and therein lay the secret this success. He put himself forward as a self-consciously ordinary man, a politician who asked to be identified with as an equal rather than deferred to as a leader. Even Lloyd George, whose origins were as lowly as Law's had been, could not stoop to so humble a style, and only Stanley Baldwin (who drew much of his inspiration from Law) was able to do so successfully. If Law had a political model, then it must have been Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman, a fellow Scot who had shown that an ordinary man could hold the highest office without discredit and that he could beat the clever and the politically sophisticated at their own game. Commentators on Bonar Law's election to the leadership all agreed that the party had taken a decisive turn. For Walter Long proposing Law as leader, the decision marked the end of an era, the swansong of the country gentleman. For H. G. Wells, the change to Bonar Law marked a distasteful new attitude by the Unionists; when Balfour's""essential liberalism came face to face with this new baseness of commercialized imperialism, with all its push and energy, he made a very poor fight for it. He allowed himself to be hustled into the background of affairs by men with narrower views and nearer objectives."" As far back as 1904 Winston Churchill had foreseen the  same change when he predicted the tariff reformers' coming takeover of the party. Lord Robert Cecil detected the same change when he deplored the tariff reformers'""whole way of looking at things. It appears to me utterly sordid and materialistic, not yet corrupt but on the high road to corruption."" Tory aristocrats, Liberals and Fabians all saw in Law's election the triumph of this ""new mercantile Conservatism"" and the final triumph of tariff reform; the party was now in the hands of hard-faced businessmen, and all sorts of undesirable results would inevitably follow. Law gave credence to such fears by his unashamed espousal of the image created round him; in May 1912 he told the National Union that ""nobody knows better than I do that political work cannot be done on strictly business lines, but the nearer you can approach to business lines the better for the political work"" . Steel-Maitland was running Central Office like a business enterprise, not in order to make a political point, but because it was as natural to him as it had been foreign to Percival Hughes. The party magazine Conservative and Unionist quite specifically welcomed Law's election, because ""as a great captain of industry, his knowledge of the conditions of the workers will be an invaluable guide in the development of the Unionist policy of Social Reform"" . The resistance of Ulster was also linked to its business roots with such slogans as ""Industrial Ulster is united"" or ""They mean business"" , and Law made the same point when he described in Norwich a recent meeting that he had addressed in the Ulster Hall: That meeting consisted of practically the whole business community of Belfast. They are the very class which hate disorder, which know that disorder injures their business, perhaps ruins their business, yet this class showed an enthusiasm which equalled, if not surpassed, the enthusiasm of the workers in the shipyards. The merging of Conservatives and Liberal Unionists was described by John Boraston on similar lines: The promoters of the amalgamation are a body of keen businessmen, well knowing the difference between an investment and a speculation. They regard the fusion as a sound investment and, although Unionist stock has appreciated greatly since the new issue, there is not a man of us who has the slightest intention of selling out. So under Law the language of the boardroom became commonplace on the platforms and in the propaganda of the party. There has rarely been a clearer example of the extent to which a Conservative leader sets the keynote for the party the extent to which it is moulded round its leader. In all this, it was easy to forget the fortuitous circumstances in which Law had actually become leader in 1911. Walter Long was a country gentleman who played up to that image for all he was worth, using Henry Chaplin-""the squire — as his political model. Austen Chamberlain had been trained to be a conventional statesman; Rugby, Cambridge and a determination to live down his father's reputation had all combined to make him the most conformist of politicians. Neither Long not Chamberlain would have made great changes in  the party, and the election of either would not have seemed to signify a great change. Moreover they and their supporters were still present in Bonar Law's party, so that the scale of the real change would be heavily circumscribed. Law could give his party a new image, but the reality would remain much as before. The leadership was actually a collective one rather than a personal domination, and Law recognized his obligation to take the advice of those who were seen to be worthy of consultation by the party as a whole. He called the shadow cabinet together rarely and restricted its membership, but this did not remove the obligation to take advice. We must turn to Law's leading supporters as well as to himself in order to assess the real character of the party. Our Flag printed New Year messages in 1914 from Lansdowne, Bonar Law, Selborne, Austen Chamberlain, Long, Carson, Smith, Steel-Maitland, Lord Edmund Talbot, and George Younger, in that order; the last three were presumably included as Party Chairman, Chief Whip and Scottish Whip, but the rest of the list may be taken as indicative of a rough order of precedence at that time. Lansdowne came first because he had been leader in the House of Lords since 1902; he was too old to be a rival to Law and he cooperated with him fully, though not without some condescension. He played a vital role because the Lords were central to Unionist tactics and because the only alternative leaders there — Selborne or Curzon — had each alienated some Unionist peers by their actions in 1911. Law consulted Lansdowne on all matters of importance, kept him informed of the progress of negotiations over Ulster, but found him difficult to convince of the merits of compromise. Lansdowne was more exposed to the views of the real diehards and was thus a restraining influence on Law. With Lansdowne should be linked Balfour who, though he occupied no official position after 1911, was still close to the centre of the party. Relations with Law were cool but courteous and his tactical advice was always available on difficult issues, such as the question of the Army Act in 1914. Selborne was of significance because he was a man who had a foot in every camp; related to the Cecils, he was also a Liberal Unionist, a tariff reformer, a diehard, and a Liberal Unionist. He had been Liberal Unionist Chief Whip, with Joseph Chamberlain at the Colonial Office, First Lord of the Admiralty, Milner's successor in South Africa, and a ditcher over the House of Lords. In 1914 he was still only fifty-five and could look forward to a major job in the next Unionist government. He had not wished to leave the Commons when he inherited his title in 1895 and thereafter he became an unceasing advocate of the House of Lords, defending its powers, resisting the sale of peerages, and demanding its reconstruction so that its powers could be restored. Austen Chamberlain and Walter Long were both treated with respect by Law, tribute to their withdrawal in his favour in 1911, but they reacted very differently. Long was a choleric, short-tempered man who was a constant trial to colleagues in opposition or in power. He bad a good platform manner and a  great capacity for work but he was an inveterate intriguer. He had constantly worked against Balfour, criticizing him freely in letters to colleagues and using his party positions as independent bases against the leader. From 1912 though, his health was not good and he was no real threat to Law, but he retained the backing of a large section of the rank and file in the House of Commons. Austen Chamberlain on the other hand was always reserved and never seems to have fully understood Law's belief in his party nor his readiness to sacrifice even profound beliefs for the sake of unity. He was hurt by his failure to win the leadership in 1911 and by the hostility to his family manifested during the contest. He made it clear to Law that he did not think that Law was well qualified to be leader and that he reserved the right to contest any future vacancy, but Austen was too loyal a man to conspire; relations were not very friendly, but there was total cooperation. Sir Edward Carson occupied an independent position as the spokesman of Ulster. Although not an Ulsterman himself, he gave to Ulster the charismatic lead that transformed resistance into armed rebellion, and he was a popular platform speaker with Unionists on both sides of the Irish Sea. Although the leader of the Union Defence League in succession to Walter Long, he shared Law's belief in the inevitability of ultimate compromise, and this made him, like Law, an object of suspicion to the diehard Irish Unionists. F. E. Smith worked closely with Carson in the Ulster campaign. He was the rising man in the party, only thirty-nine in 1911 when he joined the front bench, as brilliant an advocate as Carson and a man of devastating wit. He was by far the most popular Unionist speaker after Law in 1912 and 1913, the man that every local association wanted to open their bazaars and fates. His speeches in parliament were separately published, as were those of no other Unionist of the time except Balfour, and he received the signal honour of a Privy Councillorship on the recommendation of the Liberal Prime Minister in June 1911. These then were Law's senior colleagues in the work of opposition and would have presumably occupied the senior posts in a Law government; they scarcely add up to the image of a party of ruthless businessmen and, if other probable ministers are added to the list — Lords Derby, Curzon, Salisbury and Crawford, together with Finlay and Cave, both lawyers — then it seems even less so. The only Unionists who conformed to the picture of what the party was supposed to be like were either men outside the mainstream like Milner, or men too junior to have much real influence like Steel-Maitland, Aitken, Amery and Goulding. Bonar Law himself was the only one of the shadow cabinet who fitted the image of his party, and for him part at least, was assumed for the occasion. Most of the party leaders were in any case inherited from Balfour and it would take time to find men of the new stamp, even if this were possible. The Balfourites did gradually fade from the scene; Acland-Hood, Wyndham and Lyttleton all died, Halsbury and Akers-Douglas became too old, and Midleton was dropped. But in their place, Law did not fill his shadow cabinet with assertive businessmen. Far from it, for even after  the influx into parliament of the ""hard-faced men"" of 1918 the Law government of 1922 included as many old-established peers as any of the time. Salisbury had remarked in 1911 that ""whatever your own opinions, the Conservative party can only assimilate change gradually"" , and this was certainly so in the case of personnel at the top. A Law government in 1915 would have included hardly any more MPs from a business background than Disraeli's 1874 Ministry or Salisbury's of 1895. Not all members would have been aristocratic or from the gentry, but the fastest route to the top was still through the law rather than through commerce. Unionist MPs in 1910–14 have been exhaustively studied by J. M. McEwen and J. A. Thomas, and the following analysis is based on their work. The clearest characteristic of the parliamentary party was its strongly regional base. Unionists held 54 per cent of the English seats, but only 18 per cent of the rest, and this severely limited the recovery from 1906. Ireland outside Ulster was intractable, but the lack of a Unionist revival in Scotland and Wales cost the party about thirty seats when compared to 1895 or 1900. Within England too there was a heavy concentration: the party held most of the seats in the Home Counties, Wessex, the West and the West Midlands; just over half in London, the East and the North-west; well under half in the East Midlands and North. Strength was still predominantly in the counties; the English counties returned almost half of the parliamentary party, the squires who made Walter Long such a force, and of these 128 MPs over a hundred owned land or lived in the division that they represented, a strong territorial base. This was further reflected by the fact that a third of the MPs did not keep up a house in London, confirmation of roots outside Westminster; sessions lasted for only about thirty weeks a year and even during session the attendance of backbenchers was sometimes spasmodic. Unionists had a slight majority of the English borough seats, but this was based on the small towns of the West and South rather than the heavy industrial centres of the North. The Unionist preponderance in London rested on the western residential suburbs, eighteen constituencies that elected Unionists at all elections from 1885 to 1910. Of the major cities only Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield elected more Unionists than Liberals in 1910, but Unionism was also strong in Plymouth Brighton, Preston, and Bath. Where old cries could still be made to work, old strongholds in the seaside resorts, cathedral towns, market towns and suburbs returned to their previous loyalty. Where the joint appeal of Liberals and Labour had bitten more deeply into the Unionist vote there was no visible recovery of ground; so in 1914 there were no Unionist MPs at all from Leeds or Bradford, Leicester or Derby or Stoke, Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland, Southampton, Stockport, Bolton, Blackburn or Northampton. Every one of these towns had returned Unionists in 1895 or 1900 and no Unionist government would be elected without some victories in such places. The by-election gains in Manchester in 1912 and in Ipswich on the eve of the war perhaps showed  that this recovery was at hand. The borough MPs were very different from their county colleagues, and only thirty-seven of the eighty-six from English boroughs even lived in the same towns; many were carpet-bagging lawyers, induced to stand at the last moment and at the expense of Central Office. This distribution was much like that of the 1880s: the reliance on the counties, the growth of suburban strength, and the lack of strong local roots in the industrial areas were all traditional features. In background the party was less exclusive than might be expected. Only nineteen MPs were heirs to peerages and of these seven were from families that had been Liberal before 1886 and another five were new creations since then; thirty-eight MPs were related to peers by blood and another forty by marriage. Only sixteen Unionist MPs were baronets (less than the number of Liberals, a testament to the eight years of Liberal government), and these were the owners of new wealth rather than old titles. There were twenty-one knights, but these too were more often lawyers, merchants and colonial administrators rather than landed gentry. Eighty-one MPs had some connection with a landed family (on Burke's celebrated definition) and fifty-five of these sat for seats that were adjacent to their family holdings; conversely there were only two whose fathers had been working-class (Jessie Collings and Henry Duke) but a host whose fathers had been lawyers, clergymen or doctors (including Law, Smith and Aitken). Fifty-three were the sons of MPs (18 per cent, much like the 17 per cent of Liberals) and twelve of these sat for the same seat, although few like Stanley Baldwin succeeded directly; fifteen of these fifty-three were sons of Liberals, further evidence of the value of recruits brought over in 1886. Unionists were most distinct from Liberals and from other generations of Conservatives in their age; the average age was only fifty in 1914, there were four Unionist MPs under thirty and sixty-two under forty, and half of the party had been under forty when first elected. This reflected the extent to which politics was a career that followed quite naturally from station and the clearing out that had taken place after 1906. Few Unionist MPs had any need to earn their livings, and it was usually the lawyers and businessmen who were the older members. The parliamentary party was thus a relatively young group of men, with the most privileged also the youngest. In education the party conformed more to what would be expected: 196 MPs had been to public schools (68 per cent of the party, twice the proportion of Liberals) and eighty-six of these had been at Eton, almost a third of the party. Only thirty-four had been to other secondary schools, scarcely more than the number from the second most popular public school, Harrow. The same pattern can be seen in higher education, with 144 Unionists going to Oxford or Cambridge (88–53 to the dark blues), again twice the proportion of Liberals. A few had been to other universities, to Sandhurst, Dartmouth or an agricultural college, making 190 in all who had had some form of higher education. The educational background of the party thus suggests a single  integrated elite still drawing heavily on the most exclusive sources. The difficulty of interpreting such information is highlighted though by the fact that this educated elite, two-thirds of whom had been to public schools and universities, chose as their leader a man who had been to neither. The problem of interpretation is compounded in considering MPs occupation and interests; it was not unusual for a young man from a landed family to be called to the Bar (but not to practice), to serve in the armed forces (but not to become a professional soldier), and then to settle down to a political career with several directorships. It would be misleading to classify such a man as ""lawyer"" , ""officer"" or ""businessman"" . So 156 MPs had some identifiable business interest, a little over half of the party, but for most of them some other interest seemed to predominate. Occupations are therefore given, subject to these limitations of interpretation, in Table 5.1, with the figures for Liberals as a comparison. Table 5.1 Occupations of Unionist MPs and Liberals, 1914 Unionist Liberal Land Large landowners 32 9 Small landowners 19 3 Heirs to estates 16 4 67(23%) 16(6%) Official services Army 53 15 Navy 2 1 Diplomatic 5 4 Civil Service 3 4 63(22%) 24(9%) Professions Barristers 79 59 Solicitors 12 12 Authors/Journalists 7 13 Printers/Publishers 2 10 Lecturers/Teachers 3 10 Others — 7 103(36%) 111(43%) Commerce Merchants 14 24 Stockbrokers 6 3 Bankers 7 4 Insurance 1 3 Accountants 3 1 Others 9 6 40(14%) 41(16%)  Industry Manufacture 7 18 Shipowners 2 8 Textiles 2 14 Iron 6 8 Coal 1 8 Engineering 3 5 Building — 2 Brewing 9 1 Working men — 8 30(10%) 72(27%) Land no longer dominated the party, the bulk of which was now made up of officers and lawyers, with army officers and lawyers between them making up almost half the total. In the less prestigious occupations, Unionists were still more likely to have investments in railways, banking or insurance than in coal, textiles or engineering, more likely engage in commerce than in industry. The parliamentary party on the outbreak of the First World War can therefore be seen to be in a rough state of balance, with the interests of land, services, professions and business in a near equality. Any change would of course be a small one and would only be seen in candidates adopted after the ""new regime"" of 1911 and fighting for the marginal industrial seats of the North. The MPs elected in 1918 came near to meeting the expectations of 1911 and many of these had indeed been selected as candidates before the war: in 1918 the average age rose sharply (over half were over fifty), the proportion with interests in the land fell, and the proportion with interests in business rose from 24 to 41 per cent. This generation of new men might not have been elected but for the war but they would certainly have been trying to get elected in a general election in 1915. The final characteristic of the MPs that can be traced is religion, which shows as traditional a pattern as any. Very few Unionists were Nonconformists and most of these had come into the party from the Liberal Unionist side. There were rather more Presbyterians, a few Roman Catholics and Jews, and an overwhelmingly Anglican majority, at least 90 per cent of the party. In an age when all Unionists professed some form of religious belief and when Anglicanism was the assumption of those who professed no other form of Christianity in England, some of this may be taken to be assumption rather than conviction. But to exaggerate this would be to misjudge the tone of the party in religious affairs, for if the Church of England was the ""Tory party at prayer"" then the party was also the Church of England in politics. Many Unionist politicians were prominent laymen in their own right, as were Selborne, Joynson-Hicks, Samuel Hoare and Edward Wood. The Cecils regarded the protection of the Church as a special family responsibility and Lord Hugh was as moved to indignation by the disendowment of the Church in Wales as by the People's Budget or the attack on the House of Lords. To Selborne it was no more nor less than ""robbing the church"" and many  Unionists saw it in such simple terms. The party's Anglican commitment was as firm as ever before 1914, even though it was being led for the first time by a man who was not an Anglican himself. Holding the elements of the party together were two factors of a very different kind: the social world of clubland and society cemented the ties between leaders and followers, and the organizational web of the National Union extended the same ties through the country. Bonar Law might dislike the social round and might rarely visit the Carlton Club, but he did not try to change its role. Party meetings continued to be held at the Carlton and it played a greater part in holding the party together when the Liberal Unionists joined. Other clubs did much the same things for provincial leaders; it was to the Constitutional Club that Salvidge went when in London and it was there that he stayed. It was to the Carlton as well as the Whip's Office that Robert Sanders went to hear the news and discuss political events, and it was to the Carlton too that he went for recreation when the business of the House was too tedious to be borne any longer. Social forces could be used even for directly political purposes, as Sanders himself found when he needed speakers for the South Somerset by-election in 1911; F. E. Smith could in fact be prised away from the West End only by social pressure: A comic little episode about the South Somerset election. I asked F. E. to go down, so did Talbot. But he declined on ground of being too busy. Doughty the same. I then suggested putting the Carnarvons on F.E. This was quite effective — a countess on the doorstep brought F.E. in at once. He is to go down Monday next. Doughty on getting a letter from Carnarvon, actually came and asked to go. Curzon was more difficult to drive down to the provinces. as Steel-Maitland reported to Law in 1914: ""sunderland: He says he cannot manage thee distant meetings. They are beyond his strength. If we come in, you ought to be kind to him and not ask him to sacrifice his health by taking office."" In general though the social world played a more nebulous role, oiling the wheels, providing opportunities for informal meetings and leisurely discussions, as Lord Midleton recalled in 1929 when bewailing Baldwin's neglect of such methods: We all know how the week runs away with official interviews and calls, and how difficult it is to remember all the people with whom you ought to keep in touch, but when I think of the number of things which people of different types, like Lady Londonderry and Lady St Helier and others, have got settled by letting people meet at the dinner table, I despair of a man who never sees even those who have been longest in office on any occasion. Your statement that he never once consulted you on a church appointment is conclusive. After all, if you happened to be next him after dinner for ten minutes, he would get invaluable hints. A hostess like Lady St Helier, an open-handed host like the Duke of Marlborough at Blenheim, or a fixer like Aitken with a house near to London, could all be useful in keeping the wheels of party turning. The structure of the National Union was a recognition of the reality of local powers and in this respect the party resembled less a unitary structure than a collection of private franchises. The authority of the Earl of Derby in the North-west, celebrated in the soubriquet ""King of Lancashire"" , was only the best known of the independent fiefs where the writ of the party leader did not run. In 1912–13 Derby demonstrated his power by mobilizing Lancashire to wreck Law's policy on food taxes. Derby used the machinery of the Lancashire provincial Division to gather his forces, but it would be a mistake to see his institutional position as a source of strength; the President of the Lancashire Unionists was a man of influence because he was Earl of Derby and not vice versa. He gave authority to the party rather than drawing from it, for the local standing of the Stanleys was altogether independent of party. They had consolidated their position since the fifteenth century and had latterly built up an impregnable position in the social infrastructure of the region. A brother of the Earl was MP for Bootle until 1910, when he gave up his seat to Bonar Law after Law's defeat in Manchester. Ormskirk and Chorley were both county seats under the family influence and Stanleys had sat for both seats in the recent past. Local parties, local clubs, churches and voluntary organizations were all patronized by Stanleys and proud to have a Stanley as patron. It was inevitable that the Earl should be Lord Lieutenant of the County, and that he should be President of the Lancashire Unionists. Part of the basis of this local standing was financial — the generosity with which the family backed local institutions and the land held directly from them — but part was also due to more intangible influences. The Stanleys were careful to place themselves at the head of local opinion rather than ride the county roughshod and their identity of opinion with local Unionists on political and religious matters made them even more powerful. Something of the same territorial influence can be detected in other counties too; in the East Midlands, the spheres of the Dukes of Rutland and Devonshire were rarely challenged. Nor were such examples confined to feudal counties, for family influence could also be seen in boroughs and on occasion even in big cities. Folkestone was a pocket borough of the Rothschilds, Southend was falling under the control of the Guinness family, Plymouth was learning to love the Astors, and Samuel Roberts was building up the influence in Sheffield that was to provide a seat for his family until 1966. A combination of public philanthropy and attention to local interests could yield quick results, even for an outsider like Max Aitken in Ashton-under-Lyne. Others were content to wield power in the party machines rather than in the public eye. Salvidge of Liverpool was the best-known example, becoming chairman of the National Union in 1913 and often cited as the only party boss on the American model in English politics, but his authority in Liverpool was no greater than that of Sir James Oddy in Bradford or Sir Percy Woodhouse in Manchester. Such men owed their positions to the constant manipulation of the party machinery — and so confirmed the worst of Ostrogorski's fears; they  sat on every local committee, raised money for the local party, decided the selection of candidates and kept their fingers firmly on the local pulse. The true pinnacle of success in this field was the Chamberlains in Birmingham, who combined an attention to organizational detail with a liking for the lim light. When Neville Chamberlain became Mayor of Birmingham in 1915, he was the eighth member of the family to hold the office in half a century, and he was never to forget the influence of his local roots. Even when a cabinet minister he found time to write round for subscriptions for the Birmingham Unionists and to attend their routine meetings. When facing a critical party conference in 1921, Austen Chamberlain had urged Neville to see that suitable people were selected to represent all twelve Birmingham divisions and to pay their expenses to make sure that they got to Liverpool. Birmingham was quite independent of the party and as late as 1929 was not afraid to show its independence: in that year Neville Chamberlain complained bitterly when he discovered that the Party Chairman had written to businesses in Birmingham for contributions to party funds, for this was regarded as poaching from local preserves. In the previous year, Central Office wished to promote Captain Edwards, the chief agent for Birmingham, to be a Central Office district agent, but they were thwarted by the Chamberlains, who wished to keep him to look after Birmingham; Neville Chamberlain arranged to have Edwards paid enough in Birmingham to keep him there and the interests of Birmingham thus prevailed over those of the party as a whole. In organizational terms, the question of local independence was mainly one of finance. Central party funds could not pay more than a tiny proportion of the total cost of running a local association in every constituency; not paying the piper they were unable to call the tune. The dangers of dependence on rich men would be and were regularly pointed out: if the local parties were not themselves independent then they would have to turn to rich outsiders to fight their elections for them, as The Times pointed out in 1911: If the local organization after an election remained active, on a permanent basis of annual subscription, with a permanent organizing secretary who would attend to the registration work and become the agent at the next election, a candidate could, and probably would, be selected on his merits, and the constituency would be independent of men whose only merit was their wealth. Independence was thus a two-way phenomenon; local parties should be independent not only of central direction but also of individuals. This explains the popularity of Liverpool as a model for local associations after it was publicized in 1911, for Liverpool was popularly believed to exemplify such local independence. So when a new agent was appointed in Ecclesall in 1912 he was recommended as having come from ""the great school of Liverpool, where he worked for Mr James Thompson"" . When the structure of organization in the whole city was reviewed in Sheffield in 1911, it was 10 Salvidge that local Unionists turned for advice, as did the Manchester  Unionists at the same time. When Harold Smith, the brother of F.E., was asked for advice in organization by Huddersfield Unionists, he delivered them a lecture on Liverpool methods, and in the following year they elected F.E. Smith as their President to carry through reforms that would make Huddersfield like Liverpool. When Darwen needed a new agent in 1911, it was to Salvidge rather than Central Office that they turned for help in finding one. Even if Liverpool methods had been universally adopted — and very few areas had the same religious background as Liverpool, the real basis of Salvidge's success — then change would be slow and limited. The most that could yet be achieved was independence from rich outsiders; independence from rich local men was as far away as ever, even in Liverpool. Nor is this surprising when the actual cost of politics is remembered; about $400 a year was needed to finance an effective local party, and this excluded registration or special campaigns. It also excluded the cost of elections, for these were a financial problem for the candidate, not for the local association; in a large county division an election could cost as much as £2,000, and even an unopposed return in a borough would cost a few hundred pounds to the lucky winner. Over a long period then, the cost of elections was still more than the cost of the permanent organization, and this cost was so great as to rule out all but a tiny minority. The cost was indeed so great that there were not even enough rich and unsuitable candidates to buy up the nominations. Many seats went uncontested in 1910 because of the lack of moneyed candidates, and in December Central Office paid out over £100,000 in subsidies. Most of this largesse went to the most hopeless seats, to constituencies where no real preparations had been made, to places where nobody would risk his own money. The effect of this was that Central Office, for all its generosity, did not have much control over the selection of candidates in places where the man selected might actually win, and this did not change much before 1914. Balfour explained this in 1908 over his inability to protect Robert Cecil, ingeniously making a virtue out of necessity: Top talks as if it rested with me to settle who were to be the Unionist candidates for the constituencies. This has never been the Conservative system… Both in theory and in practice we endeavour to have a representative Association in each Division, and on them — and them only — lies the responsibility of selecting their candidate. With that choice the Headquarters of the Party never interfere. In 1912 the same principle was reaffirmed to W. A. S. Hewins by Bonar Law, in a letter that was actually drafted for him by Steel-Maitland: ""If a constituency definitely refuses to accept a candidate, even if the Central Office wish them to do so, they cannot be forced to take action against their will. In the ultimate resort also, the association of a constituency must be held to be the proper exponent of its wishes."" This was not just a polite brush-off, for Steel-Maitland was anxious to find a seat for Hewins (who was a tariff reform professor of economics who would be a great asset in parliament) and finally managed to do so. But Central Office could exert only informal  pressure, since it could neither bully nor bribe its local supporters, and this is exactly what Steel-Maitland set out to do through his district agents. Any change would be gradual and for the time local parties were left with a free choice. Nothing better illustrates the social balance in the party and the fierce independence of the local parties than the argument about the selection of working-class candidates. Resolutions were passed by the National Union in favour of the principle, but as before no local party would put the good intentions into practice. A resolution proposed at the 1912 National Union Conference tells the whole story; originally the resolution approved, ""the candidature of Unionist working men and earnestly recommends the allocation to one of them of a safe and suitable seat at some by-election in the near future, as evidence of the reality of the movement"" . This got to the heart of the matter, the need to make reality out of pious hopes, and it recognized the propaganda value of a contest between a Labour candidate and a Unionist working man in a critical by-election. One such seat would not seem to be an excessive demand in pursuit of an accepted objective, but it was more than the Conference would accept. Steel-Maitland explained that a working man was being selected at Bolton as the choice of the local party, on that very evening, but he did not approve of such specific commitment as the resolution suggested. The recent reorganization of the party had been carried out because""they wanted to get a real popular element in the direction of the party, but no attempt should be made to interfere autocratically from the H.Q. to the constituencies. Time after time he had pressed the claims of a workingman candidate on a constituency"", but they had properly chosen the man who was considered to be most suitable for the constituency. Other delegates supported his view and the motion was amended to read: That this Conference, while recording its desire to see working men in Parliament on the Unionist side, thinks it undesirable that any distinction should be made between them and other members, and therefore expresses the opinion that all Unionist organizations should select and support with all their power the best candidate they can find to represent their constituency, irrespective of his social and financial status. This was little help: giving a working man equality of opportunity was tantamount to rejecting his claims outright, for the scales of wealth and influence would remain weighted against him. Labour's success was based not on equality of opportunity but on the assertion that a working man was more equal than others in his claim to represent the working-class electorate. As long as a Unionist MP had to pay his election expenses, or an association chairman to ""treat"" the party workers, or a constituency delegate to pay his own expenses to a midweek conference, then few working men would ever be selected for any of these posts. The party's real attitude was shown clearly enough in the Conference of 1913, when it reaffirmed its opposition to the payment of MPs (another form of scarcely disguised class discrimination) by  an almost unanimous vote. Funds were organized as before to pay election expenses for working-class candidates, based on Liverpool and Birmingham, and publicised by the Standard and the Morning Post. Hampstead Unionists agreed to support one such fund by levying a guinea subscription from all members of their Executive Committee — a decision that says much about the composition of the Executive Committee itself. Monmouth Unionists backed another fund, but for their own candidate they chose the nephew of their president, Lord Tredegar. Bosworth Unionists agreed to accept ""an assisted candidate"" , but only if no ""man of means"" could be found. And in Bolton, where an assisted candidate was selected by an association with a large working-class element, he found himself facing a Liberal rather than a Labour opponent and went down to defeat. In its social character and its local structures, the Unionist party of 1914 was caught in a dilemma. Old antagonisms had been revived by the tariff dispute, but time would heal these wounds and continue the long-term trend towards one homogeneous propertied elite. This would solve many of the party's difficulties inherited from the past, but it would do little to settle the pressing problems of the present and future. The gradual consolidation of wealth in the party was making it more difficult to preserve the classless, ""one nation"" appeal to working-class supporters. It was increasingly difficult to appeal to the working man whose vote might put the party back into power without antagonizing the wealthy man whose financial assistance was crucial. Robert Sanders noted exactly this problem when the party had to formulate and answer to Lloyd George's land campaign of 1913: ""A certain number of our party go openly for wage boards. Men like St. Audries and Banbury scout the idea and say ""stick to the farmer who is on our side and never mind the labourers whose votes you won"" t get anyhow"". A crushing Unionist victory in 1915, bringing with it disaster for the Labour party and a major setback for the ""New Liberalism"" might have ended the difficulty, but when the First World War intervened the problem remained."
ACA ACA-EW1-002 1.42 "War and Coalition ""Lloyd George would secure a greater hold on the rank and file of our party and he would also be so dependent on that party after the election that he would permanently be driven into the same attitude towards our Party which Chamberlain was placed in before, with this difference — that he would be the leader of it. That would, however, Jam inclined to think not be a bad thing for our Party and a good thing for the Nation. I am perfectly certain, indeed I do not think any one can doubt this, that our Party on the old lines will never have any future again in this country."" (Bonar Law to Balfour, 5 October 1918). The First World War It is often asserted that the First World War rescued the Unionist Party from an impossible position and left it poised to become the dominating force; the war broke up Liberalism and destroyed the Liberal-Labour alliance, so opening the way for Unionism; Lloyd George carried the party to victory in 1918, incurred the odium for the post-war slump and was cast aside ungratefully in 1922. John Stubbs has identified other effects of the war in the growth of backbench activity, the ending of old issues like Ireland and the strengthening of the Unionist case in others, especially tariffs. Such objective judgements have some validity, but they do not distinguish between the positive effects of war and the damaging effects of coalition. In assessing the decline of Liberalism, it is usual to separate the effects of war and coalition, and it is equally necessary in assessing the survival of Unionism. The prospering of Unionism had less to do with the war than is generally assumed, and it was more healthy in 1914 and less certain of prosperity in 1922. Unionists of the time would scarcely have recognized the terms of the debate, for in 1922 the party was still embroiled with Ireland and the House of Lords, held a smaller share of the popular vote than ever before, and was still split as it had been since 1902; few Unionists would have seen the war as a turning-point for the better in the party fortunes. Only after 1922, with the war at last receding from memory and coalition over, did the party take the decisions that led to its successes of the next twenty years. The good effects of war can be detected only in the long term, and there were bad effects too, while the consequences of coalition for the party were immediate and almost wholly negative. It is necessary then to consider in turn the war, the effects of coalitionism, and the years between the end of coalition and the party recovery in 1924. Conservative recovery after war and coalition does not demonstrate recovery because of war and coalition, and indeed the opposite might well have been the case. The effect of the war can be seen under five heads, all following from the actual European conflict: the running of the war effort; the advance of Labour; the advent of democracy in 1918; the effect of war on the party structure and organization; and the effect of war on popular attitudes. The advent of war was not seen by Unionists as a need to turn back to a conventional patriotism, for Unionists had never doubted the patriotism of  their previous stance. In resisting Home Rule and arguing for tariffs, Unionists had seen themselves as acting in the interests of nation and empire against a government that had the interests of neither at heart. The war vindicated the anti-German tone of the tariff campaign, the calls for a stronger navy, the demands for national service, and the defence of the army. If Unionists were vindicated by the war, not just in its taking place but in its nature, then by the same token Liberals were exposed. The war took away the unfortunate necessity, as Unionists saw it, to play with fire in the national interest, but it did not materially alter their view of themselves. If the war brought them more into line with popular feeling, then it was not because they had changed, but because popular opinion (or at least the Liberal-Labour part of it) had at last seen the light. This was demonstrated in the first political crisis of wartime, a carry over from peacetime. Home Rule and Welsh Disestablishment would become law in the autumn of 1914 and there could now be no election to stop this from taking place. Negotiations centred on the need for national unity in the face of an agreed threat, and provided a test of the genuineness of the parties""commitment to the national cause. A political truce was called within a few days of the outbreak of war; a pact to end contested by-elections was first signed on 6 August, and a joint recruiting drive began before the end of the month. But the Irish and Welsh issues remained; the National Union agreed to approve the truce only on a strict understanding that both issues would be satisfactorily settled. Unionists demanded that both Bills should be frozen in their present position, as passed but not to become law for the duration, but Asquith would not accept this for fear of criticism on his own side. The government thus decided that both Bills would become law, but would then be suspended for the duration. A few Unionists wished to use the Lords to block this procedure, so prompting a constitutional crisis in wartime, but Law and Lansdowne persuaded the shadow cabinet to swallow their feelings. Party opinions were partially assuaged by a protest meeting at the Carlton Club and a demonstration walkout of the Commons by the entire party, but the outcome was not affected, and so Home Rule became law. The success of the party's resistance to Home Rule had been founded on absolute faith that it was the most important issue, but by 1914 this was no longer the case. Nevertheless, the party made only a limited concession; Home Rule's suspension was real, and every attempt to implement it in wartime provoked sufficient Unionist outrage to stop it. Opposition to Home Rule was put on ice for the duration with the Bill, but opposition was as genuine in 1918 as it had been in 1914. In the meantime, the war gave chances to show the responsible nature of the party through its collective action in parliament, through the restraint of its leaders and through the patriotic actions of its individual members. Winston Churchill had welcomed Bonar Law as party leader in 1911 with the reflection that ""if ever a national emergency makes party interests fade, we  shall find in the Leader of the Opposition one who in no fictitious sense places the country and the Empire first"" , a tribute that was certainly justified by Law's role between 1914 and 1918. More than a hundred Unionist MPs were usually away from the House on military service, and 125 Unionist agents served in the trenches; the party organization was used in the war effort at no cost to the country; every local party was decimated by volunteers who joined up in the first rush; and at every level, the number who joined up was more than matched by those indirectly involved through recruiting, raising money, running war charities or breeding remounts. The party as a whole proved the reality of its patriotism from the first days of the war, and the logic of this continuation from peacetime was underlined by the speed with which Ulster Unionists rallied to the flag in 1914, and the gallantry with which they died on the Somme in 1916. The war underlined the Unionist belief in the patriotism of the British people and their belief in the failings of the Liberals, but for themselves it merely confirmed what they knew already. At first all criticism of the running of the war was muted and was aimed at measures rather than men. In parliament it was difficult to adjust to the new situation, whereby the party was supposed to abstain from all criticism of the government but had no say in its decisions. Such an open-ended commitment to a government that most Unionists regarded with contempt could hardly last for long: Law found it convenient to make use of the Unionist Business Committee, constituted in January 1915 as an official opposition group, and he suggested Walter Long as its chairman, so harnessing Long's vindictive powers and giving the party some means of influencing the government without breaking the party truce. It was only the first of many devices that articulated party opinion against governments that the party theoretically supported. Unionist concerns were still as much with traditional areas of disagreement with the Liberals as with the War; the UBC made the running with its concern to shield British industry from the war, much as it had previously been intended to protect it through tariffs, and Stanley Baldwin first made his name through its committees. As John Stubbs has written, ""that backbench activism was centred in such an essentially non-landed element of the Conservative Party tends to confirm the view that the party's centre of gravity was increasingly urbanised, commercialised and industrialised"" . It also reflects the fact that many of the younger, landowning county MPs were simply absent from Westminster; as Yeomanry officers they were liable for service in wartime and, although the Yeomanry could not be compelled to serve abroad, few did not volunteer. The UBC was never more than a small minority of the parliamentary party, with a general attendance of about forty, and its influence was more a result of its being first in the field of opposition, than of its numbers or its members""economic power. It is clear though that the economic tide was running very much in the party's direction in 1915–16; in 1915 the first industrial tariffs for half a century were imposed, and by a Liberal Chancellor; in 1916 even the Manchester Chamber of  Commerce joined in the demand for industrial protection, causing the resignation of its chairman in protest at the abandonment of a century of belief in free trade. In parliament, the bitterest domestic dispute concerned one of the oldest issues of all, drink; Lloyd George proposed restrictions on the drink trade to help the war effort, and suggested that the trade should be nationalized. A pilot scheme was introduced but Unionist indignation was fierce, led by Sir George Younger for the brewers. Bonar Law first welcomed the idea as a means of reducing his party's dependence on ""the trade"" , but opposed it when he recognized the scale of party feeling. Throughout 1915–16 though the issue of increasing importance was the running of the war. A party that had thrown itself so uncompromisingly into the campaign against Home Rule, and which had long ago accepted the need for ""organization"" in domestic affairs, could hardly accept for long the leadership by ineffective compromise which was what Asquith offered. Nor could Unionists, who had flocked to the colours in 1914, accept for long inequality of sacrifice when the nation's greatest need was manpower. Unionists had less compunction than Liberals in employing compulsion for desirable ends, and the Milnerite wing of the party had been preaching the gospel of ""national efficiency"" through organization, making a positive virtue of compulsion. Once the war came, and especially after the flow of recruits proved insufficient in 1915, Unionists called for conscription and for a nationally organized war effort. At first the party leaders resisted such demands as being likely to destroy the party truce and so tried to avoid the public discussion of. such subjects. In February 1915 the National Union Executive refused to sanction a scheme to use the party agents to find recruits, since it ""might savour of compulsion"" and in April the Committee refused to debate a motion on compulsory service because of the party truce. In September, the Executive asked to meet Bonar Law to discuss the subject, now that Unionists were in government, but Law refused any outside discussion until the cabinet had made up its mind. Throughout the winter of 1915–16, Law played for time and stalled demands for a meeting of the Central Council, while Unionist ministers pressed the party case in cabinet. Party opinion was mollified by the Derby Scheme of November 1915, whereby the agents and activists of both parties were used to canvass for recruits; the party organization was turned over entirely to recruiting and the scheme cost the party £29,000. By February 1916 pressure was mounting again, and resolutions calling for compulsory national service were flowing in; the Executive refused to debate them, but passed them on to Law nevertheless. In cabinet Unionists pressed the Liberals steadily towards a full policy of conscription, which was finally introduced in May. Criticism of the running of the war went on though, and in June the Executive passed a resolution calling for a more active prosecution of the War. The Easter Rising in Dublin and the government's abortive plan to rush through a Home Rule settlement caused an even greater furore; this time  Bonar Law had to agree to a meeting of the Central Council, but only alter the cabinet had dropped the Home Rule idea, and with a stipulation in advance that questions would be allowed but not resolutions. Throughout the autumn, the barrage of criticism went on in parliament and in the party. After Carson resigned from the government in November 1915 he became the acknowledged leader of the hardliners, organized in the Unionist War Committee. The UWC was a far more serious threat than the UBC had been: it was entirely outside the control of the party leaders and backed by over a hundred MPs; it was aimed at a government that included Unionists as well as Liberals; and it seemed likely to be a vehicle for the overthrow of Bonar Law by Carson. Its importance was based on two temporary factors, the great Unionist support for its ideas rather than its leaders, and the loyalty of Law to Asquith, which left an opening for Carson. Once Law resolved, after the Nigeria debate of November 1916, that he would work with Carson and Lloyd George to enforce on Asquith the policy that the Unionist MPs wanted, his position was safe. Law's feeling for the sense of the party was less sure than usual in 1916 but, once certain of the party feeling and the national interest, he did not waver in his demand for a different sort of government. Once the political crisis of December 1916 had been weathered and a government had been formed to pursue the Unionist war policy, and with Law himself entrenched at its centre, Unionist support for both Law and for the government remained until the war's end. Agreement on the prosecution of the war remained through 1917 and 1918, and effective opposition to the government passed from the Unionist back benches to the Asquithian Liberals and the House of Lords. From his position as Chancellor, Law could exercise sufficient influence on the domestic management of the war to avoid further problems, and as Leader of the House of Commons and de facto deputy Prime Minister he could also deal with most of the political problems as they arose. So he headed off demands for a capital levy, knowing it to be unacceptable to his party, but Britain nevertheless paid for a higher proportion of the costs of the war from taxation than the other combatants; he was also able to launch the Victory Loan of 1917 at an interest rate of only 5 per cent, having a surer sense of the patriotism of potential subscribers than did the Treasury. There was thus a community of interest in the war between party and government in 1917–18 as there had not been before, and the party was hardly shaken by the secession of a few diehards to form Henry Page Croft's National party. There was no danger that the party would be outflanked on the right as long as the war remained the most pressing national and party interest, and the National party was a complete fiasco. Commitment to the war could have become a problem in itself as the chances of victory became remote. Just as Unionists had rejected an Irish compromise in 1914 after years of commitment to Ulster, so they could not envisage anything short of total victory after the national sacrifices since  1914. When Lansdowne communicated his despair about the war to the press in 1917 and called for negotiations, there was a storm of protest. He had been fading from importance for some time, had been replaced as Unionist leader in the Lords by Curzon and was not a minister under Lloyd George. He was now reviled by the party that he had helped to lead for fifteen years; in his own word he was ""excommunicated"" . Commitment to the war also determined the Unionist response to Lloyd George's disputes with the generals in the winter of 1917–18. Sympathy was with the generals rather than the Prime Minister, hardly surprisingly in view of past events, but sympathy never went far enough to weaken Lloyd George's position greatly. Haig was saved from dismissal by defenders on the Unionist side, but Robertson's removal caused a small stir, and Unionists voted in force to save Lloyd George's face in the Maurice debate. It was doubly difficult for Unionists to resist the substitution of Sir Henry Wilson for Robertson, for Wilson was the most Unionist of all the General Staff and Robertson had not enjoyed good relations with Unionists; Derby's weakness at the War Office and Law's loyalty to Lloyd George were sufficient to defuse the situation. The dismissal of Haig would have been much more serious, but with Law's advice Lloyd George did not take the risk. Over Maurice's allegations, Unionists voted under no illusions; Maurice had indicted Law as well as Lloyd George, and a packed meeting of the UWC under Carson resolved to back the government, not because they believed its explanations but because of their belief in the war. The only alternative to Lloyd George's lies were Asquith's half measures. There was a continuity then in Unionist attitudes to the war, going on into the post-war years in demands for a harsh treatment of Germany after defeat. Lloyd George discovered in 1919, as Law had done in 1914, that a Unionist party that had given its total commitment to a cause would not be fobbed off with a compromise. In the years before 1914 the iron of partisan politics bad entered into the Tory soul, and in the battle for Ulster every weapon had been deemed acceptable. After 1914 there was the same certainty about the war, and it was indeed the inflexible determination of the Unionist party, sure about ends and pragmatic as to means, that was the bedrock on which Britain's war effort rested. Opposition to Home Rule had been canalized into a patriotic war and so the party ended the war in a confident mood, as it had begun it. In the shared community of sacrifice the party had undoubtedly widened its community of interest with the British people, and was able to speak for all of the people in 1917–18 as it had spoken for only an embattled half in 1913. The party therefore reaped the benefit of its national identity in the election of 1918, capturing the mood of the moment as surely as Lloyd George did. In the strident campaign of December 1918 the Unionists were in their element, sure of what must be done as no other party was sure. In its external elements then, the war widened the Unionists""confidence and appeal rather than created it, lining up the nation with the party rather than the reverse. In its domestic aspects though, things had gone very differently: Unionist fears about the growth of Labour extremism had been widespread before the war and had stemmed from two different factors. There had been good reason to know that Labour could damage Unionist electoral prospects and the dangerous prospect of a class-based party system had been present in the Liberal-Labour alliance. Underlying this had been a deeper fear of more extreme socialists, especially the syndicalists, who might threaten violence and revolution. The War threatened to sweep away such fears in the uninhibited jingoism that greeted the outbreak of hostilities. The train was at last ""on different rails"" and Unionists could not fail to rejoice at the disarray on the left, but the different rails might prove more suitable for Trotsky's ""locomotive of History"" than for Unionist imperialism. By 1917 Unionists had more cause to fear than to rejoice, for the Labour movement had been greatly strengthened by the war in both its aspects; increasing membership and growing militancy in the trades unions, growing confidence in the Labour party, the arrival of organized revolutionary extremism in the shop-stewards""movement all pointed to a grim future. The troubles in Sheffield and South Wales, the example of ""Red Clydeside"" and the inspiration of revolutionary Russia might all be signs of a new and terrible future. Unionist fears were based overwhelmingly on ignorance, in isolation from working-class attitudes at home and in the trenches, and on the certainty that things could not be the same again. By 1918 these fears had reached fever pitch; one Conservative MP recalled that his family had expected that the end of the war would be followed by atrocities like those in Russia, that ""families like ours would be strung up from the nearest lamp post"" ; Robert Sanders was surprised to see on Armistice Day that the crowds were actually cheering the King, so unlike the fate of the Russian royal family a few months earlier. Such fears were vastly exaggerated, for if Britain ever did reach a stage of possible revolution, then it was certainly after rather than during the war, but in isolation from working-class opinions, they seemed real enough to Unionist MPs and their supporters in 1918. Unionist reactions were twofold, first to play up the war itself as a unifier of classes, and second to exploit divisions in the Labour movement in the hope of carrying them over into peacetime. The party's first object was the prosecution of the war, and this could be linked convincingly enough with attacks on malingerers and deserters; long after 1902 Unionists had continued to revile radical Liberals (including Lloyd George) as pro-Boers, and this view was easily adaptable to the Labour party in the new war. The campaign for conscription was at least in part intended to force opponents of the war out into the open, so that their lack of patriotism could be exposed when it would be unpopular. When conscription came into force, Unionists pressed for the disfranchisement of conscientious objectors, more because it would be a sign of civic excommunication than because their numbers were significant. The reverse of this policy was a Unionist proposal that all men in the armed  forces should qualify for the franchise as of right. A clear division was to be made then, with all who served their country being enfranchised and all who refused being disfranchised, in both cases irrespective of age or other considerations; the war was to be the test and the policy was to be ""What did you do in the war, Daddy?""  Neither policy was implemented, although gestures were made in each direction. As President of the Local Government Board, Walter Long surprised opponents and supporters alike by the fairness with which he treated conscientious objectors, but local Unionists on the appeals tribunals were far less tolerant. The franchise was eventually widened as a result of the Unionist demand, but not as they had expected. Unionists did though make war service a main plank of their electioneering whenever they had the chance. In 1918 Sanders noted that""I had a contest with Plummer, the Bridgwater Trades Union Secretary. His supporters said he had got wages raised and would get the agricultural labourer 40/ a week. My supporters said ""Sanders went to fight and Plummer did not.""  On such issues are the fates of Empire divided."" After the war, Unionist candidates with commissions, good war records and decorations made the most of their advantages, especially when they could be set against opponents who had opposed the war or stayed at home. Ramsay MacDonald was beaten by such a campaign in 1921 with language that made the general election of 1918 seem tame. As late as 1931, the war records of Labour candidates were still held against them, although by then Ramsay MacDonald, like Lloyd George before him, had been forgiven his sins. Exploitation of divisions in the Labour movement was the concern of only a small number of Unionists, linked mainly with Lord Milner and with Central Office. The British Workers' League was founded under Milner's wing as a front organization that was linked in principle with the coalition as a whole but was run from the Unionist side. Its leader was Victor Fisher and it was dedicated to providing a point around which ""patriotic labour"" could rally. It asserted the need for social reform within a broad imperial policy and attacked the official leaders of the Labour movement for their failure to dissociate themselves from pacifists and militants. In the Labour movement it never made much impact, for it always remained an alien force, financed and directed from outside, but it achieved something in taking the battle on to the streets in order to break up the meetings of the left. Even here more was achieved by the ""patriotic labour"" men who had originated in the Labour movement and stayed in it, such as Jack Jones in West Ham. Central Office had great difficulty finding seats for the candidates of the National Democratic Party (NDP), as the BWL had become by 1918, and it took some time even to find a place for Victor Fisher himself before he was finally installed for Stourbridge. Unionists did not wish to stand down where they had a candidate of their own ready to fight; in these circumstances, the NDP did remarkably well in 1918, winning eleven seats, all in Labour strongholds where neither Unionists nor Coalition Liberals had much desire to stand, and  they beat both MacDonald and Henderson. After the election, though, the NDP faded into the ranks of the coalition majority, having neither roots nor party organization of their own, and Unionist efforts were carried on instead through a Labour wing in their own party. The Labour vote was badly hit by the NDP even in working-class strongholds, but no impression was made on the Labour movement. The general question of Unionist attitudes to Labour was highlighted at the Special Party Conference in 1917 where Law came under a strong attack. He gave his followers an analysis of the situation straight from the shoulder, with no false optimism about the immediate prospects and considerable perception about future events: There is another thing which I know you were thinking about a great deal, which all of us must think about. That is, the future of our Party after the War is over. You would like, I daresay, if I could give you a clear and definite policy. Well, I cannot. We are looking into a fog. It is absolutely futile to try to make plans for conditions which you cannot foresee,(Hear, hear). But this I would say to you. I am not sure that you will agree with me, but I have no doubt about it; our Parry on the old lines will have no future in the life of this Country (Hear, hear). What is the future likely to be? It is all guesswork, but we cannot help thinking about it, and I have thought a great deal about it. There seems to be two possible ways in which our Party can keep its old force. One would be if- I will not say the Labour Party but the extreme Labour Party — were to get so powerful that it would be a menace and we should have thrown on the other scale all that was moderate in the Liberal Party as well as our own Party. That is not going to happen in my judgement without some leader who commands the support of a large section of the country, and I do not see where that leader is going to come from. But the other way in which our Party has a future is the way in which I would like to see it have a future. In the past we have suffered tremendously, because we have always had the whole of organised Labour against us. It is that that defeated our Tariff Reform proposal — that and that alone. Well, gentlemen, there is splitting in all parties, and when you feel that our Party is suffering a great deal, look at the others and ask which of them is worse? There is splitting in all parties, and nowhere is it more marked than in the Labour Party (Hear, hear). Now, gentlemen, this war has shown that among the leaders of Labour there is a body which is national and patriotic (Hear, hear and applause,) and feels these sentiments as strongly as we do. I feel it is our duty to try to get — I will not say on our side but to work with us — the section of Labour which is national and imperialistic (Applause) We have got to get on our side if we can, the section of Labour which recognises that for all classes, employers and employed, production is the one thing to be aimed at (Applause), and that anything which is detrimental to that is detrimental to anybody. Well, gentlemen, you have cheered this. Everybody in our Party welcomes that with their lips, but I will tell you what I think about it, and I am going to speak quite frankly. There are a great many who imagine that we can get Labour to take the shilling for us as it were and to fight simply for our old aims as an adjunct to our Party. That is not going to happen (Hear, hear). If we are going to become part of that larger Party we will have to pay the price. I am not going to attempt today to foresee what that price will be. It may be that it is a price which none of us will  pay. It may be that when the time comes our Party will be divided in regard to this matter. But, gentlemen, of this I am certain, the Conservative Party has been a good thing for this country and it is our business today, and as long as we can, to keep that Party solid; and if splits must come, to delay them as long as we possibly can (Applause). In this single speech, Law foreshadowed the development of the party for the next fifteen years; the strategic dilemma over relations with the other parties after the war, the need to make real concessions to make a coalition workable, the openings that could be created by a national leader of independent reputation (Baldwin as it turned out), and the outcome when the moderate men of all parties came together in 1931. At the same conference, Law warned the Unionists that they must accept the government's plans to extend the franchise, whatever their personal opinions: It is very difficult to see…how you could stop much short of the Bill which is now before the House of Commons. And, gentlemen, I should like to say this also; our Party if it is properly conducted has no reason to fear that the mass of the people in this country will not support it (Hear, hear). If we cannot win that support, we may as well go out of business, and it is our duty now at all events to make the best of the situation which has arisen and to see that everything is done to make our Party what Disraeli called it — and what, if it is to have any existence, It must be — a really national party. It is ironical that one of the most beneficial developments of the war years, the Representation of the People Act of 1918, should have occasioned so much party opposition. Consideration of the franchise bad followed Unionist demands for votes for servicemen, and a Speaker's Conference was set up in 1916, with the Unionist members led by Sir William Bull and Sir Harry Samuel. It seems that a deal was hatched behind the closed doors of the Conference, by which Unionists accepted a widening of the franchise to include all men and some women, in return for a Liberal agreement to accept some plural votes and a complete redistribution of seats. Liberals had argued for a wider franchise for years and Unionists had demanded a redistribution, so both sides got something of what they wanted and proportional representation was thrown in with the present mood of Labour in mind, so that the anti-socialist parties would be able to consolidate their position if necessary. Unionist reactions to these proposals, published and embodied in the Representation of the People Bill early in 1917, were very hostile indeed; it seemed a reckless step to give the biggest ever increase in the franchise in the midst of a major war, to throw away some of the plural votes on which the party had relied, and to receive in return a redistribution that could bring almost anything. A bitter debate in the Executive of the National Union on 8 February 1917 resulted in the setting up of a special sub-committee to consider the Bill; a suggestion that MPs should be ineligible for the sub-committee  because they had let down the party so badly in the Speaker's Conference was only narrowly lost. At the next meeting, the proposals were considered one by one, along with the views of the sub-committee; every proposal was criticized and a highly critical sub-committee report was adopted nem. con., with Sir Harry Samuel finally abstaining after failing to convince his colleagues of the rightness of the proposals. The party view, express d well by the Conservative Agents""journal, was that the Unionists in the Speaker's Conference had been taken in by the Liberal members, that they had not sought or received any professional advice, and that they had blundered accordingly. However, the Central Council recognized in April that a franchise change could not now be avoided, but resolved to support it only if the government would agree to restore the House of Lords at the same time. Reports from the constituencies in May showed 259 local parties against the Bill and only thirty-two in favour; eighty-three suggested no change in wartime; twice as many local parties supported votes for women as opposed the idea, by ninety-eight to forty-four, and there was little or no support for proportional representation. By May the principle of change had been accepted as inevitable, for once an extension of the franchise had been proposed, it would be suicidal for the party to oppose it, and there was thus a need to concentrate on pressing detailed amendments, for example to protect the interests and representation of agriculture. But the partisan warfare went on: Walter Long and his PPS, Sir William Bull (who had been on the Conference himself), reacted angrily to complaints from the agents and suggested that the professional organizers wanted to keep the system as complicated as possible so that they could keep their pay and privileges. The agents took this as a slander on their profession and replied in kind. Bull also continued the fight with greater subtlety through the Daily Telegraph: he wrote for the Telegraph regularly in 1917, either directly as ""our political correspondent"" , or indirectly by feeding information on the Bill to the paper, and this helped to keep at least one part of the Unionist press briefed with the official party line. It was increasingly difficult to see what the party line was: the Chief Whip, Lord Edmund Talbot, had summoned Robert Sanders back from war service and after his return in May 1917 he was pressed into the party's service. Sanders had been a Whip and a specialist in franchise matters before the war, so his return to Westminster gave an added impetus to the party campaign against the Bill; he became a sort of unofficial party Whip against a government that the party supported, cooperated closely with George Younger, by this time Party Chairman, and eventually became deputy chairman of the party himself in 1918. The battle now shifted to parliament, where the second reading was carried by a huge majority on 22 May; many Unionists spoke against the Bill, but few could bring themselves to oppose it in principle, and so Sanders could mobilize only forty MPs to go with him into the No lobby. But this signalized  the beginning of the open fight. In June the National Union finally decided its attitude: it was duly recorded that: the Unionist party…has always been in favour of: 1. An extension of the franchise. 2. [votes for servicemen] 3. Simplification of Registration. 4. An Equitable scheme of Redistribution. 5. All of these proposals to be applicable to the whole of the U.K. 6. Concurrently, a scheme for the reconstitution of the Second Chamber with adequate powers to be introduced. It will thus be seen that the Party is in favour of Electoral Reform being dealt with on a sound basis, but at the proper time. Since reform was now unavoidable it must be made certain that Ireland would be included under the redistribution clauses and that the House of Lords should be restored to entrench resistance to Labour. The details of amendments to the Bill needed to press these points were sent to each Unionist MP, from Central Office not from the official Whips, and a special committee of agents and National Union leaders was set up to give MPs professional advice. By mid July Unionists in the Commons had tabled and spoken to over 160 amendments, with the heaviest burden falling on Younger and Sanders. Pressure was such that the government, in the person of George Cave the Unionist Home Secretary, was frequently forced to allow free votes, so several useful amendments were carried. Instructions to the boundary commissioners were revoked and amended so that they would be able to consider economic interest as well as population and community in the drawing up of the new constituencies; this was regarded as vital by the Unionists, for it seemed likely that the merging of the small boroughs into the county constituencies would take away the last of the agricultural seats. Similarly, an amendment carried in November 1917 did much to nullify the reduction of plural voting rights for town dwellers. Before 1918 electors could have more than one vote, provided that they could quality in different towns or counties; it was now proposed by Unionists that the qualifying area in boroughs should become the constituency rather than the borough itself. A shopkeeper with a shop in Bristol Central and a home in Bristol West would now qualify for a vote in both constituencies; under the new system, there were few ways to qualify for plural votes, but it was much easier actually to qualify, and so tens of thousands of new plural votes were created, overwhelmingly Unionist. At the end of 1917 there was much parliamentary manoeuvring over proportional representation. The original proposal had been for PR in the cities but this was opposed by Unionists who were concerned to protect the efficacy of the business vote; Central Office also opposed the alternative vote when it was put forward in the debates, and the majority of Unionist MPs and the National Union never backed either system. The Commons could not  agree on a scheme and several were inserted in the Bill by a temporary majority of one day and then removed by another majority later. The Lords entered the fray in December with a strong preference for PR as a means of keeping both the Labour party and the Commons in check, so that in January 1918 there were disputes between the two houses as well as between and within the parties. The outcome, perhaps inevitably, was that no new voting system at all was introduced, except for the university constituencies (for it was deemed that graduates would be able to follow the mysteries of PR even if the rest of the electors could not). The Representation of the People Act thus became law in February 1918, ushering in an era of near democracy, increasing the electorate from the 7.7 million of 1910 to 21.4 million in 1918, over three-quarters of whom had never voted before. The Act of 1918 set the scene of the entire political world between the wars, often through consequences that were not seen for a generation. Unionists proved quite able to handle the new mass electorate, and their efforts to gear up to meet new challenges in and after 1911 had set them on the right road. The party took more easily to modern electioneering than did the Liberals, and gained an unexpected bonus in the votes of women, who have been a force for conservatism since their enfranchisement in 1918. What could be anticipated with confidence was the beneficial results of redistribution, for Unionists had expected them for some time. Before the war, Unionists had pointed to the huge disparity between the smallest and largest seats (in 1910 Kilkenny had an electorate of a few hundred and Romford an electorate of over 50,000), and had noted that Unionist constituencies were on average larger than Liberal constituencies, far larger than those of Nationalists in Ireland. ""Increasing population in England and migration of middle-class voters from the towns to the suburbs had led to these disparities and to a situation where any redistribution would help Unionism. In 1911–12 Major Morrison-Bell MP constructed a model to demonstrate these disparities of distribution and had toured the country with it for propaganda purposes; the obvious over-representation of Ireland was especially useful to a Unionist party that wished to claim that Redmond was holding the Empire to ransom. The changes in population in the decade 1901–10, revealed in the 1911 census, demonstrated the rapid increase of population in Unionist areas and the static position in Liberal and Nationalist areas. The LCC area had declined in population by 0.2 per cent overall, but within that Lewisham had increased by 26 per cent and Wandsworth by 34 per cent; the population of Middlesex was up by 42 per cent in ten years, Essex and Surrey both by 30 per cent , while the population of Ireland had fallen by another 2 per cent . Time was clearly on the Unionist side. In the event, the actual redistribution of 1918 came as something of a disappointment, for although there was redistribution within Ireland, the overall number of Irish seats remained the same, and there was only a small increase in the number of English seats. But there was a net gain of some  thirty seats to the Unionists in direct comparison with the last elections in 1910, a strong position for a party that was already the largest in parliament. This position was further improved by the effective withdrawal of Sinn Fein from Westminster after the election of 1918 and the second redistribution in Ireland in 1921 after the Government of Ireland Act, which gave another bonus""to the Unionists by removing about seventy opponents from the House of Commons. The net effect of the Acts of 1918 and 1921 was thus to improve the Unionist position by a hundred seats, not just in that parliament but in every succeeding one too. In other words, quite apart from the franchise changes that did the party no net harm, the changes of 1918–21 transformed the Unionists from the natural minority that they had been in 1914 to a natural majority party until the Second World War. Under the electoral system of 1918, the Unionists had a minimum vote of at least 38 per cent of the electorate, and this would bring at least 250 seats in a parliament of 615; in a political world of three parties this almost guaranteed that no other party would govern alone and that the Unionists would usually have a majority. Within this there was an equally important change, for not only did the number of Unionist seats increase, but so did the number of safe seats. Neal Blewett found just forty-eight ""predominantly middle-class"" constituencies in 1910, while Michael Kinnear found seventy-five in 1921 (and Kinnear's figure is certainly an understatement, for he could not get figures for divided boroughs outside London, many of which certainly would come into his category, so the real figure may be more like ninety). The already safe seat at Wandsworth was divided in 1918 into five safe seats; Lewisham, Hammersmith and Fulham were each divided into two seats; the number of seats in the outer London suburbs of Kent, Surrey, Essex and Middlesex went up from fifteen to forty, of which thirty-five were held by Unionists at every election before 1945. The value of such an expansion of political suburbia has been demonstrated by Michael Kinnear. There were 200 seats with a substantial middle-class element, and these were overwhelmingly Unionist at each election between the wars. If the agricultural seats are added to the middle-class strongholds, it can be seen why Conservatism was so strong between the wars, for the party could count well over 200 seats as unshakably safe and on 300 as reliable enough to be won except in a very bad year. At a time when many middle-class voters would be looking for the party that would best defend them from Labour, this Conservative strength would be of vital importance. The Conservatives would not always win under the electoral system of 1918, but they would rarely do so badly as to allow anyone else to win. The revival of activity occasioned by the 1918 Act and its redistribution may have helped to revive local Unionist parties, but in fact the war had a less serious effect than might be expected. In the first months, when hostilities were expected to last for only a few months, party activity was hardly affected at all. A registration campaign was conducted in the autumn of 1914  and Central Office encouraged the continuation of normal activities. Continuation of the war in 1915, together with the absence of key figures at every level, led to a suspension of all but routine party business. The typical pattern was for the local parties to meet only once a year in 1915 and 1916, to re-elect their officers for another year; agents who had enlisted were kept on the books by retaining half their normal pay, to compensate them for loss of earnings in the national interest and to keep them available for a resumption of partisanship. Central Office tried to keep the local parties alive, for the party truce was only renewed for a few months at a time and parliament was prolonged beyond its five-year term only for a few months at a time too. Subscriptions fell steadily and expenditure fell even more sharply with the reduction of salaries and the suspension of propaganda, so that most local parties ended the war with a substantial profit; but this concealed a real weakness, for expenditure could be revived by a single decision, while income could only be revived by many years of patient work. In 1917 the state of readiness slipped further, with most local parties holding no meeting at all, some sacking their agents, and closing their offices. The agents who remained operated a skeleton service for several constituencies, with the salary shared out too; they visited each office once a week to answer letters and transact routine business; the Annual Report for the Yorkshire Area for 1916–17 claimed ""we still say no offices entirely closed"" but this was no longer a realistic picture of party activity. Things had got even worse on the voluntary side, for without subscriptions to collect or canvassing to do, the whole basis of the voluntary party had gone. The Yorkshire Annual Report for 1920 recalled that ""November 1918 found all Party organizations the worse — not for War but for inactivity"" . The party structure was probably saved by two features, the recruiting of 1915–16 and the need to cope with the Representation of the People Act in 1918. The Parliamentary Recruiting Committee ran the national campaign for recruits in the first eighteen months of the war, through party rather than national channels. The Committee was convened by the Chief Whips of the parties, and the chief professional organizers became joint secretaries. Boraston was thus directly involved in administration, and Central Office looked after the organization of recruiting meetings; the Liberal offices dealt with literature for recruitment and Malcolm Fraser was transferred to Abingdon Street to help with the management of the press. The entire effort was run like a political campaign, with the canvassers, speakers, stewards and publicity all run on tried and familiar lines. District and constituency offices were similarly involved and in many areas the national example was followed, with the agents of both parties working under a mayor or lord lieutenant. The Derby Scheme of 1915 allowed the local parties to mount a full-scale exercise in canvassing and knocking-up. When the state took over recruitment under the Military Service Acts, the party continued to be involved: many agents were transferred to the army, where they continued to  do the same job, and many party offices were lent to the government as recruitment centres. In 1917 party organization was used for the War Savings and War Aims movements. This all reflects the important part that political organizations played in the Edwardian era, for when politicians needed means of communication and organization in a time of crisis it was to the parties rather than to the state that they turned for the machinery and the expertise; it was not to be the same in 1939, with consequent effects on the state of the local parties by 1945. Through recruiting and War Aims publicity. even tapers and tadpoles could play their part in the national cause. Central Office was able to keep going at full capacity through 1915 and 1916, but here again there was a falling off in 1917. Boraston was so much involved in war work that his assistant. William Jenkins. had to be promoted to Joint Principal Agent to look after the party. and he was also given a promise of the reversion of Boraston's job. By this time too there were economies in staff and publications because of the war: Gleanings and Memoranda, the Constitutional Year Book and other semi-partisan pieces of literature were suspended in 1917 for the duration. The middle of 1917 saw the party at its lowest ebb, but the demands of an approaching general election produced a recovery. Professional advice was important to the MPs fighting the Representation of the People Bill and National Union committees began to meet again at every level to discuss the Bill's consequences for the party. There was a conference in late 1917, the Executive met regularly. and the Central Council met a record four times in 1917. The rules of the national Union were changed to allow a special appeal to working-class and women voters. Constituency parties had to be wound up and re-formed to conform to the new boundaries. and all this at the worst point of the war. Local campaigns to resist unsatisfactory new boundaries were run and in some cases were very successful. In Cheshire the plans put forward by the boundary commissioners were opposed by local Unionists and counter-proposals put forward by their chairman, Sir Alan Sykes. were adopted instead: this produced a new constituency called Eddisbury. which would be a most peculiar shape. but which would be almost wholly agricultural — and strongly Unionist. Finally. the passage of the Act into law made a general election a certainty in the near future. For the local parties this increased the urgency of changing the local structures and settling candidates; for Central Office it meant the negotiation of a pact with the Coalition Liberals and the NDP, the arrangements of a joint platform. and the production of anti-Labour party literature. all of which were under discussion from the spring of 1918. In every way, then, the party organization emerged from the war years in reasonably good shape; it had played its part in the war and its local and national structures were attenuated but intact (a major and significant contrast with the effect of war on the Liberals). and a large reform had been carried out with little trouble. Great efforts would be needed to restore the party to its strong position of 1914 and to carry on with  the fundamental changes that had been under way then, but the war years had done no lasting damage. The final effect of the First World War was less tangible, the impact of war on the attitudes of Unionists themselves, but there is no doubt that the holocaust did leave lasting effects. The effect of war on religion was among the most profound of these influences. For the party that had leaned heavily on the established Church and derived satisfaction from its role as defender of the Church, the decline of religion was a serious blow. After the war clouds rolled away old arguments about Home Rule were quickly resumed, but the issue of the Welsh Church was easily settled: Lloyd George offered compensation and the Welsh Church was duly disestablished in 1920 with little Unionist complaint. The House of Lords, trade unions, and licensing continued to raise as much heat as before in Unionist minds, but the issue of the Church was drowned in the mud of Flanders. Fisher's Education Act of 1918 raised far less sectarian strife than Balfour's had done in 1902, less even than Butler's was to do in 1944. In part the death of the old politics of Church and Chapel was a consequence of the catastrophic effect of the war on militant Nonconformity, and especially on Nonconformist Liberalism, but in part it was also due to a new doubt on the Unionist side. The Prayer Book debates of 1928 and the arguments over tithes in the 1930s showed that many Unionists still counted the interests of the Church high in their priorities, but the battles were no longer party ones. The party was as sure as ever about Christian principles, and the advent of women into the organization may even have strengthened the connection, but there was no longer certainty about forms and institutions. Baldwin was one party man who remained a convinced Christian but without certainty about forms, and he was also characteristic of one sort of party response to the suffering caused by the war itself. Bonar Law became ever more pessimistic after the death of his sons in action in 1917, but the reaction of Baldwin and Neville Chamberlain was more positive. To both of them, the human sacrifice of 1914–18 created not just a deep loathing of war but also a determination that such sacrifice should not be in vain. Baldwin had a profound distaste for those who had made money out of the war and in 1919 he made an anonymous donation of part of his wealth to the nation as his personal sacrifice; Neville Chamberlain was greatly affected by the death of his cousin Norman and determined that such sacrifice should not be wasted. For many there was a conviction that the post-war world must be made a better place, a view that recurred regularly over the next twenty years. In 1925 Winston Churchill, no empty idealist, introduced his pension scheme with the hope that the sufferings, the sacrifices, the sorrow of the war have sown a seed from which a strong tree will grow. This is the finest war memorial you could set up to the men who gave their lives, their limbs, or their health, and those who lost their dear ones in the country's cause. For the older men, who had sent their sons to slaughter, there remained a determination to make conditions better; for the younger men there was an almost obsessive guilt at having survived the holocaust when so many friends had died. In their different ways. Harold Macmillan and Anthony Eden shared the same reaction; the young Robert Boothby was one of the few who were disappointed by the Armistice, because he had been too young to fight. Not everyone was affected by the war in this way. but a large group in the party were scarred by the First World War for the rest of their lives. and as a result the party acquired a moral calibre that it had not had before. The Unionist party thus emerged from the war reassured in its identity as the national party, more closely in touch with the national mood than in 1914, with its electoral prospects much improved. but, like the rest of the nation, affected deeply by the war. The only cloud, and in 1918 a threatening thunderstorm to all appearances. was the challenge from Labour. The struggle to determine the party's attitude to the aspirations of Labour was to be its chief battleground for the next six years. Coalition troubles, 1915–1921 For ten years after 1914 the theme of party was accompanied by a strong counterpoint: the idea of coalition. For Rosebery, for Milner, even for Lloyd George, there had been temptation in coalition ever since the Boer War, but such dreams had never come into the political daylight. But when war came the persistent pedal-point of coalitionism sounded all the louder for the sudden silence of the party truce. A coalition government was formed in May 1915, continued under Lloyd George in December 1916, and carried over into peacetime in 1918. Once established, coalition proved difficult to shift and coalitionists developed an ideology of their own. During Lloyd George's premiership, the counterpoint of coalition almost drowned the theme of party, and many Unionists feared for the survival of politics as they knew it. The coalition facilitated a realignment from the two-party Liberal-Unionist contest in 1914 to the Labour-Conservative battles of the late 1920s; only with the triumph of coalition in 1916 did the old politics die, and only with the destruction of coalitionism in 1924 could the new politics be born. It is necessary to examine the idea of coalitionism and the political forces that made it a powerful alternative before considering its direct impact on the Unionist party. The most positive argument for coalition, and the one that tipped the balance in its favour, was the experience of war. The Boer War brought the first murmurs of coalitionism, a sense of national crisis brought the first attempt to form a coalition, and the advent of the First World War made it a practical possibility. In each case the argument was much the same: in crisis, it was the duty of politicians to come together so that the best men could be used to the greatest advantage, and so that shibboleths of party could be discarded. Without a combination the nation could not be properly mobilized, for any party government would be opposed by half the nation, and would be forced to consider its own extremists as more important than moderates on the other side. Coalition was the negation of the party system, for as party assumed a grouping from the centre to one of the extremes, coalition assumed a grouping at the centre to the exclusion of extremists. A coalition in 1910 would have excluded Ulster, Irish Nationalists, and Labour; coalition in 1915 excluded anti-war MPs and diehards. The very existence of coalition meant a struggle for the survival of party, a struggle that the Liberals lost, that Labour  won by keeping clear, and that Unionism almost lost too. By May 1915 Unionist leaders were convinced that they must give up some independence if they were to influence the war; the liquor issue seemed to show the danger of staying aloof, and the shell scandal seemed to show that they were needed inside. National and party interest thus combined to make Sonar Law promote a coalition, but it was the national interest that was cited as the reason for joining Asquith. It was also the national cause that prompted Law to accept a junior position; he took the Colonial Office himself, a backwater in wartime, and Liberals retained most of the major posts. In a negative way, Unionists had an important influence on the new government. securing the removal of Haldane, the demotion of Churchill and the placing of munitions under Lloyd George. Unionist ministers were also able to move the Liberal majority closer to the Unionist view of how the war should be run, notably on conscription and compulsion. Asquith's 1915 government was only halfway to coalition; it was in fact a coalition of parties rather than a coalition of men, and it was run so as to maximize continuity. Unionists were therefore soon frustrated by what seemed the weakness of their leaders in swallowing- Asquith and getting nothing in return. In parliament the position seemed worse now that the Unionist leaders sat on the government front bench while their followers continued to sit as the opposition. But it was the continuing failure in the war and Asquith's inability to take important decisions in time that really fuelled Unionist discontent in 1916. By the summer of 1916 the Unionist backbenchers were used to voting against the government. and were close to acting as a full opposition again under Carson. In the crucial Nigeria debate in November Law actually did quite well, for he persuaded a narrow majority of Unionists to back the government. At the height of the criticism, Law met constituency chairmen and agents at the Queen's Hall and told them that the question whether or not this government was wise must be judged on very broad grounds. This is the question which everyone ought to ask himself, and the only question — are we as a nation in a better position to prosecute the war as a consequence of it than we would have been by any other arrangement? I have no doubt of it. A year later he recalled that he had supported Asquith because""rightly or wrongly. I was afraid of any alternative at the time"". In 1916 he cited conscription and the suspension of trades union restrictions as things that coalition had done for the nation; Gleanings and Memoranda headlined the speech ""The Coalition Form of Government almost indispensable.""  The argument for coalition was pragmatic. that no other government was fitted to the war effort, but it had significant undertones: coalition was especially useful in providing the party with allies more able to secure the cooperation of the working class. Although the Nigeria debate was a relative success after a year of criticism, its significance was not lost on Law: it was held on the subject central to  Unionist economic attitudes; Law and Steel-Maitland were singled out for censure, a pointer to the level of party discontent Party feeling had built up much as Law's own had done; having fought off the direct attack, he took the party along with him in the effort to reconstruct the government on more businesslike lines. There is no question of Carson, Law and Lloyd George conducting a conspiracy to unseat Asquith in December 1916; Law and Lloyd George at least wished to retain Asquith in government and they kept him informed about their plans. Asquith's fall was the result of his own miscalculation, especially of his reluctance to believe that the Unionists would prefer Lloyd George to himself in a contest. When the real crisis broke the Unionist ministers acted to strengthen Lloyd George's hand, from a conviction that only greater power for Lloyd George could put enough drive into the war effort. Unanimity was less marked in the scramble for office after Asquith's departure; ""the three Cs"" , Curzon, Chamberlain and Cecil, managed to keep official party interests to the fore by ensuring that Curzon rather than Carson should join the war cabinet — disloyalty might be useful but it should not be seen to pay. For the rest of the war, the party's loyalty to Lloyd George was strengthened when he became not only the organizer of victory but the inspiration of the country. National service remained the prime reason for coalition. With the approaching end of war in 1918 coalition became more positive because the coalition now had to deal with the issues that had been put aside for the duration, and more controversial because this pushed some Unionists into outright opposition. The government had prepared ambitious reconstruction plans, partly devised to put a moral basis into the war effort and partly produced by progressive ministers and their advisers. It could now be argued that the unity of wartime should be carried on to deal with peacemaking, demobilization and economic reconstruction. The government that had won the war would smooth the transition to peace and would redeem its promise of a land fit for heroes. Such was the argument adopted by most Unionist candidates in the 1918 election, a positive programme of the sort put forward by Lloyd George in 1910. A deal on the government's actual policies was done, again like that proposed in 1910, except that the Unionists now held rather more of the cards. The basis of the argument was still the national interest, but the emphasis was now on positive domestic possibilities rather than on negative foreign problems. Underlying the Unionist acceptance of coalition in 1918 was a darker attitude to the future than appeared in the coalition programme. It was important to retain Lloyd George, not just as the man who had won the war but also as a man who could talk to the working class; and if a revolutionary situation were to arise, then it would be far better if Unionists could call on Liberals to help resist it. The post-war coalition thus had two distinct justifications, a positive sense of what could be done and a negative dread of the alternative. In 1920 Birkenhead put forward both lines of argument when  he argued for greater coalition cooperation in the press. Gradually. though. the failure of coalition policies. failure to deliver the goods in almost every sphere. reduced the positive side of the argument to nothing. By 1922 coalition was based on fear, though by that time on fear of parliamentary Labour rather than revolution as such. It was still possible to argue. as Younger did in January 1922, that a coalition could best carry through the policies that Unionists wanted, but by then the main Unionist demands were directed against Labour anyway. the reform of trade union law and restoration of the House of Lords. By the autumn, the arguments for coalition were entirely negative. Coalitionism, though. was a matter of men as well as measures. The change to a real coalition in 1916 had been occasioned by the need to give Lloyd George a freer hand as much as by concern for structures. The government then developed a momentum of its own as a focus of loyalty that ran against the party system. There had always been more in common between the front benches than either had in common with their followers in the country. By 1920 several Unionists actually thought of themselves as coalitionists. Austen Chamberlain made no secret of his belief that coalition produced better government than party. and he reached a stage of heavy dependence on Lloyd George; Birkenhead found it more congenial to work with men of ideas like Churchill than with the squires who would fill out a Unionist ministry; Balfour had always striven to practise government by agreement. and Curzon was attracted by the glamour of the ""first eleven"" . By 1922 the team of brilliant men who had governed for the past six years could not but see themselves as irreplaceable. They could not easily accept a return to old party cries or the need to oppose men who had become close friends. Nor were such responses confined to the cabinet, for many Unionist MPs could not bring themselves to oppose Lloyd George in 1922 after six years of backing him, and one at least never broke the habit: ""He had become fascinated by Lloyd George. and until the end of his life he would not allow a word of criticism to be heard in his house. If anything went wrong in any part of the world he always said ""That's because you got rid of the little man"" . ""In the organization too there were exponents of continued cooperation; although Younger worked to defeat coalition in 1922 he did not rule it out as a future possibility. Locally. electoral pacts between Liberals and Unionists to resist municipal Labour created the same direct contacts and in some places the pacts remained for the rest of the inter-war years. Coalitionism was not then only a political creed, but also a web of friendships and habits that underpinned political cooperation. By 1922 it was for some such a strong attitude as almost to obliterate the normal responses of party. Coalitionists saw well enough the contradiction between politicians who were elected through parties and a government that was the negation of party. and party men saw it too; hence the contentiousness of the various schemes to square the circle by fusing the two coalition partners into one  organization. Coalition had become a political habit that would be quite difficult to break and had sapped the party's confidence in itself. Most MPs who voted against Lloyd George in 1922 did not envisage a Unionist government as the final outcome, and the defeated ministers did not expect their discomfiture to be permanent. When coalition died in 1924, not all recognized that coalitionism must die with it. In the coalition years the party encountered severe difficulties, some endemic to coalition as such, some related to the times, but together they created a general frustration from which the party was lucky to emerge so well. The first source was frustrated ambition: for seven years from 1915 the party had a share of government. but not a full or fair share. In the Asquith coalition Unionists had eight cabinet posts and Liberals thirteen, although there were far more Unionists in the Commons. Unionists had a majority in Lloyd George's war cabinet, but were little better placed in his government as a whole. From 1916 Unionist MPs were the only reliable support for the government. and from 1918 they had a parliamentary majority of their own, with three times as many seats as the rest of the coalition, but they never held as many as half of the government posts. as table 7.1 demonstrates. At the highest level, Unionists could be satisfied, for they held the most prestigious offices, but the number of jobs was never sufficient to reward the deserving aspirants. Throughout the coalition, there were never more than fourteen offices of cabinet or departmental rank to satisfy the combined ambition of 300–359 MPs and a large number of peers. Normally, the ratio was roughly equivalent to one post for every seven MPs; in coalition, Liberals were appointed on a ratio close to that norm, but Unionists had a proportion of jobs to MPs more like one to twelve or fifteen. Table 7.1 Unionist share of coalition governments, 1915–1922 Cabinet Unionists in Total no. of Total no. of Ministers cabinet ministers Unionists May 1915 22 8 24 9 December 1916 23 13 32 14 January 1919 21 10 30 14 January 1921 21 12 29 14 October 1922 22 11 29 13 The discontent caused by lack of opportunity can be clearly seen in a number of cases, but was a general phenomenon that affected all but the top dozen in the party's collective leadership. At its simplest, about a dozen men were not ministers who would have held office in a Unionist government. and about thirty junior men did not hold a post at all as a result of coalition. (And this at a time when the Unionists could install their own government whenever they wished, through their control of both Houses.) Selborne had resigned from Asquith s government in 1916 and was not offered a post by Lloyd George. From the House of Lords and the National Union he became a  thorn in the flesh of the party leaders, where in a party government it would have been inconceivable that such a man, at the height of his powers and with powerful connections. should be left out. Steel-Maitland had been appointed Party Chairman in 1911 to a post ""of cabinet rank"" , and had served loyally for four years without pay or reward. When the Asquith government was formed there was of course no post for such a recent recruit to the front bench. He wrote to Law to protest when he was offered only an under secretaryship. pointing out that he had only accepted the Chairmanship because of the offer of a cabinet post. Law consulted Balfour and replied that Balfour had not promised in such a way as to bind his successor. that ""of cabinet rank"" did not imply a seat in the cabinet (if not. it is hard to see what it did imply!), and that all must make sacrifices. For eighteen months Steel-Maitland worked with Law at the Colonial Office, a useful liaison that kept the leader and Chairman in close touch. When Lloyd George formed his government. there was a bitter exchange of letters, for Steel-Maitland was now expected to serve under Walter Long. an old enemy. In disgust Steel-Maitland resigned as Party Chairman and in 1919 he despaired of ever getting a senior post and resigned from the government too. He was a man of strong ambition and had a doubtful reputation as an intriguer, but he was an able man who had deserved better of his party. After six years as Chairman, he knew all the important party figures and he became a dangerous foe; in the National Union he combined with Selborne to mount a campaign against coalition and as a Birmingham MP he threatened even- Austen Chamberlain's home base. In normal times, Selborne and Steel-Maitland would have been tolerated and both would have been at least partially silenced by the restraint of office. The same can be said of the junior ministers who finally wrecked the government in 1922; many of these would have been cabinet ministers in a party government. as indeed they were in 1922–23, but they had few prospects under coalition. The careers of Bridgeman. Wood, Amery. Sanders and Lloyd-Greame would at the least be held up for years by coalition, for there was no room for their promotion. This is not to say that they opposed coalition in 1922 merely from personal motives; they had a legitimate ambition to serve their country and resented what they saw as the promotion of less able Liberals. They could only blame the coalition system. for only a change of system would give them their chance. In 1918 Sanders thought he had a chance to become Chief Secretary for Ireland, but was soon reduced to considering himself as a possible Speaker; in 1921 he was passed over for Chief Whip because it did not suit the coalition to have such a partisan in so sensitive a post. and he was fobbed off with an under-secretaryship; in 1922 he worked actively to bring the coalition down. The cases of Lord Robert Cecil and Lord Derby illustrate a different truth about coalition. Both held high office under Lloyd George. but both chose eventually to leave the government. Derby was a weak man whose subservience could usually be taken for granted (in Haig's words he was like  ""the feather pillow [who]bears the marks of the last person who has sat on him"" ), but he was very conscious of his position in the party. Lloyd George dominated him but could never prise him away from his party roots; when Lancashire opinion moved away from coalitionism in 1922 Derby moved with it, and provided the opposition with added credibility. Cecil was more concerned with policy than with party or personal ambition; he parted company with Lloyd George over the League of Nations and post-war diplomacy; once outside the government he manoeuvred with other discontented ""outs"" . with Steel-Maitland to project Grey as a possible national leader, and with Salisbury to provide principled leadership for discontented Unionists. Thus the existence of coalition served to divide the collective leadership by separating those who had power and influence from those who did not, by separating the senior men from their junior colleagues and by cutting off those under the Prime Minister's influence from the rest. Difficulties were accentuated by personal prejudices that had not been broken down. The senior ministers fell easily into the habit of cooperation. but many in the party refused even to attempt the transition. Lloyd George had been the Liberal most hated before 1914 and. after a brief honeymoon with Unionists in 1917–18, he regained his old standing by 1920. Early in 1918, a meeting of Unionist leaders considered future relations with Lloyd George and ""Bob Cecil and Curzon [were]against touching him on the ground that he is such a dirty little rogue"" . To diehards, Lloyd George was ""the"" Welsh Walpole ""and friend of MacDonald who would peddle any opinion and give in to any Labour leader if it would help him to stay in office"" . Neville Chamberlain referred to him as ""this dirty little Welsh attorney"" and Stanley Baldwin called him, somewhat ambiguously. ""the goat"" . There was then a deep distrust throughout the party. as Law discovered in 1920: Bonar addressed a mass meeting. He spoke on excess profits, negotiations with Russia and Ireland. His audience was against him on all these questions and there was no enthusiasm. After the meeting he said to one of the local people that it was very unlike the Last Conference in 1913 when he attacked L.G. for 45 minutes amid great applause. The local man replied ""There would have been as much enthusiasm if you had done the same tonight.""  The honours scandals, the employment of the press lords, incessant changes of policy, and a profligate waste of money were all taken as signs of the degradation of office by Lloyd George. Other Coalition Liberals were disliked as warmly as Lloyd George, more for their present policies than for their past. Edwin Montagu was accused of anti-British motives for his Indian policy; with Reading as Viceroy there were openings for the diehards""latent anti-semitism. Christopher Addison was unpopular because of his advanced social policy and he was eventually driven out by the Unionists. But the bête noire second to Lloyd George was Churchill, whose war record seemed to prove all that Unionists had alleged about his excitability and his unfitness for office. Law was very angry when  Churchill was put in office by Lloyd George in 1917, and the National Union resolved that it was ""an insult to the Army and Navy and an injury to the Country"" . The men at the head of coalition Liberalism were therefore execrated as dangerous. corrupt. or irresponsible enemies. and the same gulf separated Unionists from the rest of the party. especially when the ""coalies"" tried to keep open their avenue of escape by parading their Liberalism. At Leamington, in May 1920, the coalitionists were finally driven out of the Liberal party. but Walter Long only noticed what they had said before they were excommunicated: We have been patient. loyal. self-sacrificing and what do we find? Our Liberal colleagues go down to Leamington and ask the audience to believe that they are just as Liberal as ever they were. In other words that there has been no Coalition, no mutual concessions. but that they have swallowed us. To frustrated ambition was added frustrated partisanship. as Unionists were denied the opportunity to criticize men who were still regarded as enemies. just because they were colleagues. Some refused to accept the restriction but many more nursed resentment in their hearts. Throughout the coalition Ireland, the Empire and the House of Lords continued to divide Liberals and Unionists as always. Over India the Unionists resented the Montagu-Chelmsford reforms in general. but nothing stirred their animosity more than the treatment of General Dyer after the massacre at Amritsar. Dyer was applauded by the diehard press to make up for his censure by the government. and a collection for his benefit soon raised $15,000. Any post-war government would have met Unionist critics in its reconsideration of Britain's imperial role, but the existence of a bipartisan policy did not help to secure acceptance. Criticism ran along similar lines over Lloyd George's middle eastern policy. and over his preference for Greece over Turkey. Ireland provided a clearer division. Unionists were critical of Ulster obscurantism when voiced by Carson in 1918 and in no mood to fight another war in Ireland, but neither would they tolerate the coercion of Ulster. While Asquithians were attacking the Black and Tan policy as immoral, the Unionists were accusing the government of irresolution. The truce of 1921 was attacked as a typical piece of Lloyd George chicanery, and it needed all the efforts of the party leaders to stop the party from breaking up the government there and then. Finally. the House of Lords was a prime domestic reason for Unionist acceptance of coalition. but a constant source of friction. No agreed reform plan had been forthcoming in 1917–18 but it remained an agreed priority of the government to the end, and pledge after pledge was given. Each year it was put off because of the impossibility of devising an acceptable scheme. It was exactly the issue that could be best settled by a bipartisan government. for that would avoid charges of the gerrymandering of the constitution; time would show whether the coalition would deliver the goods, and coalition would be judged accordingly. In all these policy questions. and in the others that still separated the parties. the party reacted as an independent group and not as a partner, for the Lloyd George government was never a focus of loyalty for Unionists. Complaints about government appointments or policies could only be met by Law with the barren reply that the party could not expect total control and that in coalition such things must happen — which is just what the critics were saying too. Individual Unionists played important parts in the government and many Unionist policies were implemented in full, but the party as a whole never took the government to heart as its own. The party never indeed accepted coalition as an idea; a majority of MPs accepted the advice of its leaders to keep the actual government in being. but it was always a decision for now, never one for always. Coalition thus involved inevitable difficulties which could only be kept in check as long as the sense of crisis lasted. The decision to continue collaboration after 1918 can only be understood through the actual events of that year. Active consideration of the future began early in the year. for a general election could not be long delayed after the new franchise came into effect and the war was at a particularly gloomy stage. No advice to the government expected victory before 1919 at the earliest, and after the rout of the Fifth Army in March 1918 defeat stared the government in the face. So in the winter of 1917–18 murmurs of opposition began to grow louder than at any time since Lloyd George became Prime Minister, the Asquithians revived their interest as they scented a chance to bring Lloyd George down. and the press became more hostile — The Times and the Morning Post as well as the Liberal papers. The idea of a general election was therefore a tempting one for the government. for a khaki election like that of 1900 would present the government as the war party and leave Asquith and the Labour party no way to avert destruction. In March 1918 the Unionist leaders agreed to open up negotiations with Lloyd George's supporters and set up a subcommittee of Law, Long. Younger and Clyde to investigate. Behind the scenes talks about a coalition programme were initiated and the party""managers met to share out the candidatures for the projected election. By July an outline agreement had been presented to Law and Lloyd George, by which 150 seats were allocated to Coalition Liberals, but no decision of principle was taken. Throughout this tine, the assumption was that the government was seeking a mandate to continue the war, and as late as October Bonar Law could still see ""almost no chance of any joint action of this kind unless it is begun as the result of an election which takes place during the war and under the pressure of war conditions"" . But by that time a renewed coalition and a coalition election would not be arranged to get a mandate for war so much as to reap the benefits of victory. A few months later Sanders recalled that Lloyd George had""prophesied great unpopularity for the government during the period of demobilisation and said if we had an election in the Spring we might get a  Bolshevik Government. I always held that view and did all I could to press for an election before Christmas in order that we might get a majority large enough to stand the racket."" In the course of negotiation. the Unionist leaders realized how much of their own programme could be extracted from Lloyd George. and they recognized too the enormous boost to his prestige that had come with victory. For Law, the issue was that many Unionists would in any case feel compelled to support Lloyd George and that he might command a large personal following in the constituencies; it would be useful to capture him as Joseph Chamberlain had been captured in 1886. There was then little belief in the value of the Coalition Liberals, but a strong belief in the value of Lloyd George; he would be a good advocate with the new electorate and he would in due course be disarmed as Chamberlain had been. As Law told Balfour,""that would be not a bad thing for our Party. and a good thing for the nation"". The final decision was taken at the end of October, with victory only a few days away, and was announced with the publication of a letter from Lloyd George to Bonar Law, a letter actually drafted by Law as a summary of their agreement. By the time that the deal was presented to Unionist MPs on 12 November, two important developments had taken place. The war had come to an end, so an election would now be very soon indeed, and Asquith had turned down Lloyd George's suggestion that he rejoin the government. Law supported the offer to Asquith, and it was logical for him to do so; a government bent on post-war reconstruct on and resistance to Labour would be strengthened by Asquith's presence. But Asquith's refusal greatly strengthened the Unionist position. as it left Lloyd George wholly dependent on his allies. The deal done between the Whips was in any case a good one for the Unionists: Coalition Liberals would have a free run in 150 constituencies (a figure suggested by Guest, but then rigidly adhered to by Younger). but Unionists would have at least twice as many, and they would now be free to attack sitting Asquithians too, and with Lloyd George as an ally. The joint manifesto proclaimed that imperialism would be the coalition's chief objective. and on specific issues that interested the Unionists Lloyd George promised an open mind on tariffs and no coercion of Ulster. Commending this agreement to his followers, Law was anxious that they recognise the advantage of Lloyd George as an ally, for ""at this moment, Mr Lloyd George commands an amount of influence in every constituency as great as has ever been exercised by any Prime Minister"" . Law was equally keen to point out that little was being risked, and to set at rest the fears of his supporters: What I propose does not mean that our Party is going to cease to exist. We go into this election — at least if I have my way — as a Unionist Party forming a portion of a coalition. I should be sorry if it were otherwise. From the time that my colleagues in the House of Commons did me the honour of electing me to be their leader I  have felt that I was in the position of a trustee; and even throughout the war the one thing that I have aimed at constantly has been to preserve. if it could be done, the unity of our Party. What was proposed was not the submersion of party in a wider unit, but a parliament of collaboration between independent groups; no more was discussed in 1918 and, despite the strength of the arguments for further collaboration, they would scarcely have carried the party to a greater commitment. The scale of what had been achieved in capturing Lloyd George was underlined by incidents surrounding the letter of agreement between Law and Lloyd George. At the meeting of Unionists of 12 November, Law read the letter and impressed his audience with the concessions that Lloyd George seemed ready to make. At the meeting of Coalition Liberals though. Lloyd George gave only a summary of the letter and stressed its Liberal contents. When MPs returned to the Commons, it soon became clear that all was not well, as Robert Sanders noted: Our people became suspicious at once. I spoke to Guest and urged the publication of the letter. On Wednesday afternoon [13 Nov.] Bonar sent me word to come to Downing Street where I found L.G., Balfour, Bonar, and Auckland Geddes. Meanwhile there had appeared in The Times a fairly full report of L.G.'s speech to his own followers. L.G. said it must have been sent by someone in the audience who could write shorthand. He said he spoke impromptu. that he had a difficult job and that he was anxious to make things easy for his Liberal supporters. It was agreed that a joint meeting should be held, at which he, Bonar and Barnes should speak. I pressed for the publication of the letter. L.G. rather deprecated that saying he was not in love with it. Further pressure was applied by the Unionists and the joint meeting on the 16th went off well, with ""the famous letter"" duly printed and handed out. Unionists were only interested in a deal that would make Lloyd George's capture public. both to give them maximum advantage at the coming election and to spread the maximum disaffection in the Liberal party. The election was announced, parliament was dissolved, and polling arranged for 14 December. One problem remained to be settled, which was the working out of the electoral pact. No details were given to the National Union or to the constituencies involved, so much hard work had to be done and much recrimination endured before the party could settle down to the campaign. Overall the party had done very well, getting 362 of the 531 ""coupons"" that were offered by Lloyd George and Law to approved candidates, but locally the position could look very different. In Wales the Unionists had only two coupons out of twenty-two, because most of the sitting Liberals backed Lloyd George, but this did not much impress Welsh Unionists. In Brightside the Unionist candidate had been specially demobilised for the election; the Central Office agent for Yorkshire persuaded him to stand down, but it took a  visit to Central Office before his supporters could be persuaded to support a Coalition Liberal that they had opposed at the last three elections. It was only the fear of Labour and strong pressure from Central Office, including the withdrawal of financial aid, that kept the local parties in line, and some rash promises had to be made. So in Banbury and in Newport local Unionists were assured that the deal was for one election only. and that acceptance would not preclude them from running a Unionist next time, promises that caused trouble later. Leigh Maclachlan of Central Office later recalled the anguish that such talks caused there: Deputation after deputation came pouring in from constituencies whose candidatures had been assigned to Lloyd George Liberals. At last, after one particularly painful interview, Sir Robert Sanders, looking thoroughly upset. turned to the writer and said""You must see any further deputations there may be. I won't be a party to turning down any more of these good fellows."" Financial control may have been a vital weapon. for the local parties that defied the pact were mostly from strong and independent city parties used to financial independence. Overall, though, only nineteen Unionists stood against couponed opponents; in only one constituency. Morpeth. did such Unionist defiance cost the coalition the seat. On the other hand, five of the nineteen rebels won comfortably on their own, against Coalition Liberals, Labour, the coupon, and their own leaders. A case can be made out for the 1918 election as a Unionist victory rather than a coalition victory. Unionists had some success against the coupon and even more in places where no coupons were allocated, as in Cardiff and in Manchester. The issues of the election were certainly more likely to benefit Unionists than anyone else: an outspoken patriotism, a pursuit of the fallen foe, and a call to restore the conditions of 1914."" Lloyd George received a hero's welcome wherever he went, but then so did Churchill in 1945, and it is impossible to tell now whether Lloyd George would have fared so well if he had had Liberals rather than Unionists at his back. Unionist candidates used his letter to Law as an election leaflet to reassure their supporters and to parade his capture to the nation. There is little doubt that the coalition was returned to power mainly on Unionist votes, although this was not widely recognized at the time; the Unionists had never won so many votes before, and it was perhaps natural to attribute their success to their new asset. In the general pattern of inter-war elections though. 1918 fits in easily enough: in 1922 the party won the same share of the vote with a similar number of candidates, but without Lloyd George. The scale of the triumph of 1918 no doubt owed something to Lloyd George, but the fact of Unionist victory did not, for without the pact the party would certainly have won some of the Coalition Liberal seats that it prevented them from attacking. and these would have made up for some of the others perhaps won for them by Lloyd George. It may even be that the coupon helped to limit the size of the Unionist victory and to prolong the life of the Liberal Party. In parliament there was no mistaking the size of the victory: there were 382 Unionist MPs out of 707: without Sinn Fein the Unionist preponderance became overwhelming. Not all Unionist MPs ever supported the coalition, but almost all of them took the Whip at some time; the Unionists made up three-quarters of the government side of the House. Unionists therefore looked forward to domination of the government: but this never happened. and the party as a whole played only a junior role for the next four years. Their majority gave Unionist MPs a virtual veto over policies and appointments in the long run, but their junior position in government prevented any more positive control. This tension led on to attempts to fuse the government parties in 1920, to the failure of almost every government policy, and to complete deadlock by 1921. Fusion became possible in 1920 because of the difficulties already met by the government. Lloyd George's absence in Paris had accentuated the arguments about policy; peacemaking had produced a major Unionist rebellion in a telegram to Lloyd George from 233 Unionist Mrs in April 1919, urging stronger action on reparations; the appointments of F. E. Smith as Lord Chancellor (as Lord Birkenhead). and of Churchill and Addison, had been much criticised. The attack on Birkenhead was especially revealing; it centred on his lack of gravity in the highest legal office, but it was occasioned too by his lack of concern for party in the excitement of office. Unionists also resisted Lloyd Georges attempt to go on running things as in wartime, insisting that the war cabinet should be wound up after peacemaking was completed. Nor did they like Addison's reconstruction plans: his Ministry of Ways and Communications Bill was eventually passed. setting up a Ministry of Transport. but only after Unionist MPs had shorn it of railway and electricity nationalization. Similar action forced the abandonment of coal nationalization after the Sankey Report. and of parts of the Excess Profits Tax. Bonar Law was now Leader of the House of Commons without a department, and it was indeed a full-time job to keep the governmental process going there. Outside Westminster the government was losing support: eight seats were lost at by-elections in the first eighteen months of peace. Turnout rose as the opposition parties recovered from their disarray of 1918 and there was a large turnover of votes. When local elections were resumed in 1919 there was a large Labour advance, and only local pacts stemmed the tide in 1920. The weakness of the government at its roots was demonstrated by the events at Stockport in March 1920, when a vacancy occurred there; weeks of argument were solved only by the resignation of the other sitting member, so that there could be a double by-election with one Unionist and one Liberal candidate as in 1918. By the time Stockport had been settled Lloyd George was moving to prevent such situations from recurring. He proposed the fusion of the two coalition parties into a new party, which would be launched on an inspiring  programme of strong government and social betterment. The serious economic situation and the delicate state of Labour relations demanded a stronger government to hold the ring. for the attempt at fusion took place just a month before the post-war boom began to collapse. a development that punctured the inflationary crisis and took""the heat out of the Labour militancy. So, for various different reasons, most of the Unionist leaders approved of Lloyd George's intentions; the party managers agreed because they feared that continuing disorganization on the Coalition Liberal side might eventually wreck the government. Birkenhead put the case for a new party in articles in the Weekly Dispatch. a round robin from ninety-five MPs supported fusion, and Balfour formally proposed fusion in a letter to Bonar Law on 10 March 1920. Other Unionists, including Law himself, were less sure, even though they shared their colleagues""concern about the political and economic situation; nevertheless it was agreed to go ahead, but that Lloyd George should make the first move. Lloyd George would propose fusion to his Liberal supporters, and Bonar Law would follow suit on the next day. In the event the reactions of Coalition Liberal ministers were so uniformly hostile that Lloyd George moved quickly into reverse; when he met Coalition Liberal MPs, he merely suggested greater cooperation with Unionists and did not mention fusion as such. Bonar Law promptly gave up the whole idea, with obvious relief, as he told Balfour: The result of this will probably be not to attempt any real fusion of the Parties but to get cooperation. something on the lines of the Liberal Unionists and Conservatives in the early days. This will be difficult to arrange and will certainly not be efficient, but personally I am not sorry at the turn events have taken. I do not like the idea of complete fusion if it can be avoided, but I had come to think, as you had also, that it was really inevitable if the Coalition were to continue. But it always seemed to me more important from L.G.'s point of view than from ours. As a Party we were losing nothing and, since the necessity of going slowly in the matter has come from L.G.'s own friends, I do not regret it. In March 1920, as in November 1918, Lloyd George's open dependence on the Unionists had been openly demonstrated. When the Coalitionists were driven out of the Liberal fold at Leamington in the following May dependence became even greater, for it removed the only theoretical alternative that Lloyd George and his friends had left. It remains to decide whether the Unionists would have accepted fusion if Lloyd George could have made it a real option in 1920. The party in the Commons would probably have done so, though not without a severing of all connections by a determined minority; there is little doubt though that the party outside parliament would not have accepted fusion, or that they could have prevented its implementation. The parliamentary party could determine the shape of governments and election campaigns. but they could not change the structure of the party itself without a positive vote from the National Union and overwhelming approval in the constituencies. At the Party  Conference of 1920, which coalitionists had hoped would approve fusion, it was estimated that about five-eighths of the delegates were in favour of the existence of the coalition, and the rest against it on principle, but that hardly any of them approved its current policies. The Executive elected at that Conference was packed with diehards, and ""a debate on cooperation against Labour revealed the depth of division: a motion calling for closer collaboration met strong opposition, but so did one calling simply for a Unionist government: They must turn out the man who was the greatest danger to the Conservative Party"" ,(a voice — ""Lloyd George"" ).  ""Yes, if you allow conditions to continue as at present you will find a deliberate attempt is being made to assassinate the Conservative Party.""  In the end a meaningless compromise was made, and the Conference called on all good men to come together to resist socialism, but also insisted that the Unionist party should not sacrifice any of its independence in the process. It is difficult to see how this Conference could""possibly have approved fusion; even if it had done, half the constituencies would probably have refused to implement the decision. A motion which would have specifically committed]the party against fusion was not put on the chairman's decision; the diehards accepted this ruling without demur, no doubt because they felt that they had already made their point. Bonar Law's position remains enigmatic, for he promoted fusion and yet was glad to see it fail. He was never an ideological coalitionist and never fell under L.G.'s spell, for all their good personal relations. Had his colleagues backed fusion in 1920 Law would have accepted it, but he would hardly have stuck to that position in the party crisis that must have followed. His relief in avoiding such a parting of the ways is understandable. With the failure of fusion, and with the subsequent failure of Liberal reunion in May 1920, the coalition settled into a stage of continuous crisis. The deepening economic recession defused the worst industrial problems, but the failure of fusion had deprived the government of the only way of bringing coalition and party into line. From now on time was on the side of the anti-coalitionists, for the approach of another election would eventually reopen the argument to their advantage. By the time of the next possible resolution of the problem at the end of 1921, coalition had signally failed to provide Unionists with what they had hoped for, and Lloyd George had become an electoral albatross rather than an asset. The failure of the programme of 1918 stemmed above all from the lack of real agreement at the time; despite the negotiations, the coalition's electoral manifesto and campaign of 1918 went little further than Lloyd George's letter to Bonar Law. When coalition ministers began to bring forward legislation in 1919 they met a hail of criticism, from Liberals hostile to decontrol and Unionists lukewarm on social reconstruction. To keep all his supporters in balance, Lloyd George had to offer something to all of them, but this meant that every coalition scheme was also hotly opposed by a part of the coalition. Lloyd George disarmed his opponents on Ireland with his Russian policy, and his opponents on Russia with his Irish policy, and they did not combine to oppose him. Another example of this division of opponents was the Amritsar Debate of July 1920. Conservative MPs. voted 122 to 93 against the government. Lloyd George was upheld in this division by the votes of Labour and Asquithian Liberal M.P.s who at the time vigorously opposed his repression of Ireland. Such a balancing act could keep his government in being only by increasing his own reputation for lack of principle. Instead of a systematic policy of imperialism, Unionists had Montagu's Indian policy and Milner's policy in Egypt; instead of settlement in Ireland there were outrages; instead of a broad social policy there was first a reckless waste of money and then an abandonment of almost all that had been proposed. In only one area did the coalition succeed totally, but this argument was a double-edged sword: Lloyd George had weathered the storm of labour unrest, and after ""Black Friday"" this was clearly abating. What was now needed was a means of countering Labour's electoral appeal, and for this a Prime Minister with a cleaner political reputation would be needed. The more the revolutionary threat receded, and the more Lloyd George appeared as a loser of votes, the more the Unionists would be tempted to cast him adrift. In most of this Lloyd George was desperately unlucky, both in the failures and reconsiderations of policy and in the development of his own reputation. Many coalition schemes were wrecked by Unionist hostility, yet Unionists also complained when the government then changed course. The following scenario was typical: government introduces social scheme balanced to meet Liberal and Unionist influence in government, but tilted slightly to Liberalism by the minister in charge; Unionists in the House of Commons wreck the plan and denounce the waste of public money; government withdraws the scheme and is then accused of unprincipled change of front by Unionists. Such was the logic of coalition when the balance of the government did not correspond to the balance of parliament. Successes of the government would always be claimed by all its members, but failures would be left to the Prime Minister. Rapid changes of policy were in any case dictated by circumstances. The uncertain foreign situation was typified in Eastern Europe where in 1920 the Poles seemed likely to extinguish the Bolshevik regime, and a year later the Bolsheviks almost took Warsaw. At home the sudden switch from inflation and boom to stagnation and slump in a few months made changes in policy inevitable. Ireland was a nightmare for all parties; the fifty-year respite gained by Lloyd George in 1921 was certainly based on pragmatism rather than principle but no other policy could have worked. In field after field the government was forced to change course, earning a reputation for dishonesty and lack of principle that, when allied to Lloyd George's prior reputation, could only do him great damage. Nothing exemplified this more than the campaign for public economy which shook the government in 1921. A public  that had seen income tax rise fivefold in five years were only too ready to believe that their money was being wasted. During the war the national crisis kept discontent within bounds, but when income tax actually went up again in 1919 (to pay amongst other things-for homes for heroes) the reaction of taxpayers was very hostile indeed, especially when in 1920 inflation reached unprecedented levels too. The first to sense the new mood was the press, and an Anti-Waste League was founded by Lord Rothermere. Two by-elections at the Wrekin and one at Dover showed the threat that independents could pose on the anti-spending tack, and Lord Salisbury tried to guide the agitation into respectable channels through a People's Union for Economy. Two further Anti-Waste victories in June 1921, on Salisbury's doorstep in Hertford and in the ultra-safe Unionist seat of St George's Westminster, were too threatening to be ignored. Government spending had already been reviewed and cut substantially, but the time had now come for a great public gesture; this was supplied by the appointment of the Geddes Committee, a typical Lloyd George manoeuvre using businessmen instead of MPs or ministers. When the ""Geddes Axe"" fell in February 1922, it proposed cuts in the social services which alienated once and for all the Prime Minister's last admirers on the left; moderate Unionists like Stanley Baldwin disliked the Geddes Axe as being too arbitrary and too indiscriminate, but the rest of the party criticized it as too little, too late, and unlikely to be implemented anyway. Resolutions continued to call for further economies and lower taxation, so the government got no credit for what it had done. After the summer of 1921 the Anti-Waste threat receded, but this was largely because Unionist candidates were now on the bandwagon with them, demanding cuts as loudly as anyone. After St George's, almost all Unionist candidates ran without making promises to support the coalition; this did not mean that all of them joined the diehard group when elected, but it showed that coalition was no longer seen to be a winning ticket. By 1921 indeed frustration with coalition was building up such a head of steam as seriously to threaten its future. The party managers continued to bewail the organizational weakness of Coalition Liberalism, but there had been little opportunity for organizational collaboration; one of the few joint ventures, a magazine called Popular View, was abandoned in 1921 because of the impossibility of producing a lively magazine out of continuous compromise. Money was short in the party by 1921 because there had been no proper revival since the war; members were constantly described as apathetic, and were in no mood to give their time or their money to a party that did not know where it was going. The state of the organization was causing concern to the party managers, for it would deteriorate further unless some definite decision about the future were taken. At the end of 1921 Younger still favoured coalition, but the balance had become a fine one. The National Union had much less doubt, and by 1921 it was committed firmly against coalition. Younger was in a very exposed position, for he was  Chairman of the National Union Executive responsible for carrying out its decisions, as well as Party Chairman and so committed to the leader and the coalition. He tried to escape the cross-fire by getting the two offices separated but could not get the new rules approved. The actual administration of the National Union was separated from Central Office in 1921, and it appointed its own secretary thereafter; it was a change of no great importance, for the National Union continued to work from Central Office and the Principal Agent continued to be Honorary Secretary, but it was a minor declaration of independence. The question that exercised the National Union most of all was the House of Lords, and regular deputations were sent to Law to press for action. By early 1922 tempers were short and the Chairman of the Central Council publicized the dispute in March with an open letter to Austen Chamberlain. This brought a reply from Salvidge, still a convinced coalitionist: I read with amazement Sir Alexander Leith's letter to you in this morning's press. The inference in his letter is that he speaks for the Council of the National Union of which he is chairman. As a member of that Council I emphatically deny that he has had any mandate, or that he is justified in assuming that the Council as a whole takes his view. Despite Austen's soothing reply, Salvidge took the matter up at the next meeting of the Executive, when he demanded whether or not Leith had been satisfied with Austen's reply. Salvidge was right to claim that Leith had overstepped the mark and that he had no mandate for his action, but it is clear that he rather than Salvidge really represented the views of the National Union. In March he explained that he had acted in a personal capacity only and that Chamberlain had suggested that their correspondence be published. At the May Executive the government was rapped over the knuckles for its failure to reform the House of Lords, ""a breach of the understanding upon which the allegiance of the Unionist Party to its leaders depends"" . Salvidge proposed to delete these insulting words but could not even find a seconder; nine MPs were present, including Younger, Sanders and Neville Chamberlain, all of whom must have approved of the resolution or seen the futility of attempting to amend it. The National Union also reacted fiercely to the attacks on Younger by coalitionist ministers, most of all Birkenhead's description of him as ""the cabin boy"" and Lloyd George's of ""a second-class brewer"" . There were fears that it was intended to remove him and substitute someone more acquiescent. In March 1922 Steel-Maitland proposed a strong motion of confidence in Younger that was a clear rebuke to his critics; Younger lowered the temperature by asking Steel-Maitland to withdraw the motion, but the Executive accepted this only ""on the understanding that Sir Laming Worthington-Evans would make known to his colleagues in the Government that the Committee would bring the matter up again unless the attacks by Ministers on Sir George Younger ceased"" . The National Union was then hostile to coalition and quite determined to use its independence if  necessary to protect the interests of the party. The views of the local parties were less clearcut — although the National Union itself was no more than the sum of the local party leaders. There was support for coalition in the North and in Scotland, where local cooperation was pushing back municipal socialism in 1920–21, and also in Birmingham, where Austen Chamberlain traded on the family name and Neville brooded uneasily on the course of events. In southern England, there was forthright opposition, for here the benefit of cooperation was negligible and the Labour threat more remote. Sanders found that Somerset was almost wholly hostile to coalition, and Middlesex and London were both equally critical. It was now that the assurances of 1918 that the pact would be for one election only came home to roost; wanting to be ready in plenty of time, many local parties were by 1921 selecting candidates who would oppose sitting Coalition Liberals. In Newport it was the Licensing Act of 1921 that brought about this decision, but in other places it was India, or Ireland, or public spending. Local parties also pressed sitting MPs to declare that they would fight next time without the coalition label and many gave way to these suggestions. Local parties were not very representative of Unionist voters, but this did not affect their independence or their control over their candidates. There was little to be done to prevent this inexorable build up of pressure from the roots. Taking the lead against the coalition was a small but implacable group of diehards; they were never more than a few dozen in the Commons and, although they attracted shifting support on particular issues, they never threatened the coalition majority. The Lords were more diehard, as they had been ever since 1911, but unless their powers were restored they would denounce the government in vain. Diehard opinions ranged from the virulent obscurantism of Northumberland, Page Croft and Cooper, who saw politics as a black-and-white struggle between good British imperial-minded Christians and Jewish-dominated marxist wreckers, to the high-minded Association of Independent Peers, who were primarily concerned with the effect of coalition on the standards of public life and its failure to halt the drift towards class politics. The strongest weapon in the diehard armoury was the press, for it had the reliable support of the Morning Post, National Review and Spectator, and intermittent backing from the papers of Beaverbrook, Rothermere and Northcliffe. Of the Unionist press, only the Daily Telegraph supported the coalition, and it could make little head against such a tide. This motley bunch of adventurers, undesirables and patriots had by 1921 accepted the general lead of Lord Salisbury. As the son of a Unionist Prime Minister, Salisbury used his name and connections to weld the diehard opposition together and awaited his opportunity. He was desperately worried that coalition, as a cynical combination to keep Labour down, would produce a reaction among working-class electors that would eventually put Labour in power. This was the most respectable strain of Unionist opposition to the  coalition. When the Unionist won the by-election at Newport in 1922, on working-class votes and on an anti-coalition platform, his agent explained that""the working classes had never understood the Coalition. They had regarded it rightly or wrongly as a wangle and as an attempt to ally capitalist forces against the worker."" It was such fears that Salisbury set out to quieten, using his People's Union for Economy to widen the diehards""appeal, and calling for a return to the classless tradition of Conservatism. His own group called itself the Free Conservatives, set up an office to rival that of the official party, and supplied money and professional assistance to rebels at by-elections. Salisbury did not share half the views held by those who accepted his lead, but he was a focus for the increasing Unionist discontent, a respectable public figure acting from the highest motives; by 1921 he had made the diehard opposition a formidable force. In any calculation of the party's future prospects Bonar Law would be a key figure. Throughout the coalition, Law was prepared to support its continuation, but he was rarely prepared to argue for concession that would weaken his own party. In private he got on very well with Lloyd George, but he never hid his doubts; in 1917 he told Unionists that Lloyd George was a man who has the defects of his qualities"", and told his audience that he was saying no more than he had told the Prime Minister to his face; when in 1920 he was told that Unionists would rather hear him attack Lloyd George than defend him, he told this story to the Prime Minister too. For ten years Law had been at the heart of the party's reactions to political events, largely because his own views mirrored those of his followers almost exactly. The extreme diehards had written off Law as the dupe of Lloyd George because he did not come out fighting against coalition policies, hence the witticism that the coalition was an alliance between a flock of sheep led by a, crook and a flock of crooks led by a sheep. But to the bulk of the party, Law s presence in government was a guarantee of the party's independence; with Law in charge the party would extract from coalition whatever there was to be gained, but at no risk, and when stripped of all complications this was more or less what Bonar Law intended all along. He was therefore as vital a figure as Salisbury, and in something of the same way: Salisbury was the link between the anti-coalition forces outside the government, and Law was the link between anti-coalitionists outside and critical Unionists within. Successive crises were dealt with by Law without resolving the fundamental disequilibrium of the situation, for the conflict between coalition and party was as real in Law's own mind as in the minds of a host of Unionists who continued to give general support to the government. It was therefore an event of major significance when Law's retirement was announced in March 1921. He had been unwell for some time and had now gone into a state of collapse. Lloyd George announced his resignation to the Commons on 17 March in a speech that was close to tears, and the reaction of Unionist MPs was equally emotional, testament to Law's great standing in his  party. The effect of the resignation was increased by its suddenness: within two days Law had laid down all his offices and gone abroad. Maurice Cowling has suggested that Law's resignation was tactical, that he could not face reconciling his party to the coming Irish negotiations, and that he was giving up office so as to be available as an alternative to coalition in the future; in Gaullist terms he was becoming a Prime Minister ""in the reserve of the republic"" . Lloyd George perhaps entertained similar doubts, for his first reactions were to suggest that he should resign too, and to ask if he might speak to Bonar Law's doctor. But there can be no real doubt that it was on medical advice that Law resigned, for he was advised that only a complete break would save him from total breakdown, and he was actually suffering from the disease that was to kill him in less than three years. For six months in 1921 Law was in France, cut off from most political information and from all political action. His position after his return in September should not affect the assessment of his resignation in March. The effect of Law's abrupt departure was magnified by the departure at about the same time of Walter Long, the only other Unionist of weight who combined an acceptance of coalition (as a defence against Labour) with a determination that the integrity of the party should not be compromised in any way. Long's health had been deteriorating for years, but he had kept open his channels of communication; like Law his influence was based on years of devotion to the interests of the party, and like Law's that influence had been used to argue the case for coalition. In February 1921 he gave up office and soon afterwards he accepted a peerage and retired from active politics. With the passing of Law and Long there were no Unionists in the cabinet who had both authority and detachment; the link had been broken, but its importance was demonstrated with devastating effect when both intervened to influence the events of October 1922. By this time Long would not have been a possible leader, and so the third contender of 1911 alone remained: Austen Chamberlain. There was some speculation about alternatives, with some canvassing the claims of Derby and Salisbury and others imploring Lloyd George to take over the leadership and unite the parties in a shotgun wedding, but Austen's claims were undeniable. He was elected leader of the party at the Carlton Club on 21 March 1921, proposed by Captain Pretyman who coined in his speech the idea that Conservative leaders ""emerged"" rather than being elected. Austen had certainly emerged as leader, for nobody could have stood against him with any prospect of success, and it was appropriate that his succession should be marked by Pretyman, who was a respected backbencher of long service and represented the inarticulate centre of the party. At the time of his election, Austen was seen as a party man who would be even more attentive to Unionist interests than Law had been. This was a natural enough view for those who remembered his tariff opinions before the war, his stout defence of Ulster and his diehard opinions in 1911. But by 1921  Austen was an ideological coalitionist for both personal and tactical reasons: he had fallen under the personal sway of Lloyd George, he was influenced by Birkenhead and Horne, and he had no doubt that a coalition alone would be able to contain Labour. The intolerance he had shown for free-traders before 1914 was now turned on rebel Unionists who rocked the coalition boat. He had perhaps been too long in high office, too isolated from discordant views by the well-oiled Birmingham machine to take full account of the volume of dissent. Any doubt about his attitude should have been set aside by the speech with which he accepted the leadership: There are moments when the insistence upon party is as unforgiveable as insistence upon personal things, when the difficulties which the nation has to confront call for a wider outlook and a broader union than can be found even within the limits of a single party, and when the traditions of more than one party, the ideas of more than one party need to be put into the common stock. For the next eighteen months, Austen Chamberlain worked behind the scenes to maintain the interests of his party, just as Law had done, but he had no personal sympathy for the diehards or their views, and he made no gestures of conciliation to them. His public speeches were all aimed at converting the party to a positive belief in coalition, leading it from the front — and in a direction where many Unionists did not wish to follow. In losing Law the party had lost a conciliator; in electing Austen it had gained an inflexible leader who would not always put party first. There was reason to think, as the Financial News suggested, that""Mr. Bonar Law's resignation is more than a nine-days wonder. It is probably the beginning of the end of Coalition Government. ""The advent of a convinced coalitionist to the leadership of the largest coalition party was indeed the beginning of the end for coalition."
ACA ACA-EWW-001 1.76 "Foreword: Alan Simpson's tribute to his co-author My co-author and friend Professor A. R. Collar, C.B.E., LL.D., F.R.S., Emeritus Professor of Aeronautical Engineering in the University of Bristol, distinguished aeronautical scientist and former Vice-Chancellor of that University, died at his home in Bristol on 12th February 1986, just ten days before his 78th birthday, and only a short time before our book was published. Roderick's eminence as an engineering scientist and scholar is well known. However, he was also a man of exceptional personal warmth and charm. He was, in every sense, a gentleman and a gentle man. Nevertheless, when the occasion demanded it (as it did during the turbulent period in which he became Vice-Chancellor of Bristol University), he showed great courage and firmness — the latter always in the nicest possible way. Roderick's interests were wide; for example sport (cricket, tennis and football — both varieties), good music (he played the violin), verse (he read extensively and composed, when inspired or provoked, to match an occasion and could recite extensively from memory — particularly W. S. Gilbert), games and puzzles (chess, cribbage, mathematical conundrums and crosswords; he could, at his zenith, do The Times Crossword any day in less than twenty minutes), and art (he was an active member of The Bristol Savages). He was also president of a local Gilbert and Sullivan society for many years. He did much hospital work: for several years up to his retirement he had been Chairman of the South West Regional Hospital Management Board and was an active hospital visitor. His charitable works were extensive. He had been President of the Bristol Rotary Club, chairman  of governors of many schools and colleges (notably R.M.C.S., Shrivenham), and was a Liveryman of the Guild of Air Pilots and Navigators, to mention but a few of his activities. He was the perfect committee chairman: he loved committee work when it was productive, and it always was when he was in the chair. Innate within him was the ability to put committee members at their ease, so that they could give of their best, and he could abstract the maximum amount of information. This ability was evident in his many years of A.R.C. Committee and Council chairmanship and in his chairmanship of the university committees, culminating in his Vice-Chancellorship. At one time he was on 25 committees, over and above those within the University, and was chairman of many of these. At the height of this committee and other administrative work, Roderick often expressed his desire to return to his mathematics and, in particular, to write a sequel to his famous book (with R.A. Frazer and W.J. Duncan) Elementary Matrices. I had agreed to be co-author, but it was not until seven years after his retirement that work could begin, for only then had his committee activities abated to an extent which allowed the long periods necessary for writing and discussion. It is appropriate to recall that Elementary Matrices (1938) was printed nine times in U.K., several times in U.S.A., was translated into Russian and Czech, and finally republished in hardback in U.S.A. in 1983. It was written following a period of pioneering work on the application of matrices to engineering problems, undertaken by Frazer, Duncan and Collar at the N.P.L., Teddington, in the 1930s. Collar was certainly the junior member of the partnership, but those who know his mathematical style are well able to perceive his many areas of contribution to the book. In later years, Roderick confided that he had been far from happy with the title, for the book certainly was not ""elementary"" . Any sequel must be ""more elementary"" and tailored to the needs of the engineering student. This is not to be viewed as condescending: Roderick regarded himself as a student of the subject and said so on many occasions during the writing of the new book. As work began in earnest on the book, I realised that Roderick had lost none of the skills that I, as his research student twenty years before, had regarded with awe. But writing now was not easy for him: he had begun to suffer with arthritis in the year following his retirement, and had had to give up his violin owing to lack of flexibility of his fingers, and as the condition developed, he found writing more and more difficult. This did not deter him, as, between 1980 and 1984, he completed over 400 pages of manuscript. On average, we met for three hours every ten days, constantly revising, exchanging and criticising so that in the end we had both had a hand in everything. The whole must have been rewritten about five times. Roderick was always seeking a better way of putting things in order to remove all possible ambiguities and to assist the reader to the maximum extent: if this meant rewriting 100 times he would gladly do it. He was meticulous, but never pedantic. Roderick's last, and possibly finest, contributions to this book were the Theorems XII and XV of Chapter 1 which were completed in 1985 shortly after the serious fall which perhaps precipitated the leukaemia from which he failed to recover, despite repeated blood transfusions. At this stage, the arthritis in his fingers was scarcely bearable and writing extremely painful. But the exceptional clarity of his thought processes was evidently still totally unimpaired. We last met on the Sunday before his death. Although very weak, he was anxious to discuss technical matters, among which were possible revisions to Chapter 6. He had, a few weeks before, completed an excellent set of autobiographical notes and, characteristically, a sonnet to his wife, Bobbie, on her birthday. Roderick will be sadly missed in every circle in which he moved, but most of all, of course, by Bobbie, whose devotion and fortitude was his greatest comfort in his final illness, and whose forbearance over many years enabled Roderick to spend such a great amount of their valuable time on the book. A.S., February 1986."
ACA ACA-F98-001 0.94 "The Ninth British Library Research Lecture Computers and the humanities Anthony Kenny The British Library 1992 Scholars in the humanities, like researchers in other subjects, make use of computers for word-processing, for cataloguing the books in their departmental libraries, and also for desk-top publishing. This generic computer use is not my topic. I want to talk about the use of computers in actual research, and the features of that use which derive from the special characteristics of the humanities. University lecturers in the humanities are making increasing use of computers for teaching purposes; but this too lies outside my scope. The uses of the computer in humanities research can be divided into three main kinds, depending on the nature of the objects studied. A humanities researcher may use a computer to study strings (as in natural language processing or the analysis of literary texts) or to study numbers (of discrete items or events, as in social and economic history) or to study icons, whether visual (as in art history), or acoustic (as in musicology). Of course individual humanities disciplines make use of more than one of these types of computer study: the student of literary style will make statistical studies of the frequency of the lexical strings and grammatical features identified in his chosen text; the historian may have occasion to search through and analyse the texts of his primary sources in machine-readable form. In art history a large part of electronic data processing takes the form of cataloguing works of art, and only a small proportion of research concerns pattern recognition or digitization of images; in musicology it has only recently become possible to study scores directly input to the computer without the mediation of alphanumeric code. In all humanities disciplines the computer is used in an endeavour to replace intuition with quantification. Linguists, students of literature, art historians and musicologists all seek to identify styles, and the similarity and differences between them. Common to all these disciplines is the question: what statistics define a style? How far can a style be identified with an aggregate of statistical features? Similarly , a historian will make use of statistical techniques to give objective substance to intuitively sensed historical processes or trends. In all humanities disciplines the use of computers seems to have passed through three stages, each corresponding roughly to a decade. The first stage was the period of pioneering work: the abortive first attempts at machine translation; the earliest computer concordances; the early authorship studies of Morton, Ellegard, Mosteller and Wallace; the first conferences on computing in the humanities (1964–7) and the more specialised ones in history and anthropology (from 1962) and in literature and linguistics (from 1970). During this period concordances to many major works of literature were produced by computer, but published in traditional hard copy. Many of these early projects were the work of interdisciplinary research teams, including not only humanities scholars but senior information scientists, responsible for custom-designed software. This period lasted until about the end of the sixties. The second period lasted through the seventies until the early eighties. Humanities scholars learned how to write their own programs, as programming languages became easier to master. But more significantly the development and widespread availability of pre-designed packages, such as OCP (the Oxford Concordance Package) for concordance construction, and SPSS (Statistical Package for Social Sciences) for statistical analysis, meant that it was possible for the humanist to become more independent of the computing experts, and to operate with at most low-level assistance. In history, in particular, the use of computers to provide material for use in monographs, once a matter to be trumpeted in the text, became a commonplace to be noted without elaboration in footnotes. Humanities computing centres were set up in Oxford, Liege, Tubingen and other places. While the availability of systems such as SPSS meant that there was a temptation for humanists to fit their special data to the software, rather than to design software for the data, on the other hand there began to be developed systems for source-oriented data entry, of which the most famous was CLIO. Throughout the seventies and the early eighties, humanities scholars, despite their growing independence, still worked in collaboration with, and usually in proximity to, their colleagues in computing centres. With the advent of cheap microcomputers in the mid-eighties, the typical humanities scholar was more likely to be found doing research at home on a personal computer, attached no doubt to a network, but engaged much less interactively with colleagues in the computing centre. As a result of the microcomputer revolution, electronic data processing has become a familiar feature of research in most humanities disciplines. Nowadays, I am told, in Germany most doctoral students in history make use of computers, not just for word processing, at some stage of their studies. No doubt this will shortly be the case, where it is not so already, in other European countries. The building of large databases, whether unstructured (like text-archives) or structured (like many historical databases) has been a major preoccupation of this period. The development of CD-ROM techniques has been of particular significance for students of texts: classics students can search the complete database of ancient literature by using the IBYCUS implementation of the Thesaurus Linguae Graecae; students of English can use the CD-ROM version of the Oxford English Dictionary to conduct searches which would take lifetimes if conducted on the twenty volumes of hard copy. In archaeology, I understand, it can now be said that computers are automatically considered for any project, however small. Throughout these stages of development, the research conducted by humanities scholars has taken place at three levels. The lowest, most general, and most unambiguously useful level consists in the employment of a computer to perform a humdrum task in less time than would be possible for an unaided human: the search through a text for a quotation, the determination of a word frequency, the construction and analysis of a contingency table, the classification of iconic data. This kind of activity will leave little visible trace in the published work of the researcher. At the other end of the scale there are ambitious research projects undertaken for methodical demonstration purposes. The results are sought not so much to enrich the domain of research with fundamentally new findings as to demonstrate the validity of some new form of automatic processing. Two examples of such projects are discussed in a recent paper by Manfred Thaller. In France Gian Piero Zarri has developed a system known as RESEDA to allow Artificial Intelligence techniques to be applied to historical source material (concerning the Hundred Years War). The project is well known in AI circles; but it seems to have left virtually no trace in the historical literature. This is because the system is so complicated that no historian could use it without explicit support from the AI project group. Again, in 1981–7 the Volkswagenstiftung funded on a large scale the ARCOS project, a system which photographs a three-dimensional archaeological object, provides a drawing and converts it into data which lend themselves easily to methods like Cluster Analysis. The prototype was in the vanguard of technical development. Unfortunately the price of the prototype was so high that it was out of the financial reach of the archaeological community. Projects of this kind win reclaim in the literature of AI, but pass almost without remark in the parent humanities disciplines such as history and archaeology. Where, in fact, are we to look for the major effects of the use of computers in humanities research? The most spectacular is the creation of the whole new topic of research, the new discipline of computational linguistics. The most widely felt effect has been the perfecting of traditional tools of research, data-collections, concordances, dictionaries, and corpora. New tools of research, and new testbeds for theories become possible. Perhaps the most dramatic opportunity being developed for linguistic studies is the British National Corpus. This is a collaborative venture, involving three publishers (OUP, Longman, Chambers), the British Library, and two universities (Oxford and Lancaster). The aim is to provide a corpus of 100 million words of contemporary spoken and written English to provide raw data for the empirical study of language by a wide variety of disciplines. The project started in January 1991 with a grant from the DTI and the SERC. When complete it should provide an unparalleled resource for lexicographers, and information technologists, and a test-bed for theoretical linguists. But in spite of the multiplication of new basic research tools in the humanities, it is surprisingly difficult to point, in specific areas, to solid, uncontroverted gains to scholarship which could not have been achieved without the new technology. The high hopes which some computer enthusiasts held out that the computer would revolutionise humanistic study have been proved, over and over again, to be unrealistic. Sometimes the initial claims made were much exaggerated: as the claim made in New Testament studies that the computer would for the first time reveal the true lineaments of the Bible that we had ignorantly worshipped. But even in areas where there was no hubris in the initial claims, the results delivered have often been disappointing. Between humdrum research and showpiece research, what the humanities scholarly community is really anxious to see is work which is both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer. In the last three decades the number of such contributions is sadly small. No doubt in each discipline my colleagues could single out a handful of seminal projects. What I want to do, in this second part of my lecture, is to illustrate in the field in which I have been myself involved — literature and stylistics — the kind of projects which have been attempted and the limited success which has been achieved. From the outset, some scholars have been highly suspicious of the use of numerical methods in literary studies. This suspicion is particularly strong among biblical scholars, and one of them, Principal T.M. Knox, said more than twenty years ago ‘The spirit moveth where it listeth and is not to be reduced to the numerical terms with which alone a computer can cope’. But such hostility to numerical methods seems irrational, and often inconsistent. Biblical scholars have long noticed, and based arguments on, the occurrence of hapax legomena, or words which occur once only in a given text or author. But if one is to allow counting at all in a literary context, it seems perverse to insist that counting should stop at the number one and go no further. Since long before the invention of computers, students of literary texts have made extensive use of concordances. Concordances are often more helpful than dictionaries for determining the precise sense of a word in an author's vocabulary, and they enable favourite phrases and tricks of style to be identified and catalogued. To make a concordance of a lengthy text by hand calls for months or years of tedious labour. With the aid of a computer, concordances of many kinds can be made with comparatively little difficulty. Students of literature who used concordance packages on mainframes commonly asked the computer to produce for them a complete print-out of their chosen concordance, and then took it home to consult in the traditional manner, turning the pages of a sheaf of paper. Producing several hundred pages of hard copy with a desk-top computer and printer would be a long and tedious business. It is much more common now to use the facilities provided by a package such as micro-OCP to generate a particular concordance entry on the screen of a PC directly from the text-base whenever it is needed. Thus, if you want to study the use of the word ‘true’ in Arthur Hugh Clough, rather than generate a massive concordance containing all the words in Clough's poems, and then leafing through it to find the word ‘true’, you use the concordance package commands to generate a concordance which contains all and only the uses of ‘true’. You then consult that on the screen and print it out only if you think you are going to want to look up the same word again. Concordances produced by computer may differ from traditional hand-made concordances in several ways. One is that they will be much more complete: they will contain all the tiny function words which were too frequent, and regarded as too unimportant, to figure in a work like Cruden's Concordance to the Scriptures. More interestingly, the items which provide the focus to the concordance need not be dictionary headings or even vocabulary words at all. A particular grammatical feature, rather than a particular lexical item, may provide the focus of the concordance; thus, you may look up, in a Virgil concordance, not the occurrences of ‘bellum’, but the occurrences of the second declension neuter singular nominative noun. Concordances of this kind to the New Testament have been produced on the basis of the Analytical New Testament compiled by Barbara and Timothy Friberg (Baker Books, 1981). What is the literary scholar to do with all the information to be found in the concordances and word-lists generated by the new technology? Much of the material will no doubt be exploited in all kinds of traditional ways, for the study of meaning, style, and language history. But the computer also facilitates one particular type of study of texts: the study of their quantifiable features by statistical methods. The statistical study of style is a discipline which is still in its infancy, but has recently been showing signs of vigorous growth. It is often called ‘stylometry’. Stylometric studies may be undertaken for many different reasons. One may wish to study the statistics of word usage or word order with a view to understanding a text better, to catch nuances of meaning and perhaps to render them into a different language. Or one may be interested in the history of the development of a language, and study the speech habits of particular authors as an indication of linguistic change. Or one may hope to use the quantifiable features of a text as an indication of the authorship of a text when this is in question. Authorship attribution studies of this kind have caught the public eye rather more than other types of stylometric inquiry. It is sometimes claimed that stylometry enables the scholar to identify the fingerprint of an author, a stylistic criterion, or set of criteria, which can be used to determine with certainty questions of disputed authorship. Such claims seem exaggerated, on the basis of the evidence presented hitherto; but there is no doubt that stylometry can offer valuable evidence of a novel kind which, taken in conjunction with more traditional evidence, can often throw new light on ancient problems. The study of hapax legomena formed the basis of one of the earliest sophisticated statistical studies of the Bible, that of K. Grayston and G. Herdan in 1960, who, building on work of P.N. Harrison in the nineteen twenties, argued that the Pastoral Epistles could not be the authentic work of the Apostle Paul. Probably the best known stylometric work on the New Testament is that of A.Q. Morton. Morton, in collaboration with others, has argued, from 1966 to the present time, that in the Pauline corpus only Romans, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and Galatians form a homogeneous group which can be attributed to a single hand. Morton's arguments were based on a study of sentence lengths, on the frequencies of common words, and on other grammatical features such as the proportion of different parts of speech. My own investigations into the NT, based on the full data provided by the Friberg Analytical NT, came to much less dramatic conclusions than Morton. I addressed first two ancient problems: the relationship between Luke and Acts (I found that Acts resembled Luke more than it resembled any other book of the NT) and the relationship between the Apocalypse and the Gospel of St John (I found that they differed from each other more than any other two books of the NT). On the more difficult topic of the Pauline corpus I concluded that the evidence was equally compatible with a widely differing set of authors or a single unusually versatile author, but that it did not support the view that four epistles stood out as uniform by comparison with all others. The use of stylometry in authorship attribution studies depends on the hypothesis that there are quantifiable features of style which are characteristic of particular authors. Ideally, a stylometric test of authorship should be a feature which is characteristic of all the known works of a particular author and which is unique to his works. Features which are to be found in all, and only, the works of a particular author turn out to be frustratingly difficult to come by. Authorship attribution problems are easier to deal with when they can be cast into the following form: in respect of the measured features, does the doubtful work resemble the work of candidate author A more than it resembles the work of candidate author B? A classic example of this kind of study was the work of the Harvard statisticians Frederick Mosteller and David Wallace on the Federalist Papers. These papers were a series of articles published in 1787 and 1788 to persuade the citizens of New York to ratify the U.S. Constitution; most of the papers were known to have been written by Hamilton or by Madison, but the authorship of twelve of them was disputed. By comparing the rate of occurrence of particular words in the disputed papers with the rates in known Hamilton papers, and rates in known Madison papers, the authors were able to establish beyond reasonable doubt that Madison wrote the disputed papers. A partly similar problem is presented by the Aristotelian corpus, which contains two ethical treatises of parallel structure, the Nicomachean Ethics and the Eudemian Ethics. The problem here is not one of authorship attribution, since most scholars regard them both as genuinely Aristotelian; the puzzle is that three books make a double appearance in the manuscript tradition, once as books five, six and seven of the Nicomachean Ethics, once as books four, five and six of the Eudemian Ethics. In 1978 I published a study (The Aristotelian Ethics) in which I argued, on the basis of twenty-four independent tests based on 60% of the word usage in the text, that the disputed books resembled the Eudemian context rather than the Nicomachean one. Similar problems have been studied by similar methods in the very different context of the law-courts. It is sometimes a question whether a particular confession is the unaided work of an accused or is a fabrication of a police officer. A.Q. Morton, in his book Literary Detection records how stylometric evidence was admitted in such a case in 1974. The Californian court trying Patricia Hearst for bank robbery was asked to hear stylometric evidence to help determine whether she composed the propaganda for the Symbionese Liberation Army which was part of the case against her. The trial judge refused the evidence on the grounds of ‘the relative infancy of this area of scientific endeavour’. But anyone working in this field will receive from time to time invitations to offer evidence as an expert witness in such cases. In recent years many authorship attribution problems, in a variety of languages, have been tackled, with varying degrees of success, by stylometric methods. Thus Thomas Merriam has used these methods to try to show that Sir Thomas More is the genuine work of Shakespeare, and it was partly on stylometric grounds that the poem ‘Shall I die?’ won its place in the Oxford Shakespeare. Y. Radday has used Hebrew stylometry to address the problem of the unity of Isaiah and to argue against the standard critical theory which sees the book of Genesis as woven from three disparate strands of tradition. In spite of the proliferation of stylometric authorship studies, it would be wrong to think that attribution is the only goal for statistical studies of style. One of the most interesting recent works is J.F. Burrows' Computation into Criticism. This is a study of Jane Austen's novels based on common prepositions, conjunctions, pronouns and the like. ‘It is a truth not generally acknowledged’ Burrows points out ‘that in most discussions of works of English fiction, we proceed as if a third of our material were not really there.’ Burrows shows how Jane Austen makes skilful use of the common words to build up different idiolects for the different persons in the novels to bring out the differences in their characters. Admiral Croft, for instance, uses ‘we’ and its cases more than ten times as frequently as Lady Catherine de Burgh. It is by tiny touches such as these — though only a stylometrist would consciously notice them — that Jane Austen builds up the picture of one character's clubbability, and the other's insolence of rank. Computer-assisted studies of style have often attempted to settle questions of chronology in the work of authors whose works are undated. Leonard Brandwood has worked for many decades on the chronology of Plato's dialogues. One of the most recent contributions to this debate has been that of Gerland Ledger, in his book Recounting Plato. Ledger took the simplest possible feature of language — the occurrence of particular letters of the alphabet — and by subjecting this to a complicated multivariate analysis he came closer than many previous workers to identifying particular authors and even works. He drew new conclusions about the authenticity of the dubious dialogues, and the chronology of the entire corpus. In the study of literature, quantitative methods can never achieve the primacy which they enjoy in the experimental sciences and in many branches of social studies. But scholars who use them with a sober sense of their limitations can add a new dimension to literary studies, and in an age of divided cultures we should surely be ready to welcome a marriage of literacy and numeracy. However, of the studies I have mentioned it would be difficult to claim that more than a handful fulfilled the criteria I mentioned earlier: both (a) respected as an original scholarly contribution within its own discipline and (b) could clearly not have been done without a computer. Indeed throughout humanities disciplines, after thirty-odd years of this kind of research, there are embarrassingly few books and articles which can be confidently pointed out as passing both tests. This has meant that many enthusiasts for computing in the humanities have an uncomfortable sense of crisis, a feeling of promise unfulfilled. Gone is the glad confident morning in which Ladurie could say ‘L'historien de demain sera programmeur ou il ne sera plus’. The feeling of disillusion is indeed partly the result of the misplaced optimism and exaggerated claims of some of the pioneers: the belief was sometimes encouraged in the past that feeding data into a computer would automatically solve a scholar's problems. Rare has been the computer project which did not, in the course of execution, bring to light an initial overestimation of the technical possibilities, and an underestimation of the problems of data preparation. The proliferation of personal computers in the last decade has often, embarrassingly, gone with an actual diminution in methodological sophistication. If the fruits of computing in the humanities are less abundant than one might have hoped, there are also disadvantages of the introduction of computers which are becoming all too obvious. Let me mention six, which I will call: redundancy of people, redundancy of effort, diversion of effort, diversion of funding, distortion of research and transfer of population. 1) Redundancy of people. Alexander Cruden spent the best years of his life preparing his concordance to the Bible. There is no longer any need for dedicated Crudens to make concordances. Classical scholars among us will all, as students, have stood in awe of our seniors who, given a rare Greek word, could pluck out of their memories the ten contexts in different classical authors in which it was used. Nowadays any student can discover that information in moments with the aid of IBYCUS. It is no longer possible to found a reputation for scholarship on being good at spotting allusions. This problem is the humanistic analogue of the problem of the stoker on the electric train. It is not a serious one for the discipline, nor even in human terms does it compare with the undesirable side-effects of technological innovations in practical life and scientific research. 2) Redundancy of effort. Scholars who are good at knowing where to look for the sources of their subject matter may not be good at knowing where to look for suitable software. The replacement of mainframe use by desktop computing in recent years means that scholars working alone do not have as much contact with computer-learned people as they used to do. This means they are less in touch with software developments. Hence, if they get interested in designing their own software, scholars may spend their time reinventing last year's wheel. 3) Diversion of effort. Even if the software designed is genuinely original and useful, there is a danger that scholars become hooked on the production of software. There is a risk that a scholar whose talents and academic position call for historical and critical work will spend most of his or her working time as a programmer. 4) Diversion of funding. Because there is pressure on departments in humanistic subjects to appear up to date and efficient, it is much easier to persuade funding bodies to give money for computers and software than to buy manuscripts, rare books, or second and third copies of frequently used library texts. After a few years a department may be left with serious gaps in its library and a load of superannuated computing equipment. 5) Distortion of research. There is a danger that projects may be undertaken not because they are likely to lead to academically interesting results, but simply because they are susceptible to computerisation. Scholars feel the need to show they have used the latest technology, even if electronic methods are not the appropriate one. But in the words of Manfred Thaller it is important for humanists to adapt the software to the scholarship, not the scholarship to the software. 6) Transfer of populations. Professor Connor, in a fascinating paper on computers in classical studies, claims that computers came just at the wrong time, at a time when scholar's interests were moving from textual studies to critical theory, women's studies and the like. He says: ‘Computer technology became available precisely at the wrong moment in the profession's development. The era of traditional lexical and textual studies had largely passed… The energy of North American classicists, by and large, has concentrated on interpretive questions and on the writing of essays and monographs of social themes, cultural history and literary criticism… The questions posed by Feminist, Marxist, Structuralist and Post-Structuralist criticism have not lent themselves to computer-based responses.’ Is this just a malign coincidence? One may well speculate on possible causes for the phenomenon. One does not need to draw exaggerated conclusions from the differences between the left and right hand sides of the brain in order to accept that humanists and scientists may be different kinds of people. Those whose gifts and tastes lie in a certain direction — people who do not have a head for mathematics — may well have been influenced by this in an early career choice. To their dismay they see quantification invading their own subject: they might as well have become physicists or engineers if English literature, Greek history and even New Testament theology now offer no escape from those wretched numbers. So now the more abstract, intuitive, and ideological branches of the humanities become more attractive. The number of practitioners in these areas grows — largely, no doubt, through the genuine fascination of their subjects, but swollen perhaps with an influx of refugees from the relentless advance of technological rigour. There are still, thank God, a few areas where one can work without either having to use computers or feeling guilty because one does not. If this is a correct analysis of the situation, the consequences for our disciplines may be far-reaching in unexpected ways which are only just beginning to be noticed. I would like to end by asking what lessons can be drawn from the successes and the disappointments of recent decades. No doubt there are many, but I would like to single out just three. The first is that it is important never to lose sight of the fact that a computer is an assistant to, not a substitute for, a human researcher. Neglect of this obvious truth led to computer programs (say, for language analysis) being regarded as failures if they could not record 100% success. More recently, we have learnt to become grateful for robust programs which will do 95% of the work and leave the human being to make the decisive intervention in the other 5% of cases. A second lesson is that even when the computerization of a research project fails because of the intractability of a particular set of data, it can be an intellectually instructive task to try, and fail, to prepare the data in a formalized manner. And the successful formalization of data can open up questions for research, and types of evidence, which would not have occurred to the research community without the effort to present the data in computer-friendly form. The third lesson is that it will not be possible for humanists to take full stock of what the computer has to offer to their disciplines until the study of statistics becomes a normal and inescapable part of the training of those who plan an academic career in the humanities. This needs to be recognized not only at university level (as in France, where now a course of statistics is an essential part of the training of an academic historian) but also in any high school which has an interest in sending on students to do university work in the humanities. There is still a great lack, in every language, of good textbooks designed to teach statistics outside the context of the natural and social sciences. Apart from strictly academic consideration, the ordinary citizen of any modern democracy will find an elementary course in statistics of more general educational value than courses in e.g. differential calculus, which are more popular in science-oriented schools. One of the unquestionable advantages of the growing use of computers by humanists is that it has done something to bridge the divide between two cultures — scientific and humanist — which many writers have lamented as threatening to fragment the community of scholars and the republic of learning. A by-product of the computer revolution has been an increased understanding by scientists and humanists of each others' methods and preoccupations. Surprisingly, in the last decades is that literary studies, perhaps especially classical studies, which may seem to be at the other extreme of the academic spectrum from the sciences, have shown themselves more self confident in the use of computers than history has done, even though history is closer to the social sciences which have for long been acclimatized to quantification and computerization. On the other hand, the flight in some literature departments from traditional methods of study, with their emphasis on the detailed analysis of texts, towards theory-laden forms of criticism with an explicit political agenda, is a development which is not favourable to the search for objectively quantifiable features capable of computerized study. What will the next decades hold? Will it be seen, with hindsight, that the introduction of the computer into the humanities disciplines has made no more substantial change in the eventual output of research than was made by the introduction of the electric typewriter? Or will there be a flowering of research papers, neither pedestrian nor spectacular, containing solid and original results obtained by techniques for which the computer is indispensable? It is hard to make a confident prediction. But the testing time has now arrived; because for the first time posts of leadership in humanities departments are being taken up by a generation of scholars who have been familiar with the computer from their earliest schooldays, scholars who are neither frightened by, nor over-respectful of, the new powers which the computer has brought.

ACA ACA-FEF-001 0.19 "1. Maxwell's equations One of the chief peculiarities of this treatise is the doctrine which asserts, that the true electric current on which the electromagnetic phenomena depend, is not the same thing as the current of conduction, but that the time variation of the electric displacement must be taken into account in estimating the total movement of electricity. JAMES CLARK MAXWELL A treatise on electricity and magnetism Oxford 1873 ALL the problems we shall be concerned with may be solved by calling upon one or more of the following equations: . Where do the above equations come from? They are contained (though not quite in the same form and not in the same system of units) in Chapter IX of Maxwell's Treatise on electricity and magnetism published in 1873. Are we to conclude that electromagnetic theory has made no advance in the course of a century? That conclusion would essentially be correct. Our technique of solving the above equations has improved, and of course we are in a much better position now to evaluate the material constants, but fundamentally electromagnetic theory stands now as it stood a century ago. As far as the interrelationship of electromagnetic quantities is concerned Maxwell knew as much as we do today. He did not actually suggest communication between continents with the aid of geostationary satellites, but if he was taken now to a satellite ground-station he would not be numbed with astonishment. If we would give him half an hour to get over the shock of his resurrection he would quietly sit down with a piece of paper (the back of a bigger envelope, I suppose) and would work out the relevant design formulae. The lack of advance on our part should not be attributed to the idleness of a century, much rather to the genius of Maxwell. The moment he conceived the idea of the displacement current, a new era started in the history of mankind. Events of similar importance did not occur often. Newton's Principia and Einstein's first paper on relativity would qualify, and perhaps two or three more learned papers, but that's about all. If we assume that our kind of beings will still be around a few millennia hence, I feel certain that the nineteenth century will mainly be remembered as the century when Maxwell formulated his equations. What was so extraordinary about Maxwell's contribution? It was the first (and may be the best) example of reaching a synthesis on the basis of experimental evidence, mathematical intuition, and prophetic insight. The term  (1.1) had no experimental basis at the time. By adding this new term to the known equations he managed to describe all macroscopic electromagnetic phenomena. And when relativity came, Newton's equations were found wanting but not Maxwell's; they needed no relativistic correction. I could go on for a long time in praise of Maxwell. Unfortunately we have little time for digressions however entertaining they might be. But before we get down to the equations I must say a few words in defence of the approach I choose. I know it must be hard for anyone to accept a set of equations without going through the usual routine of presenting the relevant experimental justifications. It might seem a little unreasonable at first sight but believe me this is a possible approach, and under the circumstances it may very well be the best approach. You are already familiar with the mathematical operations curl, div, and grad (I prefer using them in vector-operator form), and you need no introduction to the concepts of electricity. You have heard about electric charge, current, magnetic field, etc. All the eqns (1.1) -(1.7) do is go give a number of relationships between these quantities. So if some of them are known, you can use the equations to work out some of the others. The notation is fairly standard but still I should better say what is what: H, magnetic field strength; E, electric field strength; D, electric flux density; B, magnetic flux density; J, current density; p, charge density; F, force, q, charge; v, velocity of moving charge; u, permeability; e, permittivity. The  two latter quantities are constants depending on the material under study. Using the subscript zero to denote their values in free space, they come to . The rest of the course will be concerned with the various solutions of eqns (1.1) -(1.7). Isn't this boring for an engineer? Shouldn't this be done by mathematicians or by computer programmers? Not for the time being. Perhaps one day computers will be big enough and numerical analysts clever enough so that the engineer will only have to pose the problem, but not yet, and not, I think, for some time to come. In the large majority of cases a straightforward mathematical solution is just out of the question. So one has to use that delicate substance known as physical intuition. How can one acquire physical intuition? There is no easy way. One has to start with a simple physical configuration, solve the corresponding mathematical problem, then solve a similar problem and then another problem, and then a little more difficult problem, and soon. The first breakthrough comes when one can predict a solution without actually doing the mathematics. In order to have a unified view of the subject we have started with Maxwell's equations. It means a new approach but not a radical departure. The subject is still the same. You will be able to see that the laws you love and cherish (Coulomb's, Biot-Savart's, Snell's, etc.) all follow from our eqns (1.1) -(1.7). The order of discussion will follow the traditional one: electrostatics first, followed by steady currents, then we shall move on to slowly varying phenomena, and reach finally the most interesting part, fast-varying phenomena, exhibiting the full beauty of Maxwell's wonderful equations."
ACA ACA-A6U-001 1.6 "BEING DRAWN TO AN IMAGE Guy Brett Why do certain images matter to one, and why is the desire to answer this question as involuntary as the response itself? Why does it seem important that the answer should have some ‘objective’ quality about it, an insight into history, society, knowledge, rather than point to a merely personal obsession? The American film-maker Maya Deren says somewhere that ‘response should always precede analysis’, a remark which sounds as if it was made as an artist's challenge to academic dryness and formalism. But is not the response and the analysis actually part of the same phenomenon, whether it results in an exclamation (‘how beautiful! ') or a new ‘reading’? The recourse to books, documents, or sources, underscores a perception which is somehow already in the air. The effort to recapture art's ‘history’ is always entangled with the desire to remake its identity and meaning as part of contemporary struggles. This article comes out of the familiar experience of being drawn to a particular image, or set of images, without at first knowing why, and the attempt to account for this feeling. Looking intermittently at the so-called colonial art of Latin America in churches, museums, private collections and books, I became magnetised by the figures of angels. They are extraordinarily resplendent. They have a material splendour in their dress. The spiritual (or is it the psychic?) intensity of their presence goes together with a marvellous air of freedom and delicacy. They have a tendency to expand, to fill the picture space. If the angel is already a hybrid (a human with wings), the Latin American angels seem to incorporate further incongruities into this composite of the human and the supernatural which hints at further, latent meanings. I knew that these paintings were produced for the Spanish in the decades after their conquest of Latin America, and represented the christianising of the old centres of Inca culture, in Peru and Bolivia especially. I knew that in the main they were painted by Indian and mestizo artists at the command of the Europeans. It lodged in my mind to try and answer the question as to whether there was something special about the depiction of angels in post-conquest art, and if so, what it could be. I didn't make a systematic study but I occasionally followed up clues if I came across references in books and catalogues. I soon learned that the theme of angels was one of the most popular in the paintings produced by indigenous artists for the complex iconographic programmes of the churches and missions established by the Spanish after the conquest. This word ‘popular’ is of course problematic and will be returned to a little later. All colonial painting began in a process of copying. Indian artists were obliged, or forced, to abandon their own forms of representation and learn the European way. But after a period of sheer copying, some themes took off. Some developed differently in the American context. Why did angels especially flourish? As I investigated further, it seemed to become clear that if this question could be answered it could only be in a complex way. These paintings, in other words, could only be read as the site of a complex play of forces. They were not simply transcriptions of the power of the conquerors and the coercive force with which they attempted to annihilate the existing culture and beliefs of the Indians and impose Christianity. Nor, obviously, were they a simple expression of Indian resistance to this assault. In some way they were both these things at once. The more I looked into it the more the paintings seemed to go beyond simple unitary ideas of authorship and meaning. The Peruvian art historian Luis Enrique Tord has written: The Spanish conquest of the Inca empire had a profound impact on many aspects of Indian society, but by far the most serious blows suffered by the Andean peoples were administered by the Church. The efforts of priests and missionaries to eradicate the Indians' ancestral beliefs produced profound emotional disturbances as well as great changes in their conception of the world. To enforce conformity to the new orthodoxy, the Spaniards instituted ecclesiastical visitas , or inspections intended to extirpate the idolatory that persisted long after the conquest. In the sphere of art the range of subjects and genres permitted by the church was extremely narrow, only in fact religious paintings and portraits. At that time after the conquest there was effectively no ‘thought’(recorded discourse) outside the religious framework and institutions. The first university in Peru, for example, was founded by the Dominicans. Painting was from the beginning one of the most important instruments of conquest in the sphere of thinking, the mind. In the earliest years of their missionary efforts Dr Tord writes: the friars discovered that the Indians were deeply impressed by sacred images created with the newest artistic techniques brought from the Old World… Those images were first seen in the catechisms, Bibles, books of hours, and hymnals used to convert the Indians and direct their worship. ‘The Archangel Raphael’, by a follower of Luis de Riano, Cuzco School c. 1640. Oil on canvas, 65″ x 42″. Convento de San Francisco, La Paz. The Jesuits brought over their leading painter in Europe in the late sixteenth century, the Italian Bernardo Bitti, to live and work in Cuzco. A school of painting grew up in Cuzco which became the leading centre of the production of paintings south of Mexico and exported paintings and painters to many other parts of the continent including remote areas. Leopoldo Castedo, the Spanish-Chilean art historian writes: Of forty-seven painters documented in Cuzco during the period, thirty-five were Indians, seven criollos or mestizos, four Spaniards, and one Italian. This list does not include the great number of Indians who remained anonymous…. The similes usually used to describe the stylistic hybrid produced over the years by the Cuzco painters — the ‘melding’, or ‘blending’, or the ‘intricate amalgamation’ of European and indigenous traditions to produce an art of ‘Byzantine richness and splendour’— obviously belies the violence of events. These phrases do, however, have the ring of truth in an aesthetic sense — or rather there was an aesthetic process involved which had to some extent its own story. This was manifested not only in the precise, artistic and critical response by Indian peoples to European paintings, but also in connoisseurship within the colonising ranks. A blossoming of the arts followed the rebuilding of Cuzco after the catastrophic earthquake of 1650, partly due to the arrival of Bishop Manuel de Mollinedo y Angulo. His collection included two El Grecos, and other outstanding Spanish pictures, and he sponsored Indian painters like Diego Quispe Tito, as well as sculptors, architects and jewellers. Sometimes the coercion and oppression is felt directly in the paintings: for example, in images of Saint Isidore, a rather obscure Spanish saint vastly amplified in the New World as the patron of labourers, who is shown to carry a small bag of coca leaves as the Indian peasants and miners did, and do, to chew to combat hunger and fatigue. Castedo points this out. He also shows that images of Santiago (St James) staying the moors were often changed to Santiago slaying the Indians . Indian painters would in this case be painting an image showing the Church's and the State's warning to Indians who contemplated rebellion, as many did. And occasionally, as, for example, during or around the time of the rebellion led by Tupac Amaru II in 1780, an image would appear of explicit resistance to colonialism. In the somewhat unlikely context of the Pelican History of Art (the relevant volume is Art and Architecture in Spain and Portugal and their American Dominions 1500–1800 ), an anonymous painting is described which shows America: nursing Spanish noble boys. Negroes and mestizos are pressing around her throne, while nude Indian children weep abandoned. Two richly dressed Indian couples present their gifts in a beautiful park crowded with different animals. The legend says: Where in the world has one seen what one sees here… Her own sons lie groaning and she suckles strangers. The images of angels are much more ambiguous and capable of different interpretations (this could, of course, be said of the angel theme generally as it recurs in the history of art, and in various guises across different cultures). It is not hard to find documentary evidence for the Church's deliberate use of the angel theme as an instrument of conversion. The Bolivian art historian Teresa Gisbert writes that the Councils of Lima, which were responsible for questions of orthodoxy in the Viceroyalty: ‘sought to attract Indians to the new faith by the use of images which would be especially appealing to them.' Why were angels appealing to them? In the Pelican History, Martin Soria tentatively puts forward the theory that angels were popular because ‘they replaced similar messengers in pre-conquest beliefs’. Teresa Gisbert produces evidence to show that Diego Quispe Tito's series of paintings of the zodiac for the Cathedral of Cuzco was commissioned in order to counteract the traditional indigenous worship of the stars and were intended to aid in Christianising the Indians of the Andes. And she suggests that the angels, especially the series of angels, could have a similar purpose, to ‘replace worship of celestial phenomena with the theologically acceptable cult of the angels’. So apparently they were ‘popular’, for different reasons, with both Christian and native American, with oppressor and oppressed. It is as if you could read in them simultaneously transcriptions of inducement, threat, coercion, protection, solace, yearning and resistance. Does this explain their complex expressivity? For the same quality can be interpreted differently according to one's point of view, one's experience, and one's feelings. Protection can mean Defence of the Faith, i.e. of Christianity, or it can mean the adoption and identification of a ‘guardian spirit’, who will watch over your life-journey, a universal, but at the same time very individual and personal desire, expressed in most religions and cultures. Looking at the angel's image you can dream, ask for what you want. The angel, with its brilliantly opulent but light clothing, its mobility, its freedom from hierarchical placing in the pictorial composition, and its bisexuality, is an intimate image of enablement. Among the images of angels is a genre apparently unique to South America, even to the Andes, the Angels with Guns. This was also a very popular subject (one church inventory for 1748, for example, lists 36 pictures of armed angels). Julia P. Herzberg, who calls these pictures ‘representations of winged  beings at once military, aristocratic and religious, gives this explanation of their raison d'être: Paintings of angels with guns appeared at a time when the religious orders were confronted with the stubborn persistence of pre-conquest religion amongst their Indian charges. Immense problems remained not merely in the campaign to destroy Indian idols, but in teaching and reinforcing the principles of the new faith. Sermons and catechisms were of course the primary means of conversion, but images of angels with guns were useful symbols of important teachings of the church. The Spaniards conquered the Incas with both the Cross and the arquebus. The key to understanding the religious function of these images is found in the gun motif. Firearms, unknown to the Indians at the time of the conquest, seemed a frightening manifestation of the supernatural, for they ‘fled out of fear when there was a blare of trumpets, the roar of arquebuses and artillery’. The firearm in an angel's hands must have had a powerful impact on Indian converts. But since guns were also used defensively, the images functioned symbolically as reminders of the protection offered to those who embraced Christianity. The image of the angel with a gun served a secular as well as a religious function by emphasising the lesson that the Church and the Spanish colonial régime were united in their goal to christianize the Indians. The military aspect of the crusade is subliminally suggested by the gentle figure who handles his firing weapon in varied positions which recall those of a fighting force. In speaking about the angels' clothing, Herzberg continues: Far more important than the military aspects of the angel's costumes are the explicit references to the high social status of both Spanish colonial gentlemen and Inca royalty. Richly brocaded fabrics, ribbons, and lace characterize the opulent viceregal dress of the 17th century. The gentlemen-aristocratic nature of angels with guns is defined by their elegant dress, which relates them directly to the ruling viceregal aristocracy. A key phrase here seems to me to be ‘gentle figure who handles his firing weapon’. Although the technical military details of loading and handling the gun and so on, of the angel paintings, is very precise — taken in fact from a Flemish military manual of 1607 — the ‘common soldier’ of the image in the manual is not retained: he becomes the gorgeous aristocrat. The non-aggressive angel-like  pose, is of course extremely seductive, which makes the threat of force oblique, only implied, as if a beautiful face was being laid over the ugly face of violent coercion. Are these pictures simply transcriptions of power, in which the hard approach is mixed with the soft, and the Church is allied with the State (and in this case hinting as well, not just at the foreigner's domination of the native inhabitants but also at class conflict within colonial society, since the angel is a mélange of Spanish and Inca aristocracies)? Perhaps. But again they seem to me more enigmatic, more multiple — images full of aesthetic tensions. Can one again make a conflation between domination and rebellion in the image, an expression of both the Church/State and the Indian wishes? Leopoldo Castedo writes: The prestige of the armed archangel was and is still very great. In mestizo architectural decoration of the 18th century, the archangel brandishing the flaming sword had a prominent place (particularly fine examples are in the Cathedral of Puno and San Lorenzo, in Potosi); and in the traditional diablada boliviana (Bolivian devil play), a religious drama, the Archangel Michael defeats […]the Devil of the Seven Masks. In 1950, in a curious or consistent coincidence (as Castedo Pointedly calls it $, Pope Pius XII declared the Archangel Michael patron of police — a decision that may well diminish the archangel's prestige in Latin America. ‘Archangel with Gun’, by an anonymous painter of the Cuzco School, early 18th century.

Museo Nacional de Arte, La Paz. Aside from dealing, as I have been doing, with one of the major subjects and themes of Cuzco painting, an inventory could be made of ways in which painters departed from European models, or from academic notions of excellence. There are peripheral insertions, like borders of flowers, or tropical birds which populate the background landscapes of many religious paintings. Or survivals at the level of colour: liking for flat and intense colours, local earth and vegetable dyes, which may go all the way back to the ancient textile traditions such as that of the Paracas culture in Peru. Also, intensification of the colours in the angels' wings as compared with Europe. These questions were not merely ‘academic’. Disputes among Spanish and Indian painters themselves, in some ways antecedents of all subsequent debates around ‘indigenism’, go back to the early days in Cuzco. In 1688 the Cuzco guild of painters split. The immediate reason seems to have been that Indian painters working for some of the Spanish and criollo masters complained of mistreatment. The Spanish admitted their guilt but no agreement could be reached and the two sides moved apart. The Spanish guild tightened its European rules of style. The Indian painters lost contact with European developments and, according to Teresa Gisbert, ‘sought inspiration both in the old styles and in their own tastes and traditions’, a mixture of ornamental stylisation with observation of the reality around them. Their religious pictures, she writes, ‘belong to an archaic world […$ who viewed the religious realm as something ‘different’ from mundane reality.' The argument so far has been intended to put forward the possibility that an art work or image could be official and coercive, and unofficial and subversive, all at the same time. The example I have given is by no means the only one that exists. The  same process has been documented in other situations where a people have been conquered, colonised and their cultural beliefs assaulted. Eduardo Mondlane found that African carvers in nineteenth-century and early twentieth-century Mozambique had made their own use of Christian themes imposed by priests and missionaries: When a [makonde]sculptor departs from the stereotype […$ this is nearly always because an element of doubt or defiance has been worked into it; a madonna is given a demon to hold instead of the Christ Child; a priest is represented with the feet of a wild animal, a pietà becomes a study not of sorrow but of revenge, with the mother raising a spear over the body of her dead son. Magazine advertisement, featuring a painting by Botero. Such images may startlingly demonstrate the general truth that the meaning of a work cannot simply be equated with its subject. But particularly intriguing is the phenomenon of syncretisation itself, as an artistic process, and its relationship to meaning: the process whereby something new is created that cannot simply be reduced to either side of two antagonistic forces, or returned to a former ‘purity’. A new ‘in-between’ is created. This is especially true in the context of Latin America where this kind of duality and fusion has been a feature of culture from the time of the conquest right up until today — both on the popular and the intellectual level. ‘Latin America is such a syncretic, eccentric, disjointed fusion of European, Amerindian and Afro-Caribbean culture,’ in the words of the Mexican artist Guillermo Gomez-Peña. Or, as the Chilean painter Juan Davila recently put it: ‘You take something of yourself, something of the conqueror’. In both cases these are intellectuals talking about their own work by linking it with a process continually taking place at a popular level and in everyday life. Today, the image of the angel is still alive, and still in contention; it has by no means been merely consigned to the museum. It is still a part of contemporary power struggles. On the one hand it has appeared as a focus for resistance. The militant angel appeared, for example, in wall paintings in Haiti during the shortlived popular uprising for food and democracy of 1986. The extraordinarily effective popular figure of the masked Superbarrio, who emerged spontaneously to lead the movement to demand the provision of proper housing in the aftermath of the disastrous Mexican earthquake of 1986, surely appeals to memories of the angel-enabler, along with references to Mexican popular masked wrestling heroes and perhaps to Superman. At the same time, the armed angel is continually reproduced as a figure of folklore, a naive stereotype of Latin America, typically exploited in the paintings of Fernando Botero, the highest selling Latin American artist in the world today. His shallow humour trades in, but misses the actual drama and sensibility of that hybrid fusion of the aristocratic and the popular which took place all those years ago in Cuzco.

Stone carving in a church at Potosi, Bolivia, 18th century. ‘Popular culture is not what is technically called folklore, but the popular language of permanent historical rebellion.’ This sentence, by the Brazilian film-maker Glauber Rocha, written at the turn of the 1970s, clearly identifies a form of expression with a mass of oppressed people whose experience has been continuous over at least four centuries. And Glauber also implies that the forms and images in which this experience is expressed are not fixed but open and changing. The sentence comes from an essay called Eztetyke du Rêve , an eccentric spelling of Esthétique du Rêve (‘Aesthetic of the Dream') in which, building on the idea that ‘the dream is the only right which cannot be forbidden’, Glauber Rocha described how he had come to realise the revolutionary importance of the mystical in Latin American popular culture. It was the only way of contesting that ‘bourgeois reason’ which, for him, was as much a feature of left-wing political programmes as it was of traditional colonial domination. In his 1965 article, ‘Aesthetic of Hunger’, enormously influential on Third World cinema and art, Glauber felt he had given ‘the measure of my rational understanding of poverty’. By 1971 he was saying that, as artists: We must touch, by communion, the vital point of poverty which is its mysticism. This mysticism is the only language which transcends the rational schema of oppression. The role of the angel as an intermediary between the human and the mystical world, and its elaborate beautifying as a vehicle of the dream, would seem to tie in closely with Glauber's identification of a continuing thread of psychological resistance in Latin American culture. The writer would like to express his appreciation of the art historical studies of Teresa Gisbert, Leopoldo Castedo, Julia P. Herzberg and dr Luis Enrique Tord, to which he has been deeply indebted in writing this article ."

And it was four pounds. Mm I know. The fish! I know. On its own! Well the last time I bought some then it was three pound something for me and you. Yeah. I mean I give Bruce the biggest bit you know   Admittedly you get more don't you, for four pounds. Oh admittedly. But it was four pou it's three pound something a pound Ann. Yeah. That's what I paid. Cod. Just cod. I just had just over a pound Yeah,isn't that dear? of fish and it, it was three pound something. Isn't that dear? Mm. I mean admittedly you don't get that much fish in there do you? No, cos there's a lot of batter  There's a lot of batter. round it. Mm. But that's what it cost, the fish itself, four pound. I know. It is expensive. Yeah. It used to be a cheap meal Ann. You see we moan about paying  three pound a pound for meat but you pay it for fish. Yeah. It's no different really is it? Yeah. Yeah but I mean fish we we used to consider fish Oh it was cheap. as a cheap meal weren't it? Yeah. No wonder people don't buy it and now, you know I mean the fish sales have gone down. No wonder. meat's cheaper. Mm. I mean that was cod. What did we have last time? That wasn't nothing special. Just cod, ordinary cod. Whether we had haddock or something, didn't we? Yeah. Or plaice, was it? Well it it's not that much dearer now than the Plaice I think we had didn't we? Something like that I know  Salmon's a bit salmon is Trout's the cheapest and Yeah. That's what I'm saying  That that's ever so cheap, trout isn't it? You could get a nice  It's only two pounds a That's right. You could get a nice pound of trout for Mm. two bits of trout for  might as well get  trout. Mm. Don't forget you're gonna get a lot of  if you have a whole trout you've got skin and  Oh yeah, but not that much. Not that much. You can eat the skin anyway. That's it. I like the skin. Mm I do. Only the head and the tail and the  innards Yeah. and then the rest's all edible. Yeah. Do you want erm  an apple crumble? Do you want Ann to go and whip you up an apple crumble? Not today. There's a bit of cake there. Bruce didn't have any cake. Is he alright? Yeah. Or is he a bit, still a bit  Oh I don't know. Oh. I didn't ask. Try not to talk  about it . Well he doesn't talk about it. I'm waiting for him. I told Sheila that. That was, that was li like that day wasn't it?

I don't think that, they can't put a better offer in can they? When it's sold subject to contract. Well I dunno, but I mean They can't gazump you at the last minute  cos it makes  But I mean if that goes if that goes through  if that falls through  somebody might be interested and  and somebody might erm  I dunno.

You don't need to have a medical? No. Doubt it. I think , he had to give his doctors  how long and what illnesses  Yeah but I just wondered he might need a medical. Dunno. Doubt it. You doubt it? Don't see any reason why I should not that  they've had nothing wrong  He's had no illnesses or   I've had nothing wrong with me. I don't suffer from anything. I know, I know but that's not the point. You know, they you the you might have to get in touch with. Well we give his name didn't we? I mean really anybody can say anything if you don't, if they don't look into it. No that's  I could say I've never had an illness in me life and whatever can't I? Anybody could s  That's right. Yes I think they'd have to do, they will do. Cos otherwise you could say anything couldn't you? Yeah, course you can. Course you can. You know I mean anybody could say anything. I could say no I've never had an illness. I mean it wouldn't be the truth but you, if they didn't look into it you could say it couldn't you? That's right. And no doubt some people who would try that kind of thing isn't there? Oh yeah. Yeah. If they think it spoils their chances. Although  does your, does your health  Yeah because this is a pension mortgage you see. Yes. Yeah. You might have to have a medical. But you don't think For the pension purpose, for the pension plan a medical is not needed. That is, doesn't matter. Oh well. Oh. The only thing that I might need a medical for is my thirty thousand pound life insurance. Oh. Well, that's what I mean. I mean it's the same kind of thing isn't it? That's the, I won't need, if if I just did the pension You can bump him off now you know, from the fifth of January cos you get thirty thousand quid if you bump him off. Do we? You do. Oh well I won't, if y  You're his beneficiary. If you put the glass, yeah I'll   So once he's paid the first payment by the fifth of  January . If you, if you do the bumping off  Ann if you do the bumping off  Ha  we'll share it? Yeah. We'll go fifty fifty, how about that? Yeah. Alright. You're you're you're the beneficiary of his er hi hi his f thirty thousand pound. Yeah, alright. Fair enough. You do the bumping off and I'll We'll go shares we'll have a   I'll have to  see if I can get some banana skins put on the stairs. Bahamas. How about the Baha what do you fancy the best, You you wouldn't  mother! No mother! Bahamas or or  Australia, we could go to Australia. Yeah, we could go via Bahamas couldn't we? Mother. Yeah. They go that way around. Mother. Yeah we'll go  . Cruise. Mother   What ? Can I just can I just intervene here and Via New York. You know  Can I just  we could stop off at er  at erm Yeah. at Hawaii can I just intervene here just a little bit because Shut up, we're booking our holiday. Shut up. if if  if I'm bumped off that thirty thousand pounds go off to, goes to pay the mortgage. Yeah, well then we could sell the flat. Oh well we'll flog the f flat then. So we'd still have the money. Wouldn't we? Well you'd have to sell the flat then. Oh well   Yeah but I mean we'd have a  a flat without any  any mortgage. It would be completely owned by your mum. So therefore she could do what she wanted with it. Yeah but I you you put me down as as as er next of kin  you see   You can name  he said, who do you wish to name? Yeah. And he put your name down. I mean it doesn't say  But it has to be your parents. No, it can be anybody I suppose, couldn't it? Yeah I suppose it could. I don't know what He put your, he he just put your, you down and that was it. Oh thank you very much. Oh well, definitely   So that's it. Mm. Bahamas, yes. Hawaii yes. Yeah we'll go that way round. Mm. To Australia . Visit to Australia cos we might as well have a long cruise . What, yeah yeah. Mm. Better watch your step next time you drink whisky   That's what  few things on the stairs    that's what er  that's what you used to say er er er er you should never ever be worth more dead than alive. It's dangerous . He used to tell me that! Didn't you? Yeah he used to always say that. You n don't ever get yourself erm  what do you call it? Worth more  I'm worth more dead than alive. We all are aren't we? Most people are if they've got property aren't they? Eh? Yeah. Yeah I'm worth more dead than alive. Never mind. Well I hope  I hope  you're gonna be very happy. And I hope you've done the right  Yeah, we are   Here you are. That's all I I'm hoping  I hope you  that Stuart's done the right thing. It's him that's signed it. Well why? Why shouldn't he? Well  He's done it with you, you're, he's got  he's got you with him. Yeah. Hasn't he? It's not just him Ann. Well at least he knows with this  m mortgage and that, he knows what  it's all about. It's not like one of us going in and not  Yeah. understanding and just signing papers. Yeah. At least he knows and he What you're doing. questions and he, he understands it all. Yeah. Which a lot of people would, say they go and sit down there and they say  blah blah blah sign here and  It's not fair but that is what happens. It's what happens because you don't understand all the No. terms and the things they use. You don't know what they're on about. No you don't. I mean even today he'd made a mistake on that thing and you spotted it where I wouldn't have done. Oh my god. He must be He didn't take tax relief off. Cos Stuart will get tax relief and he hadn't put that down. But Stuart noticed it straight away. I is he much cop, this bloke? I think  I mean, it's something, a pension mortgage is something that doesn't crop up  every day. No, not many peo you've got  I don't know why. They don't know how to cope with it. I don't know why it doesn't crop up because it's cheaper than an ordinary one, so why it doesn't  Because they don't want  yeah well you you'd better tell your mates at work that. Why it doesn't I don't know. I don't understand that. And not only does  Is it cheaper than an ordinary one? Well it is as mu it's  it's worked out a few pounds cheaper. It can  it can be yeah. It can   But not only that at the end he's also, as well as the house he's getting a pension as well instead of just the house. Well that's what I mean. That's what I mean. You get a pe just an ordinary pension, thing, you know  mortgage. You don't get a pension at the end of it. You're gonna get a pension as well. Well that's it. Well that's not bad. Well er I'd never heard of it. I'd never heard of it. Not only that you see  alright the mortgage rates might go up but  I mean if you're working your wages are gonna go up Stuart. Aren't they? You'll have a pay rise and and you're gonna still be paying s you know? So as the years go past  Pay an average amount of your wage, whatever. As the years go past  I mean if the wages go up as they have done, you know, regularly  your mortgage is gonna gonna gonna be smaller. Yeah that's that's what happens with people now. Yeah. People who are paying seventy eighty pound a month mortgage who've had them for years and then  Years. That's right. And the same thing will happen to you, see. And then you'll be pleased. Yeah. You've started. I mean I know it's hard to start with. Isn't it? It is difficult. But we've got all that side sorted out haven't we? It's difficult. I mean we paid eight qui , eight pound a month  Er er  and that was a hell of a lot of money. Yeah well that's it, if your wages are only eight quid a week  if you're paying a month's wa  That's right. one week of your wages out it's  We were. I remember that. Halifax Building Society. Used to, I used to have to pay it. has to come out of his bank. Every month. It'll just be took automatically  Yeah well they didn't have them in these days Ann. out of your bank, won't it? Direct debit. His money his money will be gone and we'll live on ours, mine. So I mean it's just  the same whatever isn't it? That's it. You can survive. Oh yeah we'll be alright. As I say if they took my wages into consideration they would have let us buy next door even. Yes. They would. I mean it would have been a hell of a lot of  I think  nice as this next door here. Well it would have been a hell of a lot of money. How about that one across the way? Well that's it you see. But if if I'd have, if we'd have gone joint we'd have had enough  Wouldn't you, if if if if you had Ann if you had the choice of these two  what would you rather have?"

I said I think you need a break. I think you need to go and do something else for a little while  I said cos if you keep looking over thinking you can't do it, have a break and go back to it afterwards you just get really despondent Yeah. and fed up and think you can't do it and you go blank and then you can't touch anything you  and you know it's hard.

I dunno, I think she just, probably gone down and played some records or something . She's got to do some trigs and she just doesn't fancy trying, doesn't understand enough of it to do it. And the science paper she's only got the  the kind of practice one, it's a very basic one. She's got no practice ones for the two, the other two she's got to do which are obviously going to be harder and she's got no idea, not, well she's got the guidelines but no real paper to sit and look at. Mm. This is for GCSEs isn't it? Yeah. Mm. Well you'd think they'd let her, you know have some old paper   Does she have  or not? Yes, she erm  There aren't any old papers yet though are there? Well yeah this is done in Croydon last year and the year before so yeah there would be a couple Oh right. cos this was Croydon  I'm pretty sure it  yeah because otherwise she couldn't have the basic from last year would she?

She's wanted to be a doctor for six years now she's decided One of Mandy's friends wants to be a doctor. It's the one who's had cancer and she wants to kind of, go on and study and help the people with cancer. Cos she doesn't want to be like depressing, she said er no she doesn't feel like that because she's already gone through the worst so she won't, yeah she wants to help people who've got it. Which I thought was quite nice. Mm. Nice idea. Mind you, that's what motivated my brother in M S Mm. cos he had a, he had it, had it as a  kiddy. Went through so many operations he felt he wanted to give something back to the Health Service. Well I think that's the kind of idea this girl's got. Cos, that's right we took, we took them all skating when Mandy was twelve . Yeah when she was twelve. And that's when, that week, well she already knew she had something wrong  Mm. and about two weeks after that it was diagnosed that she had cancer of the ovary. Yeah.

She's all fine now. Is she fully  full recovered? Yeah, I think so, yeah. From what I can gather. Very lucky. Mm. Yeah because  it was pushing everything. You know it was taking up so much space.

Actually her friends have gone through a lot. I mean what with that girl and cancer, and then another good friend, her father died. Then, it's quite a lot to happen, isn't it? Really makes her think. Or worry. Mm. Whose father died then? Celestian's  Oh Christ. He had, er, sickle cell, didn't he? Oh that funny version of sickle cell, wasn't very nice. Didn't know there was two versions of .

And, they diagnosed that, and said try and keep, you know, give her fluids, but it's going straight through. And they've given her something low in glucose and that you know to  kind of try and stabilize it a bit. Mhm. But she's not too good by the sounds of it. Mind you I saw her two day's ago and she looked absolutely fit as a fiddle  so I said I think it strikes quickly and Mm. You know she looks a lot more comfortable in there than Charlotte did.

So they'll be able to record the excitement that might happen tomorrow. I wonder what's gonna happen tomorrow. Mm it's been very thrilling so far hasn't it? Everybody being sick . A week in the life of. In the  . A jolly little incident in Kwiksave that you would have been amused at dear. Mhm. We wanted to get some Rice Crispies okay? And we thought  a good place to get Rice Crispies at Kwiksave cos they're cheaper than Tesco's. They were  we found the Rice Crispies  place didn't we? And there was just one sort of half opened, half scattered packet sitting there. So we looked around and there was erm  a box full of them right up high, yeah? So we thought oh well, go and get an assistant. Yeah. So it caused chaos Did it? you know trying to find an assistant cos there wasn't one walking about cos there was some at the  tills but there weren't any walking around and it was very busy, there were lots of people going through the tills. So anyway this girl eventually she said she was, it was her coffee break but she would come er in passing and sort us out. But mummy  mummy. So she came down, it was so embarrassing . Mummy. I explained about the Rice Crispies she said ah  Mummy. I think there must be some in here. There was another great big box but instead of being up high it was down below and I could easily  Mummy. have helped myself  to it . Mummy Yeah  seen it? Mummy. Well they must have been just well they must have I didn't see them  Mummy. They must have been unpacking Rice Crispies. Mummy They were a bit away from the Rice Crispie hole type of thing but  if I'd have used my eyes I would have noticed where they were. Mummy  mummy. Yes Timothy. You don't know what to say now you've you've shouted at me. Yes Tim, what were you gonna say. That's what I'm thinking. Come on. Let's hear it. Something about Rice Crispies? Something about going to the shops? Or something about going to the library? Who do you take to the library with you? No. Oh, didn't Christopher go to the library? Well he did but  we didn't sort of take Christopher. He just came. Oh. Somebody else came did they? Did you? Who did you take to the library with you? In your hand, who did you have? We took   You took teddy didn't you? Did you take a teddy? Did you? He chose   We hadn't actually heard anything about this library experience but when I asked him he wouldn't say anything. don't know what  We don't quite know what happened. to teddies. What did you do with them when you got in there? What was it called? You had a biscuit? Mm. We saw the biscuit  A picnic. a picnic! You had a picnic? A picnic for teddies? Well well. A pretend picnic? Mm. He came out with a a a biscuit covered in desiccated coconut. Which he didn't like to eat so  Cider ate it in the end. Cider the dog . You can guess what happened  he gave it to me. Yes. Mummy dropped it when she was giving it to me. And then we had to pick it up and put it near Cider and Cider ate it. Cider likes coconut. However we still don't know what happened. Did you have some stories with this teddy? Yeah. Mm. Mum Stories about teddies? I don't like feeling hot. A teddy went in the dump. A teddy went in the dump? Oh dear. Did they get him out again? Mm. Because a  Oh. He kick them home. Kick them home. No He went in a van? Mum  What about story  was a bit like that. Mm.

They've had the girl that's normally in there on a Saturday  during the week. Perhaps she's ill. What did you say? What did you say mother? I said there's normally a different lady in the  in the library. For what? On a Monday. The lady that was in there today  not Rosie the one that does the stories, she's always there  well, when she's there. The other lady, Josie, she's normally  in there. But she hasn't been there for a few weeks now so I think she might be ill. Or on holiday or something. No she can't be on holiday all that length of time. She's back now. No she wasn't today. There was a lady there but that's the lady that normally goes on a Saturday. But why didn't she go on a Saturday then? Well I suppose she does go on a Saturday as well.

I could help with maths You've got to know the syllabus though and you've got to know what, I don't know what Yeah you've got to know what you're doing It's not a case of helping because in the letters I know what, I know what I'm doing, I'm just, I'm just gone to, yeah I've got everything right, actually what I did and I couldn't give you, I haven't got a clue, trigonometry, well I couldn't tell you how to do it, I should That's why you need somebody you can ring up and say look, we did this yesterday what am I doing wrong today? Yeah. It goes out my head from one week to the next, I can't keep it, I know what I'm doing  Keep it up  at the time some sort of but again if, if somebody who knows about the G C S E actual course  you know the G C S E, did you know about yeah I did that at school  Someone must teach it somewhere. Erm, oh erm  Who? Mike  I was gonna say Mike  has had a degree in that He but he might know What you'd have to do, you know, you tell him what you need to know, he'll be able to tell you how to do it. Oh I don't even wanna do it, I just need It's good book though isn't it? books here, yeah, I just, read them, I don't know if I can do it I but it, he needs to find out what he needs to teach you through the book so you know What you need to do is to find books are they a memory thing, that will, you know, click your memory, you know how some people have an a yeah  well I know what you mean I can just remember though you know over the  No I remember  I just need something that reminds you of what you've done rather than, er  Like my I just can't remember that twenty  Well, you'll pass No you don't pass or fail you get given marks out Yeah, but I mean you only that was and I'd written down just sit down and listen, then read the question wrong write down the answer anything from What I could never do was but I could never do them being those things like well I can't do those tables  all the  and what not  at all, I've never since a child remember Well you should of been learning those I've tried, I can't for the life of me remember them  I can't remember  I've tried Can you get up to five, fives? twenty five Yeah, but can you get up to that, like get all your other tables?

Yes, really you know, because, then I, then I looked at, on the other side they er were full of cows and  and he would make it that was alright, but he was making sort of very little . That was alright . Well, you know, it's, it's not a very, was it on the road? No, never. Where? I see, well . I know, because you know, it's not very . Aha, because it's supposedly, it's not ecologically good for   I see. So, so the  aren't doing here. Well fair enough, but . I'd rather have a meal  wouldn't you? Sure you know  it's, it's a high fence but we could  try to jump in and would have done the other, the farmer came with a stick  and er he   Useful know, no  Yes, it is. . I bought it , it's a multiple  yes, yes. Never mind . I don't know, it's a very nice gathering . Yes,. I think the owner of  is Swiss. No. I wonder now, or is, I'm not sure any more, but I think she is. Why do you think so? It's an old lady. Yes, but I think she is Swiss. Is she? I'm not sure though, I'm not sure. She's a very old lady, distinguished looking. Very old lady , yes. Well have you seen her? N I have worked with her on, she is responsible for some artist to do in Belgium and I needed some information on some artist who worked, that was at the time when I was doing eh, P R campaigns for er, Sheba, the cat product, and we needed . We needed artist who were painting cats. Aha. And she had, she was responsible, I mean she was er, representative for two of the paintings in Belgium so that's why I'm . Yes, so you're painting cats? Yes. Yes. All two, all the two of them. Oh, yes.. Yes. So, look, I have to hid it from Patrick otherwise he will eat them all.. Well he has  to eat. . Have to hid it. Well then have to hid it from me too. Alright, take some, and then I hid it. . Here have some . shocking,going to take some away. Shall we need some plastic sacks? One . In the morning, all day. Nine thirty. Not all day? Three hours? Three hours. That's it. From nine thirty until half past twelve. The little  analysis and communication board. Oh my grief. How many , maybe that  simple, very simple  eh? And what is it really? What is meant by that? It is, about comparing political, sociological, economic novels. Well, what do you mean ? Great communications, great . How can you compare, how can you apply pluralism, imperialism. Oh my god, can't you really find . Which is? . or a corporate system, how can they apply to communications? I still don't know any . Okay, so,. Give me an example. Erm, alright. For example, when you talk of, imperialism, when you look at, when we, we've study it from a , erm, quite a few, so it means that  that capitalism  supply and, but the problem is, that, although it creates supply it laboured people who worked, yeah Yeah. cannot buy it because it's too expensive for them. So capitalism has to export it over its boundary and that's one of the company, what you could call it period, for example, erm I see. Let's Maybe become export, become  does it? Alright, let's see the French , mm, mm, mm, yes. Well . So for example, I don't know, erm,, let's take an example,,, the French, erm multinational,tele telecommunications Yeah. National. Do you know , you will find here, that they say . Yeah, so you better  if you have . I haven't . You don't, okay. Multinationals, they have erm,, doing much better abroad than it is doing in France. Okay, well . Because the French cannot always buy what   Alright, alright. so that's why it's only period. Well you can call it export too, but export is . That means imperialism means in a way they're the French market it's well known, and, makes itself sell at much a  than in its, in its own country, so you can say that for example Thompson has a monopoly tower, most European and  have a monopoly tower  Yes. in not only Holland but in Germany. Yes, quite. Belgium  Yes, yes. And so when you, so it means that the Dutch are leaders, so it's, it's kind of, that's how putting up the communications empire . In Holland that the empire is broader than Belgium is. Mm, mm. Broader than all over Europe. Mm. That's why it's called imperialism. Ah yes. So it becomes in fact a telecommunication empire. Yeah, it's really, it, it is the power not they're exporting. Yeah. Yeah. The power. It's more than . Yes. Logical side of, of . Yeah, yeah. Now, alright, that's imperialism yes. What, what's the other? Eh, multinational. They do a bit of imperialism. , they are easy aren't they? And then erm Brussels. I  my power at that, that place and nowhere else and nobody agreed and, well, they say we go somewhere else, and . They're a big company in Brussels , and they got, they got their office where they like . And now they're gone. Aha. Well you really . But it's nice you know Brussels. You know   So what did you do yesterday? Went there at what time? Erm what did we do yes, well we went, I, I went to Isobel at what, I found her at three, we had . We even gave her coconut to the dog which I  which was nice. I see you. No, no, yes my dog. Aha, he, he, still thinks Isobel has the dog. No I don't think so. No. No because it's another one, not the usual one. I see. So, then we went to . Yeah. I went home . On Saturday afternoon we had tea at five with erm, Andre and . Andre and . Aha . And they . And they play well? Yes. . . Some more tea? I'm fine, no. No. So you don't play ? I, I did play. Out of practice eh? Right, well I'm not . He said,to myself, you know, just by myself,. And so on. No . Yes. Can't all be. No. I suppose it's healthy enough  actually, your mother coming today, the airport? No, no. No. My brother drove me. Aha. One week in . No . Yeah. Yep, I hope it . Youngest? The youngest one. Ah gosh it's .. , because, though he is in the army, he's doing a masters degree in Brussels as well, at night, so it can be done. Can't he work a bit in the day? Is he fully occupied? Yeah. Is he really? they get him free time, so now he's had two weeks off I see. for study. Aha, yes. But he'll have to two more weeks then afterwards. No, aha,. And a , Michelle. Michelle is now in the , second  and then erm, he might go to Switzerland to study . Ah yes, what is ? The second year. Yeah, yeah, what? What? In accountant. Ah, has he . I see, yes. Are you still completely confident in, in finishing? very quickly now. Does it? But erm What about if you have to write it? That's fine, well I have to, to make a, have to write a little letter and, and, that's . And I wasn't sure of the work any more, but Yes, you mix it up . No, no. Really, no. No , it's quite a  apart. Yeah. It's much harder, I mean I simply , Swiss German, than Dutch Yeah, really? Aha. cos I practice more it. Yeah, yeah. No, I, I really. . Talking yeah. talking . . You know I still keep the Italian  you know , it's more  than French, at that time, and, well I worked in , I was, I was really quite good at it, but now, I just lost it. First of all I never hear it any more on the continent I can't seem to hear the radio, you hear some, you know,put on the radio and you have a , Brussels already , he had nothing at all. But don't you think that  Oh no  he would come back quick. I don't know anybody, aperitif, and the and all that stuff, you know, the exception. No,And I, I . Aha, aha I told myself, I had to force myself not to. I  at once, Stefan, there was an , I was  anything, just . So a lawyer came, and of course I had my own office , confidential stuff, so he wanted to give it to me. , and  in the machine or something, I had  you know, I never know, you have quite a few words which aren't any French or . one language, one  and the others have two or two . Or else, I . Yeah. And so I thought you . You have . Common . Common? Common. No it's too . As well. Yes. The French. Yes. I see, is it? Yes,. I know you're right, now it's imperative  with one  and it's with two . Yes. . That's what I mean. poor chap, he's, he's getting furious and  and there are hundreds of . Two S's you know and French you don't marks the difference, Italian you do say that you have double quotes,.. Writing I don't, I don't think she'd, she can write it there, I don't know. Italian . Yeah, and she ever uses it, why doesn't she forget it? Well I think she uses it quite often, you know, I mean  Where, where? at the office, or the Italians come, she always uses it. Well, when there are, I mean, I think, well I think it really con I mean, when I'm with the Dutch I really thought the other day I can  till David comes back again, quite quickly. Well I hear you, but . Mm. I forget it, erm, where is it . stop there for tonight, but I had  you know, I just spoke French. I just didn't open my mouth, but I understood what they said and they didn't know . You know, and so, so the second time, the second day I could say one or two words and the third a little bit more, but eh that's it. Same when I'm, when I'm in Italy, I, I can't speak Italian very well, but when I'm there a week, I pick up words very quickly and although I know my grammar isn't perfect, I can form sentences in a way that people do understand me,. Yes. Yes. I, that, for me the hardest thing to do is example is study Spanish. Yeah. Because as I heard my mother speak Italian all the time and my cousins, you really ca can in my, you know in your   Yes. Your sub conscience, yeah. You'll pick it up. Mm, mm. And I really understand Italian quite well, and eh, when I had Spanish, I, I suppose . You picked it up.. All the time I had, I had  Spanish. Did you? And when I had to speak, I spoke Italian. Did you? Well I didn't know Spanish, but I got by with the Italian, you know, I had, I had once,. don't you? Yeah, yeah. And eh, Julia and  and eh Ruth and her husband , eh went to Madrid and I stayed with Isobel. Mm, mm. , and we went to the beach and I came back and  , leap of the whole er, side of the car. You can imagine so, I , it's awful. So Yeah. I , want other people's cars in . That's very funny, for example, I went Dutch because when we were small my brother run away. Yeah. He always, well we not always  often, very often, spoke Dutch with each other. Did you? Yes, because of, we were in school together in Dutch and on the way home we were with Dutch friends, so we  then, and we mostly spoke Dutch and now, since I, so it's nearly, since now seven years have been, since I have gone to States, first year in eighty three, came back in eighty four, and since then we've never, ever spoke Dutch. Erm, yes, yeah yes. Yes I see now, ah, yeah . We always speak French to each other. Yeah,. That a make . if you spoke Dutch all the time. Oh. So Yes, with my mother and my father . All French,, yeah. when we couldn't, when, when we were not allowed to in the States. Really, I think it  But now it I remember a  on the telephone, you know, I used to speak and talk and talk, apparently she would switch to German, so that means that I can't  someone   Shouldn't allow it, I, I always knew what it meant . And, that, you make me think of it, suddenly she'd switched. For what happened she can do it because, so okay, let's hope it's going to be nice. I really pleased with, with that . Really, I really like it. Sweet, isn't it? It's very nice with the plants on. Yes, yes. Very, very nice. Now I'm, I'm really thinking all the time , something in the back thing  The grass, the garden  . Looks nice, and erm, how do you call these erm, ah . Looks nice. Yes. It's, it's already once cove covered the whole wall, but when we took the other fence down, the high fence eh, you know, they damaged everything. Erm, I'm going to lose , digging so much, it's terrible. It looks nice . Right. Come a  no you've seen that,. Yes. You know you can, you can take few of these chairs, and, these chairs and tables here,in the evening, whenever you want to read there, you can do that. Okay right, right. I've already asked. Where the keys? There we are. I'm not going to throw that away until . Put away my things. Yes."

Special collections  Who makes them They were made for special occasions Were they? For instance? They're nice aren't they? we Just for ? Yes I suppose so. unclear Yes? Not always. Sometimes they were sold in shops as a special limimited edition. Just as a  Swatch Collector's . Yes really. I mean now exactly we send out about dunno how many letters to ask if they have anything to sell. So we the whole collection since eighty three. When did it start eighty three  Eighty three Sure? Yeah. Yeah you have any   they have the whole  thousands? No not thousands but  Yeah hundreds? Yes hundreds Because the books come out then to be edited Yeah Really? That quick? Yeah Is that because they are too expensive? No How much are these? Oh! They can go very high now. About ten thou I dunno. The middle one is the is the most expensive No? That tell me low ah the no one is twenty five one is thirty seven and and hundred and seventy eight that means he threw three together. Come and see can't be forty forty five. Look. Which one is this? Twenty five and thirty seven No I no this one is the most expensive one How do you know? But how do you know? This is that one is seventy eight. Is not what  Ah hah I see. Yes this is twenty five Yes. See  and this is thirty seven. But why   they'll they'll be too late Ah it is written here. I'm sorry yes It's one thousand francs to two thousands  But it's not possible. Forty thousand and you paid I even wanted to buy that one and this one too. When when I when they were out I didn't even see it Yes I've seen it Have you seen it? Yes and I know I have one which is totally black with here the caldon Needle yes You know and supposedly it should be worth a lot. I dun't know They don't make it anymore? No I almost thought that too. And then I have the jelly fish which is the totally transparent one Mmm mm The problem it's very expensive when it doesn't say Swatch and it's all white nothing so it's just  a Swatch and so on it's probably not as much Have you seen it? Yeah I haven't seen any of them I have seen those two. This one I have never seen before. Can you imagine? Can you? In how many years? Eighty three and eighty nine Eighty nine No! No no not Three years yes  eighty nine  Yes eighty nine Hah! Two years Hah! It must have cost a lot at the start but they  But they are all the same huh? No but those  you couldn't buy like that. This was a  is an artist who made a special limited edition of them Yeah and where do you buy them? I don't know. Probably you could buy them some stores have them for maybe a week or so. They were all sold I dunno. No? There's  in Switzerland and I see But they must have cost a lot Yes? I think so As what? Well They are exactly the same size as the others I know but you know we have a serie limit edition is full up. During  Swatch watches Did he? Yes No I didn't know. Hmm hmm in Belgium they were What did they look like? They were all kind of silk covers with the  painting in the middle Huh huh and the they cost at that time the Swatch costed about one thousand three hundred thousand francs and they costed about two thousand eight hundred I think Ah huh did they? Must be they were all the same  No I have seen just bigger ones black but very  Yes those are called Which are very expensive but not forty one No And they have been very much but I though that Swatch cost that much no there are  But some types before in the beginning all Swatches were the same price  Ah huh . It's that one which just with the tiger in gold no more? No And I saw it and I thought ah I saw it in Zurich. I'll get that I like it  so it's er I didn't  That I know how but I bought it You got? At Easter time yes I bought it at Easter time Ah you've got it? And then I amd they said I think that one is worth something And you have the men? Hmm hmm And the men  the woman as  Mm mm yes Have you seen  yeah? Yes Yes? Rather nice? Yeah But and the one's  too late I like that one too and I wanted to buy it as  I've never seen do you think every country gets different ones? Yes no well some countries don't get all  all  Mm Yeah. For example well I don' know which Swatch really but on Omega up for example there are Omega watches in Belgium which you can't buy in Switzerland Can't they? which are only made for export. For example my dad's brother Omega which you couldn't find in Switzerland No? Which was only made for export. Do you think a lot of people buy watches? Yes Yes  a lot of makes then there can't be very much left. Well the market is quite large Do you think? Well I managed a collect a small  very decorative. I see forty thousand  in how many years? Two years. Two years!? Yes I cannot cost forty thousand I mean the one who bought that you know  He must laugh now. Why should we   And I would be very happy you know and things like that Do you really think it's that much money No. You would get it? I would never give that. But do you think someone will pay that? I don't I don't know. I have no idea. 'TIS nice 'tis maybe over estimated too I see yeah Ya so that if the  goes up to thirty thousand the reserve might be large enough to give it to sell it for that price. For example sometimes they overestimate certain works of art and you wonder you know during the sale you see it's estimated forty to fifty thousand so you think they'll never give it to you for less. Sometimes a  gets up to thirty and then they give it to the person Yeah it depends  Then one wonders why. It's just because or they over estimated it or it's the price you know They wanted to get  They wanted to get Yeah yeah It's  Yes well my dear look next time I have all again next time round.

DEM DEM-KE2-132 -0.15 "Yes, erm  on the other hand there are some  there are some very good comprehensive schools! Oh yes! I mean you can't, you can't erm Thank you. Thank you love. There's some very bad grammar schools! Yeah, I agree with you. You know, again as you said earlier on it all comes down in the end to the head! You see we've had some very good reports , I mean that went through a very bad patch but they've this new Doctor Colin   he's meant to be pretty switched on Mm. and erm they say, you know it's it's  turning into a very good school! So that's one possibility to look at. But  I mean a a grammar doesn't suit every child does it? Some kids  erm er , you know. No it doesn't, you see. I mean I yo , I would always say, you know if a child was borderline Mm. If there was a doubt then he would be better not going to a grammar school Mm. because he would be at the top end of the other school  That's right! That is exactly that! and then success breeds success! That's right! That's right. Erm  whereas  Right. er the same child goes to the grammar school, he's in the C stream, he's at bottom  Yeah. at the end and they perhaps don't bother quite so much  and Yeah. he, he drops back, he gets  Yeah. further and further and further behind. Yeah. Now I found that, you see, cos I passed my eleven plus and I lived in Hampshire and the grammar school was Hampshire Grammar School for Girls, which was quite a long way away from where I lived and it would have entailed a bus and the train and I  and there was only me that passed and I, I didn't wanna do it. So I went to a very good secondary school but I was in the A one stream  right the way through  and I was always within that top three of that A one stream and it gave me confidence and I really got on. And I never regretted not going. No. That's right. You know a lot of people said to me oh how stupid! To my mum, you know  she's passed, you're daft, but  there'd have been so much hassle for me to get there! Yeah. And I didn't feel confident, and I wasn't happy within  Yeah. myself and my mum said if you're not, then you don't  That's right! wanna go. That's right! And that's how I felt about  Yeah. it, I didn't  and I felt I'd have no friends around where I lived and  you know, I'd always be alienated, I'd always be home later  and I said to my mum I don't think I can cope with it, so she said right then you don't go! And I didn't. And I never regretted it, I'll be quite honest with you. And I think lots of children probably feel that way. Yeah. And  That's right! you know. But it's  Ha! nice talking to someone about education cos I talk to some people and they think I'm crackers cos I took my kid out of a state school! You know? Ya, I I, I'm only sorry that you felt you  Yeah that  had to! And I'm sorry  I am! the fact that you had to! I am! Erm but I, you know I think that's  that, that's an indictment of it you see because I  Oh it's cost us an arm and a leg! It really has! Yeah sure! An and it's  what makes me so cross as I walk past that blinking school every day and you think my kid should be over there! That's it! That's just  the way I feel   Yeah I know it's sad isn't it? Do you know what I mean? Yeah I do. I do know what you  Yeah. mean and I think it's, it's, it's a shame! It's awful really! when I speak about it I get so upset that they've got three or four and they can't ! And that's right! You see. You can't! And there, lots of people and and lots of them actually they came from Abbotsbury and  that all their kids were doing so well and then this period of a year, nothing! No progress! No ! I know! Well You know! Nice to talk to you  See you again. again. Bye bye! Bye bye!"
FIC FIC-AB9-007 -0.0899999999999999 "Over at the Department of Trade and Industry the news that Francesca would not be back before Thursday morning was being received with open dismay. Bill Westland CB, MC, the fifty-five-year-old Deputy Secretary responsible for both personnel matters and regional policy, cursed heartily. He summoned his junior, Rajiv Sengupta, a rising star of thirty-six who had the job of co-ordinating financial assistance to industry in the regions, to worry with him. He derived some comfort from Rajiv's habitual elegance; wearing a suit, shirt and tie that must have cost two months of his salary as an Assistant Under-Secretary of State, he was sitting at the other side of the large, uncompromising desk that the Department provides for its most senior officials, not a hair out of place and his black eyes alive with amusement. ‘What are we going to do with Professor Thornton tomorrow?’ Bill Westland appealed, hopelessly. ‘You and I and Henry will be with the Minister at the Select Committee all afternoon, and we'll have to be on call to brief all morning. I was depending on Francesca to look after Thornton, and give him lunch and introduce him around, since she'll be working with him.’ ‘Why is Francesca delayed?’ Rajiv asked. ‘Some problem with the New York legal system. Or she's staying to thank O'Brien personally — I really don't know.’ ‘You don't seem to have much control of your god-daughter.’ ‘None whatsoever, as well you know, Rajiv. You're no use either, and you taught her for three years at Cambridge. Never mind that: at ten o'clock tomorrow we have Professor Thornton, distinguished economist, Oxford don and friend of the Prime Minister, here for five weeks to do a study on how effective regional assistance is, and we have no one to meet him. Now what do we do?’ ‘Send him to a regional office?’ Rajiv offered. ‘Without someone from here to look after him? Heaven forbid.’ ‘Give him to the Chief Statistician?’ ‘To Gerhard ? Even if we get him to comb his hair, it'll be too much of a shock for Professor Thornton.’ ‘Oh come now, Bill, Oxford senior common rooms are full of people quite as untidy and generally as odd as Gerhard. Last ti me I dined at Balliol I sat next to the Regius Professor of Chemistry, aged around 193, who told me about his visit to Egypt before the war, probably the Boer War. His teeth didn't fit awfully well, so I couldn't be sure. Gerhard is at least intelligible.’ Bill Westland, grinned, sidetracked. ‘You know the story about Gerhard, looking as he usually does, standing on the steps of Horseguards after a Cabinet Committee, when a kindly person sidled up to him and gave him a quid to buy himself breakfast?’ ‘I have always assumed it to be apocryphal.’ ‘Not at all, dear boy, I was there . Gerhard thought it a charming example of English eccentricity and placed the  quid tenderly in the mince-stained pocket of whatever Oxfam-reject he was wearing. I suppose it's not a bad idea to get him to entertain Thornton.’ He seized the telephone, and, ruthlessly disrupting Sir Gerhard's morning, imposed a guest on him for lunch. ‘In the afternoon the good Professor Thornton can come and watch us and the Minister defending the assistance given to Willis Engineering,’ Rajiv pointed out, eyes bright with malice, and Bill Westland winced. ‘It is, of course, precisely what he ought to be seeing,’ he agreed, reluctantly. ‘As an exposé of the soft underbelly of our policy on regional assistance, Willis Engineering has no equal. I suppose so, Rajiv, I suppose so, but he is not to come to the briefing. Then what?’ ‘Well, by Wednesday I'm clear of the Committee, and I could take him to a Regional Office. If I must.’ ‘Yes, you must, but not Birmingham. After last week's announcement that its development-area status is being removed, the staff are all cowering under their desks while the population throw bricks through the windows. What about Manchester — virtually everyone there has applied for selective financial assistance? Can you keep him there overnight? Good, then Francesca can do the honours from Thursday and work for him thereafter. She's got the troops and it's right up her street, she can get on with anyone.’ ‘What age of man is he?’ ‘Mm, hang on. Fifty-two, married to an American, four children but three are steps, girls; his own boy is only eight. Fellow of Balliol, went to Harvard in his late thirties, came back five years ago. Lots and lots of long, distinguished, incomprehensible books on econometrics.’ ‘Frannie's maths was never any good,’ Rajiv warned. ‘This may be beyond her.’ ‘She'll find a way,’ her godfather said, with perfect confidence. ‘I just wish she was here now. I've got enough to worry about without Professor Thornton.’ Interesting that the offices of Yeo Davis should be very much less at the leading edge of modern design than the  solicitors' which they had just seen, McLeish thought, and murmured as much to Catherine Crane, who laughed. ‘It's like all the Italian restaurants used to be, isn't it? Lots of black and white tiles and plants and arches.’ McLeish was considering the possible relationship between design and organizational style when Peter Yeo himself came down to fetch them. ‘Nice to meet you, Chief Inspector,’ he said with automatic politeness, then considered what he had just said, decided it was beyond explanation and led them upstairs to his office. This echoed the prevailing Italian-restaurant theme, except for the large comfortable mahogany desk which featured reassuring and recognizable objects like drawers and blotters. Peter Yeo himself was an old-fashioned and recognizable object, McLeish thought, seeing him against the rapidly fading light from the window. It had been Bruce Davidson who had interviewed Yeo before, when Angela Morgan had still been officially only a Missing Person and Peter Yeo, as her employer, one of the obvious people to talk to about where she might be. He considered him as he caused coffee to be produced and established them at the big table at the other end of his room. Given a choice, you would have taken him rather than Timothy Hutton for a solicitor. With his conventional double-breasted suit, carefully cut to disguise a distinctly stocky figure, and his watchful courtesy he was in sharp contrast to Hutton's hard-edged efficiency. The difference was partly generational; this man must be ten years older than Hutton. The real distinction however, McLeish thought in a flash of revelation, lay in their clients' expectations. Yeo Davis's business was concerned with representing people who did not know the ropes, or even that there were any ropes; Hutton's predominantly with fellow professionals in other fields who just wanted the best and swiftest way through. So Peter Yeo had to look reassuring and solid and a bit older, while Timothy Hutton could probably have come to work in striped organza without losing a single client. He abandoned this line of observation and looked carefully at the man inside the suit. The impression of suppressed energy which he had received as he arrived was  intensified; Peter Yeo could barely sit still and was discharging tension by moving papers on his desk, then fiddling with the Venetian blinds to prevent the sun from shining in Catherine's eyes. The bright blue eyes looked a bit bloodshot, and there was a flush of colour across the cheekbones. Yeo rubbed the back of his neck irritably, and reached for his coffee, downing two cups while McLeish and Catherine Crane were still passing each other milk and sugar. A thick weekend, McLeish decided, trying to think how best to establish what Yeo's relationship had been with the dead girl. He started, as he had intended, from where the last interview had left off and went quickly over the ground again. ‘Last Friday, yes, ten days ago, was the last time I saw her,’ Yeo confirmed. ‘Around five o'clock — she left early because she was meeting Giles. Giles Hawick, yes. She was spending the night with him before he went off for a walking weekend in Derbyshire. She didn't want to go with him because she had too much to do, what with the wedding. As I told you, I didn't particularly take in her plans for the weekend, you know how one doesn't, one just asks to be civil and doesn't listen properly to the answer.’ He met McLeish's eye and blinked. ‘That must sound remarkably silly to a policeman. Sorry, I'm afraid I'm still baffled by all this. What on earth can have happened? I understand she was found not all that far from her parents' house? But she wasn't planning to go to her parents — I know because I rang them on Tuesday when she still hadn't turned up.’ ‘I wondered if she might have come into the office on the Saturday?’ ‘Not while I was here. I was in…oh, from about ten o'clock to well after lunch, and I wouldn't have thought she would come in late in the afternoon. I mean, it's not a bad idea, Chief Inspector. She often was in on Saturday. We own the building and all the partners have keys, so unless someone else was here she could have been in and out without anyone noticing.’ ‘I see. You left at what time?’ ‘Well, about three. I was going to have lunch with a client but it got cancelled, so I just stayed here. There's a kitchen here, we have a girl who comes in and cooks lunch during the week and there's always cheese and things around. I killed a rather good bottle of Fleurie, as I remember it. I went to the flicks — I wanted to see Some Like It Hot for about the tenth time and it was being revived at Baker Street. I knew my wife didn't want to see it at all. Then I came back here to change, before I joined my wife at a dinner party. Angie wasn't here then, either.’ ‘What about Sunday? Did you go to the office?’ ‘No, I didn't. We spent the day with friends.’ That left a large space of time on Saturday where there was little possibility of establishing that Peter Yeo had been where he said he was. But the man himself seemed to be unconcerned about this. ‘One or other of my partners is usually in the office on a Saturday. It happened that none of them were, last week. In fact it's so regular that Fiona — that's the girl who does our weekday lunches — is under instructions to leave something we can eat for Saturday lunch.’ ‘Do you tell her how many are likely to be here?’ Catherine had decided to ask a question. Yeo thought about it. ‘Depends — I mean, if I knew I had a team coming of course I'd tell her. But otherwise I just reckon there will be something around — or if the locusts have been at the fridge, well, I can always go out.’ ‘Can you remember what you ate?’ Peter Yeo considered her, as the reason for her question sank in. ‘Actually I can. I had an enormous slice of quiche that was left over from Friday. I felt afterwards it would have been better not to make such an effort to finish it all. Fiona will probably remember.’ He sounded mildly offended but not in the slightest bit rattled. ‘I think Some Like It Hot started around three-thirty but I can't quite remember. I walked down — it's not far, and I was feeling rather full of quiche.’ That will check, McLeish thought, of course it will, someone just has to do it all. That means at some stage we  may have to see Mrs Yeo. In fact, he decided, he would be interested to see a wife who accepted with such apparent equanimity her husband's absence on a Saturday. Presumably, however, the senior partner in Yeo Davis was hardly needed to do the odd household chore. Which brought him to consider the Yeo Davis partnership; how did it work? How important to it had Angela Morgan been? He decided to start as softly as possible. ‘Groups like yours are a bit outside my experience,’ he confided, ‘and I need to understand a bit about what Miss Morgan did for a living. Could you tell me, perhaps with an example?’ He observed from the way peter Yeo gathered himself and sat up straight that he was on familiar territory, and understood further that the general patter was well rehearsed. It was, for obvious reasons, a great deal less incisive than Francesca's summary, but the same skeleton was recognizable under the attractive padding placed round it by Peter Yeo. Much emphasis was put on the importance of identifying the key decision-takers and making sure that they had the right information — much was made of the necessity of their getting a balanced picture on which to take their decisions. ‘Ours is not unlike the job of a good barrister,’ Peter Yeo observed, reaching a peroration. ‘We try to make sure the judge has all the facts before arriving at a decision. Mostly we do this by ensuring that our client gets to talk to the decision-takers. There is no point at all in my talking to those people, except on a preliminary basis; they're not that interested in my views. I do the background briefing but the clients have to do most of the work, and so I always tell them.’ McLeish decided this was good stuff from which, but for Francesca, he would have gained no clear idea of what a firm like Yeo's was really for. ‘So you would, for instance, have lunch with people in government departments to talk to them about particular policies.’ ‘Yes, often that is the best way to start. We've got a lot of friends whom we can talk to about a policy generally, and where we can put a word in. Let me try and think of an example that isn't confidential. Yes. One of our clients is Andy Barton, who runs the biggest textile group in the north-west. Well, the DTI is at this moment considering giving money to keep Huerter, one of his main rivals, going. A Conservative government, if you believe their manifesto, ought not even to be considering putting money into dying private-sector firms, but Huerter employ a lot of people, many of whom voted for this government. One of the last things Angela did was to have lunch with an old schoolfriend in the DTI who is responsible for the Huerter case, to make sure the DTI understood the impact of such assistance on Barton's operations.’ ‘And did it?’ McLeish asked. ‘Oh yes, but Angela was clear that the civil servants were going nonetheless to recommend assisting Huerter. They've been rescuing companies for so long they do it automatically now, I expect. So that told us that we had better get a full-scale defence working immediately.’ McLeish, who had understood from Francesca's report of her lunch that she and her seniors were indeed going to push for assistance, was amused to hear that she had not succeeded in disguising her intentions from Miss Morgan. ‘Can you tell me what you are going to advise your client now? I mean, what is a full-scale defence?’ ‘Ah, well it varies. I've got Andy Barton in to see the Minister responsible at the DTI. I'm keeping the Secretary of State — that's the top man — in reserve. And, of course, we are arranging to brief Treasury people, who will automatically be opposed to giving away public money; and we are working with the company on a memorandum on what assistance to Huerter would do to Barton, with a two-page bullet-point summary. Politicians don't have time to read screeds, so you have to give them short, pithy things to look at, We were doing all this anyway, of course, but the chaps at Barton, including Andy, are working on it much more effectively since we were able to say definitely that the DTI civil servants were agin them. These chaps, good blokes who've spent all their lives running businesses, believed the government manifesto and thought that if  they shouted loud enough in the local paper, Whitehall would crumble and right would prevail. It's a bit more difficult than that.’ That lunch had, in fact, given a considerable spur to a campaign being waged against the policy Francesca and her colleagues wanted, McLeish observed. The point of Yeo Davis was now clear: they were there to inform, inspire, and orchestrate a client's efforts to get what he wanted, as efficiently as possible. ‘I've read about people giving MPs expensive lunches,’ he said, with interest. ‘Waste of time,’ Peter Yeo said briskly. ‘The good ones don't have time for long drunken lunches, and you get better results by getting them to give you and the client a sandwich in a bar at six p.m. The ones you can get for lunch — there are plenty — will likely forget every word you tell them, and they certainly don't feel obliged to help.’ He caught McLeish's eye. ‘Sorry, but the fact is the average backbench MP doesn't know anything, unlike the average civil servant who really does know about his or her particular area. It's only worth using MPs to have a go at the government, and then you spoon-feed it to them.’ The man had come to life very considerably in discussing his job and a formidable personality was emerging. McLeish decided he would have to abandon any prejudice taken from Francesca about this trade; Peter Yeo knew his business and was obviously effective. And it was a good thing Yeo Davis existed; McLeish himself had often been quietly riled by the intellectual scorn which Francesca and her colleagues would bring to bear on criticism of some of their more sweeping policies. It might well have been necessary to invent Yeo Davis if they hadn't already existed. He reminded himself that he was talking to the inventor of the firm and decided to prod a bit further. ‘How long have you been in this field?’ ‘I've spent all my life in general PR, but it was about eight years ago I decided that there was room for a specialist agency, not really a PR firm, which was concerned entirely with government relations. Government in the widest sense, including our masters in Brussels. I have  —— had — four partners, and we have another twenty people working for us.’ McLeish glanced at the clock on Yeo's desk and saw that he was running behind ti me, as tended to happen at this stage in an investigation when you needed to be in six places at once. He considered his notes; what he needed from this interview was to confirm that Angela Morgan had not been in the office on Saturday, and a statement of Peter Yeo's movements over the period within which Angela Morgan had probably been killed. He also did need to understand the financial side. ‘Was Miss Morgan about the same age as the rest of your partners?’ ‘No, no, she was the youngest by a good five years. She is — was — outstandingly able, that's why I asked her to join us.’ McLeish noted the absence of reference to the other partners. Yeo Davis, evidently,c'est moi as far as Peter Yeo was concerned. ‘I'd like to confirm what the financial arrangements were. I mean how much did she get paid, and how much capital was she asked to put up, that sort of thing.’ ‘Yes, I suppose you do. Well, you understand about partnerships, do you? None of the partners here is actually entitled to a salary; in theory we split the profits in accordance with a formula that we fix annually and that takes account of age, and experience and what people are contributing in terms of work or clients. As a matter of practice, and because we've all got to live, we all draw about two-thirds of what we would have got last year as we go along, then share out the rest at the end of the year.’ McLeish contemplated this system and its possible application to the Metropolitan police force and felt imagination boggle. He himself would have been desperately pushed if he had had to manage on two-thirds of his salary until Christmas every year. A moment's thought told him that this system worked only because two-thirds of the expected total of a Yeo Davis partnership came out at an amount well in excess of his salary, or that of any public servant of his age. He asked what Angela Morgan had been drawing  on every month and found his belief confirmed. Christmas must be worth having at Yeo Davis. ‘What about tax?’ he asked, still considering the mechanics of the system. ‘All partners are technically self-employed but in order to prevent them from getting into a frightful mess we deduct a percentage from their drawings, so there is something put aside for tax. I'd have to say it's a great deal lower percentage than most employed people pay because there are all sorts of expenses a partnership can claim. If we seem to have got it wrong, we sort it out when we divvy up the profit.’ McLeish made a conscientious note, feeling that he had got himself sidetracked off the more interesting question of Angela Morgan's capital investment in Yeo Davis. Finding no way other than the direct question, he put it, and watched Yeo, unruffled, confirm that she had indeed put up £100,000. ‘The rest of us had put up much the same, given that we had done it earlier,’ he assured McLeish. ‘It seems a lot, but we have employees, I can tell you, below partner level, who would be prepared to mortgage their children to get a partnership here. And Angela didn't need to borrow — I imagine you've talked to her solicitors? Well then, you know that she was pretty well placed.’ ‘I didn't know that a business like this needed much working capital?’ McLeish said, in faithful imitation of Timothy Hutton. ‘Oh, you'd be surprised. We live off fees, of course, but they can be slow coming in. And this is a short lease here — we have to provide for buying something or paying a hell of a lot more rent. No, that sort of money is needed, believe me.’ McLeish, who had a built-in prejudice, well supported by experience, against statements incorporating an appeal to belief, noted dourly that he might at some later stage need to get closer to Yeo Davis's accounts. That could wait, and he would possibly talk to Timothy Hutton again first. He wound up the interview and was rising to say goodbye  when Catherine, sounding shy, asked Peter Yeo if she could possibly use their ladies' room. ‘Of course, of course .’ Peter Yeo was obviously delighted to do any service, however modest, for her and bustled her away, returning belatedly to ask McLeish if he would like a similar facility, which he accepted, obedient to the unwritten CID rule that you looked after your physical needs at any moment that opportunity offered, because you never knew when you were going to get stuck for hours without help. He waited what seemed to him rather an excessive ti me for Catherine, but decided, charitably, that you couldn't look as she did without pretty regular attention to the overall effect. They were in the car, preparing to drive off, before she spoke. ‘There's a nice little flatlet on the second floor. Bathroom, bedroom with double bed, kitchen off. I thought there might be.’ He looked at her sideways; she sounded both smug and irritated. ‘You think it's misused regularly?’ ‘I'd put money on it.’ The response was so swift and unhesitating that McLeish was taken aback, and drove much too close to the car in front. ‘Sorry. You thought he was that kind of bloke?’ She was silent, and pink across the cheekbones — and McLeish, who like all good policemen depended heavily on intuition, understood suddenly that experience was speaking here. She laughed shortly, obviously annoyed with herself but determined to make her point. ‘Well, let's say that I've heard of married blokes who always had to go to the office on Saturdays, and it usually wasn't office work they were doing. It sounds all right, and if the wife gets suspicious and rings up, well he's there, isn't he?’ ‘Not so good if the wife decides to drop in,’ McLeish offered, with interest. ‘Well, you have to keep the office door locked on a Saturday, don't you? So you've got warning,’ she said dismissively, and McLeish let himself, briefly, wonder who the bloke had been who had introduced Catherine to this  experience. He abandoned speculation firmly and concentrated on the implications for the present case, since he was plainly being offered expert testimony. ‘Could be that any of the other partners used it?’ he suggested. ‘The place isn't run like that. Mr Yeo is the boss, isn't he?’ So she too had observed Yeo's imperial command of the partnership. ‘No, I agree. So he was maybe with a girl on that Saturday?’ ‘Maybe. I was wondering about him and Miss Morgan. I mean, he likes women, and she operated by sleeping with the boss.’ McLeish found himself shocked by this piece of feminine sharpness and must have registered something because his sergeant blushed. ‘I don't mean that like it sounds — she didn't do it to get on, or not like that.’ Her hands moved, in frustration as she tried to explain. ‘I think she might have done it as a quick way of finding out how the business worked. Because she was obviously both clever and ambitious.’ ‘Mm.’ McLeish found himself receiving this with reluctance and wondered why, since it made sense. He glanced at her, being taken aback to find her looking strained and as near plain as anyone with her looks was going to. Her profile was very sharp against the gathering darkness. ‘What is it, love?’ he asked, anxiously, falling into a term of his childhood, and she jumped. ‘Sorry, I'd drifted off. I was wondering about Peter Yeo. Suppose they had been having an affair, and she'd dropped him?’ McLeish considered this. ‘When she met Giles Hawick?’ ‘Well, that's possible, isn't it? If you remember, Hawick said — and he's not silly — that there was someone else on the scene when he first asked her out. Perhaps it was Mr Yeo? And she decided Hawick was the better bet, particularly since he wasn't married.’ McLeish pondered this, eyes narrowed, driving fast but carefully. ‘Perhaps there isn't all that much fun in going around with a married bloke, after all?’ ‘She could still have wanted him but got tired of waiting — decided he wasn't going to leave his wife.’ Catherine was sounding tough and rational, but something in her voice made him feel this whole discussion was uncomfortable for her. He sneaked a look at her, and found he had an excellent view of the back of her head; she was staring out of the passenger window at the darkening vista of St James's Park. He looked again, cautiously, and saw that she was blindly extracting a crumpled paper handkerchief from her neat navy bag. He waited thirty seconds before glancing sideways again, and found her dabbing at her face, trying hard not to sniff. He flicked up the left-hand indicator and stopped the car. ‘I need some tea and I've got a thermos here,’ he announced, getting out of the car without looking at her and opening the back door on his side to find the thermos which he had filled before starting off. He got the top off and a cup poured before lowering himself gingerly back into the driving seat and passing it over to Catherine. Then he glanced quickly at her. It was nearly dark outside but the dashboard lights cast a faint greenish glow. She was still sitting with her head partly averted, so her face was hidden. He poured himself a cup of tea and drank it, selfconsciously, very aware of her sitting tensely beside him. ‘Thank you, John. That was nice.’ Catherine sounded suddenly exhausted, and as she gave him back the cup she turned towards him, letting him see that she had been crying, but without looking him in the face. Looking down at the curve of her cheekbone, still wet with tears, he suddenly wanted her, quite overwhelmingly. He sat frozen in his seat by surprise, so blocked by his own consideration of duty, honour and the right way to behave to junior staff that in the end it was she who moved towards him, and touched his cheek. He slid his cheek against hers and, moving with delicious deliberate slowness, he kissed her on the lips. The sheer pleasure of it swept him up and it was a full minute before he pulled back and looked at her, amazed at how happy he felt. ‘Jesus, Catherine. Another minute and I'll be inviting you into the back of the car.’ He watched her smile, happy and comfortable with him, secure in the pleasure they shared. ‘If you like, or we could go back to my flat?’ For McLeish the rest of the journey had the quality of a dream. With one part of his mind he knew he was getting the benefit of the backlash from an experience in Catherine's past, but with another part he didn't care about any of that, there was no reality beyond her. The feeling of dream-like ease persisted when they arrived at Catherine's flat. He opened the car door for her, hugged her as she got out, and they went up to her flat, his arm round her shoulders. He took off her clothes for her, while she undid as many of his buttons as she could, and after that it was pure, undiluted, uncomplicated pleasure until they fell asleep in each other 's arms."
FIC FIC-CB5-002 -0.04 "‘So now that we have been here almost three months,’ Mrs Carson said, ‘what do you think of New York, Ruth?’ She was not really looking for an answer. She was concentrating on her appearance, adding the finishing touches before setting out on yet another shopping expedition. The Carsons had quickly made friends. They were a pleasant, handsome couple and New York had welcomed them, showering them with invitations. Naturally, all this activity made it necessary for Mrs Carson to renew her whole wardrobe. Everything she had brought from Manchester now seemed so provincial. New York was so chic, so fashionable. ‘What do I think of it?’ Ruth smiled, ‘Why, ma'am, I think it's wonderful! Incredible! It's so exciting.’ She had felt the excitement in the air the minute she had stepped off the boat. Her whole body tingled with it. She just knew, she knew with absolute certainty, that in this vast, noisy, busy city,something would happen to her, and it was bound to be something good. Life, from now on, was going to be quite different from anything she had ever known. Adventure awaited her around every corner. ‘And so big, so busy. Five hundred thousand people, Professor Woodburn says there are. Sometimes I think they're all on Broadway at the same time!’ She adored Broadway. The shops — so many, such variety! A person with money could buy just about anything. And the hotels! Splendid buildings with grand entrances and such smart people going in and out that it was a pleasure  just to stand and watch them. She had dared to step inside Mr Brady's photographic establishment to view the wonderful daguerreotypes and portraits he had taken. The very best people went to him and it was her intention, once she had saved the necessary two dollars, to do likewise. She told herself she wanted to have her photograph taken so that she could send it to Aunt Sarah, but really it was for herself. She was curious to know how she looked to other people. ‘I could never tire of New York, ma'am,’ she said. ‘Not in a lifetime!’ ‘Good!’ Mrs Carson replied absently. Would her bonnet take more ribbon, or perhaps a flower or two, to give her height? ‘And now I absolutely must fly! So much to be done! Everything must be ready for an early start tomorrow. See that your own things and Anna's are packed, Ruth.’ They had been invited to spend a week or two at the country house of Mr Josiah Barnet, a banker on Wall Street, whom Mr Carson had met in the course of business. Mr Barnet was rich. His wile, it was said, was even more so, and well-connected. They were lucky, Mrs Carson declared, to have received such an invitation. There was no knowing who they might meet there. ‘I'm afraid it's very hot again,’ she said. ‘Perhaps you should not take Anna out today. But use your own judgement.’ Ruth was a sensible girl. She could safely leave Anna in her care. When Mrs Carson had left, Ruth suggested, ‘I think you ought to have a little nap, Anna. After that we'll go out, if it's not too hot.’ ‘Can we go to Wagner's ice-cream parlour?’ Anna asked. ‘We'll see. For now you must lie down on the bed and go to sleep.’ Anna was asleep in ten minutes. Ruth sat down and took a letter from her pocket. Before they had parted on the Flamingo she had given Ernest the name of the boardinghouse where the Carsons had made arrangements to stay, and he had promised to write to her the minute he and Charlotte arrived at their destination. A dozen times since  then Ruth had visited the post office in Nassau Street, but no letter came. Sometimes she wondered whether her cousins were still alive. They could have been attacked by Indians; they could have run out of food and water and suffered a terrible death by starvation. Or perhaps they were still wandering in that long stretch of country which lay between New York and the State of Wisconsin? ‘You are letting your imagination run away with you,’ Mrs Carson had said. And yesterday she had been proved right. When Ruth called yet again at the post office a letter was waiting for her. Now, while Anna slept, she read it for the tenth time. ‘We are fit and well,’(Ernest wrote). ‘Little Jane thrives, as do we all. Charlotte did not enjoy the journey up the Hudson River and through the Canal, nor the horse-drawn wagon which followed. She is with child and the bumping added to her sickness. Everything is different from Ilkley though we have met up with a family from Leeds, which makes it more like home.’ When she first read the letter, standing out there in the heat of Nassau Street, Ruth was overcome by a pang of homesickness so severe that it felt like a pain burning inside her. It was strange that, truly enamoured of New York as she was, she could still feel like this — choked with a desire to hear the broad vowels of her native Yorkshire. There was a score of different accents and tongues around her as she stood there, but not the one she wanted. Today she felt better. So Charlotte was to have another baby? Somehow in the confines of that tossing, stinking ship her cousins had managed to make love, perhaps even when she was Alas with them. No wonder Charlotte hated her. There had been no mention in Ernest's letter of Aunt Sarah. Ruth had written to her four times and lived in the hope that her aunt would get the minister to reply. She had also written to Willie and Maria, even to Mrs Johnson. Though she was not really homesick, penning the letters somehow kept her close. Anna stirred in her sleep, opened her eyes slowly. ‘Are we going out now?’ she asked. ‘Not yet. It's still very hot.’ ‘Tell me about where we're going tomorrow then,’ Anna demanded. ‘I've told you a dozen times. To the country. We're going to a big house called Millfield. I daresay there'll be a shady wood, and trees and rocks to climb. And other children to play with. Mr and Mrs Barnet have three children.’ ‘Is it a long way?’ ‘Twenty-three miles. And now I must finish packing.’ Not that her packing would take long. She had few clothes, and fewer still suitable for the hot weather. How she would have managed had not Mrs Carson handed down two dresses, both of fine cotton, Ruth didn't know. They were invaluable. When she had packed she washed Anna's hands and her own in a basin of cool water, put on their bonnets, and took Anna's hand to descend the stairs. As they reached the hall Professor Woodburn came in from the street. His face was flushed and damp and he mopped his forehead with a large handkerchief. The professor was Mrs Gutermann's most prestigious boarder, and her favourite. She cosseted him, served his favourite dishes, bullied him into changing his clothes when he came in drenched from one of New York's torrential showers. It had surprised Ruth that the Carsons should choose to live in a boarding-house, until she discovered that in New York it was quite the thing-always supposing that the establishment was high-class and in a good locality. Spring Street, just off Broadway, was fashionable, and no-one could describe Mrs Gutermann's as other than high-class. Ruth had heard her boasting to the Carsons. ‘I take mostly professional people,’ she'd said in her strong voice with its pronounced German accent. ‘Professor Woodburn; Mr Gossop from the New York Society Library, Miss Fontwell who has a position in the New York Historical Society, and so on. All my boarders are ladies  and gentlemen.’ She did not mention Mr Pierce. He was a manager in Brooke Brothers, Men's Outfitters — and being in trade was only admissible by the skin of his teeth and because, Mrs Gutermann being a widow, she could look to him to undertake certain practical tasks, to make himself useful. Anyway, he was a manager. Had he been an ordinary shop assistant it would not have done at all. ‘Good afternoon, Miss Appleby, Anna,’ the professor said. ‘How cool you both look!’ ‘We're not really,’ Ruth replied. ‘We're going out in search of fresh air, if there's any to be had. We shall go to your Washington Square. It's not too far and there'll be shade from the trees.’ She called it his Washington Square because he was professor of English in the university there. According to Mr Carson, the professor had taken his degree at Oxford, but he had been in America for several years now. ‘There is a little shade in the square,’ he agreed. ‘Though it is not cool anywhere. Perhaps one day when you are in that direction you will allow me to show you my department in the university.’ ‘That would be most pleasant,’ Ruth said. The professor seemed not to realise that she was a servant, perhaps because she was so much with the Carsons as to seem almost a member of the family. But when she got to know him better she was to realise that he treated all women, servants or otherwise, as if they were ladies. When they stepped into the street the damp warmth hit her in the face and the heat of the pavements struck through the thin soles of her shoes so that every step of the way was like treading on hot cinders. She could never, in her wildest dreams, have imagined the summer weather of New York City. In the early mornings the heat came in through her open bedroom window and when, later, she went out to take the air, there was no air, only a dense, clinging humidity. She walked slowly, Anna's damp hand in hers, keeping to what shade there was from the buildings. Sweat beaded her face and soaked her body in the most unladylike way. In spite of having sponged herself down in cold water to close the pores, and liberally applied powdered chalk to absorb the perspiration, she could feel the rivulets of sweat running down her back and the insides of her thighs. ‘If we walk up Broadway we'll pass Wagner's,’ Anna said. ‘I want some ice-cream.’ ‘Then want must be your master,’ Ruth snapped. ‘We'll just stop talking about it if you please!’ She was ashamed of her sharpness, but the heat seemed to penetrate her brain, taking over her senses so that she was no longer in control. She felt like slapping Anna. In spite of what Professor Woodburn had said, it was a little cooler in Washington Square, especially as they were lucky enough to find a vacant seat under a tree. Ruth had discovered Washington Square on her second day in New York. Its air of peacefulness was in such contrast to Broadway, and to the harbour and waterfront on the day they had landed. She loved these contrasts which the city afforded. Whatever one's mood, it seemed, there was a place to match it. ‘I'm bored,’ Anna said. ‘Can't we play a game?’ ‘It's far too hot to run about,’ Ruth told her. ‘You may pick daisies and I'll show you how to make a daisy chain.’ While Anna picked flowers, Ruth observed every detail of the dress and deportment of the people in the square, for she hoped one day to emulate them. She did not dislike her present job, but she had no intention of doing such work forever. She meant to get on in the world. She had no idea at the moment what she would (or could) do, but she knew that something good was bound to happen. She could feel it in her bones. And hopefully it would happen before too long. She couldn't wait until she was old. How terrible to be thirty and not to have realised one's ambitions! But today the square was unusually quiet. Anyone who could do so had already left the city for the comparative cool of the country. She would be glad when they themselves followed suit. ‘We must return home,’ she told Anna when they had  made the daisy chain and hung it around the little girl's neck. ‘But since you've been so good, you shall have your ice-cream!’ Broadway was as crowded as ever. Clearly there were many people who couldn't afford to escape the heat of the city. Two horse-drawn buses careered down the middle of the road, the drivers racing against each other, scattering everything in their way, including the piles of rubbish which lay stinking in the heat. But it was cooler in Wagner's and the ice-cream was deliciously cold to the tongue and delicately flavoured with just enough vanilla. Ruth had never tasted ice-cream before coming to America and now, like Anna, she could have eaten it all day long. The two of them scraped their dishes clean. When they emerged it was hotter than ever. ‘It feels like a storm,’ Ruth said. ‘We'd better hurry.’ Mrs Carson was already back. She lay on the chaise longue, fanning herself. ‘I'm quite exhausted!’ she exclaimed. ‘All the shopping one has to do! But one must be suitably dressed for a country visit and I had absolutely nothing fit to wear. Anna, my pet, I have collected your new dress and in a moment you shall try it on.’ ‘Does it rustle?’ Anna asked. ‘Rustle?’ ‘I want a dress which rustles when I walk. Like yours, Mama.’ Mrs Carson smiled fondly at her daughter. She found it difficult to refuse her anything. ‘Well, since it is of the finest Swiss cotton I'm afraid it won't, my pet. But when you go to dancing school in the Fall you shall have a taffeta dress and you will rustle like a lady in a ballgown. How will that do?’ ‘And new slippers with bows?’ Anna said quickly. She was adept at recognising and seizing the favourable moment. ‘New slippers with bows,’ Mrs Carson promised. ‘And now, Ruth, will you ring for some tea? Mr Carson took me  to Astor House for luncheon and it was all quite elegant, but the food was so rich it has left me thirsty.’ Everything was elegant: food, clothes, buildings, speech. It was the fashionable word. Mrs Carson fanned herself, sighing with exhaustion. ‘It is so hot! Thank goodness it will be quite different in the country. We shall be able to breathe there.’ Ruth was not sure what difference twenty-three miles would make to the climate, but at least there would be no hard pavements or buildings to reflect the heat. There would be grass underfoot, perhaps a lake. And on the moor at home, she thought suddenly, there will be a breeze, and the heather will be in bloom. ‘Mama, I want to try on my new dress,’ Anna said. ‘Very well, my dear. Ruth shall unpack it and put it on you. Goodness knows what we shall do if it needs any alterations, since we have discovered that Ruth is not a needlewoman, and I have far too much to do before we leave.’ Soon after they had arrived in New York Anna had torn a dress and Mrs Carson had handed it to Ruth to repair. She had been horrified at the botch Ruth made of it and Ruth had begun to wish that she had taken a few of Hester's proffered lessons. She could do with being able to sew for her own sake. She had saved enough to buy a length of material in the market, but by the time she had enough money from her wages to pay a dressmaker, the summer would be over. Fortunately, Anna's dress fitted perfectly. Mrs Carson smiled. ‘Spared again, Ruth!’ It was mid-morning when they left the city and the heat was already building up again. ‘Last night's storm has done little to clear the atmosphere,’ Mr Carson said. ‘But I have ordered the carriage hood down so we shall benefit from the movement of air.’ ‘Then we must take our parasols,’ Mrs Carson decided. Ruth wore the pale lavender cotton dress which Mrs  Carson had given her. It fitted closely, since Mrs Carson was thinner than her servant, and flatter-chested. She had pinned a bunch of violets on her bonnet and put new, light grey ribbons on it. She was aware of Mr Carson looking at her, and when he handed her into the carriage to sit beside Ruth she felt quite the lady. Or almost. Elegant kid gloves like the ones Mrs Carson wore would have improved her image, but she possessed none. So far, gloves had been something to keep out the raw cold of the Yorkshire winter. Now she would have liked them to have covered the warmth of the hand which Mr Carson took lightly in his. For his part he noticed, not the dress but the slender-waisted, full-breasted figure it adorned; the pretty face and the abundant dark hair which the bonnet framed; the large amber eyes which met his as he helped her in. He felt the warmth of the hand, which was not soft to the touch like his wife's, but firm. He was not sure whether the pulse which beat in their joined hands was hers or his. They were quickly in the country. Above Twenty-third Street the buildings began to thin out. A few well-to-do people, preferring a quiet existence, had built houses north of there, but once they had passed those and were driving along the Bloomingdale road, there were only isolated farmhouses and cottages. As they drove north the landscape became more rugged, with hills, and great outcrops of rock which reminded Ruth of home, though the Manhattan hills were gentler, with nothing of the size of steepness or the Yorkshire fells. ‘Thank goodness there are some trees,’ Mr Carson remarked. ‘The shade is so welcome. Anna, close your mouth or it will be filled with dust from the road!’ At Manhattanville they stopped to water the horses and to refresh themselves with a drink of lemonade from an inn. The lemonade, cold as ice, in a deep earthenware jug with slices of lemon floating on top, was delicious. ‘And now we must be on our way again,’ Mr Carson said. Millfield was the largest house Ruth had ever seen. A  long drive curved towards a three-storeyed, white building, with steps leading up to its porticoed door and on either side of the doorway a wide, pillared verandah. A coal-black manservant came out to the carriage and showed them into the house. He was magnificently tall, broad, and handsome, and Anna stared at him so hard that she tripped, and fell up the steps. She was not yet used to seeing black-skinned people. This man was even more splendid than Sammy, the page-boy at Gutermann's, though he lacked Sammy's braided uniform and turban. He seemed kind, too, putting out a hand to set her on her feet again. Mrs Barnet, accompanied by a boy of about Anna's age, was in the spacious hall to greet them. ‘Did you have a tolerable journey? Was it very hot? How nice to meet you all!’ Mrs Barnet carried too much flesh on her small frame, so that her figure appeared several years older than her face. Her gown looked expensive, Ruth thought, but it would have suited her mistress better than it did its owner. Also it was too elaborately trimmed for the country. She had pretty fair hair which escaped from its disciplined coiffure in tendrils around her long face. ‘Mr Barnet has an errand on the estate,’ the lady continued. ‘And George and Daisy are out riding. Children are so energetic, are they not? I expect your little Anna is the same! And here is Edward, who has so been looking forward to a new playmate!’ She gave the boy a push and he and Anna faced each other, glowering. Ruth felt sure that but for the presence of their parents they would have stuck out their tongues. ‘We had a pleasant journey, thank you,’ Mrs Carson said. ‘Anna, say hello to Edward.’ Ruth was glad for her mistress's sake that Mrs Barnet seemed so friendly. Mrs Carson had been a little apprehensive about their visit. Mr Barnet was no more than a business acquaintance, but with true American hospitality he had taken pity on the young English couple who had no means of escaping from the city. ‘Now Reuben will show you to your rooms,’ Mrs Barnet announced. Ruth longed to go with Anna to their room. She wanted to wash her face and hands in cold water, if possible to lie down for five minutes. She felt quite sick and dizzy from the long drive over the bumpy road. ‘I have put your daughter in a cot in your room,’ Mrs Barnet continued. ‘We have a very full house, but in any case I'm sure you'll want her with you. Then Reuben will take your maid to the servants’ quarters.’ So the fluttering Mrs Barnet knows where I belong, Ruth thought. She waited alone in the great pillared hall until Reuben returned. From the slight smile he gave her she judged him friendly, but dignified; conscious of his position in the household. ‘Please come with me,’ he said. At the back of the hall a flight of stairs led down to the servants' kitchen. That, too, was on a larger scale than anything she had ever known. She remembered how huge she had thought the Longhills' kitchen on her arrival in Nordale, and reckoned that it would have fitted into a corner of this one. There were at least eight people in it, most of them busy. Only two men and a woman, who sat at a centre table, were not at work, though the woman had a piece of sewing in her hands. The men looked up as Reuben led Ruth towards them. Ruth knew at once that she had seen one of the men before. While he regarded her with evident interest, she searched her mind. Had she passed him on the street — on Broadway perhaps? But why should she have remembered him? He had a pale face, deep blue eyes, hair darker and straighter than hers, and a mouth which curved and turned up at the corners in an almost feminine way. A pleasant enough appearance, but in no way memorable. ‘Come and sit yourself down,’ he invited. The moment she heard his soft Irish voice, Ruth remembered. He was the man on the Flamingo , the one who had  explained to her why so many ships lay at anchor. And the reason why she had been so slow to recognise him was that on the ship he had looked so much older. Now the years had fallen away from him. His face had filled out, the slight hollows beneath his cheekbones owing nothing to hunger and serving only to accentuate his agreeable features; the slight tilt of his nose, the long, Irish upper lip, the blueness of his eyes. Ruth now put him at no more than five-and-twenty. ‘Sit ye down,’ he repeated. He poured a drink and pushed it towards her. It was pale green, with a delicious new taste which turned out to be that of limes. ‘Ye looked startled when ye saw me,’ the man said. ‘Not startled,’ Ruth contradicted. ‘Puzzled. I knew I'd seen you before and I couldn't think where.’ ‘I doubt that,’ he replied. ‘I've not been in the country long. And you could say I get about a lot without meeting anybody. I'm coachman to Mr Barnet. Mostly in New York City, up here only for the summer. Besides, I couldn't have forgotten you!’ He raised his glass to her. ‘Sean O ' Farrell, at your service!’ ‘Ruth Appleby. But you have forgotten me, Mr O'Farrell. We met on the Flamingo .’ He looked surprised, studying her face intently until she felt embarrassed. Had she also changed in a few short months? ‘Of course!’ he exclaimed at last . ‘You're the lady with the little boy!’ 'My cousin's child. They went on to Wisconsin.’ ‘I kept a lookout for you on the ship. You seemed to vanish.’ ‘Well, here I am now,’ Ruth said. ‘And very welcome. But I'm forgetting my manners, so I am. Introductions! Now this elegant young lady…’ he indicated the woman ‘…is Miss Polly Beard.’ Miss Beard, for whom Ruth thought ‘drab’ would have been a better description, inclined her head. ‘And this gentleman is Mr Herbert Fraser. Their master and mistress are visiting here.’ Mr Fraser gave Ruth a strong handshake, his round, apple-cheeked face creasing in a smile. Then as she was about to explain her own presence there, the outer door of the kitchen opened and a man entered. He was tall: elegantly dressed for riding in well-cut white breeches and a black jacket which fitted to perfection over his broad shoulders and deep chest. He was dark-skinned, as if there might be Mediterranean blood in him. In fact Ruth thought, his features were very like those of a man in the reproduction of an Italian painting which had hung in the Longhills’ drawing room. He had a straight but prominent nose, a well-shaped generous mouth, dark eyebrows which almost, but not quite, met over the bridge of his nose. But most noticeable of all — it was something apart from his physical appearance — he had a presence which immediately dominated his surroundings. It would be easy to forget everyone else when he was there. The Irishman sprang to his feet. ‘See to Prince,’ the newcomer said. His voice was deep and strong, matching his appearance. ‘I shall want the carriage in an hour's time, O'Farrell.’ Ruth could not take her eyes off him. Then, as he seemed about to leave, he shifted his gaze from Sean O'Farrell and caught her staring. He stared back and, blushing with confusion, she rose to her feet and gave him a little bob. ‘I don't know you, do I?’ he asked. ‘Are you new here?’ ‘I'm Ruth Appleby,’ she replied. ‘I belong to Mr Carson:’ Mr Barnet — it was clearly he — continued to look at her, and while he did so she could not look away. ‘Do you, by Jove!’ he said. Then he turned, and left the room. Ruth found herself obliged to share a bedroom with Polly Beard. Miss Beard — to her face only Sean O'Farrell dared use her first name, bringing a blush to her cheeks whenever he did so — was lady's maid to Mrs Harvey Telscombe. ‘Servant’ seemed too coarse a word for such a refined creature and indeed she made it plain that she did not usually inhabit a servants' hall. ‘Naturally I have my own little room,’ she assured Ruth. ‘Which Mrs Telscombe has furnished especially for me. She is a woman of refined taste and comes from one of our oldest families. I dare say you are not used to servants’ halls either.’ Since sharing a room with her was clearly going to be more bearable if Miss Beard could suppose Ruth to be a cut above the other servants, Ruth humoured her. ‘No. I've never been used to that. I share Anna's room and live close to the family.’ Miss Beard nodded with satisfaction at her reflection in the spotted mirror, before which she was brushing her sparse, dun-coloured hair. Then she put down the hairbrush and inspected her countenance. Ruth wondered if she was gazing at the dark whiskers which sprouted on her chin and made her so appropriately, though unfortunately, named. ‘Of course we shall not be staying here long,’ Miss Beard said. ‘Were it not that Mr Telscombe had business to discuss with Mr Barnet I doubt we should be here at all. We are not really on visiting terms. Indeed, we are on our way to the Astors.’ Even Ruth, ignorant as she was of New York society, knew about the Astors. Who didn't? Now she pleased Miss Beard by opening her eyes wide and looking suitably impressed. ‘Tell me, Miss Beard, is it true that Mr Astor's income is two million dollars a year, four dollars a minute? I can't believe it!’ ‘Oh, I'm sure it will be true,’ Miss Beard said nonchalantly. ‘Not that any mistress talks much about money. I know in New York it is wealth that counts, but I am pleased to say that it is not so everywhere. In Virginia it is family which matters, and the Telscombes are a very old family. At home there we move in the highest circles.’ ‘As the Carsons do in England,’ Ruth replied impulsively. She doubted if it was anywhere near the truth, but clearly it made Miss Beard happy. Ruth resisted a fleeting temptation to bring in Queen Victoria and the Royal family, deciding that her almost total ignorance would quickly let her down. ‘The Barnets are nouveau riche ,’ Miss Beard confided. ‘Their wealth has secured them a place in New York society — and one must admit that Mr Barnet is a very presentable man, though somewhat offhand. But it is different in Virginia.’ When she spoke of Virginia it was in reverent tones, as if it was the last stage on the journey to heaven. ‘Is Mr Barnet well liked?’ Ruth asked lightly. ‘Well enough,’ Miss Beard conceded. ‘My mistress likes him, but then all the ladies do. And his wife is pleasant. But his children are odious, as you will find out.’ Ruth soon came to share Miss Beard's opinion of the Barnet children, especially of Edward, but Anna was attracted to him and within twenty-four hours was his willing slave. She followed him everywhere, allowing him to bully and browbeat her for all he was worth just as long as he didn't banish her. Sometimes it was Ruth's job to look after them both, though not often, since Edward had his own governess, Miss Fitch, who was omnipresent and jealously guarded her position. Ruth hated the way Anna let herself  be dominated by this selfish boy. ‘You should stand up for yourself, Anna,’ she told her.’ Never give in to a bully.’ He had taken all Anna's coloured chalks, so that she was reduced to standing and watching while he drew the pictures. ‘I want Edward to have my chalks,’ Anna said flatly. ‘I like watching him draw. He does it better than I do.’ Since Ruth was required to be less and less with the children she found herself with too much time on her hands, and since she was unused to idleness she found the vacant hours trying. Mrs Carson noticed Ruth's listlessness and rightly interpreted its cause. ‘You could help me more,’ she suggested. ‘You could help me dress my hair, manicure my nails. Most of the ladies here have their own maids.’ So it was arranged. Ruth never felt that she was good at it, but it made a change, and she enjoyed listening to her mistress's accounts of her days. She thought too that Mrs Carson liked having her there. She was still a little unsure of herself in American society. ‘I hope you are enjoying yourself, Ruth,’ Mrs Carson said one evening. In fact, Ruth heartily wished herself back in New York. She was bored at Millfield. ‘Yes, thank you, ma'am,’ she replied dutifully. ‘Though I haven't always enough to do. It would be pleasant if…’ She hesitated. ‘Yes?’ ‘Well, perhaps you might allow me to go for a walk from time to time, instead of waiting around in the servants’ hall. But only when you weren't likely to need me, of course.’ ‘Very well, Ruth,’ Mrs Carson agreed. ‘But see to it that you don't go too far, and try always to be in the house when you think you might be needed.’ Not all Ruth's time with the other servants was disagreeable, but she quickly found that Millfield's own staff had little time for the servants of visitors, especially anyone they  thought might consider themselves superior. In this, in spite of her repeated offers to help Mrs Cranbrook, the cook, she found herself classed with Polly Beard and Herbert Fraser. She sensed, too, that her English accent kept her a little apart, made her sound uppish. She doubted that in ordinary circumstances Herbert Fraser and Polly Beard got on well together. He had a valet's professional mistrust of all lady's maids. Ruth thought he was also disappointed that his opposite number wasn't young and attractive. But in the face of the enemy they presented a united front. Sean O'Farrell was no-one's enemy. He was friendly to everyone. ‘They're all all right really,’ he told Ruth. She had been irritated by the cook's refusal of her offer to make a simple white sauce, though Mrs Cranbrook was up to her eyes in work. ‘Remember,’ he went on, ‘we're all the same kind. We should band together.’ ‘What do you mean?’ Ruth asked. ‘That's our strength,’ he said. ‘Sticking together.’ Though she had certainly never thought herself superior to her fellow servants, Ruth had no wish to be too close. She knew already that to think like a servant was the surest way to remain one — something she was determined not to do. Sean was always busy. Members of the house-party were constantly taking trips; calling on neighbours, going on picnics, inspecting local beauty spots. He was forever in demand, in spite of which he remained affable and good-tempered. Ruth was in the servants' hall one day when he returned from yet another picnic. ‘Did you have a good time?’ she asked him. ‘'TWAS not bad. The sun would have shone brighter if yourself had been there. Why were you not with the children? The little devils could have done with a firm hand!’ ‘Mrs Carson said there wasn't room in the carriages. Miss Fitch went instead.’ ‘Nonsense!’ he said. ‘I'd have been delighted for you to  have been squeezed in next to me. And the less room the better!’ His blue eyes invited her to imagine what it would be like (which she did, and found the thought quite pleasing). ‘It's a good thing I don't take you seriously,’ she told him. ‘I might be annoyed.’ ‘Oh, but I am serious,’ he assured her. ‘And it's a stupid woman who'd be annoyed by a compliment. You're not stupid, Ruth.’ She had sensed from the beginning that his compliments to her were of a different kind from those he bestowed so liberally upon every female in sight, but she couldn't tell him that, while in her heart she liked them, she might be annoyed by his assumption that they were always acceptable. ‘Yorkshiremen don't go in for paying compliments,’ she said. ‘they think it's a bit soft. So their womenfolk don t always know how to accept them.’ ‘Which is a pity,’ Sean stated. ‘Compliments oil the wheels of life. Even a bit of flattery doesn't go amiss.’ She knew that Sean found her attractive. She would have liked to have made the truth plain — that the feeling, though not one to be taken too seriously, was mutual. But that was too big a step for convention to allow. Convention demanded that a woman must skirt around the truth, fobbing off a man while leading him on. To be too direct was to be unfeminine. ‘Perhaps when I get a minute to meself we can have a picnic of our own,’ he suggested. ‘There's one or two places I'd like to show ye.’ ‘Oh I couldn't,’ Ruth said quickly. ‘Not just the two of us!’ ‘Well then, if you don't think that's proper, we can take Herbert and Miss Beard,’ he conceded. ‘It won't be half the fun, but I daresay we'll manage.’ ‘That would be all right,’ Ruth said. ‘And now, if you'll excuse me, I must go to my mistress.’ Mrs Carson proved to have no need of her. ‘Not for  at least an hour,’ she said. Anna was immersed in a game with Edward under the watchful eye of Miss Fitch, who gave Ruth no welcome: so she decided to go for a walk. She knew better than to walk around the front of the house. Servants, except when summoned, must never be visible. It would not do for some occupant of the house to look out of the window and actually see one walking across the lawn. She took a path across the land at the side of the house and found that it led to a small wood which girdled the top of the hill on which the house was built. Having walked through the wood, she emerged on to a small, high plateau, from which a wide sweep of the countryside below was visible. One could sit here and admire the view, she thought; or lie almost hidden by the tall golden grasses which, perhaps because the place was not easy of access, had been left to grow to their full height and now filled the air with their mingled scents. Ruth chose a place and sat down. There had been a shower earlier in the day, and although the hot sun had dried the ground again, a sharper-than-usual smell of earth and growing things still lingered. She lay back on the ground and inhaled deeply. When she closed her eyes, the sun warm on her face, she recognised the perfume of the grasses as ones she had encountered before. And then she remembered Dick; the journey back from Skipton, and her first and only taste of lovemaking, there in the field. It was almost two years since then, but the scents in her nostrils were so evocative that every detail of that occasion came sharply into her mind. She could remember the feel of Dick's hands on her body, his voice in her ear. She did not think at all of the consequences, only of the act itself. And remembering it — it seemed more as if she relived it — her whole body ached, tensed, fidgeted. She held her arms across her aching breasts so tightly that her fingers dug into her flesh, but whether in an effort to contain herself or as a substitute for someone else's embrace, she didn't know. Nor did she know whose embrace she was seeking. It didn't matter. She was not sure how long she had been there, or how long she might have remained, had she not been disturbed. It was  the thud of a horse's hooves, very near, almost on her, which jerked her back to reality. She jumped to her feet, screaming in terror, certain that she was about to be trampled on. At the sound of her scream the horse stopped short, reared, whinnied loudly in distress and fright at the figure which appeared suddenly, noisily, from the long grass just beyond its forelegs. While the rider tried to hold on, to calm the horse and to prevent himself being thrown, Ruth ran as fast as she could towards the wood. ‘STOP!’ It was a voice not to be disobeyed: authoritative, commanding. She stopped at once. ‘Come here!’ Reluctantly she turned around — and saw that the rider was Mr Barnet; also that he was exceedingly angry, his eyebrows meeting in a fierce scowl, his dark eyes blazing. ‘Come here at once, I say!’ The horse was a big one, a grey of about seventeen hands. Though it was quieter now, Ruth walked forward with trepidation, stopping a few yards short of it. Horse and rider towered above her. ‘Don't you ever do that again! Never, ever , do you hear?’ There was an ice-cold anger in Joss Barnet's voice which lashed Ruth as if he had used the whip in his hand. ‘Are you aware that you could have caused an accident — a serious accident? This is a most valuable horse!’ Ruth's fury suddenly equalled his. ‘I ‘m aware that he could have harmed me !’ she retorted. ‘I move quickly so that I shouldn't be trampled to death. Am I supposed to lie down and be killed, then, so that your horse shan't be frightened?’ The words rushed out. She didn't care what she said, or that he was who he was. But when she came to the end of them, and stood there trembling, she realised that if he remembered her he would certainly report her to Mr Carson. Such insolence — that was what it would be called — could cost her her job. There was nothing else for it, she would have to apologise. But why should she? He had not shown the slightest concern for her. She might be hurt, but he didn't care. He hadn't so much as asked. She looked up at him, well aware that her rebellious thoughts must show in her expression. To her surprise, the anger left his face. There was a twist to his mouth which, though not going so far as to be a smile, showed some amusement. ‘I know who you are,’ he said. His voice was still stern. ‘You are the young lady who belongs to Mr Carson.’ Ruth's faint hope that he would not remember her died. But she was emphatically not sorry for anything she'd said, and she decided that nothing in the world would make her say she was. ‘I wouldn't have frightened your horse deliberately,’ she replied. ‘I should hope not. That would be both stupid and dangerous. At any rate you seem to have come to no harm.’ ‘I didn't know I shouldn't come here. It's the first time I've done so.’ ‘Who said you shouldn't come?’ he asked. ‘Servants are not to go where their masters frequent.’ She was aware there was nothing of the servant in her voice. Now he did smile, and it changed him completely, lifting the lines of his face so that he appeared hardly older than herself, though she knew from Miss Beard that he was almost thirty. ‘I can't see that stopping you,’ he said. ‘You are a pert young woman. However, you may come here whenever you wish. It is not a place I usually frequent.’ ‘Thank you, sir.’ He continued to look at her and she could not take her eyes off him. ‘But if I chose to do so, what then, Miss Ruth Appleby?’ She was astonished, and secretly pleased, that he had remembered her name. ‘Since you have given your permission, sir,’ she said slowly, ‘why then, I would come here just the same.’ He nodded, then turned and rode away at a canter. Ruth dawdled back through the wood, reluctant to return. The moment she set foot in the house, Cook called out to her. ‘You'll be for it, my girl! Your mistress has been ringing for you this past fifteen minutes!’ ‘Where on earth have you been?’ Mrs Carson asked crossly when Ruth appeared. ‘I'm sorry, ma'am. I was out walking and forgot the time.’ ‘Well if you're going to be absent when I need you, you must cease taking walks!’ Ruth thought Mrs Carson had been put out by something other than her small misdemeanour. At a guess, she had had a tiff with Mr Carson. But it behoved her to tread warily if she didn't wish to find her new-found freedom curtailed and that was the last thing she wanted. ‘I'm really very sorry, ma'am,’ she repeated. ‘I promise you it won't happen again.’ ‘Well, see that it doesn't,’ Mrs Carson replied. ‘It pleases me to give you privileges, but I don't care to see them abused. Now, what shall I wear this evening? I think the grey silk might be suitable.’ When Ruth had brushed and pinned up her mistress's red-brown hair, which always shone as though newly burnished, she thought how lovely Mrs Carson looked. She had a skin of a creamy paleness which Ruth envied. Her own rosy cheeks were so countrified. And now that Mrs Carson's awkward mood had passed, her brown eyes were clear and soft again. ‘Yes,’ Mrs Carson said, looking in the mirror. that will do nicely.’ ‘You look beautiful, ma'am,’ Ruth told her. ‘You mustn't flatter me, Ruth,’ Mrs Carson said pleasantly.’ Flattery is bad for us.’ ‘It's not flattery, ma'am,’ Ruth replied. ‘And compliments, so I've been told, oil the wheels of life.’ Mrs Carson gave Ruth a questioning look. ‘Well, I daresay that's true — if the compliment is  genuinely meant. And now I have some news for you. On Saturday evening there is to be a special party here: an orchestra, dancing, and several important guests. I must certainly look my very best then! I think the affair will call for my new yellow satin.’ ‘You will outshine everyone, ma'am,’ Ruth said. Mrs Carson pulled a face. ‘That's enough, Ruth. Now please go and see to Anna. The strange child has chosen to sleep in Edward's room tonight; but I am sure she will want to see you and perhaps you can give Miss Fitch a hand.’ At suppertime in the servants’ hall all the talk was of the coming party. ‘We had one once before,’ a housemaid said. ‘You never saw anything like it! Coloured lanterns hanging from the trees; a quartet of musicians playing from a boat on the lake, as well as a band for dancing…’ ‘Drink flowing like a river in spate,’ Reuben put in. ‘And tables laden with food,’ Mrs Cranbrook added. ‘Where I'm supposed to find the time to prepare everything I don't know! We can't call on Delmonico's out here in the country, not like the city. Well, I suppose it will all fall on me. I'll be at it every minute the Lord sends!’ ‘I'll help,’ Ruth offered. ‘I can make pastry. And jellies. Lots of dishes. I'd like to help.’ ‘We'll have to see,’ Mrs Cranbrook replied doubtfully. ‘I heard there were to be fireworks,’ Sean said. ‘It'll be a grand affair and no mistake.’ Ruth turned to Miss Beard. ‘What do you suppose Mrs Telscombe will wear?’ Miss Beard conveyed superiority, disdain, and several closely-allied feelings, in a single sniff. At the same time as her nose wrinkled, the corners of her mouth turned down and her eyelids drooped. She really had no need of speech. It was all there in her face. Nevertheless she condescended to reply. ‘I'm afraid we shall not be present. We leave here on Friday. I believe I told you that we are to move on to the Astors?’ ‘What a pity you will miss the party,’ Ruth said. ‘One grows weary of parties,’ Miss Beard replied languidly. ‘And fireworks are a little vulgar, don't you think?’ Ruth had seen fireworks only once; at Barnswick's own celebrations to mark the wedding of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert. She had been six years old then and she had thought the fireworks the most beautiful sight in the world. She had never forgotten them. Sean caught Ruth's eye and winked at her. ‘Well then, Miss Polly, if I'm to have the pleasure of your company on an outing it will have to be soon. And isn't it the luck of the devil that the master don't require me tomorrow afternoon? Now if you two charming ladies, and Herbert here, can persuade your betters to free you from the chains for an hour or two, we're as good as on our way!’ So it was arranged. Ruth looked forward to it and she thought that, secretly, Miss Beard did also. When Ruth went into the attic that night she caught Miss Beard standing in front of the mirror, holding a navy muslin dress with a cream lace collar against herself. Flustered by Ruth's appearance, she tried to hide the dress, but she was too late. ‘It really becomes you,’ Ruth said. ‘Shall you wear it for the picnic?’ ‘I doubt it,’ Miss Beard replied. ‘A lady never dresses too finely for the occasion.’ Ruth awakened early next morning. While Miss Beard slept on she rose quietly, dressed, and went out. There was no-one about as she left the house and walked towards the wood. This hour, before the heat began to build up, was the best time of day to be out of doors, and since her mistress would be asleep for some time yet she was free to go as she pleased. There was an unusual excitement in her this morning, though even to herself she did not admit the reason. In the deep shade of the trees-great oaks, spreading beeches, sycamores, which had been there longer than Millfield House — the air was almost too cool, and underfoot there was a damp, springing feeling to the ground. But  where the wood ended she stepped into another world. The ground which nurtured the long golden grass was hard and dry. Already, so early in the morning, the sun shone brightly. She walked forward to the edge of the plateau. From where she stood the downward slope and the valley below were clearly visible. The countryside here was so different from her native dales and moors. It was richer, yet less splendid. More fertile, so that man would be able to tame it as he had never, in thousands of years, been able to tame her wild moors. Would Mr Barnet ride this way, or would he still be in bed? She knew in her heart that that was why she was here. The thought had been inside her ever since he had spoken, though she had continually pushed it away. But now, since no-one else inhabited this early world of hers, she would allow it to remain. But was her imagination too hard to work? Had she read something into his words which was not really there? Had her feelings and longings as she had lain in the grass, remembering Dick and their lovemaking, her body crying out for a repetition of the act, forged a false link in her mind? She thought not. She remembered the way Joss Barnet had looked at her. She knew she was not mistaken about that. She continued to stand at the edge of the plateau. No horse and rider should take her by surprise today, nor easily overlook her. Her sharp eyes scanned the countryside below and, in spite of the sun, she felt a shiver, though not unpleasant, of apprehension. She did not have long to wait. Within a few minutes she saw him riding towards her up the hill, his horse's harness glinting in the sun. When she was quite sure he must have seen her she sat down. He breasted the hill, riding straight for her, coming so close on the great horse that Ruth had to steel herself not to move from the spot. She looked up at him and he acknowledged her presence by a brief glance, but without slackening speed he rode past her, towards the wood. Ruth could  hardly believe it. She had been so sure of his intentions. And then she realised that the hoof beats of his horse had come to an abrupt stop. She turned her head, saw him tether his horse at the edge of the wood, watched him as he walked towards her. She noticed his long, powerful legs, the immaculate cut of his close-fitting breeches, his purposeful stride. As he drew near she made a half-hearted move to rise. She did not count this as a master and servant situation, yet she didn't dare to presume too far. She looked to him for a lead and he gave it to her. ‘Stay where you are,’ he said. ‘You look comfortable there.’ He stared down at her, studying her in every detail with no pretence that he was doing otherwise. He saw a young woman, slight of figure, with narrow, sloping shoulders and a waist his two hands could easily have spanned, yet full-bosomed, the outline of her breasts, the small mounds of her nipples, thrusting against the sprigged cotton dress which was slightly too tight for her. The neckline was low and the upper part of her breasts swelled against it, dividing to reveal the shadowy cleft between them. Her neck rose in a long, rounded column to a face which, though not classically beautiful — the nose was too tilted, the mouth too wide — was heart-stopping in its freshness, its air of innocence combined with its look of deep, untapped feminine knowledge. Was she aware of the effect her large, amber-coloured eyes, her curving red lips, might have on a man? He couldn't tell. There was something about her which baffled and intrigued him. ‘The grass is warm already,’ Ruth said. His face broke into a smile. She knew what she was about all right. ‘You tempt me to try it,’ he replied and dropped down beside her. ‘I’ m sorry,’she floundered. ‘I didn't mean…’ ‘Don't be coy,’ he said. ‘It doesn't suit you.’ His voice was sharp, yet as intimate as if he had known her for a long time. There was to be no paddling around in  the shallow waters for this man, Ruth thought. And with the thought came a tiny prick of fear. ‘I'm not being coy,’ she protested. ‘I was trying to be polite. I'm not very good at polite conversation.’ He didn't answer. For several seconds they just sat there. Ruth wished he would say something — anything. She found the silence unbearable. In the end she said the very last thing she intended. ‘I must go!’ ‘Why?’ he asked. ‘Mrs Carson might need me.’ ‘Your mistress will be asleep, as you well know.’ Then he leaned towards her and took both her hands in his and began to study them as if they were entirely new creations, the like of which he had never seen before. He contemplated the palms as if he might be seeing past and future in them, and then he turned her hands over and examined the backs. Though tremors ran through her body at his touch, she wanted to draw away. She had always hated her hands. She was ashamed that they were large, and neither smooth nor white, but hard to the touch, and calloused, with the knuckles already swollen. Servant's hands, which nothing could disguise. She would have preferred him to concentrate on her face, which was more presentable. ‘And supposing I need you?’ he asked. ‘Supposing I say I want to look at you, to hear you talk in your funny English voice? What if I tell you you've not been out of my mind since last evening?’ ‘Why, I'd not believe you,’ Ruth said. ‘And you shouldn't talk to me so. It's not fitting.’ He threw back his head and laughed loudly. ‘Don't tell me you worry about what's fitting! I don't believe that!’ His eyes, which were darker than Ruth remembered, almost black, sparkled with amusement. ‘You have a low opinion of me,’ she said, ‘that you think I don't care what's right.’ ‘I didn't say that. I said you wouldn't worry about what was fitting. A question only of manners.’ She flared at him. He was trying to put her in the wrong again. ‘So now you're saying I'm ill-mannered?’ ‘Ah! I've made you angry,’ he said. ‘Good! You're exciting when you're angry. I thought so yesterday evening.’ ‘Well, are you saying I'm ill-mannered?’ Ruth persisted. ‘I'm saying that I think you don't care about the stupidities of convention. That you're honest with yourself and don't dissemble. Otherwise you wouldn't be here. You knew I'd come, didn't you?’ ‘I thought you might,’ she admitted reluctantly. How could he make her confess such a thing? It was brazen of her. ‘You hoped I might. You wanted me to. If not, you could easily have avoided this place.’ She could think of nothing to say. ‘Let's be honest with each other,’ he said. ‘Let's have no more talk of what's fitting. And now I think you must go. I don't want you to be in trouble with your mistress.’ It was agony to him to dismiss her. She had aroused him so much that he wanted to take her here and now, on the ground. But there was something about her which forbade the crudity. Ruth jumped to her feet, bitterly disappointed that he dismissed her so suddenly, but determined not to show it. He stood up and walked beside her to the edge of the wood where his horse was tethered. Then, before mounting, he took her chin between his finger and thumb and tilted her face towards his, kissing her lightly on the cheek. ‘Where is your room?’ he asked. ‘Where in the house do you sleep?’ ‘I shared a room with Mrs Telscombe's maid.’ She was trembling now from head to foot. He nodded, and started to ride away. When he was almost out of sight she called after him. ‘They leave tomorrow!’ He didn't look back. There was no telling whether he had heard. Back at the house the kitchen was a buzz of activity. Cook  was making fresh cornbread rolls for breakfast and lesser mortals were hard at it with brooms and mops. Ruth walked through the kitchen and ascended the back stairs, looking neither to right nor left, afraid that her face might give her away. She wanted, desperately, to be alone. She wanted to think about what had happened, what might happen. But solitude was impossible. Miss Beard was there, easing the tightly-knotted rag curlers out of her hair. Ruth took off her dress, hastily moving a stem of grass which fell to the floor, poured water from the ewer into the basin, and set about washing herself. She splashed herself liberally, trying to reduce the flush which she could still feel on her cheeks. ‘Well,’ Miss Beard said, ‘we have a fine day for it! Just as long as the heat doesn't build up into a storm.’ ‘A fine day?’ ‘For the outing! Mrs Telscombe has kindly said that I may be free from two o'clock until six. I hope your mistress will accord you the same privilege.’ Ruth had totally forgotten the outing and her immediate feeling was that she didn't want to go. She wished to be quiet. She felt, deep inside her, that there would be decisions to make. Or should she simply let things take their course, give herself up to the almost overwhelming attraction Joss Barnet had for her? But to do that was in itself to make a decision. It was clear that he was attracted to her. She was sure he would seek her out again. The thought of Mrs Barnet entered her head only fleetingly, to be as quickly dismissed. It was inconceivable that she could take from Mrs Barnet anything that was rightly hers, nor did Ruth flatter herself that Joss Barnet's interest in her was anything but transient. It was too much to expect, not the way of the world. So Sean O'Farrell and his pleasantries would not be to her taste today. He was perceptive. He would sense that she was not herself. And she knew that this outing had been contrived by him so that he could make progress with her. She did like him. She liked him very much. Had Joss Barnet  not joined her this morning she might have felt quite differently about the plan. All these thoughts raced through Ruth's head while Miss Beard continued to babble. She heard the lady's voice but she had no idea what she was saying until a sharpness in Miss Beard's tone signified that she was repeating the same remark. ‘I'm sorry?’ Ruth queried. ‘Perhaps you should take some soap and water to your ears,’ Miss Beard said acidly. ‘I said, what shall you wear?’ ‘I'm sorry. As a matter of fact…’ Ruth hesitated. ‘… I'm not sure that I can go.’ ‘Not go? Not go ? Why ever not?’ 'I… I don't feel well. I think perhaps I have a chill.’ ‘But if you don't go then I can't go!’ Miss Beard cried. ‘Could you not take a powder? Or perhaps you will feel better by two o'clock?’ Ruth had never seen anyone look so disappointed. The older woman's face puckered and for a moment Ruth thought she might cry — which was unthinkable in Miss Beard. It dawned upon Ruth with some surprise that the outing was to be a great treat for Miss Beard, and that in spite of all her high-faluting talk, not many of those came her way. Ruth knew she could no more disappoint her than she could snatch a toy from a baby. ‘Well, I daresay you're right,’ she agreed. ‘I'll ask Cook to give you some cinnamon water,’ Miss Beard declared. ‘That should do the trick!’ ‘Thank you,’ Ruth said. ‘I'm sure it will.’ Since she hated cinnamon water next only to cod-liver oil it would be a suitable penance for having given Miss Beard a nasty moment. When Ruth and Miss Beard arrived at the rear door of the house, the carriage was already waiting. Ruth thought how smart Sean looked. He had discarded his uniform and wore his best suit, a light pearly grey, with a brightly-coloured necktie, and a rose in his buttonhole. His grey hat, which he swept off with a flourish as the ladies approached, was set at a jaunty angle. Mr Fraser was, as usual, dark-suited, but as a concession to the occasion he also sported a rose in his lapel. Miss Beard, in the navy muslin with the cream lace collar which yesterday she had affected to consider too fine for the event, carried a cream parasol. Ruth wore Mrs Carson's lavender cast-off with her one and only bonnet, and was therefore all the more pleased by Sean's appreciative look as his glance took in her appearance from top to toe. ‘'TIS a beautiful sight the pair of ye are!’ he said. Ruth knew, as his eyes met hers, that the words were meant for her. For all the world as if she and Miss Beard were ladies of quality, he ceremoniously handed them into the carriage, the two of them to sit together in the back, while Herbert Fraser sat beside Sean in the front. Ruth guessed that the seating arrangements were for the benefit of whoever might be watching their departure, and that they would not prevail. ‘Where are we bound for?’ she asked. Not that she cared. She was here in the flesh to oblige Miss Beard, but her mind was filled to the brim with Joss  Barnet. Even Sean's obvious appreciation of her had served mainly to boost her confidence as to how she would look in that other man's eyes, if by some absolute miracle they should meet him for a moment as they were driving through the grounds of Millfield House. All she really wanted, if she could not be in his presence, was to be left alone so that she could recall and relive in her mind every moment of that morning's encounter, and dream about what the future might hold for her. He had said she didn't care about the stupidities of convention. Was he right? Sean gathered up the reins and drove off at a smart pace. ‘Just you wait and see!’ he said. It took Ruth a second or two to realise that he was replying to her question, not to the thoughts which whirled around in her head. ‘Twill be a pleasant surprise, I promise you,’ he declared. ‘I'm sure it will,’ Ruth agreed. ‘I like the countryside around here — what I've seen of it. Don't you, Miss Beard?’ ‘It's quite pleasant,’ her companion conceded. ‘Though after Virginia… Now if you were to take a drive around Williamsburg…’ ‘I hope I may, one day,’ Ruth said. There was silence for a while. When she was not holding forth on the almighty Telscombes, or the glories of Virginia, Miss Beard had little to say; and Ruth was in no mood to talk. In fact, she noticed little of the countryside through which they passed. The harvest had been gathered and she was vaguely conscious of the glint of the sun on the gold and brown stubble. Where, in one place the track was lined with trees which stood between the carriage and the sun, she became gratefully aware of the cool shade cast by their dense foliage. On her lips she tasted the dust raised by the horses' hooves and the wheels of the carriage. But these small experiences had the remoteness of a dream. Real life was going on inside her. She felt — it was much more than a memory-Toss  Barnet's strong hand holding hers, his lips on her cheek. She raised a hand to touch the place, as if by such an action she might capture the feeling forever. But with Sean O'Farrell around, the silence and tranquillity could not last. Ruth had no idea how long they had been driving when Sean turned the horses off the road on to a narrow side track. It was the sharp turn, together with the speed of his driving, which flung Miss Beard over on to Ruth, and her sharp squeal as it happened which brought Ruth back to reality. ‘I beg your pardon, ladies! The going's rough just here.’ From the wide grin on Sean's face as he turned around to look at them, Ruth suspected that he had swerved on purpose. ‘Are ye all right, Miss Polly?’ he asked with concern. ‘I'm quite all right, Mr O'Farrell,’ she replied. ‘I'm driving down towards the river,’ he said. ‘I thought perhaps you'd like to stop within sight of it.’ The ground sloped away now, and when, after a downhill mile, Sean stopped the carriage, there before them was the Hudson River. It was broader than Ruth, used to the fast-flowing rivers of Yorkshire, had expected, and was busy with craft plying in both directions. ‘Spread the rug on the ground, Herbert,’ Sean ordered. ‘We'll have it right there.’ He indicated a patch of ground near some willows. There was dappled shade for those who preferred it or, by moving just a little, the afternoon sun for those who could stand the heat. ‘Now, Miss Polly,’ Sean said. ‘What's your pleasure?’ ‘Oh, I think I must choose the shade,’ Miss Beard replied. ‘Too much sun spoils the complexion.’ ‘And that's a risk you mustn't run,’ Sean said gravely. Miss Polly took his words as a compliment and treated him to a coy smile of invitation, meant to suggest that he should sit beside her; but Sean had already marked Herbert Fraser for that position of honour, stopping just short of pushing him to the ground. ‘Herbert's the same,’ he smiled. ‘Can't stand the sun on account of his delicate skin!’ He winked at Ruth as he indicated the place where she might sit and then, having settled them all to his liking, he fetched the food from the carriage. ‘I'm pleased to say Cook relented,’ he told them, spreading it out before them. Ruth thought it more likely that his silver tongue had got around her. As well as the cake — light, fluffy stuff with frosty icing and no body to it, Ruth privately thought — there were freshly baked rolls, split and filled with ox-tongue. Then, when the blackcurrant cordial was poured, Herbert Fraser brought a flask out of his pocket and proceeded to add a generous measure to the glasses. Miss Beard at once cried out in horror. ‘Oh, no, Mr Fraser! I'm strictly teetotal, as you know!’ ‘Oh come on,’ he entreated. ‘A little drop of rum never did anyone any harm!’ ‘Oh I shouldn't. I really shouldn't!’ Miss Beard protested. ‘Why not try it just this once,’ Herbert said persuasively. ‘A special occasion. It could do you all the good in the world.’ Ruth had the feeling that he was desperately trying to inject a bit of life into the party and she felt guilty that she, for one, had so far been very dull company. ‘Well, I really don't know,’ Miss Beard fluttered. ‘What do you advise, Mr O'Farrell?’ ‘Well, now,’ Sean said. ‘We all know there's no more sorry sight in the world than a lady who's had a drop too much, but a spoonful or so can be highly medicinal. Just the thing for keeping off the heat.’ ‘I thought rum kept out the cold,’ Miss Beard said doubtfully. ‘So it does, ma'am. So it does! The cold in the winter and the heat in the summer,’ Sean assured her. ‘The two extremes, so to speak.’ ‘Well, if you think…’ Herbert Fraser poured the spirit into her glass. ‘It really is quite pleasant,’ she said. ‘As a medicine, that is.’ The two men took liberal helpings but Ruth put her hand over the top of her glass when the flask came in her direction. Once, she being childishly curious, her father had given her a sip of the tot of rum he had bought to ease her grandfather's chest. She had hated the taste of it and spat it out immediately. Not so Miss Beard. She sipped at her cordial with evident pleasure, and when Herbert Fraser offered her another nip she accepted without hesitation. ‘That's right, Miss Beard,’ he said. ‘There's nothing that one dose will do for you that two won't do better!’ He poured himself another to keep her company. ‘Why I do believe you're right, Mr Fraser!’ Miss Beard agreed happily. Ruth supposed it was Miss Beard's lack of acquaintance with alcohol which accounted for its rapid, and in her case beneficial, effect. She was now all amiability — a quality none of them had looked to discover in her. ‘The spirit to give you spirit!’ Herbert chuckled. ‘Hey! Get that? The spirit to give you spirit, I said!’ ‘Very witty, Mr Fraser,’ Miss Beard said. ‘Very, very clever. I don't know when I've heard anything quite so clever! The spirit to give you spirit! Oh dear me, that is good, Herbert!’ She giggled and then began to laugh. The laughter pealed from her until the happy tears rolled down her thin face. ‘Oh Herbert you are a caution, really you are!’ She whooped with laughter, so infectious that the others had to Join in. ‘The spirit to give you…spirit,’ Miss Beard gasped.’ Oh dear me!’ ‘I didn't know you had it in you, Herbert me boy,’ Sean said. ‘Did you, Ruth?’ ‘No,’ Ruth admitted. She was not quite sure what all of them — she along with the rest — were laughing about; but there they were, rolling about with mirth, and Herbert  Fraser looking as pleased as Punch. It was the most successful moment of his life. Gradually, when they were exhausted, the laughter died. Miss Beard gave a final small giggle. ‘Oh dear me! I'm quite worn out with it all! I think if you'll excuse me I'll just take a little nap. Just a little one, that is, if you'll kindly excuse me!’ ‘Forty winks,’ Herbert said. ‘A good idea, Polly. I'll do the same meself.’ A few minutes earlier Ruth would have welcomed the idea of everyone going off to sleep (not that Sean showed any sign of doing so) as an opportunity for her to indulge in her own thoughts, but the fits of uninhibited laughter had restored her to something nearer to normality, and at last she was present with her companions in mind as well as in the flesh. Not that she could entirely stop thinking about Joss Barnet. Whatever happened, whatever was done or said, he was there in the corner of her mind. In no time at all Miss Beard was fast asleep. She lay on her back, her usually sallow face rosy, her mouth open and emitting regular snores which, though reasonably genteel, would have horrified her if she had heard them. Herbert Fraser's snores were another matter: a robust, masculine, uninhibited production. Moreover, they did not time themselves well with Miss Beard's. Sean looked at Ruth and they started to laugh again, but since neither of them wished to waken the sleepers they stifled their mirth. ‘Let's walk down to the river,’ Sean whispered. Ruth nodded her agreement and he put out his hand and pulled her to her feet. There was no path, and the ground was too stony to be described as a meadow. Outcroppings of dark rock, large and small and sometimes steep, interrupted the coarse, sunbrowned grass. ‘Take my arm,’ Sean offered. ‘Thank you, but there's no need,’ Ruth said. ‘Where I come from it's tougher country than this.’ ‘And where I come from,’ he told her, ‘it's soft and  beautiful. Greener than anything you've ever known, with gentle hills and blue lakes. And the people happy. Or they were until the potato failed; turned black and rotten and stinking with corruption, so that they killed the pigs and the people got fever. When the potato fails, everything goes. There's neither food nor work. Then it's hell, though the country is still like heaven itself.’ Ruth had never heard him speak with any seriousness before, had hardly seen him without a smile on his face. Now there was longing and bitterness in his voice and she caught a glimpse of the man she had met on the boat. ‘Is that why you left Ireland?’ she asked. ‘Because of the famine?’ ‘I could have stayed,’ he said. ‘I might have lived. Some did — though my family's not among them.’ ‘Your family?’ ‘My mother and father. My wife's parents. The famine killed them. Do you know what one of your English dukes said? He said we should learn to live on curry powder, mixed with water! The Indians existed on it, he reckoned.’ He had almost forgotten the faces of his parents. Though both in their early forties when they died, he had thought of them as old. His in-laws he had never liked. ‘And my wife and baby,’ he added. ‘We'd been evicted when we couldn't pay the rent because the potatoes failed. Oh, we weren't the only ones. It took the police and the soldiers to turn some of us out. After that we lived in a ‘scalp’.’ ‘A scalp?’ ‘A dug-out ditch, roofed over with wood and grass. Our baby was born there. He was our first. He lived a week. Eileen couldn't nourish him. When he died in her arms in the scalp, she hadn't the heart or the strength to survive.’ ‘I'm sorry,’ Ruth murmured. ‘Well, God rest their souls,’ Sean said. ‘The pair o' them.’ His wife he would never forget. Dark, thin, too pale. A gentle girl with a face as pretty as this one beside him. But with less spirit, he reckoned. They walked for a few minutes in silence. Ruth could find  no comfort to offer him. His words were all it needed to remind her of home, and while he, presumably, thought of his beautiful green homeland and his dead wife and baby, her thoughts turned to her loved ones. Aunt Sarah and Uncle Matt; her father, Willie, Maria. She could not bear to think of her grandfather. And then suddenly Sean's mood changed. He smiled again, and when he spoke his voice was lighter. ‘'TIS not the day to be thinking of the past,’ he said. ‘Also we've walked far enough. We'll sit down right here and watch the boats on the river.’ They chose a flat rock, but it was so hot from the sun that the heat burned through Ruth's clothes and she had to move to the slightly cooler grass. ‘No, it's the future that counts now,’ Sean said. ‘So what's the future to be, eh?’ ‘I think whatever we make it,’ Ruth replied. ‘You think it's as simple as that?’ ‘I think the intention is simple,’ she told him. ‘Perhaps carrying it out won't be.’ ‘So what's your intention?’ he asked. ‘I don't know,’ Ruth admitted. ‘Though I do, in a way. I know I'm not going to be a servant all my life. I'm going to be free.’ ‘Free, is it? And what will you do with your freedom?’ ‘That I don't know,’ Ruth confessed. ‘But I want to make something of myself — I didn't always think so. All I wanted once was to stay where I was. Maria was the one with ambition.’ ‘Maria?’ ‘My sister. She's a servant in Bradford. You'd like Maria. I miss her so much and she hardly ever writes to me.’ The memory of Maria came sharp and clear; pale gold hair curling around her pert, pretty face. She would likely never see her sister again, so that in her mind she would always be as she had been on that last walk over the moor to Barnswick. But why did she not write? ‘We're most of us slaves,’ Sean said. ‘Even those of us who think we're free are slaves to something. Even if it's only our own ambition.’ ‘But if we're free we have the choice,’ Ruth objected. ‘Do we?’ he said. ‘Are we not driven every bit as much as a master drives his servants?’ He smiled at her. ‘Anyway, 'twould not suit you, being a fine lady.’ So! This morning she had been told that she was ill-mannered; now it seemed she was not fit to be a lady! ‘I suppose you think I'm not good enough? Well let me tell you…’ ‘I said no such thing,’ Sean interrupted. ‘You could hold your own with the best. I said 'twould not suit you, and I meant it as a compliment. You're not the one for dressing up, visiting, gossiping, idling your time away.’ ‘Is that all ladies do, then?’ ‘Most of ‘em,’ Sean said. ‘I've seen plenty in the last few months.’ ‘Well, that's not what I want,’ Ruth admitted. ‘What I want is to be in charge of myself, to decide what I will or will not do.’ ‘I wish ye all ye wish yourself,’ Sean said. ‘But there we go, getting solemn again. We're supposed to be having a good time today!’ ‘I am having a good time,’ Ruth assured him. Against all her expectations, she was enjoying herself. In spite of her unwillingness to join the outing, and the remote mood she had been in for most of the day, in the last few minutes she had begun to feel herself a real person. She was also discovering that there was more to Sean O'Farrell than the frivolous charm which he presented to the world. ‘How wide the river is here,’ she said. ‘And to think I might have sailed up it had I not chosen to be independent. I was to go with my cousins to Wisconsin, you know.’ ‘Did they make the journey safely?’ Sean asked. ‘Yes,’ she replied. ‘I had a letter.’ He stretched out an arm and pointed to a steam vessel going north. The deck was crowded and several passengers  leaning against the rail waved a greeting. Ruth and Sean waved back. ‘Good luck to ye all!’ Sean called out at the top of his lungs. ‘They'll need it,’ he told Ruth. ‘It's certain sure that there are poor devils on that boat who've been cheated and don't yet know it. When they get to Albany they'll find the tickets they paid over the odds for won't take them any further. It'll take all that some of 'em have left to buy a ticket up the Canal. So your cousins were lucky.’ ‘Ernest has his head screwed on the right way,’ Ruth said. ‘You don't take in a Yorkshireman that easily.’ Sean laughed. ‘Now it's different with the Irish. They're easily taken in, on account of they're so tremendously honest themselves!’ ‘And modest with it!’ Ruth said. ‘But what about your future? You haven’ t said yet.’ ‘I don't know,’ he answered. ‘I'm still thankful to be alive and eating three meals a day. But I'd like to see my own kind better off than they are.’ ‘You mean the Irish?’ ‘I've left Ireland behind,’ he said. ‘America is for me. I mean my own class. The working-class. The world's servants. I'd like to see them better treated. So should you. They're your class too, Ruth.’ ‘They're not!’ she flared. ‘Oh, it's not that I think myself better, not a bit. But I will not be tied down. I shall always be myself, choose how. No-one's going to stop me.’ ‘Whoa!’ Sean held up his arms in a pretence of fending her off.’ No-one's trying to.’ ‘I'm sorry,’ Ruth said. ‘I get carried away.’ ‘A passionate Englishwoman,’ he remarked. ‘It's a contradiction in terms.’ ‘I'm a Yorkshirewoman,’ Ruth said. ‘We might take a bit of rousing, but when we believe in something we don't mind saying so. Still, like you I've left all that behind. America's my country now.’ She spoke firmly, but deep inside her she was less sure. ‘Shouldn't we go?’ she asked. ‘We must be back by six  o'clock. Mrs Telscombe requires Miss Beard no later and I daresay Mrs Carson will require my services too, even if Anna doesn't.’ Sean threw back his head and laughed loudly. ‘Have I said something amusing?’ Ruth asked. ‘If so, pray enlighten me.’ He jumped to his feet and pulled her up after him. His eyes, meeting hers, were intensely blue and lively and she noticed the fine laughter lines on his face. It was strange that a man who had known so much sorrow could radiate so much life. He was a good person to be with, even if he did laugh at her. ‘You're a real contradiction,’ he said. ‘One minute you disown the servant class, the next you're worrying about being a minute late for your duties! My dear little Ruth Appleby, you've got the conscience of a servant — and no bad thing either!’ ‘Sean O'Farrell,’ she shouted furiously, ‘I have not ! While I have to do the job I'll do it properly. But I'll not do it forever, and it shall never own me. I'll show you! One of these days I'll make you eat your words!’ He backed away from her in mock fear, but he was still laughing at her and though she meant every word, she couldn't continue to be angry with him. ‘I'll race you to the top of the hill,’ he said. He easily outpaced her. She struggled up the last few yards and arrived at his side breathless. When they reached the others Herbert Fraser, his homely face creased with impatience, was standing by the horses, but Miss Beard was still asleep and wakened only at their approach. She blinked, yawned, sat up: dazed, not quite sure where she was. ‘Dear me,’ she said. ‘Did I fall asleep for a minute? How very ill-mannered of me!’ ‘'TIS nothing,’ Sean assured her. ‘The heat of the day, no less. But now I'm afraid we have to return to Millfield.’ By some manoeuvre which was so swift that Ruth did not observe it, she found herself sitting up in front beside Sean, while Miss Beard and Herbert Fraser kept each other company in the back of the carriage. ‘It was good of your Mr Barnet to lend us the carriage,’ Ruth said when they were driving along. It gave her infinite pleasure simply to utter Joss Barnet's name. She wondered if she would be fortunate enough to see him when they returned to Millfield. There was no reason why she should. She had no excuse for going into his part of the house and she had not seen him near the servants’ quarters since that first afternoon. She pinned all her hopes on the following morning when, she had already determined, she would go to the plateau again. So, she was sure,. would he. ‘He's not a bad master,’ Sean acknowledged. ‘Not that he'd have lent the carriage — or freed me — unless it was entirely convenient to him. Self first every time.’ ‘You make a harsh judgement,’ Ruth said. ‘Not harsh. True. Besides, if he hadn't been selfish, hard, ambitious, he wouldn't be where he is.’ ‘Is he very wealthy then?’ Ruth asked. Not that she cared. ‘Rolling! And getting richer all the time, they say. A finger in every pie. His main business is in banking, but now he s expanded into ships.’ ‘Ships?’ ‘The new Barnet line. Mostly carrying cotton from the South for transhipment to Liverpool — which is where your Mr Carson comes into the picture. Also, he's started building ships on the East River. He goes after what he wants and gets it.’ ‘And Mrs Barnet?’ Ruth asked. ‘What about her? Is she…are they…?’ Though she preferred not to think about Mrs Barnet she could not prevent herself asking the questions. Sean laughed. ‘She certainly knows how to spend his money! Clothes from Paris, entertaining, travel. A beautiful house in St John's Park and now she wants to move to one of the new ones in Gramercy Park. Thinks it's more genteel. ‘I suppose she loves her children,’ Sean continued. ‘But give me warmth in a woman.’ ‘She doesn't have it?’ He shrugged. ‘There's no love lost. Perhaps because he plays the field. Or perhaps that's why he goes after the women. Who knows where anything starts?’ ‘Women?’ She didn't want to know. She wanted to close her ears to it. So why did she ask? ‘Oh, he's a ladies man all right! And from what I've seen the ladies seem glad of it. Don't tell me he hasn't made a set at your pretty mistress!’ It was unthinkable. Mrs Carson was devoted to her husband. And yet at Millfield she had been more than ever concerned about her appearance, wanting to be well-dressed and attractive at all times. And I have helped her to be so, Ruth thought, jealousy surging through her. But it couldn't be true, it just couldn't. She didn't want to hear any more. Of course she did not believe a word Sean O'Farrell was saying. It was nothing more than servants’ gossip. Even so, she would rather it remained unspoken. And even supposing — just supposing — that any of it was true; well, it would be quite different in her own case. After all, a man could change, couldn't he? ‘Perhaps we shouldn't talk like this,’ she said primly. ‘After all, he is your employer.’ Sean took his eyes off the road long enough to turn and give her an astonished look. ‘You beat the band! Since when have servants not discussed their employers? It goes with the job. Anybody knows that — including them!’ ‘Then perhaps I'm not your typical servant after all,’ Ruth said triumphantly. For once, when they got back, Anna needed her. ‘Will you bathe her and put her to bed before attending to me,’ Mrs Carson said. Anna was full of prattle about where she had been and what she had done. ‘Miss Fitch took Edward and me for a walk and we gathered stones and pebbles. Then Edward's papa took us on the lake in a rowing-boat.’ ‘Edward's papa?’ Ruth, soaping Anna's small body, tried to keep her voice steady. ‘Yes. I splashed my hands in the water but he wasn't a bit cross.’ ‘Did Miss Fitch go with you in the boat?’ Ruth asked. ‘Yes. But she didn't row. Mr Barnet rowed the boat and he let Edward and me have a turn with one oar. I like Mr Barnet. Do you like Mr Barnet, Ruth?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘I don't like Miss Fitch,’ Anna went on. ‘Now you mustn't say things like that,’ Ruth admonished her.’ Miss Fitch is…kind.’ And lucky, she thought. Perhaps if she herself had been more insistent on spending time with Anna…? But then she would have had no time for taking walks. She heard Anna's prayers, tucked her into bed and kissed her goodnight before going to Mrs Carson. Her mistress was already dressed for dinner. ‘If you would just pin up my hair,’ she said. ‘You are getting so good at it. Did you enjoy your afternoon?’ she added as Ruth brushed her hair. ‘It was most pleasant, thank you, ma'am,’ Ruth replied. ‘Sean O'Farrell is a personable young man,’ Mrs Carson observed.’ Do you not think so?’ ‘Why yes,’ Ruth agreed. ‘He's very nice.’ ‘You could go farther and fare worse than O'Farrell.’ Ruth's eyes met Mrs Carson's in the mirror. There was no mistaking her mistress's meaning. But how very far she is from the truth, Ruth thought. ‘I have not thought of Mr O'Farrell in those terms,’ she replied. ‘Nor, I am sure, has he of me.’ ‘Perhaps you should,’ Mrs Carson said frankly. ‘I should like to see you settled before Mr Carson and I return to England. I know it will not be for some months yet, but time passes quickly. I say this because I have the feeling that you no longer wish to join your cousins in Wisconsin. Am I right?’ ‘Yes, ma'am. You are quite right,’ Ruth admitted. ‘There is no place for me there.’ ‘I should have thought…with the new baby…’ Mrs Carson began. ‘No, ma'am,’ Ruth interrupted. ‘I shan't go to Wisconsin.’ ‘Then perhaps you should take what I have just been saying even more seriously. As for your point that Mr O'Farrell does not see you in that light, that is surely up to you?’ ‘You mean… I could make myself attractive enough to him?’ Ruth was fairly sure she could, but she had another question in mind of greater importance. ‘Of course you could,’ Mrs Carson assured her. ‘And you would make him a good wife.’ ‘Excuse me, ma'am,’ Ruth said, ‘but is it your opinion that a woman can attract any man if she has a mind to?’ Mrs Carson did not reply at once and Ruth wondered if she had gone too far and annoyed her mistress. Mrs Carson was peering closely at her own image in the mirror. She smoothed the dark wings of her eyebrows, pinched her cheeks to make the colour come. Then she studied her maid's reflection in the glass. How the girl had changed since their first meeting on the ship! She had been a little waif then, in her Yorkshire homespun. Though come to think of it, she had known how to ask for what she wanted. But now she had an air of confidence a bloom on her skin, a light in her eyes. The New World certainly agreed with her. Yet even now I know little about her, Mrs Carson thought. She keeps herself to herself. All things considered, she would be better married. She turned around and faced Ruth directly. ‘Not any man. Not any woman. But I'm sure you'd have no difficulty, Ruth.’ The dry note in her voice did not escape Ruth. When Ruth climbed into her bed that night Miss Beard was packing for her next day's departure and she was far more talkative than usual, regaling Ruth with the names and pedigrees of notables with whom she might be privileged to breathe the same air. She longed for the silly woman  to stop prattling and to blow out the candle. She wanted to lie there in the dark, alone with the thoughts she had had to suppress for so much of the day. Alas for the weakness of the flesh! Within two minutes Ruth was fast asleep and Miss Beard still in full spate. But next morning Ruth awakened early and, leaving Miss Beard to her gentle dreams, dressed quickly and hurried out of the house. It was another golden day. She still retained her English habit of noting each day's weather, always expecting changes, marvelling at the hot sunny days which followed one after the other, almost with monotony. When she reached the plateau she remained standing, watching for Joss Barnet, waiting for the moment when she would see him riding towards her. There was no longer any need for her to be ‘discovered’. Her sole purpose in being there was to meet him and she was content that he should know it. He was late this morning. Or was.she earlier than she thought? Had she misjudged the time? No matter. She was happy to wait for him, certain that soon she would see him riding towards her. Then as the minutes passed and there was no sign of him, she considered that perhaps he had overslept. It could happen. Or had his horse gone lame, cast a shoe? She sat down and prepared to wait as long as was necessary. She knew that in the end he would come. After a few more minutes she became restless, and stood up again, her eyes searching the slope of the hillside and the valley below, trying to determine whether some small movement down there was a man on horseback or merely a trick of her imagination. Should she set off down the hill to meet him? But perhaps he would come by another route and then she would miss him. At the end of what she reckoned must be an hour, she faced the fact that he was not coming. She dropped to the ground again and lay down, burying her face in the sweet-smelling grass. She had been mistaken ever to think that he would come. She had let her overwhelming desire feed her imagination; had read something into his words, his looks, his actions, which had not been there at all. Her face burned with the shame of it. Such was the feeling Joss Barnet had aroused in her, that not for one moment did it occur to her to blame him for anything. It was all her fault. Sick at heart, she wept. Then she dried her eyes on the hem of her petticoat and went slowly back to the house. ‘So you've decided to put in an appearance?’ Cook said. ‘I do seem to recall something about you offering to help me with the party preparations. But of course if you've changed your mind…’ ‘I haven't,’ Ruth snapped. ‘I'm ready to start now. I don't want any breakfast.’ ‘Hoity-toity! What's the matter with everyone this morning?’ Cook demanded. ‘There's Sean O'Farrell and the master left in a hurry this hour past for New York City, both without a bite inside them — and now you.’ ‘Gone to New York?’ ‘That's what I said.’ With Mrs Cranbrook's words Ruth's appetite immediately returned. So he had not failed her after all! How could she have thought that he would? Something unforeseen and urgent had happened, since Sean had obviously known of it yesterday afternoon, and there had been no opportunity for him to inform her. Relief surged through her like a physical infusion of new blood. ‘I've changed my mind,’ she said. ‘I would like some breakfast. Suddenly I'm hungry. When will they be back?’ ‘Sean? How should I know? I don't understand business. What I do understand is that if the master's not home for the party tomorrow, the mistress won't be pleased — and that's putting it mildly. Don't you dawdle over your breakfast then, not if you intend to make yourself useful. There's plenty to be done.’ Ruth worked all that day as though she had the strength of ten. They prepared chicken pies, the pastry as light as Ruth's heart, turtle soup, a haunch of venison, jellies, blancmanges, syllabubs, trifles, and a host of other dishes, with still more to be done on the day of the party itself. Mrs Cranbrook unbent so far as to show approval. ‘You've done very well,’ she conceded. Mrs Carson, knowing how much was involved, had excused Ruth from all other duties until Anna's bedtime hour. And now it approached. She took off the voluminous apron Cook had lent her and went in search of her charge. Anna was in tears. ‘We're going home,’ she sobbed. ‘I don't want to go back to Mrs Gutermann's. I want to stay with Edward. I want to live with him for ever and ever!’ Ruth could think of few worse fates, but her stomach lurched at the thought of leaving Millfield. ‘How do you know we're leaving?’ she asked. ‘Who told you?’ ‘Miss Fitch,’ Anna wailed. ‘I don't like Miss Fitch. I hate her! I daresay she wants me to go!’ ‘Perhaps she's mistaken,’ Ruth said, though she doubted if Miss Fitch was ever wrong. ‘We'll ask your mama the moment she comes in.’ ‘I'm afraid it's true,’ Mrs Carson told them. ‘Of course we were only invited for ten days or so.’ Ruth had lost count of time. To her, the long summer days had stretched ahead, world without end. ‘We are going to leave on Sunday,’ Mrs Carson went on. ‘Not too early in the day, since I daresay we shall all be tired after tomorrow's party.’ ‘Anna tells me she never wants to leave Edward,’ Ruth said after the child had gone to sleep. Mrs Carson smiled indulgently. ‘Dearest Anna! She's a little young for a holiday infatuation, but we all have them sooner or later. Thank goodness they never last! And the more intense they are, the shorter the duration, so Anna should soon be over it.’ ‘Will Mr Barnet be back for the party?’ Ruth asked. ‘I expect you mean will O'Farrell be back,’ Mrs Carson said. ‘And the answer is, I don't know. Mrs Barnet tells me that she expects her husband when she sees him. It's a fact  that American men seem to put business before everything. Thank goodness Englishmen are not like that!’ Next morning Ruth was down in the kitchen early, eagerly hoping to find Sean there. He could well have returned late at night and she not heard him, though she had stayed awake for a long time, listening for the sound of the horses, the carriage wheels on the drive. There was no sign of Sean but Mrs Cranbrook was already at work. ‘I hope you're ready to help me,’ she said. ‘Everybody is busy with this and that — as if food wasn't the most important thing!’ ‘I'll help, Mrs Cranbrook,’ Ruth agreed. ‘They're not back then?’ She tried to sound nonchalant. ‘Not back? Oh, you mean O'Farrell and the master? Not that I know of. There's no telling when they ‘U return. Sometimes they're gone for three or four days at a time.’ ‘But surely…with the party?’ Mrs Cranbrook shrugged. ‘He's a law unto himself, the master. Not for the likes of you and me to question why.’ The heart had gone out of the day. Ruth fetched and carried and stirred and whipped, praying every moment that Joss Barnet would return before they left Millfield next day. But when the day had dragged to evening — in spite of all there was to do the time now passed slowly — and still there was no sign of the two men, she began to lose hope. In the evening, bone-tired, she left the kitchen and went to put a reluctant Anna to bed. Then she turned to helping Mrs Carson. She brushed her mistress's hair and piled it on top of her head in a cluster of curls, carefully and meticulously arranged to look quite casual. It was a style Ruth had devised herself and Mrs Carson was delighted with the result. ‘It looks so different,’ she said. ‘You really are quite clever at this, Ruth. And now for my dress.’ She looked beautiful in the yellow satin, the low-cut bodice tight against her slight figure, the skirt billowing out. But  Ruth had no heart either to appreciate or to envy her mistress. Her spirits were at their lowest ebb. Mrs Carson gave her maid a sharp, compassionate look. She thought she knew the cause of this mood and in a way she was glad to see it. At least it showed that the girl's mind was working in the right direction. ‘Don't worry, Ruth,’ she said kindly. ‘I dare say O'Farrell will be back tomorrow before we leave. And if not, there is always New York when the Barnets return in the fall. And now I shan't need you again this evening, so apart from looking in on Anna from time to time, you may do just as you please.’ Had she not been so downhearted Ruth would have enjoyed herself. But she had given up all hope of Joss Barnet returning that evening and nothing else in the world mattered. The party scene was pretty enough. Coloured lanterns hung in the trees which fringed the lawn and bordered the lake beyond. Torchlights, flaring against the night sky and reflected in the water, had been set up wherever it was suitable. Already the orchestra had begun to play and the elegantly dressed to appear. Ruth had no heart for it. She climbed the stairs to her room, then undressed and went to bed, wetting the pillow with her tears which, held back all day, now flowed unchecked. Her only comfort was not to have Miss Beard in her room, to be able to suffer in solitude. Though she thought sleep would never come, eventually it did. She fell asleep to the sound of music drifting upwards from the drawing-room. When she wakened it was still dark, the orchestra still playing, though it was not that which had aroused her. Penetrating her sleep she had heard the faint click of the door latch, and then the familiar squeak of the hinge as the door to her room slowly opened. She raised herself on one elbow, blinking her eyes, trying to see in the darkness. But enough light came from the landing on to which the door opened to silhouette the man standing there. It was Joss Barnet. Shock made her cry out, and he closed the door and moved  towards her in quick strides, putting his hand across her mouth to stop-her scream. Then he sat on her bed and, without a word from either of them, she went willingly into his arms and was held close in his embrace. She felt his heart beating strong and fast against hers. They stayed like that for a long moment and then he said, ‘Light the candle.’ ‘I can't,’ she whispered. ‘Someone will see the light under the door.’ ‘No matter if they do,’ he said. ‘They will not think of me here. Only my coachman knows I am home. I have not yet joined the party.’ ‘You came to me first?’ She could hardly believe it. He would not tell her, this funny bewitching little English girl, that he had come to her first because he could not keep away from her. She had been on his mind since the morning he had seen her from his horse; frightened yet defiant, sparking with anger. Almost, but not quite, she had come between him and the work he had had to do in New York City. The moment the work was done he had ordered his coachman to drive him back to Millfield as fast as the horses would go. ‘Light the candle,’ he repeated. Ruth's fingers trembled as she obeyed him. Then she lay back on her pillow and they looked at each other as if it was for the first time. He traced the contours of her face with gentle fingers, outlining the curve of her mouth, stroking her temples. Without any hurry, in spite of the impatience which had brought him here, he caressed the length of her neck and the slope of her shoulders. From out of nowhere, Ruth remembered Dick Parker: but not, this time, the pleasure of her union with him, only the pain it had brought her on the Christmas Eve following. And now although her whole body cried out for fulfilment and she longed for Joss Barnet to complete what he had surely come to do, she knew that she must not let it happen. She turned her face away from him, pushed his hand from her. ‘No!’ she cried. ‘You must not!’ He gave not the slightest sign of having heard her, continuing to stroke her neck, and now inserting his fingers under the neckline of her nightshift. She tried again to push him away. ‘Please! Please don't!’ she cried. It was surprise which made him stop for a second. He smiled at her, an unexpectedly tender smile. ‘I won't hurt you,’ he said. ‘Don't be afraid.’ ‘I'm not afraid of being hurt.’ ‘Then what…?’ ‘I'm afraid of afterwards,’ she said hesitantly. ‘If I were to have a child. It would be the end of the world for me.’ ‘But you won't,’ he assured her. ‘I'll see to that. I'm not totally callous.’ ‘You promise?’ ‘I promise.’ She lay quiescent and felt his strong fingers, quicker now, move to unfasten the buttons of her shift one by one. And when he had undone her gown, and had difficulty in lifting it over her head, she raised herself from the pillow and helped him to take it off. Then he pulled down the sheet, which was all the bedclothes she had needed on that warm night, and she lay naked before him. She observed him without shame as he looked at every part of her. Her pleasure was in him, and in his delight of her. When, at last, he stripped off his clothes and came into her, it was as if this was the moment to which all her life had been leading. He was a skilful lover: tender and gentle in the beginning, then powerful, persistent, rough almost — until, his passion rising in harmony with hers, the climax came like the bursting of a thousand stars, like the beginning and ending of the world. Afterwards they lay quietly side by side, not speaking, until he said, ‘I must go.’ ‘Not yet,’ she begged. ‘You can't leave me yet.’ She turned over and lay on top of him, trying to pin him down with her own slight weight, and he began to fondle her  and she him, and almost at once they were making love again. ‘You are a sorceress,’ he told her when it was all over. ‘An enchantress. Women as tempting as you should be kept out of the sight of mortal men.’ ‘You're not a mortal man,’ Ruth said. ‘You're a god!’ He laughed out loud. ‘Hush!’ she cautioned. ‘Someone will hear you.’ ‘I'm a real man all right,’ he said. ‘As I've just proved to you. And would again if time allowed.’ Then he stood up and quickly began to dress. ‘I must go and do my duty as a host for what's left of the night.’ ‘Don't leave me,’ she begged. ‘Please stay!’ He looked at her in surprise, spoke brusquely. ‘But of course I must go. There's no question.’ Long afterwards Ruth realised that this was the moment when she had learned that she could never come first with him. However much he might desire her, she would have no more than the allotted space in his life. ‘When am I going to see you again?’ she asked. That, also, was the wrong thing to say. ‘I can't make plans,’ he said sharply. ‘But we leave tomorrow!’ she exclaimed. That took him by surprise. ‘The deuce you do! Well I shall see to that. My wife will extend the invitation to the Carsons. I take it they're not promised elsewhere?’ ‘Oh no,’ Ruth said. ‘We're going back to New York City.’ He finished dressing, then came and held her by the shoulders, kissing her lightly on the mouth. As he was leaving he turned around and threw a small box on to the bed. ‘From the city,’ he said. ‘You see that I had you in my mind!’ He was out of the room before she could open the box, a dark blue leather affair, lined with white velvet, against which lay a fine gold chain with a small oval locket set  around the edge with seed pearls. She gasped in amazement. It was without doubt the most beautiful thing she had ever owned, or ever would. Such delicacy, such refinement! Her fingers trembling with excitement, she fastened it around her neck. It should remain there for ever. She would never take it off."
FIC FIC-CCW-002 -0.11 "The Maggot was waiting at the airstrip. He gave me a welcoming grin and an ironic bow to acknowledge the exalted company I was keeping, then he ushered the senator on to the starboard wing and so into the aeroplane. It always seemed miraculous that the Maggot could fit himself into a small aircraft, for John Maggovertski was a huge man: six foot five and well over two hundred pounds, and none of those pounds was fat. I sometimes tried to imagine blocking the Maggot during a game of American football and simply could not. It would be like trying to stop a buffalo, because he was nothing but muscle, weight and bone. For exterior decoration he had a thick black beard, dark eyes, a shock of tousled hair, and weight-lifter's arms that were tattooed with snakes, naked ladies and the twin flags of the USA and the Maggot's home state of Arkansas. He put the senator into one of the back seats, first shoving aside a tangle of camera equipment. Another of John Maggovertski's failing businesses was taking aerial photographs of rich folk's houses. He also refilled air-bottles for scuba divers, ran sports-fishing excursions and, despite his slow left knee, was a good enough tennis player to have been hired as a coach at some of the Lucaya hotels, though the Maggot's career as a tennis coach had been somewhat jeopardised by his insistence on helping only the prettier guests to improve their game. He sporadically published a newsletter about rare firearms, collected guns himself, and was the proud owner of a decrepit fishing boat that was called Bronco-Buster in honour of the Giants' Superbowl victory, though the Maggot himself never referred to the beaten team as the Denver Broncos, but always and ever as the Denver Fairies. The Maggot referred to himself as a ‘good old country boy’ which description provoked Ellen, who could not stand the sight of him, to comment that John Maggovertski was to country what the serpent was to Eden. The Maggot, Ellen insisted, was an untoilet-trained redneck jerk whose only expertise was as a player of the most brutal and mindless  sport to be devised since the lions took on the Christians. The Maggot, faced with these scathing judgments, countered by asserting that Ellen's education had ruined what might otherwise have been a useful bimbo, and loudly proclaimed that her extreme aversion to himself was positive psychological proof that she was secretly enamoured of him. On the whole I found it less tiring to keep the two of them apart. The Maggot now ordered me into the right-hand pilot's seat and told me to keep my thieving hands off his knobs. As he fired up the twin engines I wondered just what instruments had once occupied the vacant holes in the dashboard, from which empty holes there now trailed forlorn scraps of wiring. It was best not to wonder, for I faced a long journey in what remained of the Maggot's plane. We were flying first to Nassau where the senator was to be guest of honour at an American Embassy reception for senior officers of the naval units taking part in Exercise Stingray, and after Nassau the Maggot and I would fly on to Grand Bahama where he lived and where Wavebreaker was docked. ‘Are you sure you don't want us boys to keep you company at the reception, senator?’ John asked. ‘I'd be surely delighted to have your company.’ The senator, ever affable, seemed unworried at the thought of taking the Maggot into polite society. ‘Do I have to wear a tie?’ ‘I guess so. I'll be wearing one.’ ‘Reckon I'll leave the embassy girls to you then, senator,’ the Maggot had to shout over the sound of the engines, ‘and me and Nick will just have to play with each other on account of forgetting to bring our ties.’ He laughed, then frowned at the aircraft's controls as if he was not entirely certain what most of them did. One reason why John's air-taxi service was less than successful was his habit of pretending not to know how to fly the plane or, worse, pretending to have forgotten how to land it once he had succeeded in becoming airborne. The performances made his customers understandably nervous, and nervous customers do not pass on glowing  recommendations to their friends. ‘I suppose we should try and get this hot heap of shit off the ground,’ the Maggot growled now. It was indeed as hot as hell inside the aircraft. We taxied away from the palm-thatched hut that was proudly styled as Straker's Cay Airport Terminal Number One. The hut was home to some lizards and to the island's one taxi driver who had sequestered it as his office and gasoline store. The airstrip itself had been built to serve a golf and diving resort that a consortium of Dutch and American businessmen had planned to build on Straker's Cay, but the money had run out before the hotel or marina had been built and all that was left of their grandiose plans was this pinkish runway made of compacted coral and a few abandoned cement mixers which rusted forlornly where the hotel's swimming pool was to have been built. The Maggot, who refused to wear a seat belt, shoved his throttles forward, and I felt the sweat trickling down my belly as the brakes were released and the small plane thundered down the rough surface. ‘It plays hell with the tyres, senator!’ The Maggot yelled over the howling engine noise. ‘What does?’ The senator shouted back. ‘Runways made of crushed coral! As likely as not we'll blow a tyre, slew off, and become three small puddles of melted fat in a blackened and twisted plane wreck!’ The senator blanched and leaned back. I had heard it all before and so was a little more sanguine. The Maggot, pleased to have spoilt someone's day, pulled back the stick and we liked safely off the runway and there was suddenly a wonderful rush of cool air coming from an overhead vent. We banked over Bonefish's house and I waved at Thessy who was standing beside Masquerade . Thessy would follow on the weekend ferry, arriving at Grand Bahama on the same day as the senator's twins. The Maggot's Beechcraft clawed higher, its progress punctuated by the alarm sirens that the Maggot ignored and which the senator had learned not to worry about. Once, when an alarm became peculiarly insistent, the Maggot thumped the  instrument panel until it stopped. ‘I think that goddamn racket means we should all be dead,’ he announced cheerfully, then carried on with an involved story of how he had once won undying glory by intercepting a pass against the Philadelphia Faggots. In the senator the Maggot had found a listener who was only too eager to hear his tales of goal-line stands and blocked punts, concussed running backs and sacked quarterbacks. The one subject we did not talk about was why the senator had flown to Straker's Cay to meet me. I knew the Maggot was dying to hear the senator's business, but even the Maggot had enough delicacy to wait until we had safely delivered the senator to Nassau before asking. But once Crowninshield was gone, and when we had refuelled the Beechcraft and put a crate of beer on to one of her back seats, the Maggot demanded to know everything. I suspected that he was hoping to hear that the senator had been arranging for an illicit love affair on board Wavebreaker . We had embarked two such affairs in the last year; the most memorable being an English lawyer who had arrived with his French mistress, but only after telling his wife that he was attending a legal conference in Brussels and, to preserve the lie, he had been forced to hide every inch of his pallid skin in case a sun-tan betrayed him. The French girl, to Thessy's infinite embarrassment, had strolled stark naked about Wavebreaker 's deck while the lawyer had cowered in the stateroom cloaked like an Ayatollah with impetigo. The Maggot, disappointed that the senator's business offered no such rich pickings of gossip, scowled at me. ‘You mean you're just babysitting two rich junkies?’ ‘You've got it.’ ‘Shee-it.’ We had at last taken off from Nassau and were banking north to where three American warships sliced white water. I opened us each a beer, then idly unfolded the aviation chart that the Maggot had stuck down between our seats. It looked very different to a nautical chart and made little sense to me, but I gradually deciphered some of the meaning from its weird markings. ‘You ain't going to have fun,’ the Maggot said suddenly. ‘I'm sorry?’ ‘You ain't going to have fun with two goddamn cocaine addicts. That stuff is the hardest to kick.’ ‘So the senator told me.’ ‘And there ain't no magic pill that will do it.’ Maggovertski sounded unusually sombre. He lit a cigarette. ‘I hate cocaine,’ he said finally, and he surprised me by saying it for the Maggot had always struck me as one of life's rebels. If he discovered a new rule he would immediately seek a way of breaking it, and I had assumed that he would have some sympathy with those who flouted the laws against drugs, yet there was no denying the genuine anger in his voice when he talked of cocaine. He must have sensed my puzzlement, for he offered a reluctant explanation. ‘I knew a girl who got hooked on cocaine. She taught in a health club; aerobics, that kind of thing, and the next we knew she was wearing hot pants on a street corner in New York and strutting her stuff at the cars. Jesus, if you knew how hard we tried to get her off that damned powder.’ ‘Did you succeed?’ He paused, and finally shook his head. ‘Last time I saw her she was doing a peep-show in Pittsburgh. Hell, Nick, I tried to get her out of that place, but she didn't care. All she wanted to do was shovel that crap up her nose, and if that's how someone wants to pass their time, then there's diddly-squat you can do to stop them.’ He had sounded immensely sad as he spoke, and I wondered if the girl had meant more to him than being merely a casual friend, but I did not like to ask and Maggovertski was clearly disinclined to explain more, so I just stared down at the aerial chart, and I suddenly noticed, in an otherwise empty space beneath an intersection of two air corridors, the tiny island of Murder Cay. The chart, either printed before the government's name change or else blithely ignoring it, noted the existence of a 2500-foot paved airstrip. ‘Is 2500 feet long for a runway?’ I asked Maggot. ‘Two five? Short as a quarterback's dick.’ He was evidently still thinking of the girl, for the obscenity was automatic and his voice was clipped and distant. ‘Have you ever flown into Murder Cay?’ I asked him. The big shaggy head turned to look at me. He frowned and sucked on his cigarette and I somehow got the impression that my question had annoyed him, but when he answered his voice was mild enough. ‘It's a snakepit, Nick. Leave it alone.’ ‘So who are the snakes?’ I insisted. ‘The dickheads who bought the place, of course.’ He paused to pull on his beer bottle which, emptied, he tossed out through the tiny triangular window at his left elbow. ‘I ran a couple of passengers there before the dickheads bought the island. It was a real nice place two years ago; nothing but luxury houses for the super-rich, but then the snakes bought it and they've painted a big yellow cross on their runway. You know what a big yellow cross on a runway means? It means keep away if you want to go on living.’ ‘So who are the new owners?’ I tried again. ‘Never been introduced to them, Nick.’ ‘Drug people?’ ‘Of course!’ The Maggot assumed I had already known that. I looked down at the chart and saw that the island was not so very far off our course, and I knew that the Beechcraft was brim-full with fuel. ‘You fancy having a look at the island?’ The Maggot laughed. ‘What's made you feel suicidal? Did you get bored with waiting for Ellen to drop her panties?’ ‘I'm just curious,’ I said with as much innocence as I could muster, ‘but of course, if you're scared of the place…’ ‘Oh, damn you.’ I had reckoned that an accusation of fear would sting the Maggot, and even before he interrupted me he had banked the plane westwards. He snatched the chart off my lap and worked out a crude course for the remote island. ‘So why do you want to stir the bastards up?’ he grumbled. I told him about Hirondelle and how Deacon Billingsley had lied about the yacht's fate, and I confessed that though  there was nothing I could do about a corrupt policeman, nor about what I strongly suspected had been the murder of a yacht's crew, I was still curious about the island. ‘Billingsley's a bastard.’ The Maggot, who had lived long enough in the Bahamas to learn and relish all the important gossip, growled the verdict. ‘You want to stay upwind of him.’ ‘McIllvanney says that Billingsley owns a house on Murder Cay.’ ‘That figures,’ the Maggot said gloomily. ‘The dickheads know that the best way of keeping the Americans off their backs is by buying themselves a slice of the local law.’ His disgruntled voice made it seem as though the precautions of the drug smugglers formed a personal affront to his patriotism. Yet if anyone's patriotism should have been affronted by what happened in the islands, it was the Bahamians, for they were forced to endure the indignity of having another nation's law-enforcement agencies operating in their waters. The islands had always been a smugglers' paradise, and had proved a perfect place to stockpile cocaine before running it across the narrow Straits of Florida to the waiting American markets. The American government had pressed the Bahamians to clean out the drug lords, but instead the trade had flourished until the Americans finally insisted that their own coastguard be allowed to patrol Bahamian waters. A scintilla of Bahamian pride was preserved by the presence of a native officer on every American boat or helicopter, but no one really believed the polite fiction that the local officer was thus in command. ‘But we ain't in command either,’ the Maggot said sourly. ‘We can stop a boat at sea, but we sure as hell can't put a foot on dry land without Bahamian permission. And you can bet your pretty ass that your policeman friend is making sure that permission to search Murder Cay is never given, or if it is, that the guys on the island are well warned before our boys get anywhere near.’ ‘We?’ It was so incongruous to hear the Maggot aligning  himself with the forces of law that I was forced to ask the question. ‘Our boys?’ ‘I keep thinking of that girl in Pittsburgh,’ he said with a bitter ruefulness, ‘and how the bastards who run the peep-show have to put sawdust on the booth floors every hour. You don't get much lower than that, Nick, and if anyone wants to kick the balls of the people who put her there, then those are my guys.’ He paused to light another cigarette, then nodded through his scratched windscreen. ‘I reckon that's your snakepit, Nick.’ Far ahead, and blurred by the heat haze, there was a bright green dot of an island ringed by coral-fretted water. No other land was visible. The Maggot turned in his seat and rummaged in his camera bag until he found a battered Nikon and a roll of black and white film. ‘Take some pictures for me. You never know, some customer might want a snap of Murder Cay one day.’ By the time I had loaded the camera we were already close to the reefs that formed the Devil's Necklace. The shadow of our plane skipped across the bright sea, then flickered over the outer coral. We were approaching the island from the south-east, coming with the wind at a height of six thousand feet. The island was shaped rather like an anchor. The airstrip, with its unfriendly yellow cross that warned strange aircraft from landing, had been built across the curved flukes of the anchor, which otherwise seemed to be covered in low scrub, slash pine and sea-grape. The surprisingly big houses were all built on the western side of the north-south shank of the anchor that was thick with palm trees and vivid with bright blue swimming pools. The rest of the shank was a long narrow golf course, punctuated with sand traps. I twisted in the seat to see that there were a dozen or so boats moored in the protected crook of the easternmost anchor fluke. The Maggot dipped the starboard wing to let me take a picture of the deep water channel that dog-legged in from the west. We flew above the skeletal radio mast and I stared down at the row of huge houses. No one and nothing stirred there. ‘They spent a fortune developing the place,’ the Maggot said, ‘but the rich folks never came, so they sold it to the rich dickheads instead.’ We flew out across the northern reefs. ‘One more pass?’ I asked John. ‘Why not?’ ‘And a bit lower?’ ‘Yeah, maybe.’ He had turned to fly around the eastern edge of the island's encircling reefs and was now staring intently at the houses, searching for any signs of danger, but it seemed as though Murder Cay was deserted. ‘What the hell,’ the Maggot said, and he wrenched the plane round in a tight turn until we were aimed plumb at the island's southernmost tip, then he dropped the nose ready to make one high speed and low level pass above the Cay. ‘That's friendly!’ he shouted over the engine noise, and he pointed through the windscreen at the concrete airstrip which not only had the yellow cross painted huge at its western end, but also had two trucks parked in its centre line, thus making it impossible for any plane to land. Despite the obstructions it was clear that aircraft did use the runway, for it was marked by the black rubber streaks of fresh tyre marks, but the two trucks, together with the yellow cross, were evidence that the runway could only be used by invitation. We slashed across the shank of the island, then we were over the anchorage and I had a glimpse of a sailing boat's shadow black on the bed of the lagoon before our own winged shadow whipped across a gaggle of powerboats. We were going too fast to see any details of the moored vessels so I just snapped a random photograph and, at the very same instant, the Maggot swore and banked and rammed the throttles hard forward. We were side-slipping, starboard wing down, falling to earth with our engines howling. I flailed for support as the camera flew up to the padded ceiling. The Maggot whooped, dragged the stick back and our earthwards wing lifted and suddenly we were screaming just above the palm trees, close to the tiled roofs and at a speed that seemed to be doubled  because of our proximity to the ground. The camera, re-entering the world of normal gravity, dropped hard beside my shoes. Beer bottles were everywhere. One broke, shattering liquid across the side windows. I had a glimpse of a fair-haired girl staring wide-eyed and terrified from a tennis court, her racket held loose by her side and tennis balls scattered at her feet and, though the trees and buildings and gardens were nothing but a high-speed blur, my mind nevertheless registered with a startling clarity that the girl had been completely naked. The plane's engines were screaming. We whipped over the northernmost house, across the beach, and thus out to sea again. ‘What the hell?’ I managed to ask. ‘They fired at us! goddamn tracer bullets! Jesus!’ The Maggot did not seem scared, but rather stung by the challenge. We were over the lagoon now, racing towards the northern strands of the Devil's Necklace, but low enough so that the wash of our twin propellers was whipping the blue water into a wake of white-hazed foam. ‘Shee-it!’ The Maggot said with inappropriate exultation, then twisted his head to stare back at the island. ‘Let's go see them again!’ ‘Are you sure that's wise?’ I asked, but I might as well have saved my breath because the plane suddenly climbed, banked, then began descending fast towards the island again. The Maggot was growling to himself, relishing the confrontation. Sunlight reflected from a window among the palm trees to lance a sliver of dazzling light at our cockpit, then the reflection was gone and we were at sea level, engines screaming, and I fumbled for the camera, prayed it had not broken when it fell from the ceiling, and took another picture just before Maggot lifted the aircraft's nose so that we swooped up and over the palm trees that edged the beach. He jinked left, then right, throwing the plane into such steep and sudden turns that I was alternately jerked hard against the cockpit's side window and then against his broad shoulder. The Maggot was not taking evasive action but quartering the ground in search of our enemy. ‘There!’ he said abruptly and threw the plane straight again, but this time  dropping the nose, and I saw a jeep churning dust from the dirt road which ran the length of the island's long shank, between the golf course and the houses, and just as I saw the jeep so the red tracer bullets began climbing from a machine-gun mounted in the back of the vehicle. ‘Oh, Jesus wept,’ I said, snapped a last picture, then ducked down in momentary expectation of the windscreen shattering into a million bright scraps. ‘Fuck you,’ the Maggot screamed at whoever fired at him and I looked out of the Beechcraft's side window to see palm trees going past at over 150 miles an hour and above us. Above us. Truly. And I thought it really had been a very good life, a fun life, despite Ellen never having gone to bed with me, and I wondered if my father would even notice my death, then the Maggot whooped with glee, hauled back on the stick, and our plane was screaming up into the wide blue lovely bullet-free sky and the Maggot was laughing and slapping my shoulder. ‘Wasn't that just the best goddamned fun you can have this side of a blanket?’ ‘Was it?’ ‘You missed it?’ He sounded aggrieved and astonished. ‘Missed what?’ ‘I ran that turkey clean off the road! Shit, but I gave that bastard a headache!’ ‘I think you gave me one too,’ I said, then, very gingerly, I straightened up and twisted round to see that Murder Cay was far behind us and well out of machine-gun range. ‘You're mad,’ I courteously informed John Maggovertski. He laughed. ‘You're the one who wanted to see the island.’ We were gently circling northwards now, heading for home. ‘So now you've seen it.’ I tried to relax, letting the cold air from the vent cool the sweat from my face. My right hand shook as I remembered the sudden fear of seeing the crimson tracer flick up from the ground. ‘Hell!’ I protested. ‘They can't just open fire!’ The Maggot grinned through the black tangle of his beard. ‘Nick, they are richer than your wettest dreams, and like all the very rich they think they are above the law.’ He was speaking very casually, but I saw that his right hand, like mine, was shaking. It is not pleasant to be shot at, and even the pleasure of being missed is spoilt by the mind's habit of constructing alternative scenarios; if the machine-gunner had been a bit quicker to react, or had led us with more skill, we would now be nothing but a heap of molten metal somewhere in the sea-grape. The Maggot shook his head. ‘Do you have any idea just how rich these people are?’ ‘Very, I imagine.’ ‘There's an island not far from here that has just two thousand inhabitants, and last year, Nick, according to a banker I sometimes fly to Miami, those two thousand dirt poor and unemployed islanders deposited 24.3 million dollars in the one and only bank on their impoverished little island.’ The Maggot laughed. ‘Not bad, eh? And I do not believe that 24.3 million dollars a year is the average reward for selling coconut milk and conch shells to honky tourists. That money is pure commission, Nick, a mere ten per cent of the value of the cocaine that was stored on their island while it awaited transportation to the good old US of A; and neither you, nor I, nor even the dickheads in the Drug Enforcement Administration will ever know just how much money was not put in the bank, but stored in paper bags under the bed.’ He sounded depressed by the thought, but then cheered himself up by asking me for a beer. I opened two bottles that I retrieved from the sticky mess on the cabin floor. We flew the rest of the way home in silence. It was not till we saw the captive aerostat balloon with its ever watching radar that the Americans had hoisted over Grand Bahama to probe for boats or aircraft smuggling drugs, that the Maggot again spoke, and by then he had recaptured all his old insouciance. ‘At this time, if you'd care to fold up your tray table and extinguish your hopes, we shall land this little sucker. Thank you for flying Maggovertski Airways; please return the stewardess her pantyhose, put her in the  upright position, and kindly pray that the tyres don't blow.’ They did not, and thus I came back to Wavebreaker . I went back to the Maggot's foul house, where he kept his killer dog and astonishing collection of guns, and we sat on his makeshift verandah that overlooked a noxious and polluted creek and shared a few whiskies as he told me an incredibly tedious tale of how he had once sacked the quarterback of the San Francisco Sugar Plums. I retaliated with detailed instructions on how to bowl off-breaks to left-handers on a drying pitch, and we eventually declared a truce as we watched the sun sink across the oil-storage tanks beyond the creek. He offered me his spare bed for the night, but I could not stand the stench of the creek, and I wanted to make an early start on the work I had to do on Wavebreaker , so I caught the bus to McIllvanney's boatyard. Naturally no one was there and the gate was locked and the top of the fence was rimmed with razor-wire so I could not climb it. I had not kept my old key, because I had hoped that my association with Cutwater Charters was done, so I was forced to carry my heavy pack into the tangle of dark alleys that lay behind the straw market and where I planned to find Ellen and borrow her key. A tribe of stray cats scattered as I turned into the yard where Ellen's apartment lay. The archway was bright with the brass plates of the dozens of corporations who were registered at the address to avoid paying tax in their home countries. The courtyard was inhabited by three tethered goats that stared malevolently at me. The open-air stairways were shadowed with creepers and flickering with the eerie lights of televisions that glowed from within the screened windows of the small apartments. I climbed the two flights of stairs and walked down the rickety balcony which led to Ellen's small end room. A child was screaming in one of the flats, while two dogs were snarling as they fought in the wasteland beyond the apartment house. The chorus of televisions was tuned to an American game show in which competing families were leaping up and  down and screaming with apparent incontinence because they had won a trip to Disneyworld. Then, above all those discordant sounds, I heard Ellen's voice rise in sudden indignation. ‘No! No! No!’ I stopped outside her open window. Her room was lit by a single naked bulb which hung from the ceiling and shone harshly on Ellen who was standing in the doorway of her tiny bathroom. She was facing the window, but did not see me beyond its screen because she was staring at Matthew McIllvanney who seemed to fill the whole room with his malevolence. ‘I'm just asking you to think about it,’ I heard him say in a calm voice. ‘I've thought’— I could see Ellen was trying hard to recover her composure —‘and the answer is no.’ ‘Six hundred.’ McIllvanney's persistence in the face of any refusal was monotonous and relentless. ‘And I won't even take my usual commission on that, so you'll get to keep it all, and remember the agreed price is just a guaranteed minimum and there's always a tip. Isn't there always a tip, Bellybutton?’ ‘This one's a big tipper, Miss Ellen.’ Bellybutton laughed suggestively. He was standing just inside the front door and was thus hidden from me. ‘Shut up, you black bastard,’ McIllvanney snapped, then paused to light a cigarette. A small battery-powered fan whirled the smoke away and generally tried to stir up the humid air which played such havoc with Ellen's precious books in their orange-crate shelves. The Ulsterman blew smoke towards her. ‘Breakspear won't do the senator's cruise,’ he said, ‘so you'll lose that money, but if you work one night a week for me then you'll earn just as much anyway. And you're wanting to save money, isn't that right? So you can keep yourself while you write your book? So I'm offering you a good wage, girl! And this client's a good-looking fellow, isn't that right, Bellybutton? And he's already seen you, he likes you, and he's willing to pay you a professional's fee even though he knows you're an amateur, and —‘ ‘No!’ Ellen shouted again. ‘He might go to seven-fifty,’ McIllvanney said dubiously, as though the price was the only possible objection Ellen might have to whoring herself. That was as far as the conversation went, for I decided to end it by pushing open the screen door. All three stared in astonishment as I tossed my kit bag on to the floor. ‘I didn't have a key to the boatyard,’ I introduced myself, ‘so I thought I'd borrow Ellen's. I'm not interrupting anything, am I?’ ‘You are not, Nick, no!’ Ellen almost flew across the small room and, to my astonishment and probably to everyone else's, greeted me with a warm kiss. ‘What the hell are you doing here?’ McIllvanney asked sourly, while Bellybutton just grinned maliciously at me. ‘You sent the senator to see me? So he came, he saw, and he conquered me, which means I've agreed to do his charter. The Maggot flew me back, because if we want to leave on Sunday morning then we've got a heap of work to do first. God, I'm hungry.’ Ellen still clung to my arm. ‘We'll go out and eat,’ she said quickly, ‘I'll get ready,’and she twisted away to the bathroom, which also served as her wardrobe, and slammed the door to leave me alone with McIllvanney and Bellybutton. ‘If the suggestion I heard just now,’ I said to McIllvanney, ‘was what I thought it was, then don't make it again. Not to Ellen.’ McIllvanney found my defiance wonderfully amusing. ‘Who's to stop me.’ ‘Just me.’ He came and stood very close to me, trying to intimidate me as Billingsley had done. He blew cigarette smoke to sting my eyes. ‘Just because you were a poxy marine, your Holiness, doesn't make you tough.’ ‘Piss off.’ That also amused him. ‘Is there something going on between you and Ellen, now? Got your boots under her table, have you?’ ‘No,’ I said firmly, ‘so get out.’ ‘Did you know she's a Catholic?’ he asked me as though it really mattered, and he gestured with his cigarette at a crucifix that hung over the narrow bed, which I knew was there solely for sentimental purposes because it had belonged to Ellen's dead father, but to McIllvanney it was a challenge. ‘If I'd realised she was a taig I'd never have hired her.’ He used the Ulster slang, knowing I would have learned it during my tours of duty on attachment in Belfast. ‘Is it the papist meat that gets you going, Breakspear, is that it?’ McIllvanney laughed, then stepped quickly back as he sensed I might bring my knee up into his balls. Then, as if counter-attacking, he jabbed the cigarette towards my face. ‘I'll do business how I like, with whom I like, and when I like, and I don't need your focking permission to do it, Nicholas Breakspear. Nor does the girl have to agree to anything I ask. I'm not forcing her, I'm merely making a business proposition. Do you understand me?’ ‘Get out of here,’ I said. McIllvanney continued to stare into my eyes, but he spoke to Bellybutton who was cackling behind me. ‘He should have put on a pair of tights and joined his daddy in front of the fairy-lights.’ The Ulsterman's scorn was like a blowtorch, then he turned away, clicked his fingers at Bellybutton, and the two of them were gone. Ellen and I did not go out to eat. She was too shocked by McIllvanney's offer and, at the same time, she was paradoxically surprised at herself for being so shocked. ‘I really thought I could handle something like that! I really did! I knew I wasn't in danger, because they weren't going to rape me, but it really, really upset me!’ ‘It upset me,’ I said. ‘Shit!’ Ellen was too angry with herself to be assuaged by or even interested in my sympathy. She paced up and down the tiny room while I sat on her bed, and she explained to me that McIllvanney had been approached by a client who had apparently seen Ellen and authorised McIllvanney to offer her the money. McIllvanney had made the offer very dispassionately, but that businesslike approach only seemed to add to  Ellen's fury. ‘What kind of a jerk pays that money?’ she asked me. ‘A rich and randy jerk?’ I suggested, and decided not to tell her that for most of McIllvanney's girls six or seven hundred dollars a night was small change. ‘And get this.’ She whirled on me. ‘This jerk has got something about redheads! Rut before he'd pay any money he had to be satisfied that I was red-haired all over! I mean, Jesus! How nauseating can you get?’ ‘Who was he?’ ‘McIllvanney wouldn't say.’ She shuddered, then plucked some typed sheets of paper from the small table under the window and stuffed them into a folder. The floor was crowded with cardboard boxes that were filled with leaflets for the Literacy Project that Ellen helped in her spare time. I idly picked up one of the leaflets which had two pictures on its cover; the first illustration showed a happy black family, all neatly dressed and reading books around a table that was filled with platefuls of food and with jugs labelled ‘milk’. The second picture, clearly designed to demonstrate the rewards of illiteracy, showed a scabby-looking native dressed in a threadbare loincloth who crouched in the mud outside a grass hut and who seemed to be sharing his lunch bowl with a baboon. Ellen caught my eye, looked down at the ridiculous leaflet, and suddenly we both began to laugh helplessly. ‘I know they're absurd.’ She had tears in her eyes as she tried to recover from the laughter. ‘They were printed for Africa sometime in the 1950s and the United Nations sent them to our project, God knows why. There are too many to throw away all at once, so I take a handful out every day and hide them in someone's garbage can. They make rotten toilet paper, and I don't know what else to do with them, and, oh Nick’— she suddenly sat heavily beside me on the bed —‘you're a good man and sometimes I think how nice it would be to have a good man in my life again.’ ‘I'm available.’ She kissed me on the nose, but then, as though rejecting her  idea of adopting a good man, stood up briskly. ‘You reek of cheap whisky. I suppose you've been with that awful Mug-govertski?’ ‘He sends his most fervent and undying love.’ She mocked that assertion with a grimace. ‘If you want a sandwich there's some margarine and foul cheese in the cupboard and some not very fresh bread in the bin.’ ‘You're sure you don't want to go out to eat?’ She shook her head. ‘I want to write up my notes.’ ‘About what happened tonight?’ I sounded surprised. ‘Sure, why not? But I need a shower first.’ She went into the bathroom and I made my own supper by slicing some of the foul cheese and shoving it between two slices of greased plastic bread. Then I ate the sandwich as I walked back to Wavebreaker . Alone. Ellen was perversely unhappy about the Crowninshield charter. She had nagged me to accept it, but now she behaved as though I had done her a disservice by doing so. ‘The senator obviously just wants us to drown his children so they can't embarrass him when the time comes to run for President,’ she told me next morning. ‘I accused him of that,’ I said, proud of having anticipated Ellen's diagnosis, ‘and he told me he'd rather lose the election than lose his children.’ Ellen put down her cup of coffee and stared at me as though I had gone completely mad. ‘He's a politician, Nick,’ she said at last, and in a voice she might have used to reason with a three-year-old, ‘and politicians would sell their mothers, let alone their kids, to win an election. He's just using us!’ I shrugged, but said nothing. Ellen had bought some melon and coffee on her way to the boatyard and we were eating a late breakfast in Wavebreaker 's cockpit. Bellybutton was pressure-hosing a hull across the yard, while McIllvanney was evidently taking another day off. I hoped that he was avoiding us because he felt ashamed of his offer to Ellen, but I doubted whether Matthew McIllvanney had ever felt ashamed of anything. ‘God!’ Ellen said in a tone which implied that I had entirely misunderstood the senator's motives, which she would now have to explain to me by the application of sound feminist arguments. Sound feminist argument usually means making the nearest male look like an idiot, which in Ellen's case was not a very demanding task. ‘We are talking about a man's image, Nicholas. If he runs for President next year then he's got to be clean, and that means that the issue of his drug-sodden kids will have to be defused. And above all, he's got to keep Rickie out of prison, and that's clearly our job. We have to clean the boy up so the judge will merely tap his wrist.’ ‘Is that so bad?’ I demanded. ‘I just don't like being used by rich politicians,’ Ellen said angrily, though I silently noted she had no objections to taking their money. ‘At least we'll be taking two kids off drugs,’ I said warmly, ‘and that's something to be proud of.’ ‘Jesus wept’'she said in disgust. ‘I do hate goddamn junkies, and I especially hate rich goddamn junkies. They don't even have the excuse of poverty for their addiction.’ ‘I'm sorry,’ I said. I don't know why I apologised because it was not my fault that the Crowninshield twins were cocaine freaks, nor that their father wanted to charter Wavebreaker , but I sympathised with Ellen's distaste for cocaine and was foolish enough to say as much. ‘Don't be so downright stupid, Nick,’ Ellen witheringly rejected my sympathy. ‘Of course I don't disapprove of cocaine. You forget that I was an academic.’ I tried to work out an obvious connection between scholarship and cocaine and could not, but knew better than to ask. ‘But you can't possibly approve of drugs,’ I said instead. ‘I neither approve nor disapprove. Cocaine is merely a recreational drug and, taken to excess, like alcohol or nicotine, it is undoubtedly dangerous, but judiciously used it can be a source of harmless pleasure, and even of intellectual stimulation. Eat your melon, it's good for you.’ ‘I don't believe this.’ I stared in genuine horror at her. I  was trying to imagine a girl in a Pittsburgh peep-show, put there by cocaine. ‘Did you feed that kind of intellectual garbage to your students?’ I asked Ellen. She stared defiantly across the cockpit table at me. ‘Nicholas Breakspear,’ she said at last, ‘there are times when you can be excessively tedious. You are a turkey —’ she cast about for an even worse insult, ‘a puritan!’ ‘Rickie Crowninshield,’ I said stiffly, ‘has already lost the sight of one eye because of cocaine, and if he doesn't stop using the drug then he will almost certainly go to jail or even kill himself with an overdose.’ ‘So Rickie Crowninshield is an irresponsible idiot,’ Ellen said coldly, ‘but you can't run society on the assumption that everyone is a retard, and you have to accept that there will be casualties in a free society. If you're so intent on keeping the young alive then why don't you ban rock climbing? Or surfing? Or motorcycles? Or alcohol? Or have you forgotten that America did once try to ban alcohol, and look what happened!’ Her voice was scathing. ‘The vaunted land of the free became the last best hope of organised crime, and it has never recovered. The clear and obvious course for America is to legalise cocaine so the trade can be controlled, but there is no way that we shall ever persuade the airheads in Congress of that most obvious piece of wisdom. If you don't want the melon, I do.’ ‘But you do believe the trade should be controlled?’ I was seeking a scrap of common ground on which we could mutually back away from the argument. ‘I naturally believe that the financial profits of the drug-suppliers are offensive,’ Ellen said, ‘which is why I've only used cocaine on a handful of occasions. I can't say I liked it much.’ She poured out the last of the coffee, then looked up into my horrified eyes. ‘Oh, come on, Nick! Don't be so innocent! And stop worrying, I won't reveal my views on the drug to the twins. The poor dim little creatures doubtless need all the help they can get, and I promise not to confuse them with anything so threatening as an idea.’ ‘Robin-Anne's not dim,’ I said. ‘She passed her degree!’ ‘My dear Nicholas, a mentally retarded slug could get a degree in Liberal Arts! For God's sake, the silly little twinkle might as well have majored in handwriting or media studies!’ Ellen gave me a dismissive glance. ‘Still, I suppose to the uneducated even a degree in Liberal Arts is impressive.’ Cocaine thus became another of the subjects which Ellen and I decorously avoided, like the existence of God, the wisdom of my having been a marine, feminism and the cartoons in the New Yorker . Ellen was adamantly opposed to the first two and a noisy supporter of the last two, while my position was more or less the opposite. God alone knew why we wanted to sail to New Zealand together, except that in a strange way we were friends. But for the moment we were friends who had to prepare Wavebreaker for a possible Atlantic crossing. Thessy and I would have a chance to strengthen the rigging during our two-week trial period with the twins, but some jobs simply could not be done at sea. Thus I stripped out all Wavebreaker 's unnecessary furniture and equipment, and I installed extra fresh-water tanks and fuel bunkers. I made storm shields for the big cabin windows and skylights. They were a delight for the charterers in the Bahamian lagoons, but in an Atlantic storm such wide windows could be our death warrants for if Wavebreaker fell off a big wave the glass could be driven out of the windows and the boat be filling with water in seconds, and so I cut and shaped sheet steel shutters that could be bolted over the boat's glass at the first sign of bad weather. The shutters' anchor points had to be welded to the hull and, especially at the stern where the windows wrapped round Wavebreaker 's counter, the bolts looked intrusive and ugly, but better that than to be a good-looking boat fifty fathoms down and still sinking. Ellen and I worked hard that week and, on the Saturday, as though to commiserate with ourselves on this being our last day alone together, we stopped work at midday and took a bus to Mama Sipcott's Café on the beach where we ate lobster and  drank too much of Mama's sticky-sweet white wine. Ellen proposed a toast to the prospect of her first Atlantic crossing under sail. I drank to the toast, though I was not at all sure that we would actually make the crossing in Wavebreaker . The best season for an eastwards voyage was already past, though it was just possible that we might run far north and cross in the high latitudes where, even in summer, we could expect fog, rain and cold. I knew Ellen hated the cold, and I tried to warn her of the conditions we might expect in those latitudes. I told her of the big green seas, all crinkled and slow, heaving up astern as the icy wind scoured their tops into freezing spume. Ellen smiled at my enthusiastic description. ‘My poetic and romantic Nick.’ She cocked her head on one side and gave me a long scrutiny, almost as though she had never seen me before. ‘You did inherit a lot from your father.’ ‘You'll find that northern seas are oddly more threatening’— I ignored her insult —‘because sunlight on water always makes it seem less formidable. But if we travel the northern route we probably won't see the sun for weeks, and the daylight is grey and the sea is green and grey, while at night you just see the cold white wavetops hissing out of blackness. It seemed curious to be describing such ice-cold seas while sitting in a palm-thatched Bahamian beach café that looked on to a shoreline where pelicans perched under the diamond-hard sun. ‘You'll need long johns,’ I went on gleefully, ‘and thermal underwear and layers of greasy-wool sweaters and good oilies and a woolly hat and a towelling scarf to stop the seas slopping down your neck and good sea-boots and as many pairs of gloves as you can find, because gloves never stay dry and —‘ ‘Shut up,’ Ellen said firmly. ‘I thought you wanted to go.’ ‘I do, and I shall go. But I also want to enjoy the anticipation of going.’ I smiled. ‘Just pray we don't get a North Atlantic fog, because in those latitudes we could roll in the swells for days, with the moisture beading the shrouds and the air as cold as charity, and always being terrified that a super-tanker will barrel out of the muck at full speed to thump you under her bows without even knowing you were ever there.’ Ellen borrowed the adjustable spanner that Mama Sipcott provided as a lobster-claw cracker. ‘Don't come the Ancient Mariner with me, Nicholas Breakspear.’ She opened a claw and pulled out a sliver of succulent flesh. ‘If we encounter fog over the North Atlantic we will turn on the radar, switch on the Satnav, and start the engines. These are the 1980s, not the twelfth century when your namesake was Pope. He wasn't even a very good Pope.’ ‘He was excellent!’ I protested. ‘Authoritative, unimaginative, anti-Irish, and a lousy politician,’ Ellen commented, then she smiled and pushed the lobster meat into my mouth. ‘God knows why I like you, Nicholas Breakspear.’ ‘Because of my sexy legs,’ I assured her. She laughed. Mama Sipcott's butter sauce was gleaming on her chin and she looked very beautiful. Beauty, I thought, was something to do with the way a face betrayed character. She seemed oblivious to my scrutiny. ‘I suppose I like you,’ she said after a moment's thought, ‘because you lack guile. You remind me of a cocker spaniel I once owned.’ ‘Oh, woof-woof. Thanks a million.’ She made a face at me. ‘You'd prefer to be villainous?’ I nodded. ‘I've always wanted to be mysterious and a little bit sinister and have girls swoon when they see me.’ Like my father, I realised, and tried to reject the thought. To Ellen, my wish to be mysterious was a hoot. ‘Forget it. You have an open face, Nick, and you smile too easily, and you're much too honest, and you really can't resist helping people; and frankly, you're about as subtle as a Mack truck. As a villain, Nick, you just don't measure up.’ I turned and looked at myself in the cracked Cutty Sark Whisky mirror behind Mama Sipcott's bar. Hamlet, not Macbeth or Richard III, stared back. I turned again to Ellen, pretty  freckled Ellen with her high cheekbones and clever green eyes and flaming hair and mocking smile, and I suddenly wondered whether McIllvanney had spoken to her again in the last week. ‘Did McIllvanney —’ I began tentatively. ‘Oh, yes,’ Ellen cut in smoothly, and without any disgust in her voice. ‘In fact he increased the fee to a thousand dollars.’ She sounded perversely proud of her increased value, and again I thought it best not to inform her that a bubblehead like Donna could earn twice that fee in a single night. ‘I told him to go jump in a lake,’ Ellen said very calmly, ‘and then I told him that just as soon as I've finished with the Crowninshield twins I shall be sailing away —’she clinked her glass on mine, ‘with you.’ It was the first time she had actually said for certain that she would sail with me and I could not hide my joy, and Ellen, seeing that pleasure, laughed at it. ‘Of course I'm coming with you, Nick! I was always planning to sail with you! Do you think I'd pass up an adventure like that?’ So who cared about having a too-honest face? I was lucky Nick and she was pretty Ellen, and so I ordered another bottle of the sticky white wine and we let our dreams take wings. For we were going to sea."
FIC FIC-CCW-003 -0.11 "Ellen and I lingered on in Mama Sipcott's for another hour and a half; indulging in the sailor's shorebound pastime of planning the perfect voyage. We decided that Masquerade would sail from the Bahamas to Panama, and thence to the Galapagos where we would find Darwin's giant tortoises. Then we would sail south to Easter Island to explore the mysterious statues before going to the mutineers' refuge on Pitcairn Island. After that we would go to Tahiti, and I saw the excitement grow in Ellen as she realised that these plans were so close to coming true. It was an excitement that matched my own, for I had never sailed the South Seas and I had long dreamed of that scatter of tiny, magically named islands strewn across one third of a globe. By the time we had drunk our third bottle of wine Ellen and I had long reached New Zealand and were already sailing north towards New Caledonia. We were happy. We caught the bus back to Ellen's apartment and collected her clothes and notebooks. She was moving back on board Wavebreaker in preparation for the next day's early departure. I carried her luggage to the yard, noting that even Ellen's strident feminism evaporated in the face of two heavy bags and tropical heat. Once in the boatyard Ellen ran ahead of me, evidently eager to reach Wavebreaker 's air conditioning. Then, as she reached the dock's edge, she suddenly checked. ‘What on earth is that? Oh, no!’ She began to run again. When I reached the water's edge I understood her dismay. A large sports-fishing boat was moored alongside Wavebreaker , but moored so crudely that whoever had brought the powerboat alongside the schooner had not bothered to put out fenders, but instead had gouged long ugly gashes in Wavebreaker 's white paint. Yet even the gashes were not so ugly as the expensive boat that had caused them. There was nothing wrong with the boat's lines, which were sleekly functional, but her long powerful hull, her upperworks, and even the interior of her capacious  working deck had all been painted with a wartime dazzle paint. The seemingly random and jagged-edged pattern of blue, black, silver, green and white had been designed to disguise a boat's shape from the prying eyes of U-Boat captains, so it seemed somewhat fanciful to thus camouflage a pleasure boat in the Bahamas. This boat was called Dream Baby , and she was clearly an expensive infant for rods and whip-aerials and outriggers splayed from her upperworks like the antennae of some outlandish insect. She boasted a harpoon walkway, a flybridge, and, above the highest wheel-platform, an aluminium canopy which held a radar aerial. The fighting chair on her aft deck had thick white leather straps giving it the appearance of a padded electric chair, while the dazzle paint gave the boat an oddly military look that was completed by the number 666 that was painted on her bows in silver-edged black numerals like those warships use to display their commissioning numbers. The boat's wrap-around windscreens were made of black polarised glass which only added to Dream Baby 's ugly air of menace. Ellen, unencumbered with luggage, had already reached Wavebreaker and taken two plastic fenders from a locker. She swung lithely down to Dream Baby 's gaudily painted deck and cushioned the two hulls. ‘How bad is the damage?’ I called down to her when I reached Wavebreaker . ‘It's scraped back to bare metal!’ ‘I'll give it some paint.’ Wavebreaker 's hull was made of steel and, while such hulls are marvellously strong and safe, they are soon weakened if their steel is exposed to salt air. I had to paint the gashes as soon as possible so that rust would not begin to bite into Wavebreaker 's long sleekness. Ellen looked around the oddly painted powerboat. ‘You'd think someone rich enough to own a rig like this could afford a pair of fenders.’ ‘Who cares? Just cut the damn boat loose,’ I said vengefully. Ellen ignored my advice while I, obedient to the rule that if  a job needed doing then do it without delay, found a pot of white paint and dug through the locker for a clean brush. Then, from behind me, an unfamiliar voice sounded: ‘Oh, ring my bells.’ It was a man's voice; drawling and lazy. I twisted around and almost blinded myself by staring straight into the sun, but then, through the dizzying glare, I made out the long silhouette of a tall man who seemed, incongruously, to be dressed in a long, transparent dressing gown. He was emerging in stately fashion from Wavebreaker 's companionway and, though I could see he was tall and lanky and had a ponytail of hair, I could make out no details of his face. ‘Who the hell are you?’ I demanded. The man ignored me, walking instead towards Ellen who, dressed only in shorts and T-shirt, was climbing long-legged over Wavebreaker 's rail. ‘Be still my restless heart,’ the man had a strong, caressing voice and the slow luscious accent of America's deep south. ‘Dear lady, dear lady, to think that I might have lived my whole life through and never seen you. Oh, lay me down, just lay me down.’ Ellen, usually so quick with a scornful reply, just stood and stared at the elegant stranger who stopped one pace away from her, took her hand, then bowed above her fingers. He kissed the air a fastidiously polite inch above her knuckles, then closed his eyes. ‘Dear sweet Lord above, I do thank Thee for Thy kindness in showing me this lovely woman before I died.’ To my astonishment and chagrin Ellen left her hand in his as he opened his eyes and smiled at her. ‘My name,’ he stroked her with his voice, ‘is Jesse Isambard Sweetman. And who, dear creature, are you?’ Ellen still said nothing. I had straightened up and moved aside so that the sun no longer dazzled me and I could see Sweetman properly, and what I saw I did not like. His face was old and young, sardonic and knowing, amused and handsome; the face of a man who has seen the world's wickedness and knows how to match it with his own. His long black hair was tied into its ponytail with a velvet ribbon, his skin was parchment pale, and his eyes dark. I put his age at forty, but  even among men twenty years younger he would have been accounted handsome, and he knew it, for his expression showed both confidence and amusement as he continued to hold Ellen's hand, and he showed even more amusement when she suddenly realised just what liberty she was thus granting him and jerked her fingers swiftly away. Thus released, Jesse Sweetman turned to look at me. The dressing gown had proved to be a long, stylish, ankle-length duster coat which was loosely woven from a delicate white cotton. Beneath the filmy topcoat he wore a black shirt and black trousers that were tucked into tall black boots. It was a dramatic and impractical outfit of a kind I only expected to see on the male models who posed in the more outlandish fashion magazines that our rich clients brought aboard Wavebreaker , yet Jesse Isambard Sweetman managed to wear the elaborate style with an elegant insouciance. The only incongruous note was a cheap round badge, enamelled in red and yellow, that he wore on his shirt, which bore the legend ‘Just Say No!’. ‘You must be Nicholas Breakspear,’ he said carelessly, as though he did not much care whether I was or not. ‘Is that gaudy piece of junk your boat?’ I gestured to where Dream Baby 's aerials showed above Wavebreaker 's gunwale. Sweetman turned and pretended to notice the sports-fishing boat for the first time. ‘No,’ he said helpfully, then bestowed a patronising smile on me. ‘You look so like your father. It's really uncanny.’ ‘Did you bring that boat here?’ I persevered. ‘Oh, indeed I did,’ he said brightly, as though he merely indulged a rather dim child's curiosity. ‘Your mother was Malise Fielding, am I right? Or are you Lucy de Sills’ son?’ ‘Why the hell didn't you use fenders when you tied alongside?’ He sighed, intimating what a bore I was being. ‘I did not use fenders, Breakspear, because I despise precautions. Precautions are the symptoms of small and fearful minds. Precautions will not conquer empires, they will not build great cities, they will not transmute dreams into gold or carry  men across wide oceans, and precautions will not, emphatically not, win fair ladies,’ and here he turned to Ellen and lasciviously dropped his gaze to her long bare legs. Ellen twisted away and Sweetman laughed at her obvious discomfiture, then, as coolly as though he owned Wavebreaker , he stepped down into the central cockpit where he first brushed at, then sat on, one of the white cushioned seats by the ship's wheel. ‘I've had a look round the boat,’ he said very coolly, ‘and I approve of her. So tell me the cost of a week's charter.’ ‘The man you want to see,’ I said, ‘is called Matthew McIllvanney and his office is the pink building with the outside staircase. He's not here this afternoon, but you can doubtless telephone him next week.’ Sweetman took a pair of polarised sunglasses from his shirt pocket and put them on before inspecting me again. He did not seem to like what he saw. ‘You're really not being noticeably helpful,’ he said after a pause, ‘so let us try again shall we? Would you please tell me the high season price for one week?’ ‘How many passengers?’ Ellen asked before I could refuse to answer. Sweetman paused again, this time to light a long pale blue cigarette with a slim gold lighter. He shrugged. ‘Two, four, six passengers? Does it really matter?’ ‘One week in high season costs ten thousand US dollars for two people, and every extra couple is another thousand bucks.’ Ellen's voice was cold, as though she disliked satisfying his curiosity. ‘And to those prices you have to add the boat's running costs.’ ‘Which are?’ Sweetman asked carelessly. ‘A lot.’ Ellen said flatly. ‘You're talking fuel, food and liquor, plus any toys you might want aboard like scuba equipment, snorkels, jet-skis or sailboards.’ Sweetman drew on his fancy cigarette, then blew a plume of smoke into Wavebreaker 's rigging before smiling lazily at Ellen. ‘And tell me, sweet creature, do you count as a toy? Or are you a part of the initial ten thousand dollars?’ ‘Get off the boat,’ I said. ‘Shut up.’ He turned on me like a snake. ‘You're nothing but a hired hand, Breakspear, so shut the fuck up.’ He glanced at the paint pot and brush that I was still holding. ‘Go and paint something. Be useful.’ He stared into my eyes, challenging me to defy him, and when I did not move he looked back to Ellen. ‘I asked you a question, dear heart. Please be so good as to answer.’ ‘Get off this boat,’ I told him, but my anger only amused Sweetman who unfolded his long thin legs from the cushioned thwart. ‘Dick off,’ he said to me. I was surprised that he so eagerly sought to confront me. I am not a small man, nor am I a weakling, yet the thin Sweetman seemed unconcerned as I jumped down into the cockpit. Then I saw why he was so confident. He put a hand into a pocket of his elegant duster coat and brought out a small .22 pistol that he pointed at my face. ‘A ladies’ gun,’he said, ‘but remarkably effective at close range.’ ‘Nick!’ Ellen called warningly, as though I might not have seen the gun. The gun's threat had not stopped my advance. I was calling Sweetman's bluff, confident he would not dare pull the trigger, and equally confident that my marine training would let me turn him into mincemeat. I was also half drunk, and thus filled with the Dutch courage offered by Mama Sipcott's worst white wine. Sweetman stood. There was, at last, a look of alarm on his face, and I could see him wondering whether he really would have to pull the small trigger. He held the gun pointed at my eyes. I began to fear that he would fire, and a small sober part of my brain registered just how foolish this confrontation was; a contest caused solely by two male egos over a girl sworn to celibacy. ‘Stop it! Both of you! I mean it!’ Ellen's voice was suddenly a harsh scream, so harsh that we both looked towards her and saw that she was threatening both of us with one of Wavebreaker 's  heavy-duty fire extinguishers that she had snatched from its rack at the head of the main companionway. The cylinder was filled with a compressed chemical that would have smothered both Sweetman and me in an avalanche of nauseating foam. ‘Step back, Nick!’ Ellen said to me, her voice recovering its normal timbre. ‘But I'm only going to kill him,’ I said reasonably. ‘It is neither wise nor manly to get into a pissing contest with a skunk,’ Ellen said coldly, ‘so step back, Nick.’ She menaced me with the extinguisher's nozzle and, because I knew Ellen did not make idle threats, and because I knew she despised all displays of macho violence, I obediently stepped backwards and watched as she transferred the extinguisher's aim to Sweetman. ‘Leave us.’ she said. ‘Listen, sweet lady —‘ ‘I said leave us!’ He gave her his most confidently patronising smile. ‘Dear lady, I merely wish…’ Ellen squeezed the lever. There was a gulp from the extinguisher's valve and a trickle of yellow-white liquid dribbled pathetically from its nozzle. Sweetman crowed with laughter, but too soon, for, just as it seemed as though Ellen's gesture had indeed collapsed into an ignominious anti-climax, the extinguisher first coughed, then spat a vicious deluge of white muck that fanned from the flared nozzle to splatter spectacularly against Sweetman's chest. He staggered back, half tripped on the cockpit coaming, scrambled up to the deck and then to the ship's rail. Ellen, who was utterly delighted with her achievement, followed him to spray the churning mess over his hair, then down on to the decks of Dream Baby as Sweetman jumped panic-stricken from our gunwale. ‘Nick!’ she called. ‘It won't turn off!’ Ellen was laughing as she tried to stop the gunk that still spewed from the cylinder. Sweetman, safe under Dream Baby 's canopy, was starting his motors. He risked a soaking of foam as he darted out to cut his mooring lines, then twisted Dream Baby 's wheel and thrust her throttles forward. Ellen was laughing like a child let loose in a sweet shop. ‘It won't turn off!’ she said again. ‘Throw it overboard!’ I didn't want to spend the rest of the afternoon cleaning foam from Wavebreaker 's decks. Ellen hurled the still discharging extinguisher over the side. The cylinder bounced hard on Dream Baby 's dazzle-painted transom, then sank in the clear water where, resting on the sea-bed, it continued to discharge its disgusting foam. Sweetman turned a furious smeared face at us, then drove his garish boat hard at Wavebreaker 's hull to gouge a long scratch down to the bare metal. I heard the screech of protesting steel, then the powerboat bounced off our hull and accelerated away so that, within seconds, its powerful drives were swirling the sea into twin sprays of white water. ‘Damn him.’ I leaned over the rail to inspect the new scratch in Wavebreaker 's paint. ‘Didn't I do well?’ Ellen asked proudly. I had to laugh. ‘You did wonderfully!’ ‘He had a gun!’ She sounded astonished, and I knew that the real danger of the moment was only just occurring to her. ‘For someone who hates violence,’ I agreed, ‘you used force with great skill. You gained a victory over a piece of scum, and I congratulate you.’ ‘A piece of scum?’ Ellen turned to look at the rapidly disappearing Dream Baby . ‘I thought he was kind of cute.’ ‘Cute!’ I was astonished by her. ‘You thought that scabby creep was cute?’ ‘Yeah,’ she sounded defensive, ‘kind of.’ ‘Bloody hell,’ I said, and decided that I would never understand women. ‘You'd better check that your cute friend didn't steal anything when he was down below.’ It took me two hours to paint out the damage that Sweetman had caused to our hull. Ellen meanwhile cleared the foam from the teak deck, then searched Wavebreaker 's cabins. She reported that Jesse Sweetman appeared to have stolen nothing and, except for the padlock on the companionway, had damaged nothing either. Ellen and I both assumed that Sweetman's interest in Wavebreaker had been merely that of a prospective charterer who wanted to reconnoitre the boat's amenities. So I forgot about him, at least until that evening when I gave Ellen some practice with the sextant. She was trying to master celestial navigation and I stood beside her as she trapped Altair in the mirror, then delicately and successfully brought the star down to the horizon. She read the star's altitude off the sextant's micrometer, and I dutifully jotted down the numbers and the time of day for her. ‘Does 666 mean anything?’ I suddenly asked, remembering the numerals painted on Dream Baby 's bows. ‘Of course it does.’ Ellen was already trying to identify another star. ‘It's the number of the Beast, the anti-Christ, the personification of everything that's evil.’ ‘Seriously,’ I said, ‘does it mean anything?’ Ellen looked at me. ‘I'm not joking, Nick. It's from the Bible. Ask Thessy tomorrow. It's a bad news number, a kind of theological mindfuck.’ I looked out to sea, almost as though I expected to see a puff of smoke and a beast with a forked tail appear from the darkness. ‘And you think Sweetman's cute?’ I asked Ellen. ‘I think he's best avoided,’ Ellen said in an unexpectedly sober voice, and suddenly, and for no particular reason on a very warm night, we both shivered. If McIllvanney's yard had been deserted on Saturday afternoon, on Sunday morning it was unnaturally busy. Thessy arrived first, tired after an uncomfortable night on the ferry, and five minutes later Bellybutton half danced and half shuffled down the pontoon with a can of paint and a pocketful of rags and brushes. He arranged his materials on Starkisser 's long midnight-blue bows and, seeing my interest, offered an explanation. ‘Mr Mac wants a star painted on his sharp end, and what Mr Mac wants, Mr Mac gets.’ Ten minutes later Mr Mac himself arrived, blasting his big Kawasaki into the yard before strolling down the quay to cast his sceptical gaze at Wavebreaker . ‘She looks all right,’ he said grudgingly, then he crossed the gangplank for a closer look. ‘Good holiday?’ he asked Thessy. ‘Thank you, sir, yes, sir.’ ‘Well, it's over now, you lazy black bastard, and the client wants three scuba sets put on board.’ He tossed Thessy the keys to the storeroom. ‘So go fetch.’ ‘Scuba?’ I asked as Thessy ran towards the stores. ‘Master Rickie Crowninshield likes to scuba,’ McIllvanney said sourly, ‘and his daddy's paying for the gear, so gear they will have. Good morning, Ellen.’ He stared defiantly at Ellen who, standing at the stern just above Wavebreaker 's swimming platform, nodded back very coolly. McIllvanney turned back to me and dropped his voice very slightly. ‘Ellen tells me she's sailing away with you?’ ‘Yes, she is.’ ‘You're the lucky one, aren't you.’ He peered into the binnacle as though checking that no one had stolen the compass. ‘Screwing her, are you, Nick?’ ‘Piss off.’ He laughed, clearly in high spirits. ‘And the senator tells me that you're only doing a two-week trial with his kids, is that right?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘No, it isn't.’ He straightened up from the binnacle and jabbed a finger painfully into my chest. ‘You do the full three months, Nicholas Breakspear, because I want the commission on this one, do you hear me?’ If a charter was booked direct by McIllvanney, and not through either the London or the Fort Lauderdale agencies, then the Ulsterman collected the full fifteen per cent commission, which meant that the senator's jaunt was worth at least eighteen thousand dollars to McIllvanney. ‘You cut this one short’— he jabbed my chest again —‘and I'll cut you so short that you'll be singing falsetto.’ ‘Has anyone ever told you that you're a filthy bastard?’ I asked McIllvanney in a tone of genuine enquiry. ‘The last creature who told me that is living in a green-grocer's shop now. You know what lives in greengrocers’ shops, Nick? Vegetables do,’ He guffawed, then gave a grotesque imitation of a witless paraplegic slumped in a  wheelchair. ‘So everything's ready, is it?’ he asked, suddenly businesslike again. I nodded; then, on an impulse, I asked if McIllvanney had ever met a man called Jesse Sweetman. McIllvanney did not even need to think about his answer, but just shook his head. ‘What kind of a name is Jesse?’ ‘It's a southern name,’ I said, ‘perhaps from South Carolina or Georgia? He runs around in a dazzle-painted sports-fisherman called Dream Baby .’ ‘Dream Baby ?’ That name clearly struck a chord in McIllvanney, for he frowned at me for a few seconds, but the chord must have faded for he shrugged it off. ‘I've seen that boat somewhere, but I can't place it. Does it matter?’ ‘Sweetman and Dream Baby were here yesterday afternoon,’ I said, ‘and he gouged Wavebreaker 's hull and prised open the companionway. He didn't steal anything, but he annoyed me.’ ‘He broke into the boat? The bastard.’ Whatever else, McIllvanney ran a good boatyard and hated to think of it being vandalised. ‘Bellybutton!’ he shouted. ‘I hear you!’ Bellybutton had painted the outline of a five-pointed shooting star on the sleek deck of Starkisser 's bows. He had a surprisingly delicate touch and the silver star was going to look beautiful when it was finished. He had given the star a long fiery tail and surrounded it with darts of reflected light. ‘What do you know about a sports-fisherman called Dream Baby ?’ McIllvanney shouted over the water. Bellybutton, kneeling over his work, thought about it for a second, then spread his hands in a gesture of ignorance. ‘Don't mean nothing to me, boss.’ ‘Well if you see the bugger, run him off!’ McIllvanney said angrily, then turned to look at the yard where a silver-grey stretch limo, its windows tinted black against the sun, rolled ponderously to park beside the stairs to his office. He scowled, because he never liked meeting the clients, and clearly the big car was bringing the Crowninshield twins for their cruise-cure. Ellen came and stood beside me. Our usual nervousness about meeting clients seemed more intense this bright morning for neither of us knew quite what to expect of the senator's children. One part of me, despite George Crowninshield's reassurances, anticipated that the twins would emerge as shambling twitching wrecks, and for a second, believing my worst fears, I bitterly regretted accepting the senator's charter. However, Rickie Crowninshield appeared reassuringly normal when he emerged from the limousine. At the very least I had expected him to be physically frail and mentally chastened; a boy worn out by his long addiction and frightened of the criminal charges that hung over him, but instead he came out of the limo and down the dock with the frisky energy of a puppy. He ran across the gangplank as enthusiastically as though he sought votes for his father's election campaign, then approached us with an outstretched hand and a voice full of bright greetings. ‘You must be Nick? Dad told me about you. He says you're one hell of a guy. Really!’ His handshake was warm and firm, and his face redolent of his father's sincerity. ‘And, oh boy! I know who you are. Ellen Skandinsky! Wow!’ He gave her an admiring grin that was very reminiscent of the senator's beguiling charm. ‘Hello.’ Ellen's manner was almost British in its cool restraint, matching our welcome which we had deliberately pitched at a low key. We were not filling the marina with the steel band jollity of Yellow Bird, nor were any of us in our matching blue and white uniforms, for this was not a usual charter, and none of us were at Rickie or Robin-Anne Crowninshield's beck and call. Instead, if we were anything, we were their jailers. I introduced Rickie to McIllvanney who screwed his face into what he thought was a pleasant smile then, after exchanging an inanity or two, fled to his office. ‘A terrific boat, Nick! Really!’ Rickie looked appreciatively round Wavebreaker 's deck. He sucked on a cigarette and I saw that the fingers of his right hand were stained a deep yellow by the nicotine. ‘Just outstanding! My mom said she had just the greatest time with you all last year. She said it was  a blast, really! So I thought we could have a really good time as well, yeah?’ ‘I do hope so,’ I said with polite enthusiasm. ‘Just outstanding,’ Rickie said, but referring to what I could not tell. He was built like a basketball player; tall and as thin as a stick insect. I noticed a slight discolouration in his left eye that betrayed its blindness, but otherwise he looked as fit as a cricket. He had his father's black hair, a strong sun-tan, and seemed filled with a manic energy; ready and eager to enjoy both Wavebreaker and our company. ‘God, you look like him,’ he said to me, ‘like your dad, I mean. Really something. Wow.’ He turned as Thessy struggled aboard with a heavy scuba outfit. ‘You must be Thessy, right? Just great to meet you, just great! Do I call you Thessy or Thessalonians?’ Thessy, forced to put the scuba outfit down to shake Rickie's hand, stammered that he did not mind what he was called, but Rickie had already forgotten his question. ‘Hey! Jackson!’ He shouted towards a black man who was walking slowly along the dock. ‘You're just going to eat this up! Really! This is just awesome!’ The man who now approached Wavebreaker was as tall as Rickie Crowninshield, but, where Rickie was attenuated, this man was as broad shouldered and as heavily muscled as a pit bull. He was a black version of the Maggot, but this man appeared to have none of the Maggot's casual bonhomie. I guessed he was in his forties and he had a hard face with small wary eyes and tightly curled hair that was cut very short. ‘That's Jackson Chatterton,’ Rickie introduced the big man, ‘and he's my minder! Really! Ain't that right, Jacko?’ Chatterton carried two heavy suitcases across the gangplank and ignored the over-excited Rickie who shadowboxed two punches at his left arm. Chatterton dropped the suitcases and turned to me. ‘Chatterton,’ he said flatly. ‘I'm a para-medic attached to the Rinkfels clinic.’ ‘He'll tell you he's a male nurse,’ Rickie said, ‘but he's  really my bodyguard. A big bad black bodyguard. Ain't that what you are, Jacko?’ Chatterton continued to ignore Rickie, as did I. ‘My name's Breakspear,’ I said to the huge man, ‘and welcome aboard.’ Jackson Chatterton had not offered me his hand and appeared not to notice when I offered mine. Nor did he introduce himself to Ellen or Thessy, but instead looked warily up into the rigging as though he expected to be ambushed from the foremast's crosstrees. ‘You were a soldier,’ I said, not as a question, but as a straight assertion of fact, for almost everything about him spoke of the military. ‘He was a killer!’ Rickie answered for the giant Chatterton. ‘Really! Wow! Bang-bang.’ ‘Airborne,’ Chatterton confirmed to me. ‘Sergeant.’ ‘Vietnam?’ ‘Yessir! And proud of it.’ Ellen opened her mouth, then had the brilliant good sense to close it unused. ‘You?’ Chatterton unbent enough to ask me the question. ‘Royal Marines. Sergeant.’ I summed up my military career in Chatterton's own staccato fashion. The big man gave me an approving nod, then gestured at the suitcases. ‘Not mine, the twins’. Where?’ ‘Ellen will show you.’ Ellen offered me a poisonous smile, but I had no time to worry about her distaste for the militaristic para-medic. Instead I was looking down the quay to where a pathetically thin girl was walking beside a smartly dressed woman. ‘That's Robin-Anne,’ Rickie told me helpfully, ‘with Denise.’ I crossed the gangway and Rickie came after me. ‘Were you really a marine?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘A sergeant? Why not an officer?’ ‘I didn't want to be an officer.’ ‘No shit! Really?’ Rickie was literally dancing in circles around me as I walked down the dock towards his sister, but then he paused in his frenetic progress to light one cigarette  from the stump of another, and I wondered just what perverted fate decreed that such a boy should receive a legacy of six million dollars. ‘Is that your motorbike?’ He had spotted McIllvanney's Kawasaki. ‘No.’ ‘Just awesome, Nick. Really! I mean, what a blast! Wow!’ He ran on ahead, shouting at his sister. ‘He's a killer, Robbie! Really! He was a marine! Just awesome!’ Robin-Anne Crowninshield shyly offered me her hand. Like her brother she was painfully thin, but otherwise they seemed utterly unlike, despite being twins. Robin-Anne had her mother's fair hair, so fair that it looked bleached, and she had her mother's delicate good looks etched on to a face so pale that it seemed as though her skin must burn if it was exposed to anything more powerful than a light bulb. Her hand lay in mine as lightly as a bird's wing. ‘It's very hot,’ she said. ‘It'll be cooler at sea,’ I reassured her, then I looked at her companion who was a very crisp and handsome black woman. ‘My name's Breakspear,’ I introduced myself. ‘Denise Harriman,’ she responded. ‘I'm one of Senator Crowninshield's aides.’ ‘She's from Washington,’ the manic Rickie explained, in a tone of voice which suggested I should be impressed. ‘She had to deliver us here, but she ain't coming with us because she gets seasick. Ain't that right, Denise? You barf in boats?’ Rickie began mimicking an attack of vomiting. ‘I don't just barf on boats.’ Denise Harriman shot Rickie a look of pure venom. The sarcasm went airily past Rickie who had suddenly stiffened, and whose face now showed a look of the most terrible anxiety. I dreaded to discover just what symptom of drug dependency I was witnessing, and wondered if I should shout for the big Jackson Chatterton to come and rescue me, but then Rickie turned his terrified gaze on to me. ‘Jesus!’ He punched one hand into the other. ‘My dad promised to ask you a question, but he forgot, and Mom couldn't remember. Shit!’ He was clearly so fearful of the answer to his father's  unasked question that he scarcely dared pose it himself, but then summoned up the courage. ‘Does this boat have a sound system, Nick?’ I nodded. ‘Sure. We've got a tape deck and a CD player.’ His relief was palpable. ‘Really? A CD? Oh God, that's awesome! Come on, Robbie!’ His good spirits thus restored, Rickie seized his sister's hand and dragged her excitedly towards the boat. Robin-Anne, who had been looking very apprehensive, seemed to go aboard Wavebreaker rather unwillingly. Denise Harriman, the senator's aide, uttered a barely audible sigh which I translated as an expression of relief that her responsibility for the twins was ending. She took a thick manila envelope from her attaché case. ‘That envelope contains the twins’ documentation, Mr Breakspear: their passports, emergency air tickets and medical records. There s also a full list of the senator's telephone numbers.’ She handed me that envelope, then took another from the briefcase. ‘And these are the papers concerning your own boat.’ She opened the envelope and handed me the forms which would be needed if the senator undertook the repairs to Masquerade . For the moment my boat was staying on Straker's Cay, and she would only pass into the senator's care if I agreed to extend the trial two weeks, cruise-cure into a full summer's excursion. I spread the forms on the saddle of McIllvanney's Kawasaki. If I did take the twins away all summer then Masquerade would be taken to a boatyard in Florida, so I now signed the necessary customs forms and the insurance waiver and the dozen other pieces of paper that would be needed to keep the United States government and the delivery company happy. I signed the last sheet, hoped to God that the US Customs service did not discover the huge Webley pistol deep in its box in Masquerade 's bilges, and handed Denise Harriman back her pen. She put the signed papers in her attaché case, then shot a poisonous glance towards Rickie who was rummaging though his pile of luggage on Wavebreaker 's deck. ‘Bun voyage ,’ she called aloud to him, and it was possible to  discern a dance of relieved joy in her step as she walked back to the limousine. Bellybutton, painting his delicate silver star, laughed up at the twins with his discoloured teeth, while McIllvanney leered at them from his office window. The last of their luggage was brought from the limousine and, as Thessy and I prepared to cast off, Rickie tested our sound system with a cacophonous cassette of rock music. Robin-Anne searched for a silent dark hole in which to hide, Jackson Chatterton scowled at us, Ellen looked exasperated and Thessy appeared just plain scared. I started Wavebreaker 's engines, used the bow thruster to drive her stem away from the quay and, with an apparent cargo of misery and mania, went to sea."
FIC FIC-CCW-004 -0.0100000000000001 "We beat southwards all that first day, slicing through a glittering sea, and propelled by an apparently changeless south-easterly trade wind. We hardly saw the Crowninshield twins. They briefly appeared on deck for lunch; a meal which Rickie hardly touched, while Robin-Anne, despite her apparent frailty, attacked the sandwiches and salad with the savagery of a starving bear. Afterwards, incongruously dressed in a raincoat, she went to the bows and stared briefly down at the mesmerising onrush of sea where it split and foamed at Wavebreaker 's cutwater. She did not stay there long, but retreated from the fierce sun to the stern-cabin that she would be sharing with Ellen. The contrast between the two American girls was almost painful; Ellen was so healthy and strong, while the waif-like Robin-Anne was pathetically wan and listless. ‘What do you think of her?’ I asked Ellen that afternoon. Ellen gave me an amused glance. ‘Little Orphan Annie? It's hard to believe she's about to be worth six million dollars. Still, she's got precious little else going for her.’ I smiled at the severity of Ellen's judgment. ‘Is she that bad?’ ‘She has a distressingly simple mind, with only room for a single idea at any one time. Presently that idea is cocaine, and nothing but cocaine. She has an obsession with the drug that verges on monomania. She tells me she needs to understand it if she's going to defeat it.’ ‘Don't you approve of that?’ ‘I think she'd do better to understand herself,’ Ellen said tartly. ‘She allowed a man to persuade her into taking the drug, so she can only blame herself for her predicament. She'd find it more useful to understand her own character short-comings than to take an elementary course in drug chemistry.’ ‘What do you make of Rickie?’ I asked. ‘He's precisely what anyone would expect of a drop-out Phys Ed basketball-playing retard,’ Ellen said scornfully, ‘by which I mean that he's a jock with the brains of a dung beetle. He reminds me of your Neanderthal friend, the Maggot, except Rickie is a great deal more handsome.’ ‘Is he?’ She laughed at the suspicion of jealousy in my voice. ‘Yes, Nicholas, he is. But he's not cute.’ At supper, as at lunch, Robin-Anne ate with the appetite of a horse, though her brother hardly touched his chicken and pasta salad. ‘Don't you like pasta?’ Ellen, who was perversely proud of her skills in the salad department, asked Rickie with just a touch of asperity. ‘It's great. Really awesome.’ Rickie lit a cigarette. ‘I just guess I'm not hungry.’ Robin-Anne reached over and tipped her brother's food on to her own plate. ‘Kind of starving,’ she justified her theft, then poured herself some diet soda. For once we were carrying neither wine nor spirits on Wavebreaker , for Jackson Chatterton's drug clinic had utterly forbidden us to offer the twins any alcohol, saying that any mood-altering drug could hamper the success of a detoxification programme. We were thus officially a dry boat, though I had hidden some Irish whiskey in the engine room, and I was sure that Ellen would have similarly salted away some vodka. It seemed that Ellen and I were not the only ones to take such a precaution, for late that night Jackson Chatterton lumbered on deck with a bottle in one huge hand. ‘Bourbon,’ he explained laconically. ‘Want some?’ ‘I thought you'd never ask.’ He chuckled, produced two cardboard cups, and poured me a generous slug of the whiskey. We were alone on deck, though not the only ones awake for I could hear Rickie and Ellen's voices coming from the open skylight of the main saloon. I hoped Thessy was fast asleep for he would be taking the morning watch. ‘Cheers,’ I said. Chatterton raised his cardboard cup in silent acknowledgement, then stared ahead to where a great beam swept around the sky. ‘A lighthouse?’ he asked in a voice which suggested that a prudent man avoided such things. I nodded. ‘It's called the Hole in the Wall. Once we're past it we can turn out to the open ocean. Things will be a bit livelier then.’ ‘Livelier?’ ‘We'll have a bit more sea, kick up some spray.’ I had spoken enthusiastically, but Jackson Chatterton seemed unmoved by the prospect. ‘What are your plans?’ he asked me. I had nothing particular planned, merely an idea that it might be interesting to thrash our way out into the open ocean, though, mindful of the danger of tropical storms, I had no intention of going too far from the safe shelter of a Bahamian hurricane hole. But I fancied feeling the long hard pressure of ocean waves against our hull and, though we were short-handed, I reckoned that a few days out of sight of land would shake us all down quickly. I explained all that to Chatterton, but stressed that we would run for cover at the first sign of trouble. He must have assumed that I meant trouble from the twins, for he suddenly became surprisingly loquacious. ‘They won't give you any grief in the next few days,’ he said. ‘Now that they can't get hold of cocaine they'll just crash out.’ I grimaced. ‘Does that mean they'll be seeing green monkeys and blue snakes up the rigging?’ Chatterton poured himself more bourbon, then put the bottle within my reach on the binnacle shelf. ‘Coming off cocaine isn't like that. At first they'll just want to do nothing but eat and sleep. It's the opposite of a cocaine high, you see.’ He paused. ‘The difficult bit starts two or three days later. That's when the real hell begins.’ ‘For all of us?’ ‘It won't be easy, ‘he said grimly, and I was suddenly rather glad to have the taciturn Chatterton aboard. The big man had obviously come on deck to warn me what to expect from the twins, and for that I was grateful. ‘I noticed that Rickie wasn't eating today,’ I said, ‘but Robin-Anne was?’ Chatterton nodded. ‘Rickie may have stopped his cocaine a day or two ago, which means he's probably already over the crash period. I promise you one thing; he's brought none of it on board. I searched him and his luggage, and he was clean.’ The big man thought for a few seconds, then laughed. ‘He'd better be clean! That turkey has got one chance of avoiding jail, just one, and that chance is by proving to the judge that he's cleaned up his act. And if he doesn't do that, then the man will send Rickie's plump young ass down to the gang-rape squad in the county jail.’ Chatterton did not sound unduly worried at that prospect. ‘Can we be sure Robin-Anne didn't bring any of the drug aboard?’ I asked. ‘She won't have done that,’ Chatterton said with conviction. ‘That girl is serious about giving it up, real serious, heavy serious! That girl is really trying! She studies the drug, you know? Like it was her enemy.’ Chatterton had spoken with genuine admiration. I glanced up at the sails, down at the compass, then ahead to where the lighthouse loom arced powerfully through the night. ‘So what are the twins, chances?’ ‘Depends on their will power, 'cause nothing else will do it for them. There ain't no pill to get you off the powder, Mr Breakspear, only will power. And let me tell you, coming off coke is the hardest damn thing in the world, and you're real lucky if you have a rich daddy who pays for people to hold your hand while you go through the hell of it. The twins’ daddy has paid for you and me, Mr Breakspear, and for everyone else on board this boat, but even with all that money and all this boat, we still might not succeed with them.’ ‘It's that hard?’ ‘It is that hard,’ he said ominously, and I thought of John Maggovertski's sadness for a pretty girl who had whored herself to pay for the white powder. ‘And it's even harder,’ Jackson Chatterton's voice was suddenly sinister, ‘for a poor person who has no one to help them.’ I stared at Jackson Chatterton, and at last sensed the drama  that lay behind his big calm presence. ‘Why did you leave the army, Mr Chatterton?’ I asked after a long pause. ‘I guess you can guess,’ he said. I guessed, but did not make him confirm my guess. Instead I asked whether the American army had helped him to kick his drug habit. ‘Sure they tried, they tried real hard, but back then I didn't want to be helped.’ ‘But you still got off cocaine? On your own?’ ‘Eventually.’ The light inside the binnacle glossed his black face with a sheen of red, sparking his eyes like fire. He was not looking at me, but staring doggedly ahead into the turning white light of the Hole in the Wall. ‘And I had to lose a good, good woman before I came to my senses. But I did kick the drug, Mr Breakspear, and it was probably the hardest damned thing I ever did in all my life. But once I'd done it, I swore I'd help others do it.’ ‘Even the very rich?’ I asked provocatively. ‘The rich trash pay the bills, Mr Breakspear, which lets me give my spare time away to the poor trash.’ I looked at the tough, impressive face. ‘Are the twins trash?’ He paused before replying, then gave the smallest shake of his head. ‘She's OK, but him?’ This time the pause was almost eloquent, then he gave a richly contagious laugh. ‘I'd have liked to have had Rickie Crowninshield in my platoon for just five minutes.’ I laughed too. ‘Good to have you aboard.’ ‘It ain't bad being aboard,’ he said, and held out his hand and, not before time, we shook. By midnight I was alone on deck, and happy to be alone. I like sailing alone at night. I like to watch the phosphorescence curling away from the hull and I like to watch the brilliant specks of light fade in the black deep water far in the ship's wake. I like to be alone under the careless profusion of the stars, and alone on a moon-glossed sea. I like the sounds of a boat sailing at night. The sounds are  the same as those of daylight, yet somehow the night magnifies and sharpens the creak of a yielding block, the sigh of air over a shroud, the stretching of a sail, the hiss of water sliding sleek against the hull, the curl of a quarter-wave falling away, and the thump as a wave strikes the cutwater to be sheared into two bright slices of whiteness. I like the purposefulness of a boat at night as it slits a path across an empty planet. I like the secretiveness of a boat in the blackness, when the only thing to dislike is the prospect of dawn, which seems like a betrayal because, at night, in a boat under sail, it is easy to feel very close to God — for eternity is all around. I tacked the ship shortly after midnight, doing the job by myself and enjoying the work. Ellen was still awake, talking in the stateroom with Rickie, but everyone else seemed asleep. I wished that Ellen and Rickie would go to their beds, for the soft mutter of their voices was an intrusion on the dark and star-studded infinity through which I steered Wavebreaker . I had just winched in the staysail's port sheet when the explosion sounded, or something so like an explosion that I instinctively cowered by Wavebreaker 's rail as my mind whipped back to the crash of practice shells ripping through the sleet in Norway. The sound of the explosion melded into a terrible noise that was like an animal dying in awful, bellowing pain, but beneath that sound of agony was a harsh metallic scrape and clash that punched at my belly and eardrums. If anything the sound seemed to become louder as I ran down the deck. The noise was a foul but apt accompaniment to the schooner's fitful motion for, with her wheel lashed and her sails only half trimmed,Wavebreaker was bridling and jerking into the short hard seas that were driving through the North-East Providence Channel. The noise rose to a scream; like the sound that a beast would make while being disembowelled. I stepped over the coaming and down into the cockpit where I cannoned off the binnacle before snatching open the companionway hatch. I put both hands on the rails and vaulted down to the  accommodation deck. I slipped as I landed and fell against the bulkhead. I scrambled up and reached for the eject button on the cassette deck. I punched the button and was rewarded with a blessed, ear-ringing silence as the offending cassette slid out. ‘Shit! What is this?’ Rickie, apparently still vibrating to the music, sprang up from the stateroom couch. ‘Hey! That was my tape, man! I was listening to that!’ Ellen was grinning from the other couch, but I was in no mood to humour her amusement. ‘Thessy's sleeping for the morning watch, for Christ's sake!’ I accused her, wondering why she had let Rickie play such an appalling din at such volume at such a late hour. ‘We're just listening to music!’ Rickie was suddenly truculent, twisting off the sofa and dancing towards m ‘on the balls of his feet. An inch of ash spilt from his cigarette as he raised his hands in a threat to hit me. ‘Rickie!’ Ellen called warningly. Some grain of self-preserving sense must have penetrated Rickie's skull, for he suddenly dropped on to his heels and offered me a placatory grin. ‘You should like that sound, Nick!’ he said happily. ‘It's really heavy English music.’ I looked at the cassette which claimed to be music recorded by the Pinkoe Dirt-Box Band. ‘New shipboard rule,’ I said, ‘no English music on this boat, unless played very softly or through earphones.’ I tossed the cassette to Rickie who, turning away and thus leaving his blind eye facing me, fumbled the catch. He stooped to pick up the tape. ‘Are you saying I can't play my music?’ He was suddenly spoiling for a fight again. ‘The man is saying that you keep the noise down, and I am saying that you do what the man says.’ Jackson Chatterton had appeared in canary yellow pyjamas at the far end of the stateroom. His looming presence utterly cowed Rickie who whined something about only wanting to play Ellen a little night music, and that he had not meant any harm, and what was a guy supposed to be doing on this boat anyway? It wasn't the goddamn navy, really, and he went on muttering all  the way past Chatterton's impassive gaze and so into the cabin that the two of them shared. Thessy's scared face appeared at the other cabin door, but I shook my head at him, mimicked sleep, and he ducked back inside. ‘Sorry, Nick,’ Ellen said, though not with any great contrition. ‘Forget it.’ I was still angry, but there was no point in pursuing what was over, so I went back topsides to trim the ship, and five minutes later I saw the stateroom lights go out, and half an hour after that the lights in Ellen and Robin-Anne's cabin were doused, leaving only a light in the forward starboard cabin to show that either Rickie or Jackson Chatterton was still awake. I wondered if they had simply forgotten to turn off the bulb which annoyingly cast its brightness through a porthole and on to the swirl and rush of white water, and I was half tempted to pull the fuse out of the circuit and thus surround Wavebreaker with darkness, but resisted the impulse. The night became quiet again. Wavebreaker settled on her new course and, by the time the small hours were growing, we had left the island's lights well behind and I was cutting her prow hard into real ocean waves. We were on the starboard tack, fighting into the trades as we clawed our way out from the Bahamian shoals into the deep waters of the Atlantic. The difference in Wavebreaker 's motion was extraordinary. She had disdained the smaller waves in the shelter of the islands, but now she seemed to tremble as her hull soaked up the ponderous force of the ocean. This was proper sailing. And, as if to celebrate her freedom, she dipped her cutwater into a sudden trough of the sea and then sprayed white water high over her bows. The shudder of the bigger wave sent a shock wave through the long hull, and I laughed aloud with the pleasure of it. Then, as I often did when I was alone at sea, I began to recite Shakespeare. I knew reams of the stuff, yards and yards of it, learned from my father; the one absolutely true gift of my childhood. I liked to hear the verse, and enjoyed declaiming it, but only if there was no one to hear me, for I knew that my voice held all the fine cadences of Sir Tom himself. That night I belted out one of my favourite speeches, the one from the second part of Henry IV in which the new king, Henry V, rejects the friendship of Falstaff. I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers; How ill white hairs become a fool and jester! I have long dream'd of such a kind of man, So surfeit-swell'd, so old, and so profane; But, being awaked, I do despise my dream. I stopped abruptly. A movement had startled me and I turned to see Robin-Anne Crowninshield, dressed only in a white nightdress, standing in the main companionway. ‘That was really great,’ she said. She was shivering violently. ‘You'll find an oilskin jacket in the locker at the foot of the stairs,’ I said, ‘and you'll also discover that Ellen has left a Thermos of coffee on the stove, and I like mine without sugar but with milk. You may have to unscrew the stove-fiddles to release the Thermos, and you'll find the milk in the fridge to the right of the stove.’ She nodded grave acknowledgement of all my instructions, then disappeared below for five minutes, eventually returning swathed in one of the vast, padded and multi-layered foul-weather coats, and carrying a mug of coffee. ‘I assume it's caffeinated?’ she asked in her thin voice. ‘It is indeed proper coffee,’ I confirmed, ‘but if you insist on the wimpish unleaded kind then you will find a jar in the locker above the sink. Are you hungry?’ ‘I'm OK.’ She sat at the edge of the cockpit, curled her legs into the warm shelter of the jacket, then hunched down into the thick collar so that all I could see of her face was her enormous, moon-silvered and lemur-like eyes beneath the pale gleam of her short bright hair. She yawned. ‘How long till dawn?’ ‘An hour. Couldn't you sleep?’ ‘I set an alarm. I wanted to be up. Mom said I shouldn't miss the dawn at sea, she said it's kind of beautiful.’ She rested her head against a cushion so that she could stare straight up through the network of rigging and past the light-blanched sails to where the stars wheeled their cold fire beyond the mastheads. ‘Where are we?’ ‘We've just left the North-East Providence Channel and we're in the open sea now. Did your brother's music wake you earlier?’ She shook her head, then seemed to shrink even lower inside the enveloping jacket. ‘You look happy,’ she said, almost accusingly. ‘That's me. Just a dim, shallow and happy Brit.’ I had meant her to laugh, but instead she frowned as though my happiness was a puzzle that needed to be understood. ‘Are you going to recite any more of that poetry?’ ‘No.’ ‘It was Shakespeare, right?’ ‘Right.’ ‘It was good,’ she said. ‘He was a great poet,’ I said, as if she needed to be told. ‘I mean your voice and delivery,’ Robin-Anne said fervently. ‘It was good.’ ‘It was imitation,’ I said in self-disparagement, ‘just imitation.’ I suddenly heard my father's voice telling me that all acting is mere imitation. ‘That's all it is, dear Nick! Only imitation, mere mummery. Why do people take it so seriously?’ The wheel suddenly pushed into my left palm and I could feel all the thudding pressure of the sea and the wind concentrated into that one polished spoke. I eased the wheel up, drawing Wavebreaker 's bows harder into the sea and wind, and I was rewarded with another shattering of white spray that exploded prettily about our bows before I let the hull fall away once more. I laughed for the sheer pleasure of playing such games with God's strong world, then remembered the senator had told me that Robin-Anne liked to sail. I asked her if she wanted to take the wheel. She seemed to shudder at the very thought. ‘I'd be frightened.’ ‘But you can sail a boat, can't you?’ ‘I used to sail a little cat-boat in Penobscot Bay, but that was a long time ago. Grandmother lived there in a house that looked over the water, but she's dead now.’ She spoke sadly, as though to a twenty-four-year-old there really was a time of lost innocence, and I suppose, if the twenty-four-year-old was a cocaine addict, then there was indeed such a time. ‘I've never understood the appeal of a cat-boat,’ I said, ‘all that great big undivided sail and weather helm and barn-door rudder. It must be like going to sea in a haystack.’ Robin-Anne nodded very earnestly as though she truly cared about my opinion, but her next question showed that she was paying no attention to my inanities. ‘What do you think of us?’ she asked instead. I glanced at her, trying to hide my embarrassment with a swift and flippant response, but I could think of nothing to say and so I looked back at the binnacle, then up to the long moon-burnished sea ahead. ‘I feel really awkward, you see,’ Robin-Anne explained her question, ‘and ashamed.’ ‘I'm just the skipper of this barge,’ I said, ‘so you don't have to explain anything to me.’ ‘I feel like a circus animal’— Robin-Anne ignored my disclaimer —‘because you're all expecting me to perform my antics, and I'm not sure I can do it.’ ‘What antics?’ ‘To stop using cocaine, of course.’ She frowned at me. ‘You're all watching me, waiting to applaud.’ ‘Is that bad?’ ‘It's patronising, and it's my own fault that you can all patronise me, and I hate myself for it.’ ‘Come on!’ I said chidingly. ‘We all like you!’ ‘That's what I mean.’ She fell silent for a moment and I saw she was watching the long heaving waves slip past our flanks. Then, with a rustle of the stiff jacket, she looked back to me. ‘Did you ever try cocaine?’ ‘No.’ ‘You've not even been tempted by it?’ ‘No.’ For a moment she was silent, staring at the sheen of night on the crinkled sea, then she smiled. ‘You're lucky. You're a cocaine virgin. Stay that way, because it's the most addictive substance on the planet.’ Her last words had been spoken very portentously, and I rewarded them with a dubious shrug. ‘Heroin? Alcohol? Nicotine?’ ‘You have to persuade a laboratory animal to become addicted to any of those drugs, but you only need to give an animal one dose of cocaine and it's hooked.’ The luff of the flying jib had begun to back and fill and so I let the ship's head fall away. ‘But the real danger of cocaine,’ Robin-Anne continued softly, ‘is that it provides ecstasy, Mr Breakspear.’ ‘Call me Nick.’ ‘What cocaine does, you see, is to make the brain produce a thing called dopamine. That and a whole lot of other chemicals, but dopamine is the main one.’ Her voice was very earnest, as though it was desperately important that I understood what she said. ‘I know it's weird,’ she went on, ‘but pleasure is merely the result of naturally occurring chemicals secreted in the brain, and cocaine can turn those chemicals on like a faucet. Can you imagine a day of pure pleasure, Mr Breakspear?’ I did not need to imagine such a day, I could remember plenty. I remembered lying in bed with a pretty girl while the rain fell on a Devon river outside our window. I remembered the honesty of Masquerade in a force five wind, and then I thought of all the good days to come; days of Ellen and me and Masquerade in far seas, and I must have smiled, for Robin-Anne nodded approval of whatever silent answer I was framing to her question. ‘Think of all that happiness,’ she said, ‘and understand that a single hit of cocaine, just a single hit, will produce a hundred times as much pleasure-making  dopamine as that one happy day. A hundred times! It's like making love to God. It's euphoria.’ I looked at her, but said nothing, and she must have mistaken my silence for disbelief for she hurried to explain her evident knowledge about the drug. ‘I studied cocaine, you see. I had to. I wanted Rickie to stop using it, and I wanted a friend to stop using it as well, and so I learned everything I could.’ ‘And did learning about it mean trying it?’ She nodded. ‘Yes.’ ‘And thus you discovered euphoria?’ She nodded again. ‘And it's the euphoria that's so addictive, because you've been to heaven, and the real world seems a very dull place afterwards. So you begin to take more cocaine, and quite soon you need more and more cocaine to unlock the gates of heaven, and once you reach heaven you don't want to leave it and so you take still more cocaine, but by then it isn't working.’ She stopped abruptly, perhaps fearing that she was boring me. I turned the wheel a fraction, waiting for her. ‘The catch in this heaven,’ she went on, ‘is that the brain has only got so much dopamine to offer, and once the cocaine has used it all up, then that's the end of the pleasure. Except the brain is screaming for more dopamine, so you overdose because you can't accept that the drug isn't working any longer, and it's then that cocaine starts doing its other things to you. It shrinks the arteries, and that's what blinded Rickie's left eye.’ I really had nothing useful to say, so I responded with a sympathetic noise that only made Robin-Anne shake her head impatiently. ‘There's worse,’ she said, ‘far worse.’ ‘You mean a heart attack?’ ‘No…’ She drew the word out, so that I heard in its simple syllable all the pain and hurt of the drug. Robin-Anne had been staring at the dark sea, but now she turned her big eyes back to me. ‘The worst thing about cocaine is that once it has exhausted all the dopamine from the brain, then what's  left is a black hole of depression so big and so awful that not all the misery in the world can fill it. People try to beat that misery with barbiturates, but nothing can cure it because you've taken away from yourself all chance of feeling pleasure. The doctors have a word for that misery; they call it anhedonia, which only means an inability to feel enjoyment, and that's what it is, but it feels like hell, like true hell, and it's a hell you can't even escape from in sleep because overdosing on cocaine gives you chronic insomnia.’ Hell was being without God, I thought, but I said nothing, just stared instead at the white wash of cabin light on the rushing water, and I wondered why some people could take cocaine and just walk away from it, while others ended up in hell, or in a peep-show which was probably the same thing. ‘Of course,’ Robin-Anne went on, ‘the brain eventually manufactures more dopamine, so after a day or two the cocaine can work again, and you go soaring up from hell into heaven. It's a roller-coaster, Mr Breakspear, up and down, up and down’— her thin white hand suited the action to her words —‘from heaven to hell and back again, and if heaven is euphoria then let me assure you that hell is a terrible place.’ ‘So remember the hell,’ I said, as though I really could help her with my tuppence worth of cheerful encouragement, ‘and perhaps that will stop you ever going back to it!’ ‘But there's another kind of hell,’ Robin-Anne's voice was dulled, as though my cheap optimism had depressed her, ‘which is remembering the euphoria, and having to surrender the means of creating it. That hell is giving up cocaine. I'm in the easy stage, the first few days when you just sleep and eat, but quite soon I'll be in the hell of denial, Mr Breakspear.’ I looked past Robin-Anne to where the moon's path gleamed on the long waves, and then I glanced forward and saw another belt of silver, but this one diffuse and hazy, showing where the first crepuscular light seeped over the world's grey edge. ‘Dawn,’ I said in a hopeful voice. But Robin-Anne did not react, and I looked down to see that she was not watching for the new day, but was crying. I  did not know what to say or do. I should have knelt beside her and put my arms around her and promised her that she would be freed from the hell of anhedonia, and that there really was a God and that she did have the strength to tear herself free from cocaine, as others had freed themselves, and I should have assured her that there was true happiness without a drug, but I did not know her well enough to embrace her, so I just let her weep as the sun streaked up in glory from the east. Thus Wavebreaker sailed towards the light, carrying her passengers to hell. I rousted Thessy out of his bed with a cup of tea, then went to my own bed as he took over the wheel. I slept, dreaming of Masquerade sinking through waves of steel into torrents of fire. I woke just before lunchtime to find Wavebreaker still sailing eastwards. Ellen was showing Rickie Crowninshield all the elaborate electronic toys that only Ellen wholly understood; the radios, radars, weatherfaxes and satellite receivers, and Rickie was being surprisingly attentive, but as soon as he saw me he scowled and clamped a pair of headphones over his ears as though to make sure that he did not have to hold any kind of conversation with me. Ellen shrugged at his rudeness. ‘How's the weather?’ I asked her. ‘No change.’ I squinted through a porthole and saw the sky was scraped blue and bright above an empty sea. ‘You faxed a chart?’ I asked Ellen. ‘Sure did.’ She handed me the sheet of grey paper with its synoptic chart which had been transmitted from Florida just a few moments before. I pretended to despise such modern aids, but that was really a defensive reaction because I knew I could never afford such frills for Masquerade . I saw that there was not even a ripple of low pressure off to the east, which was the reassurance I wanted, for a depression to the east could swiftly twist itself into a full-blooded storm. ‘Good morning, Rickie,’ I said loudly, wanting to demonstrate that I held no grudge for his behaviour in the night. ‘Yo.’ His voice was surly, but suddenly he twisted round to face me and took off the headphones, and I thought he was going to apologise for his rudeness of the previous night, but instead he demanded to know if it was true that we were out in the open ocean and were not planning to make a landfall for some days. ‘That's true,’ I said. ‘But I wanted to do some scuba!’ he said in outrage. ‘There'll be a chance, I promise.’ ‘Jesus!’ he said in exasperation, then turned abruptly away. I waited to see if he would say any more, but he evidently did not want my company. I grimaced at Ellen, then went topsides where I found the ship being steered by its automatic pilot and Thessy and Jackson Chatterton perched halfway up the mainmast with reels of rigging wire from which Thessy was fashioning a parallel set of starboard shrouds. I wanted to double up all Wavebreaker 's standing rigging, just in case we did try to take her across the ocean. There was no sign of Robin-Anne who was presumably asleep. Chatterton climbed down to the deck and told me that Robin-Anne had eaten a huge breakfast. ‘What about Rickie?’ ‘He just played with his food,’ Chatterton frowned, ‘and that means he must be over the crash period, which means his behaviour's going to be difficult.’ ‘Even more difficult?’ I asked with dread. The big man laughed. ‘Nick, you ain't seen nothing yet.’ It seemed that Jackson Chatterton was right, for we were all witnesses to a dreadful metamorphosis in Rickie. When he had joined the ship he had been nothing but eagerness and smiles, romping about like a new puppy, but now he had turned unrelentingly morose. At lunchtime he scowled at his sister who, wrapped in a dressing gown, fell on the sandwiches as though she had not eaten in weeks. ‘I'm famished!’ Rickie would not even try a sandwich, but instead pushed his plate away and lit a cigarette. He sipped at his can of diet soda and grimaced at the taste. ‘Have we got any beer on this boat?’ he suddenly asked. ‘No,’ Ellen said placidly. ‘Doctor's orders.’ ‘Fuck the doctors.’ No one responded, which merely annoyed Rickie. He stared at his sister whose pale face was made even paler by the sun-block ointment she had liberally smeared on her skin. ‘You like this shit-for-drink, Robbie?’ Robin-Anne nodded, but was too busy eating to take much notice of her brother, though she did manage to mumble that she thought the diet soda was really kind of good. ‘I think it's really kind of crap.’ Rickie turned his truculent gaze on me. ‘You must have some liquor aboard, Nick?’ ‘Not a drop,’ I lied. ‘That's very un-British of you.’ He attempted an atrocious imitation of my English accent. ‘I thought all British ships were fuelled by rum, sodomy and the lash. Isn't that what they say?’ ‘That's what they say.’ I kept my voice friendly, for I was determined not to be drawn by his provocation. ‘Are you gay, Nick?’ Rickie suddenly asked me in what purported to be a tone of serious enquiry. I did not answer, while everyone but Robin-Anne, who was too busy eating, seemed embarrassed. Once again the lack of response infuriated Rickie who, seeking some other means of provocation, hurled his can of soda across the deck. ‘Shit-juice!’ he shouted. Ellen caught my eye, and we stared at each other for a sympathetic fraction of a second, then I looked away to see that the sticky liquid had sprayed across the teak planks. ‘Clean it up,’ I said mildly. ‘Rum, sodomy and the lash!’ Rickie chanted at me with a sudden and extraordinary vindictiveness. Jackson Chatterton stirred as though he proposed to clean up the mess himself, but I waved him down and kept my eyes on Rickie. ‘Clean it up,’ I said again. ‘You clean it up. This is our vacation! I didn't suggest coming on this heap of a boat to work like a house-servant, isn't that right, Robbie?’ Robin-Anne just went on eating. ‘Clean it up,’ I told Rickie again. Rickie seized Thessy's can, pulled open its top, and hurled it messily after the first. ‘Now what are you going to do? Flog me?’ He suddenly laughed, then looked at Ellen whom he perceived as a possible ally. ‘You can never tell with a Brit, can you? It's either a flog or a fuck.’ Ellen said nothing to encourage him. Robin-Anne ate stolidly on, while poor Thessy looked terrified. Only Jackson Chatterton seemed comfortable with Rickie's display of petulant temper. ‘The man said clean it up,’ Chatterton said calmly, ‘so clean it up!’ But Rickie was long beyond sense. ‘This is a vacation!’ he screamed at me, ‘so why are we out here? I want to see a beach! A beach, you know what a beach is? Sand? Surf? I want to go board-sailing, maybe do a little water skiing. I want to do some scuba, for Christ's sake!’ I ignored him, fetching instead a mop and bucket from one of the big stern lockers. The bucket had a rope attached to its handle and I skimmed it over the stern to haul up a gallon or so of sea-water which I slammed down in front of Rickie. ‘The deck needs cleaning, Rickie, so do it.’ I threw the mop at him. He ignored the mop, just staring at me, and I saw him take a breath ready to defy me so I spoke before he could. ‘Either you clean the deck, Rickie, or I'll scrub it with your hair.’ He began to weep. Robin-Anne glanced at him, then smeared mustard on a roast beef sandwich. ‘It's real good food,’ she said enthusiastically. ‘I'll help you,’ Ellen said to Rickie, then she took his hand and placed it on the mop handle. ‘Come on,’ she said gently. Thus, as Rickie feebly dabbed at the deck and as his sister ate, our happy ship sailed on."
FIC FIC-FAJ-003 -0.08 "FOURTEEN I picture the old man hopping and pacing to his cottage, finding the paper, finding the passage, transcribing it, bobbing back to the club and slipping the note under my door, in order to set the record straight; I find myself close to tears. The candlelight in the room wavers in a warm draught. In the shadows and its gentle movement I believe I see the firelight which constrains and defines the Masai night. Beyond the firelight there is the unknowable. Why do we persist in trying to know everything there is to know in the belief that one day, presumably quite soon, we will succeed? One had to forget . Nabokov's words, Fairfax's words. They could easily be rephrased: one could not understand. And he was right. I had discovered some time ago that he had loved Claudia Cohn-Casson. When I wake the candle has burned right down so that in the enamel holder there is nothing but a lava flow or wax. Outside I can hear a sound which is also achingly familiar to me: someone is trimming the grass outside with shears. They chatter and stutter in the never-ending colonial quest for the perfect lawn, which is, of course, a reproach to the disorderly lives and vegetation on the outside. S. O. Letterman has entered into a very personal contract with tennis. However well he does, however badly he is beaten, he contrives to incorporate the result into his bil-dungsroman . Like Marcel Proust, he is making art out of his life, and tennis is an important element. When we played at his club in Westwood and I beat him comfortably, he discussed the result with his friends in such a way that it  was clear that he had deliberately thrown the match in order to contribute to our personal relationship. In the locker room — no ordinary changing room this, but a soft paradise of fluffy towels, hairdryers, lotions, masseurs, electronic scales, isometric drinks, cardio-vascular scans and congratulatory attendants — he told a well-known (everyone in this club is said to be well-known) producer that he took the first three games off me in each set. And then he added that, of course, writers had nothing better to do most afternoons and since I was now writing a movie for him, he knew how to keep me happy. ‘You can't let these guys get depressed,’ he said. ‘Writing is a mood business.’ Somebody told me that Letterman had had five hundred tennis lessons. It was said with a ‘whaddya expect?’ kind of intonation. Not everyone, it seems, has bought his bill of goods. Certainly his tennis has an entirely synthetic look to it. There is a small, and often fatal, time lapse before he plays each shot, as he recalls the instructions concerning grip, feet placement, racquet position and so on. None the less, his tennis has high ambitions. He has all the latest equipment-vibration dampers, elbow restraints, luminous head and wrist bands and bicycle shorts under his strangely textured tennis shorts. His racquets — there are many — are transported in a bulging bag described with a crocodile, given to him by Michel Piccoli. ‘Very brave man. He signed a petition you know against Mitterrand and Vichy. Real shame our movie never got past first base. Anyway, this bag is a little souvenir. Mitterrand wrote articles for a Vichy newspaper before he joined the Resistance. Did you know that?’ He has had plenty of flirtations with European directors and writers and claims to be a great fan of Louis Malle and Alain Resnais, but when it comes right down to it, he doesn't believe that a European sensibility sells tickets at the box office. Yet he can work both sides of the street. In argument about the treatment of the script — these things process in  ordered stages — he is just as likely to enlist Bergman as Schwarzenegger as supporting evidence. Like his tennis, his movie-making seems to lack instinct, but half an hour in the locker room and lunch on the terrace tells you everything you need to know about the constraints under which he operates. Papal bulls issued from the Hollywood Vatican flutter in the air. There are prescriptions concerning actors, restaurants, religious sects, fads, social issues and automobiles which you ignore at peril of excommunication. The insiders — and Letterman is right on the inside track — pick up these changing signals constantly; they have no patience with outsiders' scepticism. I am reminded of Letterman's tennis because as I stroll through the grounds of the club, waiting for the arrival of my transcripts, I come upon a red earth tennis court. The surface of these courts is made with a clay brought up from underground by termites, the insects which create the famous anthills of the savannah. Nobody is playing as yet, but the lines have been freshly painted, a large old roller is being stored by an elderly man with tribal scars on his cheeks (like the marks made by French grill pans on bifteck ), and a big jug of lemon squash is standing in the shade of a little thatched tennis house, protected from the desires of wasps and flies by a beaded lace doily. Beside the court a bed of yellow canna lilies, with leaves the colour of red cabbage, is being doused by another retainer, this man with a little ornament, beaded like the doily, in one of his ear lobes. The water bounces off the waxen leaves. It was Letterman's idea to use the awful journey from the house in the avenue Hoche via Drancy to Auschwitz as a recurring, dreamlike image in the film. Letterman had previously told me that flashback is a device which must be used sparingly, yet now he was a plausible advocate for this treatment. It appeals to me, too. The final, defiant round-up by the retreating Nazis, in  which Claudia and her deluded father were caught, the train journey and the selection process at Auschwitz, will all be treated in black and white, in order, if I get Letterman, to increase the realism and to reduce the melodrama. I can see that his aim is to make these scenes so powerful that they will go beyond any fictional treatment of the death camps that has ever been tried before: the train roils through the night, the outcome, although certain, appallingly delayed by the shots of the iron wheels and the crude pistons; the final scene of the five chimneys pouring their shameful smoke over the polish countryside, intercut — this is my contribution — with the smoke rising from the savannah. Letterman confided to me after one of our tennis games that my pieces in Manhattan had always struck him as somewhat trivial — artifices — until he read my piece ‘Drancy, Ante-chamber of Death’. The mundane details of the denunciations, the decrees against Jews using the telephone or travelling on the Métro and so on had brought home to him that the French had both suffered by and been complicit in the Holocaust. (I forgave the fact that he was merely paraphrasing my final sentence. He has a way of drawing you into his enterprises, which is flattering.) Still nobody comes to play tennis. The lines are painted, the canna lilies watered. The lines are perfectly straight, their whiteness defying the ochre ant soil. On the cabbage leaves of the cannas, huge, shining droplets of water repose. Letterman told me that he once saw Steffi Graf playing tennis at Wimbledon. He was seated at the back of the court, initially angry that someone had screwed up with the tickets, but he quickly realized that every few games he was almost directly behind her. Each time she bent to receive serve he  found himself staring mesmerized at her derrière . Binding me with his confidences, he said that the wonderfully athletic, Aryan rear view of Steffi Graf made him understand how the camp inmates could believe they were indeed Untermenschen in relation to the SS. He was joking, of course. He squeezed my arm to make sure I got the point. The grounds of the club lead to a golf course, but this, too, is still, except for the attentions of green-sweepers and grass-cutters. The first fairway extends up over a gentle rise and into a forest of huge, native trees. These are the only trees around the town which have not yet gone for firewood. The town has an edgy, vicious hum. The poor see the lumpy, soapy tourists and they harbour thoughts of separating them from their possessions. A short walk near the university produces the dispiriting impression that urban life in Africa is hopeless. In their smart uniforms the police have a lethargic menace. A large Mercedes rushes by with outriders; the other traffic — held together with recycled parts, bits of wire and home engineering — is swept aside dismissively, mere twigs in the path of floodwater. I wish to run up to the window of the Mercedes and shout at the general sitting there:Wake up, you fat bastard, can't you see how you look parading in this cemetery, like some overstuffed SS officer in Birkenau ? Yet when I take a taxi back to the club, the driver tells me that the Indians will be getting it in the neck soon. They are to blame for the misery and squalor. Here in the club, gardening is still practised with religious intensity. In the Third World gardening is absurd. Why grow things you can't eat? Why water luxuriant canna lilies and fast-flowering, even faster-fading, roses, trained on ropes to make living swags around the croquet lawn? Why trim the grass so short that not even a goat could get its incisors into the chlorophyl? Why spend money on fertilizers and ant poisons and petrol for the mowers and whitewash for the tennis court — and incidentally any stray rocks that  need it — and why build great steaming compost heaps of the by-products of the above? The answer is that gardens re-create a corner of paradise. For a Masai, paradise is a vast savannah, dotted with beautifully marked and horned cattle. For a westerner entering this harsh, insected and vipered landscape, a small sanctuary of parterres and walkways and pergolas and gravelled paths and granite crazy paving, was evidence of faith. As the town began to grow and at the same time fragment in strange, squalid and unforeseen ways, the gardens became symbolic in a different fashion. This garden (protected from the road on one side by huge, untidy gum trees, in a permanent state of reptilian slough, leaving the discarded bark hanging from the newly emerged, silvery trunks) has for me so powerful a charm because it returns me to my childhood, with a complete collection of odours, insects, fragrances, ponds and over-vigorous plants. But there is more to it. The texture of the sounds, the little ant-bear funnels, the twittering of the water sprinklers, the unnamed but instantly familiar birds, the patient devotions of the gardeners, the numberless frogs (now in caviare-eyed repose on water lilies and ledges), the huge, lazy tadpoles, the dragonflies on their biplane wings skimming the water, the busy red ants returning with baguettes of grass (the same ants which used to run up the shorts of children and sink their vicious fangs into unwary little scrota) and now the distant thwack of tennis bails and the inevitable muted cries of anguish — all these impressions play so strongly on my memory because they leap thirty-five years of my life in one bound. It's pleasurable and it's surprising in its detail. The question is, what on earth does it mean? Why are these memories so strong and so personal? I am sitting now in an arbour of rust-coloured bougainvillaea drinking lukewarm, weak coffee, brought to me in a stainless steel pot by a waiter in a starched white uniform, thinking in an aimless way  about this puzzle, when I see the waiter returning. He is holding a round copper tray under one arm like a subaltern with his cap at a passing-out parade. ‘Telephone, sir.’ I walk up to the main building along a path of large brown stones with the shape and texture of unleavened bread. Within their surfaces are tiny specks of quartz. This is book to me — of which the clubhouse is built and which the early settlers favoured in their pursuit of the substantial. Taking a long-distance call still causes a certain turbulence here. I am ushered reverently into a cabin and pick up the quaint hand set, which has an additional round earpiece for clamping over the spare ear, so that I see myself reflected in the glass like a radio operator or a session singer. The call fills me with apprehension. Over the airwaves and under the sea, or however his quavering voice reaches me from LA, I hear S. O. Letterman. ‘Jesus, where were you, on safari?’ ‘In the garden, reliving my childhood. I'm the proust of the savannahs.’ ‘I didn't get that last bit. This is a fucking awful line. Do you want the good news or the bad news first?’ ‘I'll take the good.’ ‘The good news is that paramount have gone for it.’ ‘And the bad?’ ‘The bad news is that they want to see a first draft script within three weeks.’ ‘Anything else?’ ‘Isn't that enough? How's it going? Okay?’ ‘Fine. I met her ex-lover last night.’ ‘Jesus, he must be one helluva age.’ ‘Seventy-six. Imagine Robert Redford with a blue face in twenty years’ time.’ ‘You been drinking?‘ ‘Yes. I have. Brandy. Kenya brandy.’ ‘At my house you told me you didn't drink. You refused all my drinks. Listen, are you pleased?’ ‘I'm elated. Well done. Congratulations.’ The truth is, I don't feel elated. I wander back out to the garden, but the magic has gone."
FIC FIC-G01-027 -0.0400000000000003 "66 ‘You were right about the killers being linked,’ said Phillip Barclay. Gregson smiled to himself. ‘But not just in the way you said,’ Barclay continued. ‘The MO's they used may have been copies of earlier killings, even this latest one. And the fact that they all burned themselves, or tried to. But there's something else, something more conclusive to link them, but it's more puzzling, too. That device — whatever the hell it is — that I found in Magee was made of the same material I found melted in the other bodies.’ ‘And I checked his fingerprints against the files on screen at Hendon,’ said Steve Houghton. ‘There's no doubt about it, the man is Trevor Magee.’ ‘And number one?’ asked Finn. ‘Going almost solely on your files and his MO, I'd have to say it was Peter Lawton,’ the Records Officer told him. Finn looked at his colleague, then at Houghton. ‘Which we know is impossible, right?’ he said, almost laughing. ‘Lawton and Bryce are banged up.’ ‘So is Magee,’ Gregson told him, flipping open the file. ‘According to this.’ He jabbed the file with his index finger. Houghton crossed to the wall behind him and flicked a switch. Panels lit up and he reached for a number of X-ray plates which he attached to the luminescent plastic. They were skull X-rays. ‘Now look. These are of Magee,’ he said. ‘Taken when they brought his body in.’ Barclay pulled a pen from his pocket and prodded part of the first plate. It showed a dark mass close to the front of the skull. On other angles it was also present. ‘See it?’ he said. ‘What is it?’ Gregson wanted to know. ‘Wait,’ Barclay told him. Houghton reached for another set of plate. The shape was far less well defined. ‘These are X-rays of Mathew Bryce's skull,’ said Barclay, ‘at least what was left of it. Unfortunately he'd been burned, but not badly enough for the bone structure to be altered as it was in Lawton's case.’ He jabbed his pen at a dark area on Bryce's X-rays too. ‘Come on, Phil, what the fuck is it?’ Finn muttered, reaching for his cigarettes but deciding not to light one when he saw the look of disapproval on the pathologist's face. ‘Both men were suffering from brain tumours,’ Barclay said. ‘How can you be sure?’ Gregson demanded. Barclay sighed. ‘It's on the plates, you can see it,’ he said, motioning to the X-rays again. ‘And, if you'd care to look at Magee, I haven't replaced the cranial cap yet and you'll see the tumour. Come down to the morgue and I'll show you.’ ‘I'll take your word for it,’ Finn said. ‘What you're saying is, these three fucking murderers we've got in cold storage have all committed crimes identical to ones committed by Peter Lawton, Mathew Bryce and Trevor Magee, right? Three blokes we know ,for sure , are locked up, doing time in Whitely nick, yeah? Now, you're trying to tell me that this is the real Trevor Magee lying downstairs? That the real Peter Lawton killed six people and then killed himself on a motorbike less than two weeks ago? That the real Mathew Bryce cut up a girl, then torched himself? And tonight the real Trevor Magee murdered a tramp and a cabbie and then smashed his car into the Centre Point fountains? You're telling me that blokes we arrested, blokes we stood in court and saw sentenced, blokes we saw driven away in fucking armoured vans, have committed the exact same crimes that they were put away for? That's what you're telling me?’ Houghton looked almost helplessly at Gregson. ‘It's bollocks,’ said Finn angrily. ‘Absolute bollocks.’ He looked at Gregson. ‘You said yourself it was impossible. If one of them had escaped from Whitely we'd have known about it, but three of the cunts? Do me a favour.’ This time he did reach for a cigarette and light it up. Silence. ‘Somebody say something, for Christ's sake,’ snarled Finn in annoyance. ‘Somebody tell me again what all this shit is supposed to mean.’ ‘Could there be a mistake with the identification?’ Gregson said. ‘It's possible with Bryce,’ Houghton admitted. ‘I found fourteen matching characteristics in the ridge patterns of his fingerprints. There should have been sixteen, but I think my figure is conclusive enough. But even if I was wrong about Bryce, it's impossible I could be wrong about Magee. His prints match those on file. His dental records match. His blood type. Everything. Unless he's got a twin identical in every way, then that man is the same one you arrested.’ Finn shook his head. ‘I don't fucking believe this,’ he said, an incredulous smile on his face. ‘It's not possible.’ ‘Then what's your explanation?’ Houghton challenged him. ‘You're telling me that you believe three convicted killers just walked out of Whitely prison without anyone noticing and now they've come back here to duplicate their original crimes? Do you believe that? Really?’ ‘I believe what I see here, Stuart, and this man is Trevor Magee,’ Houghton said quietly. ‘If it helps I'm as sceptical as you, but the evidence is here.’ ‘Evidence for what?’ Finn snarled. ‘That we're all going fucking crazy? They're inside.’ He shouted the last two words. Gregson crossed to the phone and jabbed the button. He asked the switchboard operator to connect him with Whitely Prison and waited. Finn turned to his colleague. ‘Frank, for Christ's sake…’ he began, but Gregson held up a hand to silence him. ‘Hello,’ he said finally into the phone. ‘My name is Detective Inspector Gregson. I'm calling… Yes, Gregson. ’ He spelt it out. ‘I'm calling from New Scotland Yard. I'd like to speak with the Governor please. It's very important.’ He sucked in an angry breath. ‘Yes, Gregson.’ He spelled it out again. Then he waited. The other men watched as he tapped gently on the desk top. ‘When will he back?’ he said finally. ‘Can you get him to call me as soon as possible? It's very urgent. It concerns three of the inmates there.’ They saw Gregson's features harden. ‘Who are you, anyway?’ He sighed. ‘All right, perhaps you can help me. Their names are Peter Lawton, Mathew Bryce and Trevor Magee. I need to speak to Governor Nicholson about them as soon as possible, do you understand?’ The other three saw a flicker on the DI's face. ‘Say that again?’ He looked across Finn, a look of bewilderment on his face. He shook his head slowly. ‘Can you tell me when?’ ‘What the fuck is this?’ Finn whispered, still watching his superior. ‘Thank you,’ said Gregson. ‘Tell Governor Nicholson to ring me on this number as soon as possible.’ Gregson put down the phone. ‘Well?’ said Finn. The DI looked at Houghton. ‘Are you sure that's Trevor Magee?’ he said, the knot of muscles at the side of his jaw pulsing. Houghton held up his hands. ‘Frank, for God's sake,’ he sighed. ‘If I had children I'd swear on their graves. It is Magee. There's no question of it.’ ‘And you're sure about the others as well?’ Houghton nodded. ‘According to that guy I just spoke to,’ said Gregson  quietly, ‘Trevor Magee died six months ago. As a matter of fact he's buried in the same piece of ground as Peter Lawton and Mathew Bryce. They never left Whitely. All three of them are buried there.’"
FIC FIC-G0Y-004 -0.05 "8 ‘Thank you,’ said Louise. ‘It's exactly what I need. However did you guess? Mind, God knows why I keep on recording the children for posterity, the way they are now. When I look back I could weep — dear little things tottering about on beaches. Phil hasn't addressed a civil word to us in weeks. Anyway — thanks.’ ‘It's from Edward too.’ ‘I took that as read. Since when did Edward go shopping on his own behalf? Where is he, anyway?’ ‘In the Britches, I think. He's been trying to do something about the brambles and nettles.’ Louise flopped on to the sofa. ‘How did you enjoy your day in London?’ ‘It had its moments,’ said Helen evasively. ‘What about the investment people?’ ‘They made it fairly clear we were too small fry for them. And the place was more like a botanical gardens than an office.’ ‘Tim knows some other people. I'll tell him to…’ ‘No,’ said Helen. ‘We have still to recover from those.’ ‘Think about it,’ conceded Louise. ‘So what did you do after that — it can't have taken you all day?’ ‘We had lunch in that restaurant in South Kensington.’ ‘It doesn't exist any more.’ ‘Exactly,’ said Helen. ‘So we discovered. We had lunch on its ashes, as it were. Then we went shopping.’ ‘Well! Quite a spree! Very good for you both.’ ‘Don't patronise,’ said Helen. ‘We're less socially disadvantaged than you imagine. The village provides resources undreamed of in Camden Town. Though I will admit that I find London disconcerting these days. The landscape. Everything  seems to be built of mirrors — what on earth has happened to brick? But I grant you that I'm behind the times in some ways. Architecture and offices full of botanical specimens are the least of it. Social etiquette, for instance… What's done and what isn't.’ She shot her sister a crafty glance. ‘Most of it is quite irrelevant to me, of course, but one keeps a sort of technical interest.’ ‘Huh?’ said Louise. ‘What are you blathering on about?’ ‘Oh, I don't know… How people behave… Men and women, for instance. Such as… Do women take the initiative nowadays?’ She felt the beginnings of a disastrous blush and busied herself with a dirty mark on the window, getting out her handkerchief and scrubbing, her back to Louise. ‘I mean — time was, you wouldn't… Nowadays, would they ring up first — that sort of thing?’ ‘How should I know?’ said Louise sourly. ‘I'm married, aren't I?’ ‘Well…your friends…’ Helen persisted. ‘For instance, if someone hadn't heard from a man friend for — oh, for a couple of weeks or so-when he'd said vaguely he'd ring — I mean, she might wonder if there was something wrong, if he was ill, or if she'd offended in some way. Would she feel nowadays it was up to her to make contact?’ ‘Look, what is all this?’ demanded Louise. ‘I'm just curious. Detached interest. One ought to know how things are. If they've changed or not.’ ‘You are a funny old thing,’ said Louise. ‘You're making that window worse, you know. Haven't you got any Windowlene? Actually so far as I can see it's sod's law for women, just as it always has been. You know my friend Judith? Well, she's been having an affair with this bloke for the last year or so and then out of the blue he turned round and… Here's Edward. Open the window and he can come in this way.’ Edward was advancing across the lawn. ‘What did he turn round and do?’ said Helen. ‘Oh, some other time… Hi! Thanks for the birthday present.’ Edward came in at the french window and stared blankly at  his younger sister. After a moment he said ‘Oh… Yes.’ And then, ‘Many happy returns of the day. How old are you?’ ‘It's next week, not today. And I'll be forty-three for Christ's sake. There's this piece of contemporary mythology that the forties are the best time of your life. A load of cock, so far as I'm concerned. What about you?’ But Edward had lost interest, apparently. He turned to Helen. ‘Have we got any wire anywhere? I want to mend the fence.’ The question of age, in fact, filled his head these days, but it was not a matter he wanted to discuss with Louise. Or indeed with anyone. He did not want to be young again — that time had had particular and transcendent horrors — but the thought of being any older filled him with panic. He could not imagine finding tranquillity of soul in old age; if he could only be allowed to mark time for a while all might yet be well, one might suddenly achieve equilibrium, certainty, serenity. There would still be possibilities. Hopes. When his mother died it was as though his youth began to slip out of sight. Her existence, he now realised, had implications far beyond her abrasive and insistent presence: it had tethered him to a distant shore. Now, the shore was fading and there was no going back. And every now and then there came these appalling moments when feeling boiled, when, it seemed to him, he became slightly mad. Most of the time one was all right— or at least as all right as one had ever been — and then out of the blue it struck, a hideous uprush of fear, of longing, of shame. It could be prompted by anything, or nothing. It could come in the wastes of the night, or at the most humdrum moments of the day. It had surged forth in that dreadful shop in London, when he had stood transfixed — not, as Helen thought, by bunches of guinea-fowl but by the bare arms of the butcher's lad adroitly trimming a carcass on a block beneath. The boy was done up in a long striped apron and straw boater in arch Victorian pastiche but his arms were all that Edward saw: young, dusted with golden hairs  and somehow indisputably male. Beautiful arms; he looked at them and wanted to cry. He could fend them off, the appalling moments. Fight them. The thing was to keep occupied. He banged about in the scullery, hunting for wire. He would make the Britches impenetrable, tackle the dead trees and plant saplings. As soon as Louise had left, Helen went to the telephone. She picked up the receiver, dialled Giles Carnaby's number, and then replaced the receiver before the connection was made. She wasn't quite ready yet, after all. In fifteen minutes' time, she told herself sternly. Just a little longer to get oneself into the right frame of mind, run over the right casual, uncommitted phrases. ‘It just occurred to me you might like to…’; ‘If you're free on Wednesday, I thought maybe…’ She too resolved on activity. She had been intending for days to make a start on clearing out the cloakroom; now was the moment — she would make a preliminary survey, set aside what should be kept, see if there was anything good enough for Oxfam. Then, suitably relaxed, she would telephone Giles. Properly. The cloakroom led off the hall. It was large, ill-lit, exceptionally cold, and housed a primitive washbasin; the lavatory was separate, an internal room of its own. The walls were lined with layers of raincoats of a uniform dun, as though their colours had run together; they went back years — some had even belonged to her father and were so stiff and cracked that they could have stood unsupported. There was a pair of mackintosh waders; there were shooting-sticks and an Egyptian fly-whisk and an alpenstock. The pegs above the raincoats were occupied by assorted headgear — berets and peaked caps, a riding bowler, sou'westers, knitted hats, deerstalkers. Everything had associations — Dorothy's, Edward's, given by so-and-so, bought on a particular holiday, left behind by relative or friend; Helen saw an insistent kaleidoscope of references, shimmering tiresomely behind the garments and the implements, as ineradicable as the blackberry stains on a sleeve or the ingrained mud on everything. And the whole lot smelt — a pervasive stench of damp and mildew. High time something was done about it. Starting in one corner, Helen began to lift garments from pegs and drop them on the floor in a pile — a mack of her father's, something of Edward's not worn within living memory, a very ancient corduroy jacket of Dorothy's, also unused for many a year. It occurred to her that it might be wise to go through the pockets; her father's garment yielded an old penny and a broken pipe. In Dorothy's jacket was a letter. Unopened and addressed to Helen. She knew the handwriting at once, of course . Until ten years or so ago a bundle of similar envelopes had lain in a drawer of her desk; one day in a fit of vigour she had torn them up and thrown them away. She sat down on the battered settle and opened the letter. ‘Dearest Helen,’ he began; that was interesting — the letters in the destroyed bundle usually began with ‘Dear’or ‘My dear’. He went on to say that he felt they were both being rather silly and he wanted to make amends. He was missing her, he said. He had phoned a couple of times but she had been out. Anyway, maybe he could say what he felt more easily in a letter. She knew he wasn't good at expressing himself. If she was still cross with him please would she stop. He was sorry about what was mainly a misunderstanding. He wanted very much to talk to her. There was something in particular he wanted to talk about. Please would she meet him for a long dinner on Friday — he would expect to hear from her tomorrow or the next day. He signed himself ‘With a great deal of love — Peter.’ The postmark on the envelope was March 10th 1965. The hand of fate is brutal but impersonal. The hand of one's mother is something different. Witting or unwitting? Carelessness — the thing picked up off the hall mat, thrust into her pocket and forgotten — or deliberate appropriation? If the latter — why had she not gone the whole hog and burned it? Well, one would never know and either way the effect was the same. Helen began to shake. She saw her own hands with a certain detachment, holding the letter and trembling convulsively. She did not otherwise feel at all detached. Her mind raced. A number  of things fell into place — click, click, click — with distant muffled echoes like stones dropped into a well. That time. The tiff. The coolness about…about what had it been? ‘A misunderstanding’. Those weeks, not seeing him, wondering, too proud to make the first move. And weeks becoming a month, two months, three…a year. Anger giving way to misery and then to regret and eventually to…nothing. Until now, when one sat here in the cloakroom, surrounded by old raincoats, shaking as though struck down by fever. One could, presumably, trace Peter Datchett. It would be relatively simple — she could think at once of how it could be done: the casual enquiry of a mutual friend with whom she still exchanged Christmas cards, the phone call to the college at which he had been a lecturer. And then the reply: ‘Dear Peter, I have at last received your letter of March 10th 1965. I hope it is not too late to say yes, I'd like very much to have dinner on Friday and I too feel we've been rather silly and it has all been a misunderstanding…’ And there is Peter, on the receiving end, opening it over breakfast with his wife and children…no, children if any are flown by now, Peter is fifty-six…with his wife (and the wife one is of course assuming, merely, but the assumption seems reasonable enough, things being what they are), who says ‘Who's that from?’ And he shoves it in his pocket with some dismissive remark and wonders what the hell he is to do. How embarrassing, he thinks. God — poor old Helen. No, one will not set about tracing Peter Datchett. At this precise moment, thought Helen, I hate my mother. It was a refreshing feeling — invigorating, even. And worth indulging: it stifled various other feelings. She knew that she would not have lived happily ever after with Peter Datchett. No one lives happily ever after. Very likely there would have been a further coolness or misunderstanding and they would have parted. The point was that one would never know, now. And so would wonder, and go on wondering. One would construct alternative scenarios, and brood about them. One would furnish houses and arrange landscapes; one might go  dangerously far and people them with…children. One would conjure up occasions; things would be said and done. All this thanks to Dorothy. Still ordaining. No, said Helen. She rose from the settle. She put the letter in her pocket. In due course she would dispose of it, but not just yet. Think of what was, she told herself, since only that is relevant. What might have been is neither here nor there. She tried to reconstruct the physical Peter Datchett: tall, thin, black hair that tended to flop forwards, a mole on one cheek. He taught at the College of Further Education a few miles from Spaxton; she had met him through a rambling club. His physical presence was all mixed up with muddy tracks, overgrown woodland paths, rain and barbed wire fences and glasses of beer in steamy pubs. And then of course the relationship had become more personal and exclusive: lunches and dinners, films, visits to stately homes or places of scenic interest. Intimacy, of a kind; they were both reserved people, they didn't rush things. She did not remember passion, but a certain eroticism — that, definitely. They were on the brink of sex; it was a matter of time, she had known — next week, the one after. She had explained to him about her mother; he had met her mother; he had seemed to size up the problem, had said the right things in his oblique way. Dorothy had referred to him as ‘that chap with the birthmark on his face.’ Love? It had been in the air, certainly — around the corner, along with sex. What she remembered was a sense of expectancy, of confident expectancy. They had been a unit, had shared jokes, exchanged small gifts, written to each other when unable to meet for a week or two; the assumption was always that this would continue, and expand. Why didn't he write again? Telephone? Arrive on the doorstep? Because, thought Helen, he was as he was. Reserved; a touch diffident. And why did I do nothing? Ditto. She went out into the hall. She picked up the receiver and dialled Giles Carnaby's number. The ringing tone came: once, twice, six times… Out, she thought. Good. Reprieved. But honour is satisfied. You can put the thing down. ‘Hello?’ said Giles. ‘Oh.’ The prepared words evaporated. ‘Is that…? Could I speak to Giles Carnaby?’ ‘You are.’ ‘This is Helen Glover.’ ‘But how very nice. I didn't recognise your voice.’ ‘I was wondering…’ ‘And I'd been thinking of you only yesterday. How are you?’ ‘Very well. I wondered if…’ ‘Your mother's affairs progress. Slowly, as I'm afraid is always the case. The Probate Office moves in its own mysterious way.’ ‘Actually,’ said Helen, ‘that wasn't what I was ringing about. My brother and I are having a few people in for a drink before lunch on Sunday. I wondered if you might be able to come.’ There. No going back now. ‘But I'd be delighted. What fun. Last weekend I was away but this one I'm as free as air. I shall look forward to it. By the way I've finished the Earl Grey. Things are getting desperate. And you never did come and have a cup.’ ‘Oh. No. You can buy it at the delicatessen in Long Barton, you know.’ ‘I'm never in that direction. Do you think you could get me a packet next time you're passing?’ ‘I'll try. I mean yes, I will.’ ‘Bless you. And thank you so much for ringing. What time?’ ‘Time?’ ‘On Sunday.’ ‘Oh — twelve, I think.’ ‘Twelve. Splendid. Till then.’ ‘We're having some people in for a drink on Sunday. Before lunch.’ Edward, dealing out Puffed Wheat to the birds, swung round sharply. ‘Whatever for?’ ‘I thought we should.’ ‘But we've never done it before.’ ‘It's the sort of thing that's done all the time, in other households.’ ‘I can't think why. Who, then?’ ‘Doctor Taylor and his wife, I thought. A few others from the village. And our solicitor, Giles Carnaby.’ ‘But you went to hear him sing,’ said Edward. ‘Surely that was quite enough.’ ‘They will arrive at twelve and stay probably for an hour and a half or so. I'll get the drink but you'll have to help pour it out. Is there anyone you'd like to ask?’ ‘Certainly not. And I hope this isn't going to be a precedent.’ She made telephone calls. She hoovered and dusted the sitting room. She found glasses that were unchipped and as nearly matching as possible. She bought sherry and white wine and whisky. She bought bags of little biscuity things. ‘You make me laugh,’ said her mother. ‘I never saw such a carry-on. Who do you think you're fooling?’ ‘Nobody,’ Helen replied. Least of all myself. ‘And that chap — Giles Thingy — do you imagine he's going to be taken in? A man like that.’ ‘Enough,’ said Helen. ‘You have no right. Nor ever did. From now on I'll be mine own executioner.’ ‘Whatever have you done to the cloakroom?’ complained Edward. ‘Cleared it out.’ ‘I liked it the way it was.’ ‘We've still got nine raincoats and anoraks between us. And eight different hats and an alpenstock and a flywhisk and four walking-sticks.’ ‘I used to enjoy the way you never knew what you'd come across next.’ ‘I don't share your feelings,’ said Helen. She considered making a ceremonial pyre. She would burn Peter Datchett's letter and that dress in one fine condemnatory blaze. There you are, mother — there they go, properly disposed of at last. A few years too late. Or did you always think they had  been? Were you careless or calculating? And what did you do it for? Were these sins of omission, or a devilish scheme? I can't know if you succeeded in changing the course of my life, but it's possible. And for a person in a somewhat delicate emotional condition, as I believe myself to be, this is hard to contemplate. She did not believe that marriage, or pairing, or however you cared to define a sexual relationship, was the key to happiness and fulfilment; you only had to look around you to see that this was not so. Which was worse — to have tried and failed or never to have tried at all? She thought of her father — that grey and distant figure associated only with anchovy paste and a rustling newspaper. It was not comfortable to consider her parents' intimate life; she could recall no demonstrations of affection or indeed even of much displayed interest in one another. Usually, Dorothy had been engaged in shifting her husband around like an inharmonious piece of furniture. His own image was one of compliant self-effacement. He went out to work by day, conveniently, at a firm of accountants; in the evenings and at weekends he made himself as unobtrusive as possible. God knows what went on at night. In the end she pushed the letter into the drawer of her desk and left the dress where it was, in the corner of the wardrobe. All in good time. Edward, practised in self-deception, forgot about the guests until Sunday morning and was therefore surprised to discover Helen, at ten-thirty, wearing unexpected clothes and straightening cushions in the sitting room. She was also flushed and evidently in a state of unrest, which made him feel chivalrous and sympathetic. He decided to be nice about the whole business, though he still could not see the point of it, and offered to put the little biscuity things into bowls. He gave some of them to Tam in the process. It was not so much that he had anything against people in general, more that he saw no purpose in deliberately setting up occasions on which you stood around trying to think of something to say. Moreover, the whole process was self-perpetuating; the guest became the host in an act of social revenge and thus it  went on for ever. The only sensible course was never to start it in the first place. He could not think what had got into Helen, normally as rational as himself about all this, or so he had thought. Nevertheless, when the doorbell rang he was ready and waiting, with an agreeable expression and a fluent command of what to offer by way of drink. He had been feeling a bit better for the last few days: He had repaired the fence between the Britches and Ron Paget's yard, filled two black plastic sacks with rubbish and had embarked on a vigorous assault upon dead and decaying trees. It all felt very positive and forward-looking. The visitors arrived. There were not enough of them to make the large Greystones sitting room look as though much was going on; people stood in small clumps, eyeing one another; awkward silences broke out. I told you so, thought Edward, ploughing valiantly around with a bottle in each hand. Tam scrabbled at each pair of legs in turn, remembering the biscuits; the more uninhibited guests kicked, furtively. Apart from the doctor and his wife and Giles Carnaby they were all people from the village who had not had an opportunity for a good look at the inside of Greystones for quite a while and were busy taking note. ‘I s'pose you may be thinking of selling the Britches now, Edward?’ asked a neighbour. ‘Oh no,’ said Edward. ‘There's no question of that.’ He couldn't remember her name; her face was as familiar to him as the frontage of the village shop or outline of the church tower; he had always been hopeless at names. The solicitor detached himself from another group and joined them. ‘Giles Carnaby — we haven't met. Your sister is busy hostessing so I'm introducing myself.’ ‘Oh,’ said Edward. ‘Yes. Hello. This is Mrs…’ He gazed wildly at the neighbour who said crossly, ‘Jean Powers. Actually Edward's known me for ten years, but there we are. You live in Spaxton, don't you?’ Edward, thinking with relief that he could leave them to it now, began to withdraw, clutching the bottles that gave him a certain exemption, free to come and go. The solicitor laid a hand on his arm, making Edward wince: he didn't like to be touched. ‘Were you talking about the famous Britches? Helen's told me so much about the place. May I have a conducted tour sometime?’ No you certainly can't, thought  Edward, and what's all this ‘Helen’ stuff? He said, ‘There's absolutely nothing to see and it's awfully full of nettles’; at the same moment Jean Powers was saying noisily that not a solitary soul had been into the Britches in years and the village wondered what Edward got up to in there — ha ha!— some people said he must be into black magic, or maybe he was growing cannabis. Edward laughed politely, slid from Carnaby's grip and edged towards the group by the window, who were talking about hedges in tones of some desperation. As he did so Helen passed him; her neck was red, a sure sign of agitation. She hissed, ‘Do do something about the Taylors and old Mrs Phipson. They've been stuck together for hours.’ ‘How?’ enquired Edward; he meant it — he had absolutely no idea of the mechanics involved. Helen gave him a look of fury. The group by the window turned to him anxiously: ‘Is that hedge yew, Edward? None of us can decide.’ Really, thought Edward, people must be out of their minds, submitting themselves to this sort of occasion quite voluntarily. Kill or cure, Helen had thought. As soon as she set eyes on Giles Carnaby again she knew that whatever it was it was not a case of cure; her heart thumped, she felt unstable. There he was. Here he was. Smiling at her over people's shoulders while she could not move because someone was telling her at length how much she must be missing her mother. And then she saw him talking to Edward and Jean Powers and then someone had mislaid their glass and she had to find another and then there was the problem of the Taylors and old Mrs Phipson. And then eventually she could cross the room towards him. ‘There you are,’ he said. ‘I have been most restrained — I could see you had your hands full. But I have met your brother at long last and Mrs Powers has been regaling me with the most fascinating pieces of village gossip.’ This set Jean Powers off on a torrent of exclamations and denials so that Helen could not have got a word in had she wished to; she stood and looked at Giles Carnaby and tried to be calm. She tried to see him dispassionately as a grey-haired solicitor rather too well endowed with easy charm; indeed, she  saw him thus, but she also saw him otherwise, and could not help herself. When he turned to look intently at Jean Powers she felt a twinge of jealousy; his arm, brushing momentarily against hers, made her tingle all over. This sort of thing was bad enough at eighteen, she thought; at my age it is ludicrous and humiliating. Jean Powers moved away. Giles said ‘Dear me, what a demanding woman. She's not a great friend, I hope? Anyway, now that I've got you to myself for a moment can we make some plans? First of all, am I going to be able to persuade you to…’ ‘Oh Helen!’ cried the doctor's wife, appearing at their side, ‘We're going to have to rush off, I'm afraid. John's on call today. But first I must just have a word with you about…’ She attended to the doctor's wife. She got the doctor and his wife into their coats and saw them out of the front door. She returned to the sitting room and struck Tam, who had knocked the bowl of biscuits from the table and was wolfing them off the carpet. She refilled three glasses. She went into the kitchen to see if there was another packet of biscuits. I am not enjoying myself, she thought — but then I was never supposed to, was I? She sought biscuits in the bread bin, the vegetable rack, on the dresser. No damn biscuits. Giles appeared. ‘Is there anything I can do? You look harassed.’ ‘I am harassed,’ said Helen. ‘Edward's wretched dog has eaten the biscuits.’ ‘People can live without biscuits.’ ‘I know,’ she replied. ‘But it doesn't seem so at this moment.’ I just may burst into tears, she thought. I just might, appallingly, sit down on the kitchen chair and start to weep… Giles put his hand on hers: ‘Stop worrying about the biscuits and talk to me. We were interrupted. I was in the middle of trying to find out if you'll come and have dinner with me next week. At home. I'm not much of a cook but I do a passable roast. Thursday? Friday?’ She subsided onto the chair. She was not, she found, going to burst into tears after all. The biscuits became unimportant, and the guests. ‘Thursday,’ she said. ‘I'm not doing anything on Thursday.’ The kitchen became a warm and friendly place; she sat in it smiling at Giles Carnaby. I'm happy, she thought in surprise, at this precise moment I am happy."
FIC FIC-J10-001 -0.11 "CHAPTER 1 ‘But,’ said Owen, ‘where is the body?’ ‘Ah yes,’ said the watchman, rubbing one horny foot up and down his shin. ‘Ah yes,’ said the corporal, shuffling uneasily. Owen waited. ‘Well,’ said the corporal at last, looking out over the river to where a low mud shoal raised its back above the water, grey and wrinkled like a hippopotamus, ‘it was there.’ ‘Well,’ said Owen, ‘it's not there now.’ It had been a long, hot, fruitless morning. And now this! He boiled over. ‘If this is some joke —’ The watchman looked as if he was about to burst into tears. ‘But, effendi, it was there, I saw it.’ ‘Or thought you did.’ ‘Foolish man!’ said the corporal, swiftly switching sides. ‘It was all a dream.’ He gave the watchman a push. The watchman pushed him back. ‘It was no dream!’ he insisted. ‘I saw it with my own two eyes. A woman, on the sandbank.’ ‘A woman!’ said the corporal. ‘There, what did I tell you! It is time you got another wife, Abu. Then you would stop having these foolish dreams.’ ‘I saw it plainly. On the sandbank.’ ‘You saw something plainly,’ said Owen. ‘It was a woman,’ insisted the watchman doggedly. ‘A heap of camel dung!’ scoffed the corporal. ‘In the middle of the river?’ said the watchman angrily. ‘Anyway,’ said Owen, ‘it's not there now.’ ‘It was there.’ ‘Then what has happened to it?’ ‘Perhaps,’ suggested the corporal, ‘the river has washed it away?’ Owen looked up and down the river. It stretched, broad and placid, to the horizon on both sides. Further on down, near to the city, a single felucca was gliding gracefully in towards the bank. It came to rest and then there was nothing else moving in the intense heat of the late morning Egyptian sun. He scanned the water's edge carefully. At this time of year, with the flood still some weeks off, the Nile had shrunk back into its bed, uncovering a wide strip of mud, now baked hard and dry and cracked like crazy paving. Far away he thought he could see some goats grazing. But there was no suspicious heap lying grounded in the shallows, no flotsam or jetsam at all. Anything that came ashore would be snatched up at once by thrifty beachcombers. Under his feet a little floating clump of Um Suf, Mother of Wool, papyrus reed, torn loose from its moorings hundreds of miles to the south, nestled along the bank and came to rest against the shoal. Nestled and stuck. The current was not even sufficient to tug it loose again. ‘It can't have!’ said the watchman angrily. ‘It was Lying right up on the shoal.’ ‘How did it get there, then?’ asked the corporal. ‘Did it jump up there like a fish?’ This was exactly the kind of non-issue that Owen didn't want to get involved in. In fact, he didn't want to get involved in any of this at all. ‘This isn't anything to do with me,’ he said. ‘This is not for the Mamur Zapt.’ ‘Quite right, effendi!’ said the corporal smartly. ‘Only a woman.’ That was not what he had meant. ‘This is a matter for the Parquet,’ he said. This was an ordinary crime if ever he'd seen one. And ordinary crimes were handled by the Parquet, the Department  of Prosecutions of the Ministry of Justice. The Egyptian legal system was like the French. Conduct of a criminal investigation was the responsibility of a prosecuting lawyer, not of the police. The police worked under his direction. And, of course, when a crime was reported they were the ones who had to notify the Parquet in the first place. ‘Has the Parquet been notified?’ he said sternly. The corporal scratched his head. ‘I expect so,’ he said. ‘Expect so?’ Owen boiled over with fury. ‘I should bloody well expect so, too. And I'd expect them to be here. I'd expect them to be wasting their time on this foolish nonsense and not me. Whose idea was it to send for the Mamur Zapt anyway?’ ‘I don't know anything about it,’ said the corporal hurriedly. ‘One said that you were near, effendi,’ said the watchman forlornly, ‘and the Chief thought —’ Owen knew damned well what the District Chief had thought. He had thought, here was somebody senior he could pass responsibility to without having to do anything about it himself. Right on the spot, too! He wouldn't even have to stir out of the cool of his office. While he, Owen, was tearing around all over the place like a bloody lunatic! ‘Tell the Chief,’ he said ominously, ‘that I'll be wanting a word with him.’ This was ridiculous. He couldn't afford to be spending his time here. He had a dozen men on the other side of town waiting for him. They had been about half way through when the message had come from the District Chief. He had dropped everything and left. And you could bet that the moment he'd left they'd sat down in the shade. He set off back up the bank. After a moment's hesitation the other two ran after him. ‘Effendi! Effendi!’ ‘You stay here. Wait for the Parquet. You can tell it all to them.’ He reached the top of the bank, lizards scattering out of the way in front of him. He was just about to plunge back into the streets when he saw someone running towards him. It was one of the men he had left. ‘Effendi!’ he gasped. ‘A message! From the Bimbashi!’ ‘Yes?’ ‘You are to go to the river.’ Owen looked round. Behind him the river sparkled placidly in the sun. Apart from the corporal and the watchman, there wasn't a soul in sight. Nothing moved on the bank or out on the water. The mud shoal and its hump dozed tranquilly in the heat. ‘Well,’ said Owen, ‘I'm at the river. But why on earth…?’ The Bimbashi arrived shortly afterwards. He was in a motor-car. This was impressive since there were relatively few cars in Cairo in 1909 and the police force itself did not boast one. Normally it went about its business either on foot or in an arabeah, the horse-drawn cab distinctive to the city. If it needed a car it borrowed the Army's one. But that was battered and sober: this one was new and, well, spectacular. ‘Green,’ said the driver of the car, noting with satisfaction Owen's interest. ‘There was a bit of a fuss about that. The Mufti complained. But I said: ‘It's almost the family colour, isn't it?’’ The Bimbashi, McPhee, pink and fair and anxious, rushed forward. ‘This is Captain Owen, Prince. Owen, Prince Narouz.’ ‘Ah!’ said the Prince. ‘The Mamur Zapt. You got here quickly. Efficient of you. But then —’ he smiled ambiguously —‘we know the Mamur Zapt to be efficient, don't we?’ He was perhaps in his late, perhaps in his early thirties. All the males of the Khedive's family tended to thicken out  and age suddenly as they approached middle age. Owen knew from the title that this was a member of the Egyptian Royal Family but which of the Khedive's numerous progeny it was escaped him for the moment. The third person in the car was another Egyptian, definitely about thirty, slim and dressed, like the Prince, in a smart, European-style suit but with the usual pot-like tarboosh of the Egyptian professional on his head. Owen knew who this one was. His name was Mahmoud el Zaki and he was one of the Parquet's rising stars. They embraced warmly in the Arab fashion. They had worked together often and got on well. The Prince and McPhee had walked on to the top of the bank and were standing looking down at the river. ‘What's all this about?’ whispered Owen. ‘Don't know. Someone else was going to do this one and then they suddenly switched me on to it.’ They joined the others. ‘What's going on?’ Owen asked. McPhee turned a concerned face towards him. ‘Something absolutely frightful has happened,’ he said. ‘The Prince was on a dahabeeyah last night coming back from Karnak and someone fell overboard.’ ‘A woman?’ McPhee nodded. ‘As soon as we got the report we suspected — well, we knew, I suppose. She couldn't swim.’ ‘You got the report?’ ‘The Prince phoned Garvin first thing this morning.’ Garvin was the Commandant of the Cairo Police force. McPhee was his deputy. ‘What about the Parquet?’ ‘We got the report in the ordinary way,’ said Mahmoud. ‘At that stage it was just that a body had been found. I imagine,’ he said to the Prince, ‘that you yourself rang up later?’ ‘After I had spoken to Garvin.’ The Prince hesitated. ‘You see, I didn't want this to be…clumsily handled.’ ‘Oh, of course not!’ said McPhee sympathetically. ‘The poor girl! And the family, of course!’ ‘Yes. And the Khedivial connection.’ ‘Of course. Of course.’ ‘It could be embarrassing, you see. Politically, I mean.’ ‘For you?’ asked Owen. The Prince looked at him coolly. ‘For the Khedive. There is no particular reason why it should be. There is nothing, shall I say, to be embarrassed about. But you know what the Press is and people are. It could be used. Turned against the Khedive. Used to discredit him. Would the British Government want that, Captain Owen?’ ‘Assuredly not. The Khedive is a valued friend and ally.’ Not only that. He was the facade which concealed the realities of British power in Egypt. For while the Khedive was the apparent ruler of Egypt, the country's real ruler, in 1909, was the British Consul-General. His rule was indirect and unobtrusive. The Khedive had his Prime Minister, his Ministers and his Ministries. But at the top of each Ministry, alongside each Minister, was a British ‘Adviser’ and all the key public posts were occupied by Englishmen. Like the Commandant and Deputy Commandant of the Cairo Police. Like the Mamur Zapt. ‘That's what the Consul-General thought too,’ said the Prince. ‘I spoke to him this morning.’ ‘We are to give whatever help we can,’ McPhee told Owen. ‘How far does the help extend?’ asked Owen. The Prince smiled. ‘Not as 6r as you are evidently supposing,’ he said. ‘I appreciate that someone has died. The matter must be investigated and will be most ably, I am sure, by Mr el  Zaki, here. If a crime has been committed — oh, negligence, say — those responsible must be punished. It's all straight and aboveboard, Captain Owen, and Mr el Zaki's involvement should be a guarantee of that.’ ‘I have complete confidence in Mr el Zaki.’ ‘Quite. But, you see, there is the other dimension too. The political one. The case needs to be handled from that point of view too. It needs to be…managed.’ ‘I see. And you would like me to provide that management?’ ‘Who better?’ Owen could think of lots of people he would prefer to see handling this particular case. Most people, in fact. The Prince was watching his face. ‘It's not as bad as all that,’ he said. ‘We're not asking you to do anything you shouldn't. It's mainly a matter of controlling the Press.’ ‘It's not easy to control the Press on something like this. It's bound to get out. In a foreign newspaper, perhaps.’ In cosmopolitan Cairo with its three principal working languages and at least a dozen other widely used ones people turned as readily to the overseas press as they did to the native one. More readily, for the former wasn't censored. ‘That's why I spoke of…management.’ ‘I see.’ ‘Good!’ said the Prince briskly. ‘Then that's all sorted out.’ He looked down at the river bed below him. ‘Well,’ he said, ‘I suppose we ought to go down. You'll be needing an identification.’ ‘There's just one thing,’ said Owen. ‘Not there?’ said the Prince incredulously. ‘Not there?’ echoed McPhee. Mahmoud did not say anything but started immediately down the slope. By the time they got there he was already talking to the watchman. ‘I don't understand,’ said the Prince. ‘Are you saying that this is all a mistake?’ ‘A body was reported,’ said Owen. ‘A false report?’ Owen shrugged. The watchman fell on his knees. ‘It was true, effendi,’ he protested vehemently. ‘I saw it. I swear it. On my father's…’ ‘I begin to doubt,’ said the Prince coldly, ‘whether you had a father.’ The watchman swallowed. ‘It was there, effendi,’ he said, pointing to the shoal. ‘There! I swear it.’ ‘Then where is it?’ The watchman swallowed again. ‘I don't know, effendi,’ he said weakly. ‘I don't know.’ ‘The river, effendi,’ insinuated the corporal sotto uoce. ‘It could be the river.’ Bur the Prince had already turned away. ‘This is awkward,’ he said. ‘It could have been somebody else,’ said Owen. ‘It needn't have been the girl.’ ‘The report was of a woman's body.’ ‘Another woman, perhaps.’ The Prince shrugged. ‘Unlikely, I would have thought. Unless you have women's bodies floating down this part of the river all the time.’ ‘Oh no, effendi,’ said the corporal hastily. ‘Awkward,’ said the Prince again. ‘It would have been much more convenient… Well, it must be somewhere. You'll have to find it, that's all.’ ‘I'll get on to it right away,’ promised McPhee. ‘I'll alert all the police stations —’ ‘Quietly,’ said the Prince. ‘If that's possible with the police.’ ‘There's a bend below the city,’ said Mahmoud. ‘It will probably turn up there.’ ‘Have someone looking out for it,’ ordered the Prince. ‘This needs to be handled discreetly.’ He looked at Owen. ‘You're managing this. Remember?’ Owen and Mahmoud were left on the river bed. ‘Like it?’ said Owen. ‘No,’ said Mahmoud. ‘But then, there's quite a lot I don't like.’ He called the watchman over. ‘Come here,’ he said. ‘You saw the body. Describe it.’ ‘It was a woman.’ ‘Clothed?’ ‘Of course!’ said the watchman, shocked. ‘It mightn't have been. What was she wearing?’ The watchman looked down at his feet, embarrassed. ‘Shintiyan,’ he muttered. ‘Trousers?’ said the corporal, unable to restrain himself. ‘Oh ho, Abu, this is the stuff of dreams!’ ‘Colour?’ ‘Pink,’ muttered the watchman. ‘She was not a village woman, then?’ ‘No, effendi.’ The watchman shook his head definitely. ‘What else was she wearing? A tob?’ The watchman hesitated. ‘I think so, effendi. It was hard to tell.’ The corporal guffawed. ‘He only saw the shintiyan!’ ‘She wore something, though, apart from the shintiyan?’ 'Oh, yes, effendi. It was just the way she was Lying,’ he said aside to the corporal. ‘That's how I came to see them.’ The shintiyan were ordinary trousers, not undergarments, and came right down to the ankle. ‘How was she Lying?’ asked Mahmoud. The watchman lay down on the sand and put his arms together over his head. His body formed a kind of crescent. ‘There's a hump on the shoal,’ he said. ‘She was Lying round that.’ ‘Show me.’ They splashed out to the shoal. The water was shallow and hardly came up their knees. The shoal was some twenty feet long, and about four feet wide. At the downstream end it rose into a little hump. ‘She was Lying round that,’ said the watchman. ‘Head that side, feet this.’ ‘The body probably caught up against it on its way downstream,’ said Owen. ‘Well, yes,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Possibly. But you can see from the mud that normally the upper part of the shoal is above the water.’ ‘The wash of a boat? The Prince's boat?’ ‘Possibly.’ Mahmoud examined the mud carefully. ‘We'll have to get the trackers out here,’ he said. ‘I can't see anything.’ ‘Does it matter?’ asked Owen. ‘If anything happened, it happened on the boat. Where the body finishes up is neither here nor there.’ ‘Yes,’ said Mahmoud. ‘Except that there's one thing I find puzzling. I can accept that the body might have been carried high up on to the shoal by an exceptionally heavy wash from a boat. But I find it hard to believe in a second exceptionally heavy wash from a boat in the same morning — one so heavy as to carry the body off again.’ Owen had to go back to his men. He found them, as he expected, doing nothing. They were supposed to be carrying out an arms search. In fact, they were chatting peacefully in the shade. He put them back to work. The tip had come from a  reliable source. You didn't waste things like that in his business. According to his informant, the arms had come into the quarter the previous day. The consignment was substantial, at least two donkey-loads. It would be hidden in the quarter until the necessary deals were struck and the arms could be distributed. For a consignment as large as that hiding-places were limited. The houses in this poor part of town were single-storey, one-room affairs and there was seldom any furniture in the room. The men would simply come into the room, stand and look. Usually they concentrated their attention on the roof. The roofs were flat and used for storage: onions, maize stalks, cattle dung being dried out for fuel, firewood. It was under the firewood that arms were usually hidden. The men would run up the outside staircases and make straight for that. By now, though, the sun was directly overhead and on the roofs it was unbearably hot. It was hot even to step on them. The men winced as their bare feet touched the plaster and Owen could feel the heat even through the soles of his shoes. That was the trouble about missing a couple of hours. If he had not been called away it would have been done by now. The men were beginning to slow down. He went round chivvying. Two men were taking a suspiciously long time on a roof. He went up to see what they were doing. He had maligned them. They were working. Like many of the roofs, this one had a dovecot. It consisted of large earthenware pots stacked on top of each other on their sides so that the mouths all pointed one way like a battery of guns. The doves flew in at the mouths and made their nests inside. The trouble was that a number of the birds were inside  now and the constables, country boys, were conscientiously taking them out one by one before feeling around inside. ‘That's all right,’ he said. ‘You don't need to do that.’ ‘You told us to check everything!’ ‘Yes, but —’ He was forced to admit they were right. It could be a possible hiding-place. Though only for pistols. ‘Don't do them all,’ he said. ‘Just try a few. Otherwise you'll be here all day.’ ‘We don't want to miss anything,’ one of them said, reaching unhurriedly into another pot. ‘Yes, but we want to get a move on.’ ‘Sure!’ they agreed equably. They were some of the men he had borrowed from the local District Chief. Out here on the edge of the city life was still close to that of the village and the pace was very different from what it was further in. He thought it would probably confuse them if he insisted on their moving on. Instead, hoping to expedite matters, he squatted down beside them and gave them a hand. In the relaxed way of countryfolk, they began to chat. ‘Did you find what you wanted over there?’ asked one of them, inclining his head in the direction of the river. Over the houses Owen caught a glimpse of blue. ‘No.’ ‘Nor here, either. You're not having much luck this morning, are you?’ ‘There's still time. If we get a move on,’ he said pointedly. ‘Oh yes. Things usually turn out right in the end.’ ‘Yes, but only if —’ He stopped himself. It was pointless. One of the things he had learned since coming to Egypt was that the country had its rhythms and that if you were going to get anywhere you had to work with them and not against them. ‘It was a body,’ he said, changing tack. ‘Over there. By the river.’ ‘Oh yes.’ ‘Yes. Or rather, a body was reported. By the time I got there it had gone.’ The man laughed. ‘Bodies have a way of doing that,’ he said. ‘Or at least, on this part of the river they do.’ ‘How's that?’ ‘Oh well, if you find one, that means more work for the Chief, doesn't it?’ ‘So he doesn't mind too much if one goes missing?’ ‘He doesn't mind at all.’ ‘How might they go missing?’ ‘All sorts of ways,’ said the man vaguely. ‘They might hit a pole, for instance,’ suggested his friend. ‘What?’ The two men laughed, as at a private joke. ‘They can hit all sorts of things on their way downriver,’ said the first man, looking at his friend chidingly. ‘But what about when they're washed up?’ ‘That's when they have to be reported.’ The man laughed again. ‘Are there people working the bank?’ ‘How do you mean?’ ‘On the lookout for things. Things that get washed ashore?’ ‘Oh yes.’ ‘Regulars?’ ‘Yes.’ ‘Are they organized? Is there a gang? A society?’ The men looked at each other, then dropped their eyes. ‘We wouldn't know about that,’ they said. They worked on carefully through the dovecot. When they had finished they patted the dovecot affectionately and climbed back unhurriedly down the stairs. Owen sat thinking. It was a new possibility. Suppose the body had not been washed away? Suppose it had been interfered with? Suppose somebody had got to it? Owen went to see the District Chief afterwards. He had a thing or two he wanted to tell him. To his surprise, when he reached the office he found the green car drawn up outside and the Prince about to go in. ‘Why, Captain Owen!’ said the Prince, pausing for him. ‘How felicitous! I was just making sure that everything was covered.’ ‘Isn't McPhee supposed to be doing that?’ ‘Of course. But it sometimes helps if you remind key people which side their bread is buttered on, don't you think?’ Owen wondered in what sense the District Chief was key. The District Chief was, in fact, looking rather shaken. ‘After all,’ said the Prince with a wave of his hand, ‘it's not every day that he gets called on by both Royalty and the Head of the Secret Police.’ He gave Owen a sidelong glance. ‘He is probably more impressed by the latter, I'm afraid.’ ‘I doubt it, Prince.’ ‘You're his boss, aren't you?’ ‘No. He comes under Mr McPhee.’ ‘Not the Mamur Zapt? Don't they all come under the Mamur Zapt?’ ‘No, Prince. The Mamur Zapt is, well, out to one side.’ ‘You, too? Of course, things have changed. In my grandfather's time the Mamur Zapt used to control everything. He was the Khedive's right-hand man, you know. The man he relied on to keep him in power.’ ‘I am afraid his scope is a little more restricted these days, Prince.’ The title ‘Head of the Secret Police’ was in any case something of a misnomer. Head of the Political Branch of the CID was the closest British equivalent. Perhaps, too, in army terms — and some considered Egypt an occupied country — Head of Political Intelligence. ‘Yes. And in the old days he used to serve the Khedive.’ ‘He still does, Your Highness.’ The Prince smiled. ‘Well,’ he said. ‘I am sure you have business of your own with our friend here. Please don't let me interrupt you.’ He walked over to one of the low, shuttered windows and sat on the sill. ‘Do carry on.’ Owen hesitated. ‘Not secret, is it? If it is, I will at once remove myself. Though, as you said a moment ago, you are in a sense one of my servants.’ ‘The Khedive's servants, certainly. No, Your Highness, you are, of course, welcome to stay. I was merely going to ask the Chief why he sent for me this morning.’ ‘But is not that obvious?’ ‘No, far from it. The proper procedure, you see, when a crime is reported, is to notify the Parquet, not the Mamur Zapt.’ ‘I see. Well, man, answer him. Why did you send for him?’ ‘The Mamur Zapt was nearby,’ muttered the Chief. ‘Well, that seems reasonable. You were nearby. And, by the way, that was very prescient of you.’ ‘Hardly. I was conducting a search for arms.’ ‘Really? In this vicinity? There does seem to be a lot going on in this neighbourhood. Arms, you say? Well, I suppose that's important.’ ‘Yes. To the Khedive as well as to me.’ ‘You think so? Yes, I suppose you're right. They're just as likely to be used against us as they are against you. We and the British have a lot in common. We're both unpopular.’ ‘Only with some people, Prince.’ ‘Well, yes. These Nationalists! Very trying people. My father keeps wondering whether to bring them in or keep them out. Bring them in and they want to change things. Keep them out and you deny them the chance to share in  our unpopularity. Which is hardly wise, don't you think? I'm all for bringing them in.’ ‘You could always go half way. Bring them in so that they share the unpopularity but don't give them enough power to change anything.’ ‘Ah yes. Of course, that is the British solution. And very effective, too. But then, what about these guns? These arms of yours? Don't you think there's a danger that if people are disappointed they're more ready to try extreme solutions? What do you do then?’ ‘Conduct arms searches.’ ‘I see. Why, Captain Owen, you've persuaded me! I am now convinced that your work was very important. Too important to be interrupted. So, fellow, why did you interrupt him?’ The District Chief, who had not altogether followed all this, looked blank. ‘I was wondering whether he'd received a phone call,’ explained Owen. ‘A phone call to suggest that there were other things more important.’ ‘Oh, me, you mean? No. I always start at the top. I get round to the bottom later. As, of course, you see.’ ‘I was puzzled,’ said Owen. ‘The message from the Chief came first. Before the message from Mr McPhee.’ The Prince looked at him sharply. ‘Yes,’ he said, ‘that is interesting.’ He slipped off the sill, walked across to the Chief and stood in front of him. ‘That is interesting. Well,’ he said silkily, ‘did you receive a phone call this morning?’ ‘No,’ said the Chief, ‘no phone calls.’ ‘Or any other kind of message?’ asked Owen. ‘Did someone come to see you, for instance?’ ‘No.’ ‘The Mamur Zapt will check,’ warned the Prince. ‘If I were you I'd get it right the first time.’ ‘No one came. There were no messages, effendi. I swear it. ‘So why,’ asked the Prince, ‘did you send for Captain Owen?’ ‘I thought — I thought — the Mamur Zapt was near — and —’ ‘There may be a simple explanation,’ said Owen. ‘Laziness.’ ‘Laziness?’ ‘He heard there was someone senior in the neighbourhood and saw it as a golden opportunity to pass on the responsibility.’ ‘But isn't there a difficulty here? You said yourself earlier that you are not his superior, not directly. Yes, and that in any case the normal procedure was for the matter to be reported to the Parquet.’ ‘These are facts of which I meant to remind him.’ ‘I see. Good.’ The Prince wheeled away. ‘Carry on,’ he said over his shoulder. ‘Another time. Your Highness, I must apologize. I have been delaying you. You yourself had business, I think, with the District Chief?’ ‘Well, yes. Certainly.’ ‘Don't let me delay you further. Please carry on.’ He walked over to the window and sat on the sill. ‘Don't mind me,’ he said encouragingly. The Prince sat silently for a moment looking at Owen. Then he suddenly smiled. ‘Touché he said. ‘However, I don't mind you hearing.’ He crooked his finger. The Chief came towards him. ‘The body that was washed up this morning: I am interested in it. If I am interested, other people will be, too. Now. One!’ He held up his forefinger. ‘If anyone comes round inquiring, I want to know who they are. Two!’ He held up the second finger. ‘You are to tell them nothing. They may offer you money. If you take it, I shall hear, and you know what to expect, don't you? On the other hand, if you report all to me it may be that I shall give you money. Understand? Three!’ He clasped the third finger. ‘It may be that you will come across information which you think would interest me. Information about the body, for instance. Not about the girl, I don't need that. Just the body. I am prepared to pay for such information and pay well. Now, have you got all that?’ ‘Yes, Your Highness.’ ‘I'm sure you have. But just to make even surer, I am going to ask you to tell me what the three things are that could make you rich.’ He held up his forefinger and looked questioningly at the District Chief. ‘If people come asking,’ said the Chief hoarsely. ‘You are to say nothing. Good. And the second?’ ‘I am to tell you who they are.’ ‘Excellent!’ The Prince looked at Owen. ‘The man is well on his way to becoming rich, wouldn't you say?’ ‘There are sometimes dangers in trying to get rich too quickly.’ ‘Oh, pooh! Don't be a spoilsport. The man wants to get rich. Let him have his dream! Now, fellow, what is the third thing you have to do?’ He held up the third finger. The Chief kept his eyes fixed on it. ‘To bring you information, Your Highness. Information about the body.’ ‘Good.’ The Prince patted him on the back. ‘Good fellow! You have learned your lesson.’ ‘Thank you, Your Highness.’ He seemed uncertain, however. ‘Well?’ said the Prince. ‘What is it?’ ‘I — I — there is a thing I don't quite understand, Your Highness.’ ‘Yes? What is it?’ ‘The body, Your Highness. You said you wanted information about the body, Your Highness.’ ‘Yes?’ The District Chief hesitated, then took the plunge. ‘What sort of information, Your Highness? I will go and see the body if you wish and describe it to you. In detail, naturally. But —’ He looked uncomfortably to Owen for support. ‘No, no, no!’ said the Prince hastily. ‘Not that sort of thing!’ ‘Then —?’ ‘The body has disappeared,’ said Owen. ‘Disappeared?’ ‘Gone. From the sandbank where it was apparently found.’ ‘Gone?’ said the District Chief, as if he could not believe his ears. ‘Gone?’ ‘That's right. When I got there it had gone.’ ‘Abu?’ said the Chief faintly. ‘Ibrahim?’ ‘We got there together. It had already gone. Ibrahim rather doubted it had been there in the first place.’ The Chief unexpectedly went ashen. He bowed his head between his hands. ‘God!’ he said. ‘God!’ ‘I want to find it,’ said the Prince. ‘Quickly, and before anyone else does. Got it?’"
FIC FIC-J54-001 -0.1 "LONDON was misted over. That was Sara Monroe's first disappointment. Jetting across the Atlantic, after two years in America, she had looked forward to seeing her home town from the air, to retracing toy-sized, familiar landmarks, to marvelling at new unfamiliar ones. She wanted to savour, to prolong, her anticipation. But London, provocatively, was wreathed in blue veiling. The mist seemed like a bad omen and Sara's heart sank a little. Perhaps everything was not going to be better. There was a swift unromantic transition from the warm enclosed world of the aircraft to the hurly-burly of the airport. On the ground, the mist was less noticeable but it was a dull day and cold for May. Sara shivered a little in her thin American suit as she walked down the gangway and got into the bus which was  to take her and the other passengers to the arrival building. But later, as she listened to the English accents of the Customs men, her feeling of anti-climax evaporated a little. She was really and truly home. She did not have much baggage with her, as most of her belongings, accumulated in her two years' stay in New York, had been sent ahead by sea. She waited impatiently to be cleared, trying to peer meanwhile through the doorway beyond the Customs hall where friends and relatives of the travellers were crowded, but she could see no sign of Jenny. She was sure she was there. Jenny, her half-sister, eighteen years old and five years younger than herself, had written so positively that she would be at the airport to meet her.  ""I am longing to see you,"" Jenny had written. ""So much seems to have happened while you have been away. I assure you that now I am completely grown-up—though Daddy doesn't seem to think so, I need hardly add. He still treats me as though I were ten. I shall definitely  be at the airport to meet you and I hope to have some startling and important news to give you in person. All my love, Jenny. PS. He's marvellous."" Sara had smiled when she read the letter. Grown-up Jenny might feel, but she still sounded the same. Even at sixteen there had always been some marvellous ""he"" in her life. At last her bags were given the magic chalk marks and she was free to go. She passed through the doorway, her eyes raking through the little knot of people clustered round it. Still there was no sign of Jenny. Sara walked beyond the crowd and put her cases down and waited. The life of the airport eddied round her. People met and greeted each other with little cries of welcome. Officials in their variety of blue uniforms hurried to and fro on urgent business. Travellers, in the motley garb affected by travellers, in a state of suspended animation, sat on couches and looked tired, making footstools of their hold-alls. But nowhere in the throng could  Sara see Jenny's fair hair and slender figure. She decided that she would make a phone call just to check that Jenny had left home and knew the right time of her arrival. But first she had to get herself some English money. The coppers felt huge and unaccustomed in her hand when she received them. She searched again before making her telephone call. It would be so typical if Jenny missed her while she was in the booth. But Jenny did not appear. As Sara dialled the Kensington number of her stepfather's house, she had a vision of the hall where the telephone table was, and she was invaded with the old feeling of inadequacy. The phone seemed to ring for a long time. There must be someone there, the daily help, Mrs. Butler, at least. At last with relief she heard Mrs. Butler's flat Cockney tones. Mrs. Butler had worked for her stepfather for ten years, ever since her and Jenny's mother had died. She was an old and familiar friend. ""It's Sara, Mrs. Butler. Jenny was supposed to meet me at the airport."" ""Oh, I'm so glad you've phoned. I was hoping you would. Jenny's in her room—not well—but that's not all. I've had a message from Moorlake to say that Miss Lockwood's ill""  ""Is my great-aunt very bad?"" asked Sara anxiously. ""I don't know. We only got the message this morning""  ""And Jenny's too ill to pick me up?""   ""She's not herself—"" Mrs. Butler's voice sounded curiously evasive.  ""I don't think she's fit to come and get you.""   ""Never mind,"" Sara said. ""It would take too long now anyway. I'll get the bus and take a taxi from the air terminal. See you soon, Mrs. Butler."" Puzzled and anxious and feeling very flat, after the heady excitement of her flight, Sara picked up her bags and went to find herself a seat on the bus going into London. Somehow she had not imagined her homecoming quite like this. Everything  was going to be different. She herself was different, for one thing. America—travel—had changed her. Given her more poise and self-confidence, as Great-Aunt Alicia had said it would. In her imagination, when she came home the sun would be shining. An hour later, when she was paying off her taxi outside the house, the sun, as though to make amends, was breaking through the cloud in a watery way, bathing the red Victorian brick in a soft bland light. The house looked the same, Sara thought, standing for a moment outside the gate and looking up at it. The virginia creeper was a little more luxuriant perhaps and the wood-work had been newly painted and was whiter than she remembered. Her stepfather, Robert Simpson, had bought the battered and bomb-damaged house for a song just after the war. Now it was worth five times what he paid for it, a fact on which he often dwelt with satisfaction. The front door opened and Mrs. Butler, smiling a welcome, stood on the threshold.  ""Lizzie rang up after you did,"" Mrs. Butler said. ""She's got Miss Lockwood into hospital. The old lady's very poorly, she said. She's had a stroke.""  ""Oh, dear,"" Sara said distressed. ""I was planning to go down this week-end. Perhaps I had better go this evening."" The bond between her and her Great-Aunt Alicia Lockwood was very strong. Alicia Lockwood was the only surviving relative of the father she had never known. He had been killed in the war shortly after Sara was born.  ""I'd speak to the doctor first,"" advised Mrs. Butler.  ""I've got his number written down.""  ""And now Jenny. What's the matter with Jenny?""  ""She was taken ill yesterday,"" Mrs. Butler said,""and she's been in her room ever since. She won't eat.""  ""But what's the matter with her?""   ""She's been jilted,"" Mrs. Butler said unexpectedly, the old-fashioned word tripping primly off her tongue.  ""Jilted?""   ""Well, her young man's given her the go-by,"" Mrs. Butler said,""and she's very upset about it. All I can say is her dad must be pleased. He was never in favour —too old for her and too experienced and sophisticated; but you know what young girls are—always fall flat on their faces for a good-looking fellow.""  ""I'll go up and see her,"" Sara said.  ""Your own room's all ready for you,"" Mrs. Butler said. ""I'll help you to take your bags up. Would you like me to unpack for you?""  ""That would be marvellous,"" said Sara gratefully, ""and if you look in my blue case, you'll find a package—a little something from New York for you.""  She climbed one flight higher to Jenny's room. She knocked tentatively on Jenny's door and then tried to open it, but it was locked. ""Jenny! It's me! Sara."" There was a long silence and then she heard a shuffling sound. The key clicked and the door opened. Jenny was in her dressing-gown, her blonde hair tumbled about her face, which  was bereft of make-up, the eyes puffy from weeping. The sisters stared at each other for a split second and then Jenny flung herself on Sara, crying incoherently.  ""Jenny, Jenny darling, what is all this?""  Sara disengaged herself and led Jenny to a chair. ""I'm sorry, sorry—I never came to meet you—but I just couldn't… I can't stop crying… Oh Sara, I'm so unhappy. I just wish I could die!"" The words came tumbling out.  ""Jenny darling, what is all this?""  ""I've been given the brush… I've been made to look an awful fool…so humiliated… "" With a wail Jenny threw herself on the bed and buried her face in her pillow.  ""Who's humiliated you?""  Sara asked patiently.  ""Matthew Preston,"" Jenny whispered, and seeing Sara's look of non-comprehension added, ""The man Aunt Alicia rents half Moorlake to.""   ""I remember now,"" Sara said.  ""A charming man,"" Aunt Alicia had  written to her in America,""has become my tenant. He has his office in the old library and I have converted the rooms above into a flat for him. The arrangement is working very well. He is a forestry expert and has a small stud as a hobby, so now the stables are being used again and I wake up to the clop-clop of horses' hooves on the cobbles in the morning. It makes me so happy."" Sara had been glad for her great-aunt, daughter of a famous Edwardian horse-breeder, and in her day a breeder herself, to have this nostalgic reminder of the past. But what had happened between this man and Jenny? Was this the marvellous man whom Jenny had mentioned in her letter? Evidently he was not so marvellous now.  ""Tell me about it,"" Sara said. Jenny put her head in her pillow again. Her voice came muffled,""I don't want to talk about it. I just want to die."" Sara sat down by the bedside and looked at the back of Jenny's head perplexedly. Was any man worth this tremendous travail?  ""Jenny, Jenny darling"" she began  hesitantly. She was very fond of her little sister, so pretty, so volatile, so amusing. Now it did not even strike her as odd or ungracious that Jenny, after their long separation, should have no time for questions or interest about her sojourn in America or her journey home, and that she could not control her own unhappiness for the sake of welcoming back her sister. Whatever Jenny was involved in at any given moment took up the whole of her. If she even fried an egg, she directed upon it the beam of her concentration, almost praying it would not break. Now Jenny's heart was broken and Jenny had no will or energy to contemplate anything else. But none of this was in Sara's mind as she patted Jenny's arm, seeking for some words of comfort.  ""I thought he loved me as much as I loved him.""  Jenny's voice was still muffled. ""I thought I was going to meet you and tell you the day. Oh-h-h!"" She turned over and gave a loud wail.  ""I hate him!""   ""Where did you meet him?""  Sara asked.  ""How long has this affair been going on?""  ""I told you… I met him at Aunt Alicia's because he rented half the house, and then I helped him with the horses. I've been staying with Aunt Alicia for the past six months… I only came home at week-ends…""  ""Don't grieve so,"" Sara said.  ""You're so young—""   ""I'm not that young,"" Jenny said savagely and punched her pillow as though she wished it were Matthew Preston's head.  ""There are as good fish in the sea,"" suggested Sara. Jenny sat up with a jerk.  ""There can't be any worse,"" she said bitterly, and then a look of contrition passed across her pretty face.  ""I'm selfish, aren't I,"" she asked,""to greet you like this, and never to meet you. Did you have a good trip?""  ""Pretty good,"" Sara said,""and very fast. We had a following wind. How about dressing now, Jenny, and coming  down-stairs? Can I bring you up a cup of tea or something? Have an aspirin? Jenny smiled weakly.  ""You're as bad as Daddy,"" she said. ""He flies to the aspirin bottle for everything, but I'm afraid aspirins won't cure what I've got, which is a great indigestible lump just She banged her chest to illustrate her words. ""The doctor gave me some tranquillisers but they haven't helped either. I just haven't been able to stop crying. It's awful not to be able to stop crying. I've been leaking, leaking like a tap, and my muscles just wouldn't work to turn off the water.""  ""You're not leaking now,"" said Sara briskly. ""Put on some clothes and come and have some tea. I know Mrs. Butler is making some. I'm anxious about Great Aunt Alicia. How has she been lately?""  ""She was as right as rain two days ago,"" Jenny said,""and she was well all winter. Even her rheumatism seems to have got better.""  ""You saw her two days ago?""   ""I told you,"" Jenny said a little irritably. ""I've been living at Moorlake. She absolutely adores Matthew."" The tears welled up into her eyes again and she dashed them away with an impatient hand. ""He's charmed her as he has everyone else—and she loves the horses, of course. I came away—I came away—after Matthew and I quarrelled. She doesn't know about the quarrel—at least she didn't, unless Lizzie's told her."" Lizzie Stroud had been Great-Aunt Alicia's maid for as long as Sara could remember.  ""Or Matthew Preston?"" suggested Sara. ""I don't suppose he'll tell anyone. He should be too ashamed."" Jenny gave a convulsive sob and lay back in her pillows again.  ""Don't let's mention his name any more,"" said Sara.  ""Come on, Jenny, get up to please me.""  Jenny rose lethargically from her bed and went over to the wash basin and began bathing her eyes. Sitting in front of her mirror a few minutes later, re-doing her face, she said,""You've got thinner—much too thin—and that's a beautiful suit. Now  talk some more and let me hear whether you've come back with an American accent."" Sara smiled. ""I cultivated my English accent. It was one of my assets, and what I was hired for.""  ""What was America like?""  Jenny asked without much interest. ""Your letters were always too short, Sara, and not detailed enough, but then you've never been good at spilling all your thoughts in speech or writing, have you? Not like poor me.""  ""I enjoyed America,"" Sara said and added quietly, ""It was fun.""  America had been an escape, she thought, or perhaps a search, a search for identity, a reason for being Sara Monroe, not very clever, not as pretty or as talented as Jenny. She had not wanted to go. The job had been offered to her out of the blue. It had been Great-Aunt Alicia who had considered it a marvellous and exciting opportunity and persuaded her to accept it.  ""Good for you to see the world,"" she had said. ""I know in your secret heart you want to come here and live with me but  we're not going to be two old maids mouldering away together. You must see the world while you're young."" Well, she had learnt something, her capabilities as well as her limitations, and the value of independence.  ""It wasn't all work?""  Jenny asked. Sara shook her head.  ""And what about men?""   ""I had plenty of dates, if that's what you mean,"" Sara said,""but nothing in the way of a long-term project. I didn't fall in love. It doesn't come to me as easily as it does to you."" Jenny grimaced at herself in the glass.  ""I guess I'm made that way,"" she admitted. ""You're too calm for your own good. What are you going to do now?""  ""Get a job, I suppose,"" Sara said. She had thought a lot about her future on the way home. A job was essential since she had to earn her living. She wanted to leave her stepfather's house. She had been there on sufferance for so long and yet she had never been quite brave enough to break free, to launch out by herself. He and  Jenny were sufficient for each other; they did not want a third person, especially a person whose tastes were so dissimilar and who did not fit in with their lives or their friends. She would get a little flat of her own, perhaps go and stay with Great-Aunt Alicia at week-ends. Best of all would be to get a job in Wellingham if it were possible and live all the time at Moorlake. But that was the stuff dreams were made of.  ""I could never understand why Aunt Alicia had to rent part of Moorlake,"" Sara said.  ""My Moorlake,"" she added.  ""Her income has been dwindling,"" Jenny said,""and then she made some bad investments. You know how stubborn she is. Daddy said she was crazy but she wouldn't listen. I am afraid it was a case of necessity. She needed the money badly. Moorlake is much too big for her and it's been going steadily to rack and ruin for years. She's never been able to afford the upkeep of it. She should have sold it long ago.""  ""She loves it too much,"" Sara said  dreamily. Only the thought of Moorlake had made her feel homesick in America.  ""If anything happens to the old girl, it will indeed be your Moorlake,"" Jenny said. ""What will you do then? It will be too big for you too. You'll have to sell it, Sara.""  ""Don't talk of it,"" Sara said quickly.  ""I don't want to think of anything happening to Great-Aunt Alicia to begin with—and I can't bear the thought of selling Moor-lake.""   ""It's only an old house,"" Jenny said indifferently,""which has seen much better days. You are funny, Sara. You and Great-Aunt Alicia make a pair. She's more eccentric than ever and Lizzie's gone gaga. Sometimes I used to think I was in an old folk's home. If it hadn't been for Matthew— ""She bit her lip, and then continued a moment later,"" It was odd how I met him. I called to see Great-Aunt Alicia quite by chance. I hadn't seen her since you went to America, and then about six months ago I was staying the week-end with the Coleworthys and I thought I had  better drop in to see the old girl in case she heard I was in the neighbourhood and took offence""  ""Great-Aunt never takes offence,"" Sara protested.  ""So I called,"" Jenny went on, ignoring the interruption,""and there was this marvellous man, with Great-Aunt and Lizzie fussing round him as though he were the greatest gift to humanity. He wanted someone to help him with his horses, so I took on the job. It seemed like fate at the time—as though I were specially meant to meet him. Oh, God!"" She suddenly put her face in her hands as the tears came to her eyes again.  ""Jenny, stop it!""  Sara said. Mrs. Butler brought in the tea, and raised her eyes to heaven when she saw Jenny weeping again. Sara followed her downstairs. She wanted to make her phone calls to Great Aunt Alicia's doctor, Lizzie and the hospital.  ""What's he like, this man Preston?"" she asked.  ""I've never laid eyes on him,"" Mrs. Butler said.  ""He never comes to London —but we've heard plenty of talk of him—Matthew this and Matthew that, but you know what Miss Jenny is, what I call an enthusiast.""  Sara phoned the doctor first. He did not think there would be any point in Sara travelling to Wellingham that evening, especially as she had only just got back from abroad. He'd got Miss Lockwood into the cottage hospital. She was as comfortable as could be expected, in a nice ward with only two other people in it. Miss Monroe could come down in the morning and see her then. There was some paralysis down one side. He was non-committal about her chances of complete recovery, and Sara felt a little sick and uneasy when she put down the phone. She rang up Lizzie. A man's voice answered, husky, with a pleasant timbre. Sara knew at once that this must be Matthew Preston, and was glad that at least Lizzie had company for the night. When she spoke to the old  maid, she told her that she would be coming down in the morning. But before she could set off the next day, the hospital telephoned with bad news. Miss Alicia Lockwood had died in the night, quietly and painlessly in her sleep."
FIC FIC-K8V-003 -0.01 "Five Rose was sitting by her big window that overlooked the Thames when Steve came home. She had a glass of gin in her hand, but she was not drinking it, just holding it as if it might offer her the cheer and support that she might not otherwise find elsewhere. Gin had been the great popular comfort of Paradise Street in her childhood, gin and tea, so she took it as someone from another background might have made a dish of bread and milk. She heard his key in the door, and sat alert. She knew she had made a mistake in not showing more surprise to the police. They had noticed and she had seen them notice. Steve went quietly into the kitchen, she heard him opening the refrigerator door. Hungry. But of course, he wouldn't have eaten. ‘Steve?’ He didn't answer, naturally not. But he stopped what he was doing and came into the room. That much relationship she still had with him, she thought. His feet in the heavy studded boots he insisted on wearing, clumsy on his thin ankles, marked the pale waxed wood of her floor. Normally she would have screamed at him for the minute splinters she knew he must be creating, but now she kept her anger for other matters. ‘Where have you been?’ No answer. She looked at the huge sandwich in his hand. ‘Wherever you go, they don't feed you.’ She saw him flinch; she'd scored a hit, then. It gave her no comfort. ‘So what have you been doing?’ ‘Just walking.’ A little grudging speech was allowed, then. ‘You know you put me in a bad position going off like that. I was told by the police in the police station.’ He did look surprised at that. ‘Yes, I was down there because they were questioning me about some old clothes. Uniform.’ She looked him full in the face as she spoke. And you're not surprised either, not totally, absolutely surprised. Somewhere at the back of your eyes is a show of recognition. ‘You don't ask whose clothes,’ she said. ‘Or why I was looking at them?’ Steve put his uneaten sandwich down on the table. ‘Why don't you ask?’ Rose knew she should stop, she could hear herself shouting. This was not how to behave to your young son, but there was something about Steve's behaviour now that drove her on. In his own way, he knew how to pull her strings. She lowered her voice. ‘There was another body under that first poor boy's. It looked like Uncle Mosse; it was wearing his old uniform. So naturally the police thought I'd identified the wrong body as Uncle.’ She added briefly, ‘Well, it turns out I hadn't, not in the present state of the game. But they were his clothes.’ And why hadn't I felt that shock of surprise I should have felt? I could tell you why, Steve, but I won't  because I'm afraid you might know. Because Uncle Mosse left his door unlocked all the time at the end and he did not mind who came in and out, as he said. He liked company. Who's to say who drifted in, and then drifted out? Or sometimes, did not drift out? What do you know about that world, Steve? ‘I remember that uniform,’ said Steve unexpectedly. ‘It was fab; it had style.’ And what did he know about style? But he did; he was her child. She knew about style, so did Steve. ‘I saw you put it on once.’ ‘Yeah. It was great.’ So he was talking, but not saying things she wanted to hear. ‘And that's why I kept you apart. He was not good for you, Steve.’ I am a grown woman, I lived in Paradise Street, I know about Uncle Mosse. Oh, perhaps they aren't bad in themselves, people like that, but they let the dirt in. Steve shrugged. Your view; I have my own, he seemed to be saying. Irritated, Rose returned to her main worry. ‘And where were you walking, and why? Why not school? What excuse am I going to give there?’ Awkwardly he said, ‘A person has a private life. Even a young person.’ Rose drew in a sharp breath. ‘You've silenced me there, kid.’ Steve picked up his sandwich and went over to the television set where he sat eating it while he watched the news. At home the new Labour Government was  settling itself in. Abroad the Americans were bombing in Vietnam, Hanoi had been hit by American fighters. Without wanting to, Rose was drawn to watch. Mother and son sat in silence watching the scenes of violence unfold. The violence on the screen seeped out, rambled round the room like an animal, then joined them in the seats. On the screen a taker of LSD, the Vision-of-Hell-drug, was borne off on a stretcher, after having hallucinated he could fly. They all think they've got wings, thought Rose. ‘If I ever thought you were mixed up in anything bad, Steve,’ she said, ‘I think I'd kill you.’ Then she went and stood by the window, looking out. I am not pregnant, I have not taken a hallucinatory drug, and I have never killed anyone. If she said it often enough it might be true. She knew that, without meaning to, she had given away a lot of her life and thought, and wished she had not. Coffin and Gabriel (it was surprising how quickly he thought of them as a couple). ‘Let us —’ he paused' — let's meet tomorrow.’ He thought about it. Tomorrow looked like being a day with a heavy workload, nor was dinner at Mrs Lorimer's entirely to be recommended. ‘Let's go to a place I know. Little Italian restaurant.’ Whose proprietor was currently, as they say, in prison, but whose wife, mother and seven sisters were running the place. ‘La Piazza: used to be called the Padovani.’ ‘Oh, I know it. I was at school with the littlest Padovani.’ ‘Yes, you might have been.’ That made her a good decade younger than he was, but she looked it. ‘As an eating place it's had its ups and downs, but it's up at the moment.’ It was, in fact, better when its handsome but feckless proprietor was absent. His amours seemed to upset the cooking. ‘I'll look forward to it.’ They turned the corner into the street where Gabriel lived; she had a tiny flat. ‘What's she like, your boss? Really like?’ Gabriel said, ‘I haven't much idea. She covers up, pretty well. Deep.’ ‘I've never met her,’ said Coffin thoughtfully. ‘I don't think.’ ‘Oh, you'd know if you had. You don't overlook Rose if she's around. Tall, bright blue eyes, mass of hair. ‘What colour?’ ‘Oh, varies — sometimes pale blonde, sometimes more honey-coloured. I've even known her red, and that only in the eighteen months I've worked for her. But she's got style. She can't make it, but she can copy it.’ Gabriel spoke with feeling; she knew what she had contributed to Belmodes since she had started to work there. ‘And what's she been like these last months?’ What he meant was: Did she act like a woman who might know too much about a murdered boy? ‘Again, hard to say.’ Gabriel had been full of her own plans lately, perhaps not too observant. ‘But she  has seemed under pressure. Her relationship with the boy has gone to pot lately. I think we all knew that and she didn't mind showing it. Don't know what was behind it. Maybe he didn't like her friends. Or she didn't like his.’ ‘Think so?’ Gabriel shrugged. ‘It's a funny old world — and people like Rose, well, they get mixed up in it.’ ‘And you? Do you get mixed up?’ He didn't know where he placed Gabriel. She looked a bright, emancipated little bird, enjoying her freedom, but he thought he detected a native caution underneath her swinging exterior. ‘In and out,’ said Gabriel. ‘I won't ask questions.’ ‘You already are,’ said Gabriel drily. ‘You'll still have dinner with me?’ ‘As long as you don't ask me who I voted for in the General Election.’ (The country was still sorting itself out after the Election.) ‘Who did you vote for?’ ‘Oh, I didn't bother.’ Coffin was shocked. Far away and long ago seemed the world after the War, into which he had emerged out of the army with the feeling that his vote and the new Labour Government would rebuild England. He still voted Labour, but he was no longer sure why. But not to use a vote, that was what had changed. A gap opened between them, and they both knew it was called age. But physical attraction could jump that gap like an  electric spark and did so effortlessly. He put his arm round her and they walked on. ‘How do you feel about me being a policeman?’ A bus passed them, bringing with it a flurry of dry dust from the gutter. ‘I never forget it for a minute,’ said Gabriel. ‘Any more questions?’ I'm a slum kid, her eyes were saying, you know that, do you think we forget policemen? ‘What's democracy in Paradise Street?’ Not policemen. This was not a question, it was an answer. Nevertheless, she would go on knowing him. They parted with barely a word, but with a strength of unexpressed feeling. They would meet, they would go on meeting, but already they were on opposite sides. Rose had enrolled Gabriel, with a jump of surprise the girl admitted it. While she had not been looking where she was going, Rose had quietly taken her support. Rose and Belmodes, it was, then. It was as if she had smelt a meal cooking in the next room; it might not be a meal she wanted to eat, but already it was nourishing her. John Coffin did not know he was on the wrong side yet, not having so far met Rose Hilaire, but he too realized that there might be a fight ahead. ‘See you tomorrow.’ ‘As ever is.’ Gabriel disappeared into her own flat, which was minute, one room and a bathroom, but which she shared with no one. The first upward step of any born in Paradise Street was a room of one's own. Very few people had seen inside Gabriel's flat, because that was the other rule for escapers from  Paradise Street: do not let the world outside get past your front door. ‘Don't expect too much of me. Got a busy day tomorrow.’ It was always busy at this time of the year in Belmodes, preparing the collection for the next season. Murder or not it had to go on, and next day it did, Rose saw to that, although she was not herself. Rose Hilaire had a waking dream, one which followed her into sleep and came out again the other side to stay with her all day, going with her into Belmodes side by side like a fellow worker. As she slept in her Italian-designed tube steel bed with the iron-grey duvet, she felt sure that Steve in the room across the corridor must know who was in there with her, and as she went to work next day, she felt sure that everyone must see what she was dragging with her. Her nightmare self, her horrible double. In this dream she was outside herself, yet watching a person who must be herself strangling an adolescent boy. What she saw was detailed and specific, nothing vague or fancy. Just a pair of hands, reaching out at the end of her arms from her shoulders to grip a neck. Not exactly the sort of thought you wanted to pass on to the police at a time when two boys' bodies had been found. Yet one that was hard to keep to yourself, she could feel it bursting out all over her. Like a virulent disease. Someone was bound to notice. Excuse me, they might say, you have death all over your face, it could be serious. At work next day, discussing time-sheets and piecework rates with Dagmar, she could feel her skin irritating her. She put her hand up to her face. ‘What is the matter with you, Rose? You keep touching your face.’ Dagmar was irritable. ‘I'm having a little trouble with it.’ Dagmar did not answer. She had known Rose since before Rose was born, and had long since resolved to think nothing about Rose except what suited her. It did not suit her now to observe the emotional turmoil inside Rose. Herself the illegitimate daughter of a Danish sailor who had spent one month in Paradise Street before taking ship for ever, she had built herself a firmly structured life which could withstand all but atomic bombardment. ‘You've got your warpaint on,’ she said. Rose was wearing a tulip-red trouser suit, diamond earrings and a large aquamarine ring. She grunted. ‘If I didn't believe clothes helped, then I wouldn't be in this business.’ She sighed. ‘But who said work helps?’ and pushed away from her desk. ‘Are the police still in the washroom?’ Dagmar's expression did not change from her usual workday look of reserve. ‘The police have gone, but the washroom's locked up and no one can get in. The girls are having to use the public lavatory on the corner and they don't like it.’ ‘They won't go on strike, will they?’ Rose feared strikes even more than bankruptcy or the plague. ‘I haven't heard them mention it,’ said Dagmar in a level voice. Rose got up and walked to the window. Her suit made of nylon had stuck to her and outlined her figure. Out of the window, she could see the street outside, with one of her own vans drawing away from the kerb. A smaller delivery van from a wholesaler was just moving into her unloading yard. That would be the Italian silk jersey arriving. Good news on an ordinary day, a delight to the eye. This was not an ordinary day. ‘We don't know a lot, do we?’ she said, fixing her eyes on a policeman in uniform who was walking by. They were in the middle of the case, working in a building where bloodstained clothing had been found, and where two people whom the police had questioned about a missing boy had more than passing contact, yet they knew less than anyone. ‘Any news about Ephraim?’ ‘Not that I know. Anyway, Lily isn't in today.’ ‘Just as well,’ said Rose uneasily. ‘It's a difficult situation there. See she's paid, though, won't you?’ ‘You're a good employer,’ said Dagmar grudgingly. ‘Better than Grandpa? He kept a sweatshop if anyone did. Changed days, couldn't behave like that now. But I'm standing on his shoulders, Dagmar.’ ‘And wouldn't he have loved it.’ For Dagmar that was a show of humour. Since her mother had been a jolly lady, her missing father must have been a dour Dane indeed if inheritance had anything to do with it. Rose came back into the room, and sat down at her desk. ‘You don't think there's any special reason for Lily being away?’ ‘Such as?’ ‘Like Ephraim being found?’ ‘Did cross my mind.’ ‘You know something,’ said Rose suddenly. ‘Not know. Saw.’ ‘Oh, come on.’ ‘You didn't drive down Mouncy Street from the main road this morning?’ ‘No. Came round the other way from Decimus Street.’ She did not say that she was avoiding passing the house in Mouncy Street, but they both knew she was, and had been every day. ‘Two police cars; and an ambulance. Drove off as I went past.’ Dagmar cycled from her flat in one of the new highrise blocks. ‘Same house as before?’ asked Rose carefully. The one I used to own, she meant, the one the copper bought. ‘That or the next one. Both been empty.’ ‘Well, thanks for telling me.’ For Dagmar it had been tactfully done. ‘We'll wait and see.’ And it might mean nothing. But the cameo of death formed in front of her eyes, small, brightly lit and detailed. She closed her eyes. ‘I'll get you a cup of tea,’ said Dagmar. ‘No. I've got to see Gaby. She's probably outside now.’ ‘She can wait. You'd better tell me what's upsetting you. In a low tone, Rose said, ‘Do you believe in anyone fantasizing murder? Have you ever heard of anyone doing that?’ Gaby, who was outside, heard the word murder and stayed to listen. It was wrong to do it, she knew, but she could not stop herself. She could not hear anything, of course, as Rose's voice dropped and was interrupted by the rumble of Dagmar's, but she heard enough. The question was whether she should tell anyone or no one what she had heard. That question was decided for her in a most terrible way. When the rumour reached Gabriel she began to realize what she would say to John Coffin. Rose had said, in a terrified whisper: ‘Can you fantasize a murder? Feel sure that you saw one happen?’ She didn't hear Dagmar's response. But Rose said: ‘I think I might be the killer. I was inside it, and outside it, at the same time.’ What Dagmar said then sounded like ‘a dream’; she couldn't hear what answer Rose made to that, but she heard the words ‘missing’ and ‘blood’. Gabriel tried to slot this into what the new death was all about; she was deeply troubled. She slipped out for a cup of coffee with Charley in his studio next to Belmodes; it was one of his days to be there. She had been able to tell that by the sight of his motorbike outside. He flitted about on this machine (which obsessed him) wearing a helmet and goggles so that Gabriel called him The Invisible Man. On wheels. ‘What do you think I should do?’ she said to Charley. ‘You always give me good advice: give me some now. ‘Do I?’ ‘I think so.’ A minute ticked by while Charley said nothing. Gabriel went on, ‘And then I saw her that night, remember? In Mouncy Street. I told you. She was behaving oddly.’ ‘Which night was that? Remind me.’ ‘The night I worked late on my own. That was why I had a taxi. You had a job in Paris.’ ‘Brussels,’ said Charley absently. ‘I told you Brussels.’ Gabriel irritated him by the way she could get something nearly right but not quite. Charley sat silent, then took a deep breath. ‘Tell them. You ask me, I say: Tell.’ By lunch-time the rumour was a hard story. So Gabriel knew she had to tell. And to her, in her present mood, that meant tell Coffin."
NWS NWS-A1N-018 -0.15 "Football: Hazard hints at the missing gifts By PATRICK BARCLAY HOW TO describe Saturday's match between Chelsea and Arsenal? Well, I seem to recall a London gallery exhibiting a pile of rubbish, which was considered valid art by the proprietors and drew a large attendance. The only redeeming feature of a goalless, worthless event at Stamford Bridge was that it did not require a grant. Yet the Chelsea manager, Bobby Campbell, and Arsenal assistant, Theo Foley, agreed it had been a good match, and the spectators' complaints were muted. Some even applauded the players at the end. It takes all sorts. Bobby Robson was there to assess World Cup candidates, but nothing positive emerged from 90 minutes of scuffling that made one almost yearn for the more measured boredom of Rangers' European Cup exit in Munich three days earlier. At least the outcome was appropriate. Had either of the teams won, they would have taken the League leadership. Instead Liverpool stayed top without kicking a ball. Television had postponed Manchester United's scheduled visit to Anfield so it could be shown live on 22 December, the longest night. London's leading pair, as if piqued by this, turned 30 September into the longest afternoon. On and on it dragged. Lacking a goal that might have altered its chemistry, it remained a matter of dull physics. Yet many of the crowd were kept interested by the possibility of victory, which is, I suppose, what derbies are about. They are so frequent these days in London, which has eight of 20 First Division clubs, that we must expect aesthetic considerations to be overridden. Why, though, could these supposed championship contenders not have tried to emulate the fine passing that had sprinkled the previous weekend's Merseyside joust? The simple answer is that Chelsea are in a false position and Arsenal, on this evidence, slightly jaded champions. They ought to have pocketed three points in the first half-hour but Tony Adams, a more threatening centre-forward on his forays than the current Alan Smith, missed the target with two headers and David Rocastle let Dave Beasant save a penalty, much as the stretch-version keeper had done for Wimbledon in the 1988 FA Cup final. Now an Arsenal team in peak health would have kept a grip on the match. This one could not. As George Graham indicated upon his side's accession to the title, they would need more composure and sophistication to match Liverpool in the longer term. He chose not to hasten the process by buying. After all, he had just the man on his staff. But Paul Davis remains unfit. His absence is increasingly conspicuous and Liverpool, for the moment, in a super league of one. Davis, of course, would have walked into England's team in Poland a week on Wednesday; until last season's prolonged suspension, followed by injury, Bobby Robson had him firmly pencilled in as Bryan Robson's replacement. Michael Thomas, several years younger, is not quite in the same class yet but may have to play in Chorzow. If so, it will be a gamble, because he flopped on his only previous international appearance in Saudi Arabia. The odds are favourable enough according to Chelsea's Mike Hazard, who said of his adversary: ‘He could cope in Poland, not just because of his ability to close people down and use the ball well, but temperament — you saw that when he scored the goal that won Arsenal the League.’ Very kind, but international players are supposed to be habitually influential, and it was Hazard who in the second half, with a few incisive passes, gifts from the heavens on a day like this, left a greater mark. Chelsea might have won had the ball not kept turning into a Mexican bean at Kerry Dixon's feet. Campbell's hard-working side are still trying to sort out their system, which involves a spare defender and, as far as one can see, a good deal of improvisation. It should suit Tony Dorigo, the unblooded England left-back, though oddly his rival, Nigel Winterburn, did more rampaging on Saturday; neither, in truth, made the heart pound. Dorigo at least had the satisfaction of seeing his direct opponent and England colleague David Rocastle withdrawn. All in all, Bobby Robson must have found it about as fruitful as a day trying to get in touch with Brian Clough. There was, however, one aspect that deserves commendation. After 16 minutes Graham Roberts was injured by a tackle for which Perry Groves was booked (Steve Clarke took over as sweeper, and is likely to have several weeks in which to build on a promising display). Roberts's ankle appeared broken, but the Chelsea players were not interested in retribution and the club, as soon as they knew the injury was less serious, put a message on the electronic scoreboard: an example of public relations from which others could learn."
NWS NWS-A3M-002 -0.14 "Design: Crossed lines over the toytown tram: City transport could soon be back on the right track, says Jonathan Glancey By JONATHAN GLANCEY MODERN trams, as most continental Europeans know, neither shake nor rattle, nor do they roll. Sleek, solidly built, gentle on the environment, they are often an ideal form of city transport. They also exert a fascination very much of their own as they slither round circuses and brush through old city gates, flashing arcs of lightning as they switch tracks on winter nights. Single-car, articulated or double-decker, trams are one of the most reliable and enduring forms of public transport invented. The orange-liveried ‘1500’ series trams in Milan, for example, date from 1927. Eventually they will be replaced, but more than 60 years on they run with the rhythmic reliability of a Swiss watch. They are as much a part of Milan as La Scala or the Galleria Vittore Emmanuele. Last month it was announced that Britain will get its first new-wave trams in 1991. Destined to run in Manchester, they will relieve traffic congestion and help to reduce the levels of carbon monoxide in the city centre, outlying suburbs and satellite towns of Bury, Altrincham, Salford, Oldham and Rochdale. In Britain, with the main exception of Blackpool (not forgetting the single-deckers of the Isle of Man and Llandudno), trams had been largely relegated to the history books. Otherwise, the best place to see working trams has been the tram museum at Crich in Derbyshire or else in old British Transport Commission films and Ealing comedies. Trams disappeared from most British cities in the 1950s. London's venerable red and cream double-deckers rumbled along the Thames embankment for the last time in 1952. Somehow the image of the tall, thin, mournful double-deck tram with its wooden body, slatted wooden seats and growling electric motor has stuck in the British mind. Trams, it was believed until surprisingly recently, are old-fashioned. They had something to do with fish and chips wrapped in newspaper, men in hats, National Health specs, smog and powdered egg. They held up the bright new diesel buses and, even worse, blocked the progress of private motorists in bulbous Austins and lumpen Humbers in canyon-like city thoroughfares. They picked up power from a spider's web of unsightly overhead wires. They were inflexible in operation, draughty, and mobile reminders of TB epidemics with the enamelled ‘Do Not Spit’ signs screwed to their bulkheads. But the modern tram could hardly be more different. It plays a key role in keeping city streets on the move and is even the object of the best modern designers' desire. In Milan, for example, the commission to design the new generation of ‘Jumbo’ trams, which went into service in 1979, was one that leading Italian architects and designers fought over. After all, the Jumbo, a handsome and imposing articulated unit designed by architect, engineer and critic Klaus Giovanni Koenig, will be seen on the streets of Milan for the next half-century. Spotlessly clean and popular, the Jumbo is a long-term advertisement for Koenig's design skills. The modern tram is a green machine. Assuming the power station at the end of the line burns cleanly, the tram is virtually pollution free. Standing at traffic lights a Koenig-designed Jumbo is, save for the chatter inside, completely silent. The overhead wires are so slight that you have to look hard to see them. Powers of acceleration and braking are remarkable, the latter far greater than any car. But sadly, there is no indication that the GMA consortium which will design, operate and maintain the first of the new generation British trams in Manchester will share the looks of their Milanese counterparts. Artists' impressions show a tram that has more in common with the flat-faced, characterless light trains of the toy-like Docklands Light Railway. There is still time for GMA (GEC, Mowlem, Amec and Greater Manchester Buses) to consider employing an inspired architect or industrial designer. After all, Mancunians and visitors to the Manchester conurbation are going to have to look at these mechanical millipedes for well into the twenty-first century. Now that buses are no longer designed to enhance the streets they serve, Manchester has a chance to make a fresh start with its trams. Manchester is not alone. Other British towns, Croydon and Southampton among them, are also considering modern tramways. These are all referred to as ‘supertram’ networks, the implication being that the new-generation tram is an altogether more dynamic form of transport than its pre-war predecessors. What it really means is that the new trams are a hybrid between street car and lightweight suburban train. Although they will slip through the city centre serving the essential parts — shopping malls, leisure centres, theme parks, amusement arcades and museums — the Manchester supertrams will also head out of town on a mix of reserved track and existing railway lines. The supertram is, in effect, a low-cost replacement for British Rail's ageing fleet of suburban diesel multiple-unit trains, those rasping diesels which change gear to the accompaniment of voluminous clouds of acrid black exhaust fumes and the blessing of train spotters. They will perform some of the same functions, but they will not be an exact replacement for traditional trams. And although the supertram concept will spread through major cities during the next decade, Blackpool will still be alone in its use of traditional double-deckers."
NWS NWS-A7Y-006 -0.21 "What future for Britain's handicapped youth? Michele Hanson examines the problems imposed by budget cuts and staff shortages, and looks at the need for long-term strategies. And in the light of the recent Beverley Lewis tragedy, Adrienne Baker puts the case for self-help groups to relieve the isolation and enormous pressure felt by the mothers of handicapped children A special kind of need THE 1970 Education Act opened a new world of opportunity for children with mental and physical handicaps. It declared them educable, took them out of their own homes and hospitals and brought them into full-time schooling. Bright new facilities and therapies were provided, plus enlightened teaching and special care. In 1970 in one London borough alone, Islington, nine severely or profoundly handicapped children were born. They have had the benefit of such an education and now it is over or about to end, together with almost all paramedical help. At 19 these young people — and hundreds like them all over the country — are likely to be going home and staying there. It means, as one parent said, ‘19 years of hard work down the drain’. Education is statutory, but once it is over such youngsters are legally entitled to nothing. The Disabled Persons Act 1986 recommends, but does not legislate, that local authorities should define need and provide for it. Adequate provision will probably not be made for Jonathan Rixon, one of the Islington children. He has Seckels Syndrome, a rare disease that stunts growth. He is microcephalic, blind, has severe curvature of the spine, scoliosis, no speech, cannot walk and weighs 3 ½ stone. His knees frequently dislocate and he has a painful hiatus hernia which makes him scream. His mother Stephanie holds him, rubs him, talks to him, kisses him, stretches his body out over her knee — anything to relieve his discomfort. She must also change, bathe, feed, exercise, occupy, entertain and shave him. ‘It's not hard work,’ she says, ‘just constant.’ When Jonathan leaves school next year, this will be the pattern of their life. Stephanie cannot duplicate the essential therapies and stimulation the school provides. ‘What will happen to his small world when it all stops?’ she asks. ‘He'll just have me.’ Doctors say Jonathan will have a normal life-span and she is worried for the future and what will happen to him after her death. There are community therapists, but not enough to go around. They are poorly paid, mainly young and female, have little chance of career progression and no incentive to remain in the profession. Those available will be busy rehabilitating stroke patients, who take priority. Fears that handicapped youngsters will deteriorate are well founded. Ian Squires, severely autistic, returned to Islington in 1986 from a residential school where he'd been happy. He waited months for a day centre place; when he got one it was unsuitable and he refused to go. He became very fearful of cars, buses and stairs, eventually shutting himself in his room, with the curtains drawn, for 14 months. He began banging his head against the wall, vomiting up his food, lost a great deal of weight and was eventually taken to hospital. Islington's provision is better than most, yet the Director of Social Services, John Rea Price, feels Islington has been penalised for attempting to carry out the Government's own directives on community care. Rate capping has meant that for every ‘profligate’ pound spent on such provision, £6 has been taken away. Islington cannot even benefit from the ‘dowry’ system (money paid by a health authority to a local authority for each patient returning to the community from hospital) because their people never went to hospital. Many local authorities have had their budgets cut by reductions in central government They've been given better education and higher expectations, but no future. grants and now have a far greater shortfall of places than Islington. A white paper is expected at the end of this month in response to the Griffiths Report, which recommended that authorities be given greater responsibility for the mentally handicapped. ‘Unless Griffiths funding comes quickly to the rescue,’ says Rea Price, ‘there is no hope of extra resources.’ A recent (and the first) report by the Social Services Inspectorate on day services for the mentally handicapped finds much to criticise. It admits that funds are needed for training and basic equipment, and finds that the principles of community care have often not been fully understood. Few middle management have direct experience of the service, need has not been quantified nor fed through to planners, very few local authorities have involved parents, let alone clients. Staff feel undervalued and lack any sense of direction, joint philosophies between health and local authorities are rare, there are no long-term strategies to solve the problems and many centres are overcrowded, offering only shared, part-time places. Centres for the physically handicapped have traditionally taken the elderly, and youngsters finding themselves there after leaving school may feel their adult lives have ended rather than just begun. Mencap's Day Services campaign indicates that the most desperate need is for the severely handicapped and those with behavioural difficulties. For those with more moderate disabilities there are YTS schemes, but these are generalised, not geared to individual needs. The handicapped may be a minority group but it's a vast one — the last count, 10 years ago, totalled six million people with identified disabilities. A hidden and forgotten problem rather than a small one. ‘We're fighting a losing battle,’ says Richard Tomlinson, headmaster of the Thomas Delarue School for young people with cerebral palsy. ‘It's not a cohesive group and has no political edge. To get money you've got to present an image of disability that reinforces rather than changes the stereotype — flaxen-haired moppets in callipers. If you actually show people in much greater need, young adults, they're not so attractive. They might dribble. We're articulate enough to fool ourselves that we're nice people, but there's a strong undercurrent to our thinking that encourages us to view people with a disability as lesser, and until we come to terms with that, we will never have a proper support system. At present the whole thing is on guilt money: ‘I'm glad it's not my kids. Here's a fiver.’' The present situation reinforces his ideas. ‘No social services or Government department will deny that everyone is of equal value,’ says Mencap, ‘but the services don't support that. Even if people are unattractive, aggressive, distorted, vomit and bite, they still have rights.’ Things are, of course, better than they were. In a few areas great progress is being made. In Herefordshire, education, health, social services and voluntary groups are working together on a Lifestyles Project which enables students leaving college to have a life of their own within the community. The Spastics Society has begun Alternative Lifestyles courses for disabled school leavers, ‘providing positive alternatives to paid employment and giving them the confidence to take charge of their own lives’. The Open University has begun a new course for people with learning difficulties. Hopefully such ideas will spread to the rest of the community, but for the majority of this year's school leavers it will be too late. They've been given a better education, a longer and healthier life and higher expectations, but no future. LACK of communication is one of the saddest aspects of having a mentally handicapped child. As a social worker, I met family after family and the isolation that having a ‘special’ child brings was a common theme. The burden inevitably fell mainly on the mothers and it seemed that their loneliness could at least be lessened if they had a regular opportunity to share their experiences. The group began with mothers responding to my invitation and deciding tentatively whether there was ‘anything in it’ for them. Several women felt too vulnerable or exposed to remain; another left dramatically, announcing that her anger would destroy the group. The beginning was also a time when I was asked if I, too, would soon let them down ‘like all the others’ and when being there was expressed for all by Janet: ‘I'm only here because my daughter is the way she is. I'd rather not be here.’ Or by Shirley, who cried soundlessly and then protested: ‘I'm not crying for myself; I'm crying for the others.’ Gradually trust developed and themes emerged: sadness, ‘A grief with no end’; anger, ‘Why did it happen to me?’; and frustration with the professionals who could not fully understand their plight. The subjective experiences of these mothers became the maintheme; for example, how rejected they felt by friends or neighbours who crossed the street, not knowing what to say. They talked of their husbands' preoccupation with work, of their normal children's too-early maturing, of integrated and special schools, and of eating — the hoped-for miracle diet for their child or, often, the consolation they found in food. These mothers had built a cocoon around themselves and their handicapped child which, while keeping away the hurtful comments, wrapped them in with their pain. Then, one week, the quietest woman in the group said: ‘This is the only place where I can afford to be honest,’ and somehow it seemed the healing process had begun. Leora personified the courage: I remember her trying to calm her screaming autistic son, taking him in her arms, rocking him, comforting him, until at last he became tranquil and quiet and she was left with his violence in her. THEY were brave women and often poetic. Zena, a sculptress, took on the responsibility of caring for her Down's Syndrome grand-daughter when the mother ‘upped and offed’. She described how she walked around for months ‘with a pain, almost a physical pain, in my heart’; of how she avoided friends and pulled her hat over her face if she met them in the street; of how, at last, she knew she must express her thousand emotions about her little grandchild in the way she knew best, in clay. And when she took this most precious creation to art school, the teacher said: ‘Zena, why didn't you tell us?’ Then she could cry and let people comfort her. Jean described a trip to the park. While she queued for coffee, her friend held the handicapped child and Jean ‘made believe she wasn't mine.’ The sadness came out week by week and we confronted it. Incredibly, there was laughter, too, and companionship. We gained energy from each other and I determined that this strength must be used creatively. Their frustration that they would always remain only a mummy could be challenged. We considered how much we, ourselves, hold on to an eternally-caring-for-others role. Stirrings of feminist vitality. I wanted to help these women to ‘find a voice’ and no longer to place their needs at the bottom of the list of priorities. Gradually we re-evaluated ourselves as women and looked at the way we had always put ourselves down. One member had described the work she does as ‘just a little job’. The rabbi's wife had insisted it was her role to attend to their epileptic daughter several times each night; her husband must sleep to be strong for the community. But there was change in the air: one woman began to study and others took their cue from her. I encouraged them to write. Together we compiled an article for publication. It was raw, frank and eventually it appeared in print. By now the time had come for me to hand back to these women responsibility to go it alone. I knew that telling them would be hard but nothing prepared me for their anger and grief during our final month together. ‘Was our sadness too much for you to bear?’ asked an Iranian woman. ‘I too, would like the luxury of resigning,’ asserted another. My leaving them was similar to their having to let go of their children. My task had been to help these women to realise their own strengths and to speak out for themselves with courage and dignity.

NWS NWS-AAR-002 -0.00999999999999995 "Havel, the young playwright in the late 1960s A writer still?. IS CZECHOSLOVAKIA likely to gain a president in Vaclav Havel and lose a dramatist? It seems unlikely. One of the striking things about Havel is his commitment to drama over the past quarter-century and his insistence, in the period immediately before the Czech revolution, that he was first and foremost a writer. I had occasion in late October to present a brief profile of Havel as a preface to a Radio 4 presentation of his latest play, Redevelopment. In the course of it Edward Lucas, a BBC Prague correspondent, asked Havel directly if he wanted to be president. He said that he could not imagine conditions arising that would make it possible, stressed the collective nature of the democratic movement and said ‘I cannot forever play this dual role of amateur politician and writer.’ Earlier this summer he similarly told the Observer's Mark Frankland ‘The more I am forced to be active in politics, the more I enjoy doing theatre.’ History moves fast these days. But what persuades me that we have not heard the last of Havel the writer is that he combines a total commitment to social freedom and individual responsibility with an extraordinary ironic detachment. In both his plays and essays — recently issued in paperback by Faber under the title Living In Truth — he shows a remarkable gift for analysing the dilemmas of the dissident in a repressive society. He is both participant and observer: ‘a sceptical, sober, anti-Utopian, understated mind’(in his own words) confronting the business of opposing state power with rueful self-awareness. Havel is now in the seat of power; but I cannot imagine he has lost his central European gift for irony. At first, I suspect, we got Havel wrong in this country: on the strength of an early play like The Memorandum (1965) we pigeonholed him as an Absurdist along with Beckett and Ionesco. In that early work, memorably presented on TV and radio, we see a monolithic state organisation attempting to replace the existing vernacular with a synthetic language, Ptydepe, that will iron out the ambiguities and imprecisions of everyday speech. But where true Absurdism, as Vera Blackwell pointed out, posited a meaningless universe, Havel's aim was ‘the improvement of man's lot through the improvement of man's institutions.’ Havel has written constantly about the oppressive nature of Communist bureaucracy. But in recent years his plays have been more about the paradoxical nature of dissidence itself: the emotional turbulence of the authority given the individual as a public spokesman, and about the fact that one of the worst features of any totalitarian system is the need to conform to other people's expectations. Havel explored the dilemmas of the dissident with wry comedy in The Vanek Plays (Audience, Protest and Private View) written in the mid-70s. In the best of them, Audience, Havel capitalises on his own experience of working in a brewery at Trutnov stacking empty beer barrels. In the play we see Vanek (a lightly disguised version of Havel) summoned for an interview by the brewery's lager-swilling Head Maltster. He finds that he is being offered a simple trade-off: a comfortable job as a stock-checker if he will provide incriminating information about himself which the Maltster can then pass on to the Party. The sting lies in the tail when Vanek bends his principles to accommodate his desperate interrogator. What Havel wittily shows is the kind of Catch-22 situation faced by a dissident in a despotism: whether to cling fiercely to your own moral integrity (thereby landing others in the shit) or whether to conform and perpetuate a corrupt system. EVEN after nearly four years in prison (where, characteristically, he turned the permitted weekly letter to his wife into philosophical essays) Havel was able to dramatise the dissident's dilemma with a mixture of recollected pain and resilient humour. Largo Desolato, written in the early 80s is about the difficulty of being a moral hero in an immoral society. Havel's protagonist is a philosopher caught in a double bind. He has offended the state with a work called The Ontology of the Human Self and an openly provocative paper (much as Havel himself did with his Open Letter to President Husak of 1975). But his simple desire for seclusion is imperilled by a succession of visitors. On the one hand, two fans from a papermill implore him to become a dissident figurehead: on the other hand, two state policmen want him to sign a document denying authorship of the original article. One sympathises with Havel's predicament. At the same time the play leaves a key question tantalisingly unresolved: whether, in a repressive state, one can seek freedom for oneself without seeking it for others. And this raises the question of whether Havel's talent had begun to be affected by the nervous strain of writing under surveillance and of not having seen any of his work performed since 1969. Any fears, however, that Havel's talent might be going off were for me resolved by the broadcast version of Redevelopment, given a dramatised reading by the RSC in February under the title Slum Clearance. This is a major work: a dense, multi-layered allegory with its roots firmly in reality. It is set in a medieval castle in a historic town in Eastern Europe. Supervised by a state functionary (with a sqeaking shoe) and led by an emotionally-chaotic project director, a group of architects struggle to come up with a high-rise building scheme that will destroy the ancient town's character and, incidentally, clear away its slums. On the realistic level, the play is about a universal architectural dilemma: how to achieve a balance between conservation and civic improvement. But it also works as a political metaphor about the whimsical arbitrariness of autocracy with the architects first working under strict supervision and then being granted an illusory whiff of freedom. This is vintage Havel: creating a work that is both specific and universal, tragic and comic. It leaves me speculating that Havel the artist is unlikely to be displaced by Havel the politican. For the moment, he obviously has more urgent tasks than writing plays. But he is unlikely to be satisfied forever with the illusion of power. Michael Billington t"
NWS NWS-AHC-045 -0.05 "At Home: Pots of gold from under the ocean Leslie Geddes-Brown looks behind the mania for shipwreck china By LESLIE GEDDES-BROWN SHIPWRECK CARGOES have everything the antique collector could desire: romance, history, provenance, beauty — and buoyant prices. So, next Tuesday and Wednesday, Christie's in Amsterdam expects a full turnout of buyers when it sells 28,000 pieces of Chinese porcelain from a burnt-out junk shipwrecked around 1690 off Con Dao Island, Vietnam. The Vung Tau Cargo, snagged in a Vietnamese fisherman's nets, looks like being a repeat of the astonishing success of the Nanking Cargo — 150,000 pieces of mid-18th-century porcelain plus 126 gold bars — salvaged by an ex-Barnardo's boy, Michael Hatcher, and auctioned in 1986. The auction house had expected £3 million from the sale — it got £10 million. It was not always thus: in 1983, when Christie's sold the first batch of 25,000 pieces of Ming porcelain, found (also by Hatcher) in a junk on a reef on the South China Sea, prices were low, because neither auction house nor collectors could see beyond the porcelain's dull glaze to its historic possibilities. A year later, with a second sale, the British Museum and other astute buyers started to collect shipwrecked porcelain, which was beginning to tell historians a lot about the 18th-century European buyers and their influence on the East. By 1986, 20,000 people queued to view the Nanking ware in Amsterdam. When large quantities of Chinese blue and white porcelain first arrived in Europe in the 17th century the demand was so high it was nicknamed ‘Chinamania’; the phrase is just as apt today. Michael Cohen, a specialist dealer in oriental porcelain who expects to be a big bidder at next week's sale, spent more than £1 million buying Nanking pieces. ‘I bought a lot at the sale. We sold over 22,000 objects in two or three days. Then I started buying from other dealers to satisfy demand. ‘At the start, a tea cup and saucer was selling for around £30 in my shop; by the third day they were nearer £200 and still selling.’ Though Christie's says that the Vung Tau sale is lotted to encourage private buyers, with sets of between five and nine matching vases offered per lot (and designed to be shown, as they were in the 17th century, massed together on a chimneypiece or high shelf), Cohen believes buying is more easily done through a dealer. ‘Only 30 per cent of Vung Tau is perfect; the rest is damaged, from a small chip to half the piece missing. Then it's necessary to re-view the lots to make sure they haven't been further damaged during the view.’ He's had 10 times the number of commission bids for Vung Tau as he had for Nanking —‘and this is a much smaller cargo’. Colin Sheaf, who will auction Vung Tau, rang me from Hong Kong to say there was a great deal of interest there and in Singapore in the cargo, and catalogues were selling fast. The first print run of 6,000 sold out and a second of 4,000 is moving quickly. Anyone worrying — as dealers and Christie's once did — that these thousands of 300-year-old pots will flood the market need only look at Harrods, where Nanking Cargo plates have been selling regularly and at increasing prices since the auction (£195 for a good teabowl, £7,000 for an ‘encrusted’ tureen) and where, after the Vung Tau auction, the new pieces will also be for sale from, they expect, £50 to £10,000. Michael Cohen also plans a major exhibition — 15 or 20 Nanking pieces, silver bars from the Dutch bullion ship Bredenhof, auctioned in 1986, anything he can get from Vung Tau and, he hopes, a few pieces from the first Hatcher junk, which are the earliest of them all. These will be at his shop, 84 Portobello Road, from April 13. Christie's seems to be becoming the shipwreck specialist: next week's sale is its 13th since 1982. In 1983 it sold the contents of a Spanish galleon which went down off Cartagena carrying uncut emeralds and gold, and in 1988 homely spades, belaying pins and scrubbing brushes from HMS Invincible, a Royal Navy warship which foundered on a sandbank. But, for my money, the most heart-wrenching of all was the discovery of the wreck of Nuestra Senora de Atocha, which sank in 1622, dragged to the bottom in a gale by the weight of silver and gold aboard — no less than 17 tons of silver and 500 pounds of gold. None of the 268 people on her escaped — they were trapped beneath the storm-battened hatches. The rosaries and crucifixes of four drowned priests, the contraband smuggled aboard, perhaps by a doomed explorer and his soldiers, and a crested silver dish, belonging to a Spanish grandee who perished with his wife and teenage daughter, were all salvaged. It took Mel Fisher, an American obsessed with finding gold, 17 years to track down the wreck of the Atocha; in the process, his son and daughter-in-law drowned. So, if you ask how many more shipwrecks there are out there, ready for the eager auctioneers, the answer is plenty — but very few have any undamaged treasure on board. Shipwrecks, says Colin Sheaf, are usually violent affairs in which valuable cargoes are scattered or smashed. ‘If ships go down in shallow water,’ adds Michael Cohen, ‘cargoes are damaged by the tides. So the ones we are looking for are all in deep water. ‘No-one knew the true routes of the ships and virtually all the best wrecks have been found by accident. Just think of the Titanic — everyone knew where she went down, but it still took years to find her.’"

From Hampstead to the Hebrides there is anguish and anxiety as stress levels reach an all-time high. And that's just among the parents. The children have their radio helplines, their exam-aid videos and, if all else fails, their Easter holiday crammers. Mums and dads, on the other hand, have to muddle through this supreme test of parentship more or less on their own — except for the inevitable mock-exam post mortem. ‘Not working to full potential’ is a legend many of us feel is engraved on our hearts. Having teenagers is a humbling experience at the best of times — and having teenagers taking exams is the greatest leveller of all. Even the most competent high-flier, it seems, feels totally inadequate when faced with a child who simply will not get down to work. Janet Cohen, a merchant banker and novelist, confesses: ‘I went quite mad last summer when my eldest son was doing his A-levels. I met the most determined teenage resistance ever. I tried to help him with his schedule and give him advice on exam technique. Nothing worked.’ In retrospect she says the most important thing is for parents to build in some kind of motivation or prospect that means something to their offspring. This may entail lining up a course or school that the child wants to go on to, or offering a financial inducement. ‘We are all working for money,’ she says. ‘There is nothing wrong in bribing children.’ Rosemary Mewson Davis, an educational psychologist, disagrees. ‘The problem is that the expectations of many parents are too high. Offering the children a reward to achieve a standard they may feel they never can is often counter-productive. They are quite likely to give up. I feel that children should be brought up with the idea of doing the best they can — for themselves.’ She is amazed how many teenagers are allowed out during the week in the run-up to examinations. ‘Parents are too frightened to say no. Many suffer from the liberal philosophy they remember from the '60s and don't want to sort out their priorities on their own — however much they assure you they can. And if parents have special knowledge of a subject they should help the child.’ Banning television or video games during the week is common sense. Dealing with your children's friends who pop round in the evening calls for consummate diplomacy and the setting of time limits. According to Dr Judith Haynes of the educational psychologists' group Child Consultants, the crucial thing is for parents to gain the child's co-operation in establishing a revision regime in the weeks leading up to examinations. ‘There is no point being heavy-handed and threatening,’ she says. ‘You must regard exams as a joint problem you must solve together. ‘Support and involvement rather than nagging are the watchwords.’ She is not averse to bribery. But it should be for work done each day or week — not a promise that hangs on results. ‘There is little point in distant bribes, however juicy. It is too easy then for children to put off the evil day when they have to get down to work. ‘The most important thing is to organise a system that encourages them to stick at it day by day and week by week. Giving extra pocket money for good work on a daily basis is far more effective. But it does mean parents must be totally involved.’ ALASTAIR GRAHAM, headmaster of Mill Hill School, north London, says parents who have paid fees should not be above gently reminding offspring of the financial sacrifices made on their behalf in the run-up to exams. He disapproves of bribery: ‘Children don't need to be saddled with the nagging aspirations of parents who expect little Johnny to do everything they did plus everything they didn't manage to do.’ Like everyone else I talked to, he condemned the present education structure that encourages children to take A-level — a course that is simply not appropriate for many of those currently preparing for the exam. Nearly 40 per cent, he claims, are doomed to fail. But what can we do to help the bright child who works well during term but bombs in exams through nerves? Peter Anger, a psychologist, says: ‘This is one area where parents’ help is very important. In my experience schools are very bad at teaching the exam techniques that give this sort of child confidence.’ He suggests that parents should stage pretend exams at home to help children plan their answers — and how to read the questions. ‘It is very, very common for children who suffer from exam nerves to misread the questions under stress,’ he says. ‘Parents may think the best thing to do with a nervous child is to tell him or her not to worry. But children know that parents are anxious whatever they say. The best thing to do is to channel this concern in a positive way by helping them practise revision and exam techniques at home.’"
NWS NWS-AHF-018 -0.1 "Election 1992: Campaign: the good, the bad and the seldom seen By JONATHAN PETRE GOOD: The star of the 1992 election is Michael Heseltine. He has provided the only real glitz and glamour in what has seemed a decidedly lacklustre campaign. Chris Patten deserves an award for endurance as well as resilience in the face of adversity. He has faced the toughest election of any Tory chairman for 20 years, while spending the afternoons dashing to Bath to defend his own marginal seat against a strong Liberal Democrat challenge. A rehabilitated Norman Tebbit has been brought into the front line in an attempt to win back defecting C2s, the skilled workers and their families, who helped Mrs Thatcher win three elections. Douglas Hurd has proved a reassuring figure in a campaign that has at times seemed to lack confidence and direction. He had a key role in the ‘leadership’ theme — contrasting Tory experience in international affairs, particularly Europe, with the prospect of former CND supporter Neil Kinnock in Downing Street. His presence has forced Labour to keep his opposite number Gerald Kaufman off the TV screens as much as possible. Making the most of a walk-on role at the start of the campaign, Margaret Thatcher made many Tory candidates realise how much they missed her strong presence on the political stage. She loyally endorsed Mr Major and — despite a few barbs about borrowing too much — confounded predictions that she would rock the boat. She left a hole in the campaign when she departed this week for a pre-arranged lecture tour in the United States. BAD: The gloomy presence of Norman Lamont overshadowed the first week of the campaign. Has proved no match for his Labour shadow John Smith, who wrong-footed the Tories with his alternative Budget. By the time they woke up to the fact that many people would be only 2p a week better off, Smith had gained the headlines with the claim that eight out of 10 families gained. Lamont was given a lower profile for the second week — prompting a Neil Kinnock joke that he was only allowed out at night. William Waldegrave blotted his copybook during the ‘war of Jennifer's ear’, when he chaired a chaotic press conference on the National Health Service. His admission that Central Office had put a tabloid newspaper in touch with the consultant at the centre of the case was a spectacular own goal. SELDOM SEEN: With the economy and the recession at the heart of the election debate, the low profile of Peter Lilley has been a weakness. Labour has campaigned strongly on its £1 billion ‘recovery package’ while Mr Lilley, a firm believer in Thatcherite non-intervention, has had to rely on promises that recovery is just around the corner. Law and order should be one of the Tories' strongest cards, but record crime figures have tarnished their record. Kenneth Baker, replaced by Chris Patten as Tory chairman, has been on the outside of the campaign. He made an unfortunate slip when he was wheeled out for Thursday's law and order policy launch — conceding that Labour could win. John Gummer was not even on the Tory platform for a press conference to defend the Government's record on animal welfare. Frequently seen on the campaign trail — including Scotland, Wales and Yorkshire — he has not been part of Major's ‘A-team’ for the morning press conferences. Virginia Bottomley made a brief appearance at the chaotic ‘Jennifergate’ press conference, but Central Office has failed to make use of her reassuring presence as the gentler face of Toryism to help soothe public anxieties over the NHS reforms. George Jones LABOUR GOOD: Labour's campaign co-ordinator John Cunningham will take much of the credit for the projection of his party as putative government. One of the few senior front-benchers with experience of government, he has been keeping one eye on the national campaign, chairing almost all the party's London campaign press conferences, and another on his marginal Copeland constituency, travelling by hired plane to Cumbria every weekend. David Hill, the party's unflappable director of communications, has more than adequately filled the role performed by Peter Mandelson in 1987. A former adviser to Roy Hattersley, Mr Hill has been running Labour's highly effective press and broadcasting machine. The performance of the avuncular Shadow Chancellor John Smith has been the undoubted success of Labour's campaign. A stolid Scots barrister, he has been entrusted with holding the line of an economic policy which his opponents have found hard to lay a glove upon. Mr Smith has hardly put a foot wrong. Margaret Beckett, the other half of the Treasury team, is a stalwart of the press conference platform and the Labour politician most respected by the Conservatives, although she has not always inspired on the hustings. No one 's performance could be rated as BAD. MODERATE: Labour's Industry spokesman Gordon Brown has made strenuous efforts to shed his normally lugubrious demeanour, presumably on the orders of the party's image police. One of Labour's ‘A-team’, Mr Brown has appeared on every party election broadcast and on most political broadcasts in the run up to the campaign. But as a master of the ‘sound bite’ quote he has been surprisingly unconvincing in this campaign. SELDOM SEEN: The ‘Where is Gerald Kaufman’ jokes backfired on the Conservatives when Mr Chris Patten called for search parties to be sent out only five minutes after the Shadow Foreign secretary had appeared at Labour's morning conference. But he will have cause to resent his treatment by campaign organisers given Mr Kinnock's unequivocal pledge to appoint him Foreign Secretary in a Labour government. John Prescott, transport spokesman, has largely been frozen out of the national campaign, which is surprising given his adept performance on BBC's election call this week. Mr Prescott's capacity for saying what he thinks and his somewhat abrasive manner are evidently not qualities that are easily packaged. Philip Johnston LIBERAL GOOD: The strategy devised by Des Wilson, the party's campaign director, has been largely vindicated; despite the odd blip, the public has received a single consistent message. And Mr Ashdown has been projected in photo opportunities across Britain as the best leader the country will never have. BAD: The only serious wobble of the campaign followed the appearance of Simon Hughes, the party's environment spokesman, on BBC television's Election Call programme when he appeared to contradict or amend party policy no fewer than four times in less than an hour. MODERATE: Treasury spokesman Alan Beith has had a high profile, though he must occasionally feel like a comma in the economy debate between Mr Lamont and Mr Smith. SELDOM SEEN: After the first week party president Charles Kennedy was noticeable by his absence, raising the cry in the Ashdown battlebus: ‘Who shot President Kennedy?’ He was subsequently given a few walk-on parts."
NWS NWS-CH3-275 -0.21 "I'M DOING IT FOR YOU MICHAEL FANZINE special on the force that's driving Eubank Respect for fallen hero IAN GIBB CHRIS EUBANK couldn't help himself — the words of tribute to Michael Watson came tumbling out in a torrent, a year to the Saturday since he put the brave Londoner into a coma. Forgotten, momentarily, were the lumps and bumps and soreness of his face after the punishment he took from game but limited American challenger Tony Thornton in Glasgow on Saturday night. Today is the actual anniversary of the tragic night in Tottenham when Eubank crushed Watson — and it is only recently that the Islington fighter has started to make a real recovery. Just the mention of his name started Eubank off. ‘What a blinding man, and I'm so very pleased that Michael is seeming to make an amazing recovery. ‘I've spoken to him a few times and he's the epitome of a true warrior. He still wants to fight, believes he still has it in him to fight. ‘He's still sharp, has a sense of humour, he's witty. He's bitter about what happened — he didn't want to lose. He hated that. ‘But I got punched to pieces that night and the only reason I won the fight was that I could still keep going in the 12th round. Brilliant ‘Since that day it hasn't looked too good for Michael, certainly not five or six months ago. Now he's brilliant. He said to me: ‘Bring the championship belt and a camera.’ ‘I'd willingly give him the belt but he wouldn't take it. The difference between us is that I don't like this boxing business — and he still loves it, even now. ‘He keeps telling me that I must fight every contender and mustn't dodge anyone. He says as a champion I must perform well and give the public value for money. Then he says: ‘Are you ready for the re-match. Are you up to it?’ ‘He's still a warrior in his mind and you can't break his spirit. He will keep on trying to finish on his feet.’ Yet questions have to be asked quite seriously about whether Eubank himself can maintain his work-rate with a tenth world title fight lined up in just 24 months. He faces yet another challenge for his WBO super- middleweight crown in Manchester on November 28. But I think it's all to do with Watson, the man he now respects so much. Eubank would fight every week if he could to make his fortune secure as soon as possible. Yet on Saturday night he may have run away from a million dollar showdown with Iran Barkley, a man Nigel Benn once conquered, now the IBF champion at 12 stone. Barkley's handler, Stan Hoffman, was in Glasgow to run the rule over Eubank — and he wasn't impressed. He said: ‘I could not sell a Eubank-Barkley fight in the States after that performance. ‘All that running away in the last couple of rounds, it was crazy — an American TV audience wouldn't like it.’ Eubank's promoter Barry Hearn may have different ideas, and is thinking of trying to put Barkley on against Eubank in Britain. That's even though the British Boxing Board have already ruled out Barkley from fighting here because of eye retina damage. If that fell down Hearn might think of staging such a fight in France. But that wouldn't happen until some time next year when Eubank could also be facing Nigel Benn — especially if Benn lifts the WBC title in Italy next month. Eubank looked as though he was going to finish off Thornton in the ninth round — and should have done so in the tenth. But he admitted: ‘I couldn't stay with his pace and I had to get away and look after myself.’ Thornton was not impressed by that tactic. He said: ‘What was the speed limit in the ring during those last couple of rounds? He ran his ass off! It must be wondered whether Eubank is jaded through having so many fights at a high level in such a short time. But it won't get any easier as Hearn promises: ‘We're only going to fight sluggers and tough guys. That may sound mercenary because Chris knows the rest of his career is limited, but it will be fun for people watching! Eubank insists: ‘I HAVE to fight. I NEED to fight. I WANT to fight — on November 28. Yet even Eubank, deep down, does question his continuation in a sport that he has never really liked. He said: ‘It's nice to have a record of 33 wins in 33 fights, but in a way it is becoming tedious and I'm tired of winning all the time. ‘You can have too much of a good thing — but the alternative is quite unacceptable…defeat.’ If he keeps pushing himself so hard, that unacceptable facet of boxing might have to be faced sooner or later. Thornton wasn't quite good enough to take his title, but Eubank might soon be so tired that someone, somewhere, will catch up with him. WHAT A BELTER! STILL champ — but deep down Chris Eubank knows how close it was against punching postman Tony Thornton CHRIS makes his point to the fans EU better watch out — Thornton throws a left FLASHBACK one year — and joy that was soon to turn to despair for Eubank, with Michael Watson moments away from collapse Pictures: CHRIS GRIEVE"
NWS NWS-K4Y-054 -0.0700000000000001 "CHRISTOPHER Gable says he did not set out to deliberately shock. Yet he was well aware that tampering with the traditional approach to Swan Lake would ruffle a few feathers. What he wasn't expecting was a Sunday newspaper preview article claiming Northern Ballet Theatre's new staging of Swan Lake was steamy, erotic stuff with a hint of oral sex. More dirty duck than sensual swan was the impression given. The result of this advance publicity not wildly accurate as it turns out spelt potential disaster for NBT which prides itself on making its work more accessible to youngsters. Worried parents fretted that their children would be exposed to X-rated happenings. A Darlington councillor who, of course, hadn't seen the production called for it to be banned. The threat of cancelled bookings hung in the air. Backstage at Leeds Grand Theatre, a few days after Swan Lake's royal premiere elicited a five-minute standing ovation from the audience, Gable talks long and intelligently about the controversial production. You'd expect the unhelpful advance publicity to make him wary of the Press. Not at all. He has operated an ‘open door’ policy since taking over as NBT's artistic director and will continue to do so. If people are going to have their opinions formed by what they read in the tabloids, he feels sorry for them. A relatively simple question like ‘Are you a happy man?’(one assumes he must be in the wake of the successful opening) is followed by a 15 minute answer. Gable replies that to be honest he's surprised, although not by the attitude of ‘the old guard conservative group of three or four London reviewers’. Their reaction was predictable: ‘One expects them to groan, though I don't know quite why we should be seeing a piece as it was performed 50 years ago. That's what they think ballet should be and that's why I think, by and large, ballet is a dying art form.’ What has surprised and pleased him is the public's response. He wasn't sure how they'd take to this rethink of Swan Lake. From the letters he's received and through talking to audiences, he knows the production is a popular one. Just don't use the word ‘crowd-pleaser’. Gable regards this as an insult to the audience handed out by critics who consider themselves on a higher level. That NBT audiences and critics are out of touch would seem to be borne out by the response to NBT's recent touring hit Romeo & Juliet. Worst production of the year, wrote one London critic. Best of the year, voted readers of Dance and Dancers. ‘I was not sure what the general public's reaction would be to Swan Lake. Everyone knows the name and thinks they know the story. I presumed they would be bringing very formed expectations to the theatre. ‘What I've found is a far younger element in the audience. On the evidence this production is speaking far more vividly to this generation than the traditional version.’ Gable hopes his Swan Lake will be viewed not as a version but a theatre event in its own right. ‘Although I don't try to shock I do try to make the moment as vividly alive for the audience as I can and that's a sort of crusade,’ he admits. He's moved the story to Russia, sent the Prince on army manoeuvres where he joins a boys' boozy night out, has the swans massacred by a power-mad crippled usurper and the corpses piled obscenely in a heap. Worst of all, the swans don't wear tutus but rather fetching white corseted little skirts. NBT audiences are ‘not content to look at rows and rows of identical girls doing the same thing,’ he maintains. Gable justifies his changes with talk of Tiananmen Square killings, the murder of the Russian royal family, Auschwitz, Hollywood parties and even Prince Andrew. This may sound extreme in print but Gable considers it ‘legitimate stuff of the theatre.’ He says: ‘I simply tried to do what I observed in my career in the straight theatre with some of the finest directors, particularly Peter Brook. ‘I tried to make the story as individual and as real as I can, and if possible to approach without any preconceptions, which is hard with Swan Lake because I have been associated with the ballet for 14 years. ‘You can't just make a performance of everything you have seen. You have to clear away the debris. I did with this, looking at various segments of the story.’ He's proud that Romeo & Juliet introduced children to both Shakespeare and Prokofiev ‘in a way that makes them think it's not culture and a bit boring and I wish I could go and watch Neighbours.’ Christopher the Crusader is in his stride, the man who reckons this generation of youngsters is deprived. They may have more toys, games and TVs per room than any other generation but lack the stimulation of reading, listening to music and the radio of Gable's youth. ‘It seems to me that what our children have got is a little square box with predominantly soaps and games shows, with fingertip control to get them from one to another as they get bored. There is no stimulus for the imagination and like any other muscle it can atrophy from lack of use.’ Gable is honest enough to acknowledge that there's some truth in the saying that no publicity is bad publicity: ‘The cynical and worldly part of me tells me it's been wonderful because the production must be the most talked about in 20 years of dance. ‘Once the production opened and the showed the allegations were totally groundless we are left with a production that parents know is suitable for children and no one can take that publicity away.’ — Swan Lake plays at Darlington Civic Theatre from March 31-April 4 and Newcastle Theatre Royal in June."
NWS NWS-K58-005 -0.18 "A love at odds with its faith Joan McAlpine talks to an angry priest about the Catholic Church's attitude to homosexuals among its ranks ‘ I believe that homosexuality is a gift from God. To deny that gift is to deny God's will, saying His way isn't good enough. It's a type of blasphemy, if you like’— Bernard Lynch THE Roman Catholic Church has never been the most liberal institution in its views on homosexuality. It condemns gays as sinful and evil. So it would seem safe to assume that life as a gay priest might be something of a tortured path — if not a contradiction in terms. But some homosexuals in the church — especially in America — have exchanged guilty, fervid prayers for support groups and gay pride marches. They are now asking that Rome recognises — or at least does not condemn — the love that dare not speak its name. Angry priests and nuns argue that the hardline stance on chastity hampers the church in educating young people about AIDS, as well as caring for those who have the disease. But those who raise their heads above the vestibule are seldom treated with Christian charity. The story of Father Bernard Lynch demonstrates how the wrath of the bishops can strike those who bare their souls to homophobic scrutiny. In May 1988, Lynch, a high profile campaigner for gay rights, was indicted on five charges of child abuse in New York City. He was accused of molesting a 14-year-old boy whom he had been counselling while working as a school chaplain. But the prosecution case collapsed. Questions were raised over the fabrication of evidence. It was strongly suspected that the softly spoken Irishman had been framed. He was acquitted on all counts after the court heard the boy in question, by then a young man, had been put under pressure to testify by the FBI and the district attorney. In his book A Priest On Trial, published this week by Bloomsbury, Lynch sets out the transcript of the trial and accuses the church of colluding in his personal crucifixion. By the time of his trial, Father Lynch, a former missionary in Africa, had been working with gay Catholics in the city for nearly ten years. He had been openly critical of his own archbishop's defence of discrimination against homosexuals in church employment. A trained counsellor, he has ministered to 600 people with the disease to date. Only six remain alive. In 1986 he founded an AIDS Ministry with Dignity, a group of lesbian and gay Catholics, and became a member of the mayor of New York's taskforce on AIDS. The city introduced legislation that year forbidding discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation. This was in marked contrast to the Vatican's letter of the same time saying gays were: ‘disordered in their nature and evil in their love’. Lynch remembers: ‘The reaction in the city and throughout the gay world — and, indeed, among many reasonable, intelligent people — was incredulity. How could the church, a church supposedly based on the love of humankind, issue such a horrendously offensive document? We were devastated.’ After he spoke out against the letter, Lynch was ordered to take a year's sabbatical in Rome — even though by this time his ministry was receiving worldwide media coverage. The Society of African Missionaries made him sign a document promising to be ‘Faithful to church teaching in matters of faith and morals.’ It was at this time he was indicted on child abuse charges. ‘Of all the charges brought against the gay community there is none more common than the assumption that gay and paedophile are one and the same. ‘People can hardly be blamed for this misconception when one considers how often the media, particularly the tabloid press, come out with it. Some gay people molest children, just as some heterosexual people do, but this is because they are emotionally and psychosexually damaged, whatever their sexual orientation.’ After his acquittal, he says he was less concerned at the action of the authorities, than by the failure of his church to help him. The church's attitude to Lynch stands in marked contrast to its harbouring of some Catholic priests who have in fact been guilty of child abuse. ‘It transpired that the Archdiocese of New York had allowed the state to defame, prosecute and condemn me, not only without offering me any aid, but also keeping from my attorney any information which might have helped me.’ Yet Lynch remains a member of the church. He is on leave from his order, and currently works in London as a counsellor for people with AIDS. Up until the time of his trial, he felt obliged to deny his own homosexuality. Now he freely admits to being gay and to having had a stable, loving relationship with another man. He continues to campaign for the right of Catholics to be openly gay. But how can this be a realistic demand in an institution which condemns any physical pleasure outwith marriage — for heterosexuals as well as homosexuals? And how can gay priests reasonably expect acceptance when celibacy is demanded of heterosexuals? The desire for marriage and a family results in thousands of men leaving the priesthood. ‘I believe that homosexuality is a gift from God. To deny that gift is to deny God's will, saying His way isn't good enough. It's a type of blasphemy, if you like.‘ He does not believe celibacy should be demanded of priests — whether gay or straight. Radical views like this seem unlikely ever to be accepted by the cardinals who dictate the dominant conservative teaching. The Roman Catholic Church is distinguished by its hierarchical nature and its insistence that tradition, and the papal interpretation of God's will, is as important as scripture. But Lynch believes his church is like a large boat which should be able to take his views on board. ‘The Catholic church is universal, like the United Nations. It can take in all sorts of people. In Latin America and Africa, as well as this country, there are bodies of faithful Catholics who don't adhere to church doctrine.’ He insists the Vatican's teaching is at odds with its congregations. ‘In the US, 78 per cent of Catholics believe in the ordination of women while 48 per cent approve of blessing the union of two people of the same sex. The church's teaching on contraception is widely ignored by Catholics.’ Lynch says the church's attitude to sexuality should be reviewed in the light of HIV and AIDS. ‘The church ought to take its courage in both hands with this disease. It should say ‘If you cannot adhere to the moral dictum, then at least only engage in safe sex. It's not enough to say don't have sex. The church has enormous power when it comes to education. There is no room for soft pedalling. This is a life and death issue.’ He believes the church must go further and examine its whole attitude to the ‘rich mosaic of sexuality’. ‘Minorities have an important role to play here. Gays in the church, for example, are like the canaries in the Welsh mines, leading the way for others.’ Given his views, one might be surprised that Lynch remains a priest. The popular expectation would be the humiliation of ‘defrocking’. In fact, this is a very rare event. Only an attack on the nuts and bolts of belief — such as denying the existence of Christ — merits this punishment. Lapsed priests remain priests, but tend to be unemployable in their clerical functions. Lynch is on leave from his order. But he does say Mass when invited, often by people with AIDS who are not Catholic, but would like spiritual support from a like-minded person. Given the radical nature of his views, one must ask why he remains a priest. His experience of Catholicism from his earliest years up until his trial, seems to have been bound in oppression, self-denial and guilt. As a child in the west of Ireland, he was a member of two Jansenistic religious groups. He recalls that the Dominic Savio club, designed to safeguard bodily purity, forbade its members from even watching a screen kiss at the Saturday matinee. In his book's conclusion, he writes: ‘It has been my sad experience, again and again, especially in my Aids ministry, to witness the damning effects of my church's institutionalised God on young people's souls. The church has in effect, poisoned their lifeline to God.’ Why does Lynch remain in an institution which seems to deny everything he holds dear? Why not just leave — set up home in a more tolerant spiritual pew? After all, there are many trendy Anglicans who hold similar views. ‘I could not leave. Once you are a Catholic you remain a Catholic, whether you become a Buddhist or an atheist. You still think in the way you have been educated as a child. ‘Anyway, should you move out of your country because you disagree with the politics of the government? No, you stay and try to change it.’ DONALD MACLEOD"
NWS NWS-K5C-069 -0.11 "The crazy leader of the menopausal male pack AT first you don't really believe you can do it. You have the Haynes manual, you have the socket set, the spanners, the mole wrench, the hatchet and the sledgehammer. You have the two hands of five fingers each, honed and hardened by years of typewriter and keyboard pounding. But replacing the front wheel of a motorbike? Are you kidding? I was brought up to be mechanical, to make and repair things. My father, brilliant at stripping cars and putting them back together, encouraged my interest in dismantling bicycles, old radios, antique clocks. For me, though, the pleasure and amazement was in seeing how many bits you could get out of those once-neatly-assembled packages. Then I got bored. The bits would never fit properly. A large hammer would be employed. And that was usually that. My attempt to make a bicycle chain run more smoothly on an expensive light alloy racing crank by hitting the pedals with a large axe probably summed up my adolescent mechanical bent best. But as I get older patience, a commodity not particularly noticeable in the past, has gradually appeared in my personality, like a sandbank silted into place by too many frothing tides. I have constructed a kitchen out of flatpacks with only one minor nervous breakdown and one remarkable shouting match involving my wife, her mother, myself and how a length of pine beading ought to be attached to several wall cupboards. (They were right, and this is the first time I've admitted it.) But I still wouldn't have attempted sorting the motorbike if a garage hadn't nearly killed me. This is what happened. The Orange Beast, recalcitrant hero/heroine (politically correct transsexual eastern European motorcycle and sidecar) of (cue shameless plug) book and soon-to-be-TV-series Spirit of Adventure had survived 2,000 miles of distillery-hopping with nothing more, it appeared, than a seized steering bearing and intermittent front brake failure. To the garage the beast and I unsafely struggled, a place straight out of Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance: Bad Karma Department. MZ250s are not glamorous bikes. They are remarkably functional workhorses, two stroke, solid and very ugly. The mechanic was not impressed. It may have been the way the exhaust pipe stained his boiler suit. Or perhaps he was anti-German for some deep-rooted racial or sexual reason. Or anti-communist, my bike hailing from pre-reunification DDR days. The steering was fixed. The brakes, I was informed, had just needed adjusting. As I rode away, I noticed that the front disc brake still faded erratically. And the rev counter no longer worked. Up the A9 towards home I rattled, reaching the scary speed of 60mph. I turned off towards Munlochy, and near the Clootie Well, the entire front hub disintegrated in a shower of hot, broken alloy, and the bike headed straight for the hedge. We survived. I had been doing about 15mph when this traumatic event occurred. The brake problems had been caused by the front wheel bearings having mostly ceased to exist, sending the whole brake assembly in and out of alignment. The garage hadn't noticed. I was determined no-one but myself would fix the beast, given what had happened. The trusty Haynes manual, a completely eccentric MZ parts specialist in London (‘I got black mudguards and chrome mudguards. The black's £40 and the chrome's £60. But I'll give you the chrome for £25 'cause I got a lot of them. Or the black for £30…where is it you live, mate? Black Oil?’), the socket set and a large hammer, and to my astonishment I had fitted a new wheel and mudguard. Later I removed the back wheel, refitted it, adjusted the chain tension and replaced a headlight bulb. At last. After all these years, I'd taken something to bits and successfully put it all back together again. The sense of satisfaction was bigger than a prop's ribcage; the problems had been fewer than a hooker's braincells. What next then? Well, nothing actually. It's taken a fortnight to get the oil out of my fingers, nightly doses of Ecover washing up liquid notwithstanding. And I've had an allergic reaction to the oil and lithium grease, or maybe it's the Ecover. Green detergent, indeed! My hands are like pumice stones! Bring back Fairy Liquid, old formula, that's what I say! There must be some way of getting lanolin without killing whales, surely? No, these days I'm concentrating on passing my motorcycle test — a complex business, even if you have been driving a car on and sometimes off the road for nigh on 20 less than accident-free years. I say concentrating. Actually, it's all theoretical stuff, as frankly it's too cold to do much motorcycling on my wonderfully rebuilt MZ with the chrome mudguard. And there is no cold like motorcycle cold, no rain like an MZ rain. When you've been driving a car, and hirpling about on motorbikes using L plates, as aged car users are allowed to with anything under 125cc or possessing a sidecar, you think you know it all. Having recently braved the innard-freezing weather to sit my CBT (Compulsory Basic Training) motorcycle test part one, I am chastened. For one thing, I'm so old they've changed the rules on driving. You no longer signal when you're pulling out to overtake,(unless to warn fast-approaching traffic behind you); nor do you signal right when pulling out from the kerb. You don't even have to do hand signals. Bad habits surface like bits of forgotten oil slick in a salmon farm. The lifesaver, it is called, that last look over your shoulder before making any kind of manoeuvre on a bike. I've started doing it in the car, too. It helps. But I've now got a trapped nerve in my neck. I remember the days of the old motorbike test, when you just rode around the block a few times while the examiner walked to various points and watched you. In those days motorcycling was black leather and blood, sometimes helmetless. Death rates increased all the time, as hormonally charged adolescents flocked to give it heavy Brando on Honda C50s. Then came the CBT, a drop in deaths and the surest way of reducing youthful hooliganism on bikes: make it too expensive. These days, you just can't get insured at all if you're young and a biker in certain areas. Maybe they should introduce a CBT for climbers, those other willing dicers with death. Impossible to administer, I know, but something has to be done to stop the unbelievable carnage on Scotland's hills. Just as the motorcycling clubs became safety orientated and led the training initiative, so should the climbing clubs recognise their responsibility, even to idiots. I am old, and cheap to insure as a motorcyclist — the classic early male menopause returner. The thing is, there is nothing like a bike for sheer visceral excitement. Dangerous it is. Crazy it is, especially on the much longed-for MZ replacement, a Kawasaki ZZ-R1100, capable of massively out-accelerating every car on the road and reaching 175mph along Barassie beach. And all this for less, brand new, than a basic Ford Fiesta. I'm a long way from that, though. I potter and practise on my newly-restored Orange Beast, my socket set in the sidecar and patience at the ready. As long as the weather's fine."
