HOC HOC-BW 0.26 " In my opinion, the bank should take this ideal opportunity to claim free advertising. I'm sure they would be happy to pay a top marketing company a similar price for a really effective ad campaign and who could refuse to join a bank that is so generous? A tongue-in-cheek advertisement relating to the incident could increase their business greatly and I'm sure Mr Hickey, if allowed to keep the money, would be happy to give them a glowing reference!      We seem to be missing the point here. If the above story is complete, I suspect Mr Hickey is not keeping hold of the cash because he believes he is entitled to do so, but rather because he quite rightly feels aggrieved at being clapped in irons for honestly reporting the mistake in the first place. Surely the Spanish police only arrested him at the behest of the bank, why else would they care? Yes, he should give the cash back, but he should receive substantial compensation for wrongful arrest and detention. The debate should not be anything to do with the actual accounting error, but rather Mr Hickey's treatment.      Where money is concerned honesty is always best. When my bank made an error I told them straight away. Once I found a wallet stuffed with money, I took it to the police station and later an old gent called at my house and gave me a reward.      In my opinion, the fact that the bank had the audacity to put at the bottom of the transaction slip that it was not responsible for any errors makes the money his. That statement is to protect themselves. If the error had been in their favour and he had tried to get recompense he would have no chance. The bank should try to recover the money from the person who made the mistake.      Having had a bank pay someone elses wages into my account whilst an impoverished student, I can understand the blunder. However, the thought of keeping the money never crossed my mind! Mr. Hickey would have soon complained if the mistake was to his detriment!      It is undeniable that the money was put in the bank as the result of a request for an exchange transaction. Therefore there is a contract to supply Mr Hickey with the amount exchanged at whatever rate was agreed at the time of the transaction. If Mr hickey agreed to receive some money at a given rate then that is the only money the bank has a duty to supply him with. Having made the error and pointed it out to Mr Hickey the bank must then enter into a new arrangement with Mr hickey to cover the return of their money. Mr Hickey would of course be perfectly entitled to charge them any amount he deems reasonable for his entire costs and time spent sorting out their mess. I don't know what Mr Hickey's hourly rate is, lawyers can charge hundreds of pounds per hour, but his time spent under arrest and in court will only increase the charges to the bank.      If I make a MISTAKE in my budgets for the month and go overdrawn by accident, some might say by MISTAKE, the bank are very keen to jump on me and charge #25 just for a letter telling me this. Am I able to have them arrested? No. This bank has also made a ""MISTAKE."" They should learn their lesson by it (as should the entire banking industry) and live with the consequences. After all, we all have to.      I've had dealings with UK banks when they have made mistakes against me. Even when I've proved to them with receipts etc, they still refused to give me back money that was mine (which they had removed in error from my account). I had to take them to the ombudsmen before getting the money back. I say good on Mr Hickey for standing his ground. At the very least if it ends up going against him, they should compensate for his arrest since it was their fault in the first place. He should also keep any interest to (have you EVER tried obtaining lost interest from a bank after they have made a mistake).      I think that he should return the money as it doesn't belong to him. However, the bank concerned should also give him a good-will payment as its own terms stated that it wasn't responsible for any mistakes.      I have had a similar experience, but involving the smaller some of around #10,000. It occurred when transferring funds from my account in Switzerland to my private account in Spain. I asked the bank to transfer Pts 30,000 but they transferred SFr. 30,000. I discovered the mistake when going to make a withdrawal from the Swiss account and was told that I was SFr. 29,000 in deficit. The bank realised the mistake and asked me if I would please return the money, which of course I did, as should Mr Hickey.      Keep it!! They have said that they cannot be held responsible for errors made by the bank. I know someone who paid a bill to the bank on time, only to receive a letter the following week saying he had not paid and that the bank would charge him #25 for the error. He wrote a letter back, saying that if they check their records they will see that he has paid and that he charged them #25. The error was corrected and he did receive #25!      Of course the monies should be returned as it was transferred in error. Barclays once remitted over 400,000 into my account and were quick to take it back. They were right to do so however wonderful on the bank statement!      I recently received #1,300 into my bank account and having just started a new job presumed it was my first month's wages due at around the same time. I found it puzzling that I had not received a payslip however and found out that the money had in fact been paid in by another company. I have no idea who they are and why they paid me the money, I have contacted my bank to try and find out where the money has come from but after a 5 day wait while they went through their retrieval system, they tell me they can't reveal any details because of the Data Protection Act.      I am prepared to give the money back when asked but until then, it will stay in a savings account garnering interest. But I like the idea of Mr Hickey charging the bank an administrative charge - it seems the only way he can get something out of the whole fiasco.      Not only would I give money back that wasn't mine, I have. I got more cash out of a cash machine than I asked for or was on my receipt. The only thing to do was to call the bank to explain what happened, and have them deduct it from my account. The money was not mine, and I could not keep it. It doesn't matter what the amount, the principle is the same. Stealing is wrong. I do think that honesty should be rewarded, but not necessarily monetarily. A letter of gratitude is enough. In this world, trust is all we really have with each other in the end. Let's keep that trust, and the hope that comes with it, alive!      Bank error in your favour - so goes the monopoly chance card. Good luck to Mr Hickey. Has everyone seen the charges banks levy, like charging customers for using a competitor's cash machine. They can afford this loss.      Give it back? No Way. Only when ""I made a mistake"" becomes an acceptable excuse for being overdrawn, or not paying your credit card bill, should he give it back. Legally, if his receipt says the bank is not responsible for any errors, then tough. I feel for the person who made the mistake, but rules are rules, moral or not.      It should be remembered that an individual made a mistake, an administrative error. It happens. The money should be returned.      Having been the victim of a well-known bank's errors many times in the past, and having been charged for their mistakes, which took a long time to rectify, I'd say good luck, quickly transfer the money to another account, and enjoy it.      If the bank were to have deducted money from his account by mistake Mr Hickey would have demanded it back plus compensation. So he should repay the bank the money back less 1 percent.      A similar situation happened to me when I was in Germany. I was given 300 pounds worth of DM when I only handed in 150 pounds worth (not quite a quarter of a million). Once I realised my mistake I did bring the money back. However, it was touch and go, I was very tempted to spend it. But I think the right thing was to give it back.      He should return the money, of course. But he should also retain a percentage, say 10%, for the emotional stress involved in being arrested for someone else's mistake.      I think this man will eventually be forced to give up the cash, after all the laws are there to protect the banks. I would definitely return the cash to its rightful owner, but much like this guy is doing I'd make them jump through hoops first and then say pretty pleeeease.      Do the right thing - give the money back      This guy needs a lawyer as Spanish law may dictate what happens. A foreign country (Ireland) made the error and what recourse they might have in Spain is really the question.     I think the very fact that there is even a debate on the subject says a lot about morals in today's society. There is no debate - he came by the money in error, has seen a chance to profit at someone else's cost and is now using the media to try and engender support for his immoral stance. Incompetence and over-reaction do not justify dishonesty.      The only time I get to keep the money when the bank makes an error in my favour is when I play Monopoly. In real life it has never happened to me but if it did I am sure that I would have to pay it back. After all it isn't my money.      Whilst his arrest by the Spanish police appears to be over the top considering he didn't know about the situation then (or so he says), he is well aware now that the money is not his, and is only there as a result of an honest error. He should give back the money that isn't his to the bank, although he should be allowed to keep the interest on the money. He would not feel the same way if the error went the other way, would he?      Years ago my bank credited my account with #1,399 which I immediately realised was a bank error, caused by accidentally shifting a decimal point 2 places to the right. I pointed out the mistake three times to the bank: once by phone, once in person, and once in writing. Amazingly, the bank resolutely refused to admit it had made a mistake and after waiting six months for the bank staff to recognise their error and adjust my balance, I resolved the impasse by spending the money. Not surprisingly, the bank has long since closed down.      Mr. Hickey's situation is different. The bank and Mr. Hickey both know a genuine mistake has been made and the bank has asked Mr. Hickey to return its misdirected funds. The rule of the jungle does not apply and Mr. Hickey is likely to find himself in deep trouble if he spends the money. Given the sum of money involved, an elegant - albeit naughty - solution might be for Mr. Hickey to leave the bank's money untouched in a deposit account and enjoy spending the not inconsiderable interest!      I remember a case of many years ago where a man received #10,000 into his current account by mistake. Despite his knowing that it was not his money he immediately withdrew it and spent it. He was subsequently prosecuted and found guilty of stealing by finding. Quite right too in my opinion. The man was a thief.      Having been arrested, handcuffed and then released effectively on bail for somebody else's mistake, I would return to the bank not one penny until the bank started talking about compensation.      Having borne the brunt of banking errors to my detriment in the past, would I give it back? Not a chance! I hope that the Irish guy enjoys the sun and sand of Spain on his new-found windfall - I most certainly would!      Where has this man lost his conscience? Probably, no court can help in this situation, as legally, if confirmed by appropriate banking documents, he seems to be right to hold the money with him. This is only a question of morale, which is absent in this case.      Perhaps errors such as these will make banks be less heavy-handed with their own petty 'administrative' charges, and less prone to mistakes. God knows the number of times the two banks I'm with have made silly mistakes that have cost me time (and sometimes money). I think the gentleman in question is entitled to a percentage of the money. He should refer to it as administrative charges, and explain to the bank that it's just 'company policy'.      Businesses like to make the rules to which customers must adhere, but feel they only apply if the result is in their favour. If, as I believe Mr Hickey claims, the agreement says that the bank is not responsible for errors and they cannot be corrected at a later time, the bank should abide by their own terms of business.      Of course he should repay it - it isn't his, the bank has made it clear that the error occurred and keeping the money is tantamount to theft.     If he is correct that the bank transaction had a disclaimer saying that they were not responsible for errors then I think it sounds like the bank has no come back against him. After all those disclaimers are there to cover the banks when they make mistakes in their favour so it should stand for cases when the banks make mistakes in the customers favour.      Shame on Mr Hickey. Where does he think the money to pay for his greed would have to come from, and does he have any feeling for the poor bank employee who made an honest mistake?      Ludicrous man. So if I order a computer, for example, and it gets delivered to my next door neighbour by mistake, is he entitled to think it's his? Bank errors work both ways of course. Presumably the bank could accidentally transfer money out of his account by mistake if he doesn't cough up.      Rob, UK - actually under Britsh law if you order goods and they are delivered to the wrong person, that person is not legally required to return them.      We're all human, we make mistakes and bank personnel are no different. They should be less prone to error than most but it's almost impossible to have 100% perfection when handling large volumes of transactions in multiple currencies. This greedy man deserves to be forced to pay back every penny.      I presume that if his account had been debited by that amount then he would be happy to accept that mistake?      I sympathise with him but holding on to what you know isn't yours is dishonest. If the error had put the bank in possession of his money or goods he'd be the first to complain.      When I opened my old account they were supposed to give me a #50 sweetener. They accidentally gave me #100. I didn't complain and #50 extra was hardly going to ruin them. After a year or so another bank offered me a better deal so I switched. They promised me a #60 sweetner. I never got it. When I complained I was told that they had given customers who hadn't yet received their money till the end of last year to ask where it had got to and those that didn't ask by the deadline forfeited their right to it. Unfortunately, the bank 'forgot' to let me know about this so-called deadline. Perhaps it was some bizarre justice, making right the mistake from before and punishing me by an extra tenner for not pointing out the mistake the other bank had made. I say to Mr Hickey: keep that cash at your peril, because there's obviously a higher power out there and he's a banker!      A couple of years ago whilst making some changes to one of my Direct Debits my bank somehow managed to change the status of my account to the effect that I had died. They then informed everybody who I had dealings with via the bank of my demise. This even got as far as our postman who knocked on the door to express his commiserations with my wife. I even had letters from BT addressed to the executors of my estate. When I pointed out to the bank that I was still alive we all had a jolly good laugh about it and they apologised profusely.      However, when it came to sorting out the account not only did they refuse to inform all those parties that it had told I was dead but informed me that it was my responsibility to ensure that my account details were correct. The problem seemed to snowball from then on and I even had a letter from them implying that I had faked my own death in order not to repay my bank loan. It was only through the honesty of the bank employee who made the original error that I was able, eventually, to sort it all out. Would I give back the money? Probably, but I'd make them sweat for it. Oh, the honest bank employee, what happened to her? made redundant two months later.      I would be very tempted to tell him to keep the money but feel the right solution is for the bank to offer him compensation for their mistake and for all his inconvenience. Banks are rather a law unto themselves until they are the aggrieved party.       The assertion that Mr Hickey has made of ""Finders keepers, losers weepers"" is wholly unacceptable. If the error caused him to suffer genuine inconvenience or loss then of course he would be entitled to a claim for compensation but to knowingly benefit from a mistake like this is totally dishonest. No doubt he would complain if every bank refused his custom just in case they made a similar error! "
HOC HOC-CL -0.2 " I don't want to sound alarmist, but if Mr.Hodges sacking goes unchallanged, then it could open the doors to more and more employers imposing draconian restrictions on their staff. It is not just an outrage, it is a criminal attack on a mans basic human right to freedom of lifestyle whithin the privacy of his own home. If anyone was in doubt about how much our employment rights have been eroded in recent times, then this case should convince them.      I believe it is perfectly in order not to hire smokers. Companies don't like to hire those addicted to pot smoking. Both are addictive and affect job performance. Although tobacco smokers don't get ""high"", they take frequent smoke breaks and cause a health hazard to other employees. Smokers that do without cigarettes during their time at work may become easily irritable because of the dependence on nicotine. (Yes, nicotine is a drug!) A worker can be hired once he/she has kicked their addiction on nicotine.      No one has the right to dictate how you should behave at home. The Soviet Union was criticised for interfering with individuals and taking away their individual rights, this just goes to show that capitalism is no better.      I can't believe what I just read! An employer has no rights on what you do in your personal life, as long as it isn't illegal. Smoking is not illegal, and certainly not in your own home. UK management is rife with this kind of authoritarian bullying. I hope he sues this company and that others lay off from prying in to what is not their concern. I live and work in the US, and I have to agree with an earlier post, that this keeps me from ever wanting to return and work in the UK. I am a non-smoker, but believe in one's personal rights to do whatever you want to do.      I suppose that if a contract had been signed which stipulated that he would be immediately dismissed if he was found to be a smoker, then his employers had every right to sack him. Still, it would be a silly clause to include in a contract of employment. I don't smoke, but I wouldn't want to work for any company that restricted their workers' private lives in such a ridiculous way.      Personal life, professional life, only one of these is for hire.      If my employer elected to fire me because he disapproved of any aspect of my domestic conduct, I would first politely explain to that person my views on their crass stupidity. Second, I would invite that person to my home and ask them to fire me on my own carpet. In the wake of what would immediately follow, I doubt if that employer would ever again repeat such a breathtakingly arrogant error of judgement.      This is discrimination of the worst kind. I used to be a shop steward in the UK whilst working for a local government authority. I thought I had seen it all then, with regard to employers' attitudes, but this takes the cake! How dare any employer tell you what you can and cannot do during the time he is NOT paying you. I hope that a civil liberties group will support Mark Hodges all the way to the European courts if necessary, to give this company a salutary lesson with regard to individual freedom and workers' rights. What someone does in their own home is their ownbusiness.     This story is outrageous. I can't believe anyone could be sacked for smoking at home in their own free time. Mind you, he's better off without them. Who'd want to work for a company like that! I just don't see how this can possibly be legal.      From a legal point of view, Mr Thompson, it depends on what the gentleman declared on his job application. If he smokes and he declared on his job application that he did not, then he is in breach of his contract, and has been untruthful to his employers. It is as simple as that. They may now feel that he has not been truthful about other matters on that application, and so the trust that they put in him to be straight with them has already gone. He may well have been employed in a job (food manufacturing, or healthcare for example) where the smell of nicotine, that, let's face it, lingers on clothes and breath would be a bad advertisement for that company when he is out selling their products, or in meetings with other executives. He has been caught out, and has to accept the consequences of being untruthful. If this is not the case, then he would have good grounds to sue the employer.      Speaking from bitter experience I know that British employers and managers are notorious bullies whose attitudes are rooted in Victorian times. I would seriously advise people to work for American (or other foreign) companies. They demonstrate a business culture based on equality and respect for their employees. Or try contracting. Or emigrate to a less hierarchical, class-obsessed country. I can promise you it works - I have done all three. Oh, and I'm a non-smoker.      We don't know the company and if there were particular reasons to be so strict - I suppose that a company involved in dealing with lung-cancer research or related damage claims could have a point. I smoke about 3 small cigars per year - does that make me smoker? Should I be fired? I think it would be good though, if smoking would be restricted to an area well away from public buildings. There is no way of getting in or out of a building without passing a curtain of smoke.      I can understand why firms would want to hire people with lower sickness rates and who are less likely to suffer from long-term illness during their working lives, even if I do think this is going a bit far.      This is the most idiotic thing I have heard. I don't smoke, and while I can appreciate a non smoking policy in the workplace, what people do in their own homes is entirely up to them. As far as I'm aware, smoking isn't illegal in the UK. It's nothing short of discrimination.      The only legitimate concerns of the company you work for with regards to what you do in your time are if you compromise your ability to do your job, or if you bring the company into disrepute. Beyond that companies need to stop behaving as if they have bought your soul rather than just rented your services for 40 hours a week.      I am British but presently live in the USA. I sometimes wonder about coming home, but issues like this make me want to stay away. ""An English man's home is his castle"", at least it used to be. As long as someone or something is not affecting your emotional or physical performance in your job, your boss should have no right to sanction you in any way. In fact I think this boss should be fired for discrimination or if it is a company owner, the company should be severely sanctioned for discrimination.      That's nonsense! I hope Mr Hodges is going to sue for unfair dismissal, because employers have no right to govern your behaviour outside of working hours. If it isn't illegal, and it doesn't affect your ability to do your job, then what you do in your own time is your business and nobody else's.      I am a non-smoker and would love to see a ban on smoking in all public places, however what people do in their own homes is nobody's business but their own.      As a non-smoker, it is irritating to see people taking sometimes constant ""fag-breaks"". However, if Mr Hodges did not do this then the company had no right to complain. I actually think it's scary that a company can try and dictate one's home life like this. Corporate mentality should not need to exist after 5.30! I hope Mr Hodges sues this company and wins.      If Mr Hodges has agreed to a contract that stipulates no smoking or has claimed to be a non-smoker on his application form then he has little cause to complain. If he smokes at home he will still smell like an ashtray at work and his physical health is likely to be worse than that of his non-smoking colleagues. Also the very fact that he is a smoker says something very negative about his personality. Anyone who risks serious health problems for the sake of a pathetic little self-gratification clearly has a serious problem.      So long as he does what he's being paid for, what he does outside of the company's premises is entirely his own business. He should sue for every penny he can get. Otherwise employers will have far too much power over employees' own time. It could get to the point where they won't hire amateur sportsmen for fear of having to pay them sick leave for sports injuries, or DIY enthusiasts in case they fall off the ladder. If you can do your job, why does it matter if (or even what) you smoke?      This is unfortunately not a new situation. A few years ago a worker was sacked for lighting a cigarette up in his car and he was pulling out of the company car park (which of course had a no smoking policy). I once worked for a very large utility company here in the UK that used to have a smoking room, which they then closed down. At lunch the staff would smoke outside on the company property, again the company asked them not to smoke on company premises. They really bit the biscuit when they tried to tell staff they couldn't smoke on the council owned pavement!      An employer has every right to choose whom he employs. He's going to pay the wages so why should he be expected to employ someone he sees as unsuitable, for whatever reason?       If the employer couldn't detect the stench of stale tobacco smoke on the man's clothes and on his breath, he wasn't interviewing him sufficiently. Those of us who don't want to have our environment polluted by this disgusting habit have every right to not associate with those who do. "

Don't they have any babies or OAPs (old age pigeons)? And where do they bury their dead? I've never seen any corpses in Trafalgar Square or any other square in any city.      Why are we still so fascinated by the so-called Roswell UFO incident and what is the latest official line on it. Why is it that whenever there is a dramatic event in the heavens, such as the meteor shower of Nov 18th, the sky is obscured by clouds?

Why does my Mum always manage to phone me when I have just sat down to eat my dinner? Has she a psychic link to my oven? Is this normal Mum behaviour?      Why does time go so fast when you are close to exams, why doesn't time always go slow, I see no reason for it to go any faster? We could enjoy the good times so much more?      If the universe is expanding and the universe is all there is, what is it expanding into?      To Len, Finland: The universe is not expanding *into* anything. You only expect the concept of ""expanding into"" because you are only familiar with situations in which space is a constant - where there is always ""space"" to ""expand into"". The fact is that the universe *is* space, and it therefore cannot both *be* space and expand *into* space at the same time. We have to think of the stuff outside of the universe like an equation or something else non-spatial, otherwise our minds will make these misconceptions.      Why do fast food outlets always forget your extra serving of supersized fries? And why is this not discovered until you're about two miles down the road?      How does a cow know it's not a butterfly dreaming it is a cow?      Why do people listen to grunge music?      If a tree falls in the forest, with no one around to hear, does it make a sound?      To Alison, UK: Sound is the interpretation of air waves (just like water waves, but in the air!) by a brain. The air waves are detected by an ear and translated into ""sound"" by the brain. If there is no ear with a brain within range, there can be no translation from the air wave into ""sound"". So in conclusion, if nobody is around to hear the tree, it makes no sound.      If a man is standing in the forest and he says something and there is not a woman there to hear him, is he still wrong.      Why do people stop everything to answer the phone? A client is interviewed when the phone rings, he/she is completely ignored while the other person answers the phone. Wouldn't it be fairer to have telephone appointments as well?

And why do they unfailingly wait until they've reached the front of a long checkout queue before trying to locate their money in the murky depths of a deep handbag?      Why does a toothache always happen on a Saturday or Sunday when all dentists are closed?      Toast always lands buttered side down. Cats always land on their feet. If you fix a slice of toast, butter side up, to the back of a cat, what happens when the cat falls to the floor? Some say it will spin rapidly just above the floor and can be used to make a perpetual motion machine.      If you strapped a buttered piece of toast to the back of a cat, would the two items hover?

Frank Hollis and Chris B - Thanks for answering my question. I'm glad you both actually understood what I was asking, since the other respondents clearly didn't. Does this mean that I can now claim to be related to Barbra Streisand?      If you work on the basis that your ancestors produced offspring roughly every 25 years so that every 25 years you go back the number of ancestors you have doubles (two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents etc.) then this means that 1,000 years ago you had 1,099,511,627,776 ancestors. If you go back much further then you'll have more ancestors than there are people on the planet. This doesn't seem logical but my head hurts when I try to think about it.      Terra from England: That conundrum was solved a long time ago. The reason there aren't more ancestors than offspring is because we share our ancestors with other people. Your brothers and sisters do not each have their own separate lineage, after all.      Eden Alvernaz, USA: That isn't what I was asking. I was talking about just my ancestors. If my ancestors double every 25 years you go back (and I don't mean cumulatively) then you'll end up with more ancestors than there were people on the planet.      To Terra: Eden did in fact answer your question. You do not have 'your' ancestors, as they are shared by a lot of other people. All families are 'old' families. You cannot separate out your ancestors from someone else's as they are shared. That is precisely why the numbers don't work out the way you say.      Terra - with regards to your ancestors - yes there would be more people than currently on the planet, however they are dead and did not live at the same time so do not make up a total of the population. The world is after all thousands of years old so there will be many many more people having inhabited the planet than currently live on it.      Terra, England. That's an easy one. As you trace your family tree back you'll find it crosses over regularly. So your mother and father may each have had the same great-great (repeat 10 times) -great grandfather. Indeed scientists have determined that we all share one particular individual as an ancestor - known as the 'Mitochondrial Eve'.      Terra, England: the answer to your question is inbreeding. By way of an example: if you take the population of a small and isolated island and theorise about the number of their ancestors 20 generations ago, you might find they should have been stacked 5 deep the length and breadth of the island. In-breeding across and between previous generations greatly retards the logarithmic increase in the number of our ancestors and helps us make the most of our available space!

Why do people stay on the middle lane of the motorway, doing 50 mph when the inside lane is empty?      When we travel, why do we go ""down South"" yet ""up to London"". And also why is there only one monopolies Commission?      In the early days of the railways the up line was the one to London, hence going up to London      I am always mystified at the immense lengths that some car drivers will go to, to gain a few seconds or take a short cut, but will make no effort at all to secure their children in the back of the car.

Why are people usually quiet in elevators?      Why does your new appliance always break down, two days after the warranty expires? And why does hot water freeze faster than cold water? Surely at some point the hot water will get to the same temperature as the cold and they will freeze at the same rate from that point on?      To Graham: Hot water has less oxygen, oxygen slows the freezing process      To Paul, it's got nothing to do with Oxygen content. H2O is H2O, the only difference between hot and cold is that in hot the H2O molecules are bouncing around much faster. Hot water freezes more quickly than cold water because if you place them in say, a fridge, there is a much steeper temperature gradient between the hot water and the fridge than between the cold water and the fridge. This causes a much more rapid heat transfer from the water to the fridge! It's got nothing to do with chemistry, its just thermodynamics.      To B Roberts, UK: The only portion of thermal dynamics involved in the hot water freezing first, is the extent of the hot water forming a temporarily melted bridge to the surrounding areas in which the containment vessel is in contact with. It therefore has a much more efficient transfer of thermal energy. Conduction vs. convection? I may be wrong.      To B Roberts: It is impossible for it to be true that something hot can freeze before something cold does. Just because the temperature gradient is steeper, it does not mean that it will reach the temperature quicker. By the logic you give, you would expect the reverse of this to be true too. A frozen meal should cook faster than a meal that has been kept in the fridge - because there is a greater temperature difference and therefore steeper gradient. This obviously does not happen!      To Graham, UK et al. Regarding the problem of hot water freezing faster than cool water. It's A-level physics. The solution is in the initially dominant form of heat transport, that is evaporation or conduction. If we use a thermally insulated open container then, initially, the dominant form of heat transport is evaporation.      The effect of evaporation is two fold, firstly the liquid cools, secondly the mass of liquid is reduced. The level of evaporation from a hot liquid is higher than from a cool liquid. So the hot liquid cools rapidly AND the mass of liquid is significantly reduced. On the other hand evaporation is low from the cool liquid, so the liquid cools slowly and maintains a relatively constant mass. As the mass of the initially hot liquid has been reduced it has proportionately less thermal energy to dissipate, so continues to cool at a faster rate. Thus hot water, under certain conditions, can freeze faster than cool water.      Why do outside news reporters adopt strangely affected intonations while those in the studio speak normally?      Toast fall butter side down because in the time it takes to fall from the desk to the floor it can only rotate 180?. If however desks were twice as high toast would land dry side down. Try pushing a piece of toast off with the buttered side touching the plate.      If exceptionally a slice of buttered toast falls on the floor buttered side up, does that mean that it was buttered on the wrong side?      If humans evolved from monkeys, why is it that monkeys still exist?      How come no-one has minted a 99p coin? Everything seems to cost #1.99, #2.99, 99p. Just think of the copper it would save.      We live in a world of starts and finishes, beginnings and ends, births and deaths. The world had a beginning so, apparently did the universe (big bang). But there must be an ultimate 'space' in which our universe exists that just 'is'. It didn't have a beginning and may not have an end. How can anything exist without being created from something bigger? This thought is totally baffling to me. My brain just cannot conceive the idea.      To Roger Sayer: the reality of this situation is quite depressing. Things do what they do and only what they do. Us humans perceive our surroundings in a way that has proved useful to our survival as the gene-vessels we are. Our function is not to understand all about the universe, at this stage of our development at least. No doubt a cat perceives things differently, has different concepts that it's mind will attempt to apply to what it perceives. The point is that we may never get an answer to our question, because like a cat wondering of the sun ""can i kill it?"", the difficulty lies in the unsuitability of the question. We may have come to a head in terms of our ability to understand the universe in our current state. Perhaps it is time to look at ourselves before we once again move forward ""out there""...      To Roger Sayer, USA, scientists and quantum physicists have been wrestling with that same problem; they refer to it as the turtle syndrome; the creation of the earth is one turtle sitting on top of another that was the big bang that sits on top of another that was an even bigger bang. However, the scientists and the physicists cannot get to the turtle at the bottom and guess what, some are starting to believe in a superior being that created everything.      Gerry, Scotland - any idea what created the supreme being? Another supreme being? To follow the ""turtle"" theory will scientists get to the supreme being at the bottom? Can't stop I'm about to try my paw at killing the sun.      Why do people stand by pedestrian crossings without pressing the button? And also, Gerry - nice stuff about the turtles. But where did the ""supreme being"" come from then?      To Jake Hadlee: That is a phenomenon generally observed in London. It's due to the fact that there is no discernible correlation between pushing the button and having the light change in the pedestrian's favour. Most of the crossings I've tested (yes on my own time without pay - I'm such a dedicated scientist) exhibit a seemingly random pattern of changing lights. The buttons are only there to give the pedestrians something to do while waiting for a break in traffic.      How is it that we can put a man on the moon, but back on planet earth we're reduced to clawing and shredding the first ten meters of the toilet paper roll?      Why do people have to ""spend"" more to ""save"" money?      Why can't I write my essay on time for once, instead of procrastinating by reading BBC Talking Point debates?      To Paul, UK, the answer is that humans did not evolve from monkeys but that they both evolved from a common ancestor. That is why monkeys are still around!      Hannah in Oxford asks why she can't write her essay on time for once instead of procrastinating by reading these debates. The answer is ""because she is human"". Never put off until tomorrow that which you can put off until next week.      Who finances scientists to conduct such meaningless research?      Why does food always stick to the non-stick pans when my mother-in-law is coming to dinner?      Why do cups always have the handle on the right-hand side?      And where can I get one of those baseball hats with a peak at the back?      Why I am able to fathom out the functions on a brand new remote control, operate a computer (and keep it perfectly maintained) and open a 'tetrapak' carton of milk without spilling any of the contents in a shorter space of time than a man...      If you can be disgruntled - can you be gruntled? Also - we have drive-thru cashpoints over here - why do the buttons also have braille on them?      Why is it more socially acceptable to be warm than to have fresh air e.g. sitting on a crowded, stuffy bus in the winter with all the windows shut? After all, we're all wearing our coats, aren't we?      Why do helicopter captains sit in the right (starboard) seat, while airplane captains sit in the left (port)?       When a stream of people are going through one half of a two-door entrance or exit, why do people wanting to go the other way stand by the closed door and wait for them? Am I really the only person alive with the sense to OPEN the remaining door and go through it? And when I do, why does everyone look at me as if I'm the idiot? "
HOC HOC-CS -1.5 " Flying is not 'statistically' a safe way to travel. It depends on how you interpret the statistics. If there were the same number of take-offs as car journeys, there would be thousands of deaths each day from plane crashes. Therefore each take-off is very 'risky'. The rate at which crashes occur has remained fairly steady for many years but the volume of traffic has increased many times over. So what does this mean? It means that as a person (unit) you are very unlikely to die in a plane crash indeed. Flying is still the safest way to travel by far!      I'm getting on a American Airlines flight in a few days, and yes I'm nervous about it. Whether this latest crash was terrorist or accident, the result is the same. I'm concerned about the job layoffs in the airlines business. Based on most union work labour rules, the ones laid off are the newest workers. Just because someone's been at a job the longest, does not by any means make them the best worker.      Flying is so very very safe, even these days. When boarding a plane, try to limit yourself to being as nervous as you would be when crossing the road - you'll feel better, although you'll still be worrying more than you should be!      It's the press that are making people more nervous by asking the question ""Are you more nervous to fly now than before Sept 11"" - it doesn't bother me.      Yes, I am now nervous of flying. Because my family are in another country I fly on a regular basis, but what is worse my daughter of ten is now frightened and has to hold my hand when we fly. It is sad to see the terror instead of happiness that used to be there before all this happened. Now, with America's new plane crash, it makes things worse.      Based on the evidence available, Monday's incident sounds tragic, but not intentional. It doesn't make me afraid to fly, because airplane crashes are astonishingly rare. My odds are excellent - far better than during my daily commute to work. I will continue to fly without trepidation, and I will continue to fly American Airlines.      Yes, I am even more scared of flying now than I used to be.. I think it will be a long time before I board a plane again and when I do I will have to be inebriated by alcohol but I would rather go by train, boat or car and take a lot longer to get there.      I think the situation has improved for flyers. Besides shorter check-in lines and possibilities of free upgrades, the dumb security questions have been revised for the better. At Heathrow recently, instead of being asked all the usual dull questions about whether someone had asked me to carry something, if the bag had been out of my sight etc etc, I was asked just one question instead: Have you got any sharp objects on you - blades, scissors etc? Naturally I replied no, and that evidently was sufficient. This means we don't all have to turn up so early for flights any more. What an improvement.      As for the old chestnut of flying being safe or not, the majority of your readers will not have had the enlightening experience of daily driving in Portugal, after which the worry of terrorists on airplanes becomes positively irrelevant.      I think that air transportation is safer now than it has been in the past, with the increased security measures both on the ground in airports and in terms of maintenance, as well as in the air. Airline travel will remain my first option for travelling, and American Airlines has now risen to the top of my list as my preferred airline. No one is going to take away my freedom to move around in this world. No one is going to get ""in my head"" and take away my freedom to feel comfortable with moving around in this world.      I fly at least 80 times a year on business and this issue is never far from my thoughts. It is often said, if not over quoted, that flying is the safest way to travel. This is a measure of people travelling against miles travelled and is a questionable statistic. A better way to look at it would be to examine survival rates in accidents and then you will get a truer, probably grimmer picture. I'm sure more people walk away from train or car wrecks than they do from airline disasters. There must be a way to increase survivability. Airliners themselves are testament to human ingenuity so why not invest in preserving lives? You don't need to be a genius to work that one out.      I'm flying from Bangkok to New Zealand today and have no qualms about it. We should realise that we are all suffering from a terminal illness called life and just accept that we're all gonna go sometime.      Will I ever fly again? Yes, I can't avoid it. But I will be wide awake, and will need a few more cups of coffee than usual. Hope the airlines don't cut back on that.      As I understand it, airlines in America successfully challenged tighter security measures suggested by the Clinton administration. The CEO of BA considers those who do not fly to be cowards and now I have just read that the plane that so tragically has just crashed in NY was unfit to fly - whether I am nervous about flying is irrelevant, I am beginning to form the impression that these companies do not deserve our money.      Flying will probably never be the same as it was prior to the attacks on the legendary Twin Towers and the Pentagon. As Phil, UK puts it best it ""is no more dangerous now than it was pre-11 September. Flying remains the safest way of travel; unfortunately, rare accidents do happen. Would I get on a plane tomorrow to go about my business? - Absolutely, and it would be on my favourite carrier, American Airlines.      Naturally it makes me a little nervy but just look at the statistics. How many more people are killed crossing a road in the UK than by an air accident? The reason these accidents are so well reported is because they are rare: unfortunately those who die in car piles ups do not make news. I'm travelling to Israel from the UK this Xmas. Wonder how good my chances are?!      Flying is no more dangerous now than it was pre-11 September. People are just more frightened.      If anything, things have changed slightly for the better! Prior to 11th September mechanical failures on aircraft were just as likely as they are now, and both government intelligence, and security at airports were, if anything, worse. Therefore, you have statistically a somewhat lower chance of being killed in an aircraft than you did before 11th September. Do you become progressively more frightened of driving every time there is a car accident reported?      This crash happened at a very bad time, when airlines are trying to recover from the 9/11 atrocity. Though tragic, this will not deter me from flying, either on business or for pleasure. But it reinforces my belief that airport authorities have to be more alert about who is employed and given access to aircraft.      What is wrong with our media - and why do we put up with it? Already it is being accepted that this was ""probably an accident, but tragic nonetheless"". An engine BLOWS OFF the wing of 767 out of NEW YORK two months after.. - you know the rest. The last thing American airlines, and the US want, is for people to think that people are scaling perimeter fences strapping explosives to engines - but does our free media have to tow their line? ""Sabotage until proven otherwise"" should be the attitude in the present circumstances.      Accidents do happen and can be very tragic at times. Let's not combine this with the problem of terrorism. All the same, a sense of fear and insecurity may have crept in the minds of the US citizens. But they have to rise to the occasion and put aside all the odds to get back to the normal lives as quick as possible.      I am not happy hearing news reports that security at most US airports is still conducted on either profiling or random searches. This makes me feel like they are taking chances with my life, as my safety will depend on the security personnel making the correct choices or worse yet, playing the odds game. I for one would not mind having to show up at the airport earlier if it meant that everyone going into that plane will be thoroughly searched, and that includes the maintenance crew, ground crew, plus anyone who may have access to any part of the planes. I am aware that this represents an inconvenience to the passengers and added cost to the airlines who will of course pass these on. However, I would rather pay more and be truly safe than save myself time or money and take higher odds with my life.      I would be more nervous about using JFK airport than flying as such. TWA crashed in 1997, Swissair crashed in 1998, EgyptAir in 1999 and American Airlines in 2001. All these major crashes departed from JFK which seems rather unlucky compared with other European and American airports.      There is no doubt that this will be devastating to airlines and will be another blow to passenger confidence. The critical thing is to determine whether initial reports that it was a genuine accident are correct. If so then, tragic as it is, it is a coincidence. For myself I have always hated flying but my holiday to the US is still going ahead. If fate calls my name at least it will catch me having fun rather than hiding from what might be.      I hope this is ""just"" another tragic, but rare, accident that afflicts the air travel industry from time to time - and not another terrorist outrage. Our sympathies go to all those who have lost family and friends. Even if it is an attack, I'm still going to fly. To quit is to give the terrorists what they want. The object of terror is to terrorise, to deter by any means, to stop your opponents from living a normal life - until they give you what you want. Don't let them win, America.      At Heathrow recently, instead of being asked all the usual dull questions about whether someone had asked me to carry something, if the bag had been out of my sight etc. (you know the drill), I was asked just one question instead; Have you got any sharp objects on you - blades, scissors etc. Naturally I replied no, and that evidently was sufficient. This means we don't all have to turn up so early for flights anymore. What an improvement. As for the old chestnut of flying being safe or not, I can only point out that the majority of your readers will not have had the enlightening experience of daily driving in Portugal, after which the worry of terrorists on airplanes becomes positively irrelevant.      Statistically, flying is still the safest way to travel. I am from London and am making a point of taking my next holiday in New York. I feel it is a good way to show support to the people there and defiance to the terrorists who are trying to ruin our way of life.      I am supposed to be going on holiday next summer but because of the recent air crashes I honestly don't think I'll be able to fly. I had a fear before - now it's worse.      I am flying to Israel tomorrow morning, and nothing is going to stop me. I mourn with the rest of the world for the airline tragedies - Sept. 11th, Queens this Monday, the Russian plane shot down by mistake - but, people, there have been awful accidents on boats (Titanic), rail (Hatfield) and every other means of transport. The only way forward is to continue as before, so as to prevent thousands from losing their jobs and adding to humanity's loss.      After the terrorist attacks in New York, I would say I am wary about using aeroplanes as a method of travelling. I never really was a regular user but it will make me consider using alternative methods of travel.       Not only will I continue to fly, I have specifically chosen to go to London for my vacation because of the support of the British people and government against the terrorists. One good turn deserves another. I REFUSE to give in to the terrorists and their tactics. See you in London! "
HOC HOC-CV -1.99 " It's all very well having shops throw on the decorations months in advance, but Christmas doesn't really begin until OUR decorations go up. Oh, and by the way, I love Christmas songs. May Slade and Wizzard forever play over the department stores tannoy! Yahoo!      I'm happy for Christmas to last longer - so long as its longer from Christmas Eve onwards. Instead Christmas gets cut short by THE SALES. Christmas surplus from flooding the market place. In my opinion shops should only be Chrimbo music and put up Chrimbo decorations for the period that advent calenders cover. However it would only be a matter of time before someone invented a 5 month advent calender.      Christmas starts as early as you want it too. Normally I wouldn't dream of buying pressies until December but due to work commitments I won't be able to do that this year. So I started on Nov 1st. I will still enjoy Christmas with my family and look forward to seeing their faces when they open the presents that I have chosen specially for them. That's the reason I love Christmas and if I could spend all year with my family in this way I would. Sadly its not possible but please don't deny me the anticipation that I feel      Yes, Christmas advertising does start a tad early, but this isn't what annoys me the most. The thing that annoys me the most about the commercialisation of Christmas is the way it is frequently referred to as 'Xmas'. Something that some of the writers to this talking point are guilty of, I might add! No wonder some people forget that we're meant to be celebrating the birth of Christ.      To Lucy, England. (and anyone else it might interest) Using the term Xmas in reference to Christmas is not in any way derisive. In very early Christian history, when some the first Christians were meeting secretly in the sewers underneath Rome out of fear of persecution, the symbol ""X"" was used to refer to Christ (an X referring pictorally to the cross he was crucified on). The early Christians used many pictograms to communicate with each other so as not to arouse the suspicion of the Romans, who treated them less than kindly for quite some time. So, when people use the shortened ""Xmas"", it's actual historical meaning is not an insult to Christianity.      I'm Eastern Orthodox, and for us Christmas lasts and lasts! We have lovely prayers and feasts and it is a very special time. None of us pay any attention to the shops. By the way, that 'X' in Xmas....stands for the Greek letter Chi, the first letter of the Greek word Christ.      I love Christmas, but it is spoilt by being started so early. This year I came back from holiday at the beginning of September and the shops were already starting with their decorations. It's just a ploy to get us to spend more and more at Christmas. I disagree that we need all that time to save up. There's no need to spend a fortune on presents, food and decorations. The most important thing is making time for the family and enjoying Christmas at the right time. It's much more fun to bake your own food and give small token presents you've really put thought in to. I also agree it's a shame that so many shops are in such a rush to take the decorations down, many of them do this on Christmas eve!      Christmas does come very quickly, it's expensive and cold but it's the best time of year and I think its time for shops to put up decorations now.      I don't think Xmas starts too early at all, in fact I just can't get enough of that great Slade song which should be played more often in all major department stores and pubs. What's wrong with everyone? The earlier Christmas is celebrated the longer we can party!      I don't know, the ""does Christmas start too early?"" season seems to get earlier every year....      My local supermarket had mince pies on the shelves at the end of August. I went shopping a couple of weeks ago and had to endure Christmas Carols as background music. Why??? Who buys mince pies in August???      I agree that Christmas starts much too early. The pressure to begin shopping and overconsuming comes from merchants and the commercial world. Corresponding with the earlier and earlier celebrations of the holidays is an increase in the so-called ""Christmas blues.'' Suicide rates are known to go up during the holidays. Is it the overkill of too much cheer doing this? I think so.      I think it's up to each individual or family to decide when to begin their pre-Christmas activities. The fact that the commercial work-up towards Christmas starts in Autumn doesn't compel us to participate: it just gives us a longer time-frame in which to get ourselves organised. Christmas is really for children and kids seem to enjoy the anticipation as much as they enjoy the event. You'll never hear a child complain about Christmas starting too early! So let's just grin and bear it, and not detract from their extended enjoyment!      I don't care how early it starts, so long as someone destroys all copies of that dreadful, ubiquitous Slade Christmas song. Please, please, can the shops stop playing it? It drives me nuts!      Yes, it does start too early, almost making one wonder why the word ""Christ"" is in the name. Perhaps they should replace ""Christmas"" with ""Commercemas"" as ""commerce"" is all the event seems to be about these days.      I think that for a while in the late 80's/early 90's, some shops were starting their Christmas displays in mid-September - even earlier than they do now. Christmas is very over-hyped. I'm much more in favour of the pagan calendar, which has a festival every 6-7 weeks (8 in total). That way, no single festival becomes too big.      This year in particular, it is not too soon to start focusing on Christmas. Firstly our retailers need as much lead time as possible to get consumers to spend. Secondly with all the doom and gloom about since September, we need something cheery. Thirdly, and this is a bit of a stretch, perhaps it will engender some early Christmas spirit. Looking through others comments though, a bit of a vain hope. Just remember, it's ""baby in the manger"", not ""dog in the manger"" at this time of year!      Christmas definitely starts too early. When I was a child, the season began after Thanksgiving (the last Thursday in November in the US). Now Halloween and Christmas items grace the stores together. I just saw a display of a witch and a Santa sitting side by side!      I think the premature and compulsory immersion into the festive season does detract from the ""special"" feeling I enjoy at Christmas time. There are plenty of online and specialty stores for those who want to get their Christmas shopping done early. For the rest of us, please let us enjoy the other holidays first. (Halloween, Firework night, Thanksgiving in USA). Another pet peeve, in the USA especially, is the rush to pull it all down after Christmas Day. The 12 days of Christmas should start on the 25th through Jan 6th! (or 24th - 5th depending on who you listen to).      The worst thing about Christmas is the pressure to spend money on presents, cards, decorations etc. At least with this being in the shops early it gives people chance to spread the cost over a longer time.      The shops lost me years ago - I stopped celebrating Christmas when I realized that it had absolutely nothing to do with religion, peace on earth, goodwill to men or anything else with which it used to be associated. So, if starting the hype in shops by the end of October is supposed to give me more time to spend money on Christmas shopping, it's not working. I can't be the only person who has given up on the holiday completely - I think retailers are shooting themselves in the foot by this ""in your face"" behaviour. I don't do Halloween, Easter, Valentine's Day, St. Patrick's Day, Mother's Day, Father's Day or any other festivals which exist solely for the benefit of retailers, either.      Christmas is one of the most wonderful times in the year. All these lights, decorations, songs and tradition. I love this and I still have the illusion of a white Christmas full of happiness and freedom. But when I go into shops and see gingerbread at the beginning of September I could loose the joy for Christmas! It's awful! From my point of view we should remember Christmas as a family feast with less presents but more love and understanding!      My grandmother, who was born in 1896, once told me that her family and contemporaries did not even put up their Christmas trees until Dec. 24, then removed them prior to Dec. 31. Although they worked on handmade gifts prior to this, sometimes for month, the actual celebration of Christmas was not stretched out until it became an ordeal. Few cases of Christmas blues were ever noticed; no doubt because lonely people only had one or two days, not months, to reflect on their situation.      I think that Christmas is more of a cultural holiday than a religious one. We cannot deny its pagan roots and I think that it is important to have such a holiday that expresses our cultural roots just as much as our religious ones. I think that maybe it is good for our economy to start Christmas early. I think that people should just buy things for the kids and keep it simple. I for one have a huge family and it always puts a dent in my wallet. This makes my favourite holiday hard to enjoy. I am not a Christian and do not celebrate Christmas as a Christian holiday. I think it should be more a time to enjoy family and teach our kids about our European heritage.      Each time I visit a shop that has put its Christmas decorations out prior to December I like to point out to them my displeasure at this abuse of the Christian festival. These days of course this means complaining in almost every shop.      Give me a break. I'm still buying fireworks!      Having seen Christmas decorations in a shop at the end of August in Lymington, yes it does start too early! Let's get Halloween and Bonfire night over and done with before the decorations go up - preferably mid-late November. It takes all the fun (and magic) out of Christmas. Also, can magazines please stop advising us to ""stock up on milk and perishables"". Don't they realise that most shops (big and small) open for a few hours on Boxing Day? The amount of food, particularly bread and milk, that I see being bought by panicking idiots would be enough to keep an average family well-fed for a month!      Count yourself lucky - I just heard that Luton Council are planning to restrict Christmas and make it part of a weak merger of other religious festivals. It won't be an official individual event anymore. I bet people there would rather have it starting in November rather than not at all!! This country is a strange place of contradiction...      I think the earlier the better! At a time of year when it's dark, gloomy and cold, it's lovely to have something to look forward to. I'm sure that Christians wouldn't mind the reminders of Jesus' birth being sent out a bit earlier either!      I can't believe it! Commerce has actually killed Christmas. It's no fun anymore and it's a big stress for everyone. Well, I'm not stressing out this year. I'm spending all my cash on really good food and drink instead of tacky decorations and useless presents that no-one wants. I'm going to hold several large parties. If my guests really feel they have to bring gifts, let it be something worthy - wine.      I don't have a problem with people celebrating Christmas, but I do have one with the pretence of the whole event. Let's face it, it is nothing more than a huge marketing ploy to get people to spend vast amounts of money on things that they don't really want to buy. And the most annoying part is that you can't opt out - however much you try to do so Christmas is always shoved down your throat. Miserable Scrooge? No, I just happen to think that there are more important things in life than SHOPPING!      I know someone who used to work for Cadbury. Whilst the Xmas stuff is in the shops, they are making Easter eggs. In my opinion, Christmas is much more special when stuff is in the shops for just a month.      Yes Christmas does start too early, I went shopping on Saturday only to find Halloween costumes mixed with Christmas goods, how confusing. Also shops seem to get their items in early every year. It shouldn't start until the end of November, early December at the earliest.      I think if we shortened the holiday and ignored the commercial aspects of it, Christmas could once again be a welcomed and meaningful event. Anyone for joining me in a strike against the pressures to buy Christmas gifts early and often?      They can start putting the decorations up in April if they want but I'll still wait until mid December until I do my shopping. Like most people I've got far too much going on in my daily life to concern myself with Christmas shopping.      I used to be peeved at the sheer absurdity of Christmas ads in shopping centres, until it hit me. The truth! Don't celebrate it until you're ready. Do it at your own pace. And remember those who really don't know the freedom to choose!      If you don't like Christmas, don't celebrate it! It is then neither early nor late.      Yes, it does start too early, but big stores have shareholders to answer to and they don't have any choice - they have to bleed it for every last penny. And that means starting early.      As a foreigner, I was surprised to see that there were already Christmas ads in October in the UK. In France, what I would call the Christmas campaign starts in November. One of my professors, who is British, told us that in his opinion the French are more attached to the tradition related to Christmas than the British. He holds the view that Christmas in Britain is much more commercial than in France.      Back in the 70s the Christmas season started after Thanksgiving, that's when the decorating and the shopping began. Three weeks were enough for me. Now since the retailers rely on the holiday season for a third of their yearly revenue, the madness starts before Halloween. That is a little too much for me to stomach, with it all being shoved down our throats.      Christmas definitely does start too early. But is it my imagination, or has it started slightly later this year as a result of the World Trade Centre attacks? I'm sure we've seen Christmas decorations in shops by September in previous years.      A month ago whilst on my way to work, I spotted an outrageously fully-dressed kitsch Christmas tree... tinsel, fairy lights, the works... not in a shop, but in a house. It was not the season to deck the halls... it was not the season to write Christmas cards... it was not the season to be jolly... Bah humbug!      The commercial aspect of Christmas definitely starts far too early as does Halloween and firework sales. The Christmas lights in Chorley were starting to be put up by the council at the beginning of October.      Christmas does seem to start earlier and earlier. I think it's funny that Christmas decorations start to appear BEFORE Halloween. Businesses are planning Christmas ""specials"" earlier and earlier to try to make up for the lack of spending that has been occurring. (Although the same thing happened when the economy was good). I do not agree with forcing Christmas spending on people, but I hope that the Christmas ""spirit"" helps to alleviate some of the stress people are feeling about the ""war"" on terrorism.      I'm betting most people who don't start shopping until mid December don't have many people to buy for. As my husband and I are both blessed (or cursed!) with large families, we can only cope with buying presents for 40 people by starting in early November, it takes us most of December just to wrap them.      Christmas wouldn't start this early in the shops if people didn't buy the goods. People prefer to blame business rather than themselves.      Not only does it start too early, it also drags on until mid-January. BAH! HUMBUG!      Yes it does start too early. One large department store in Basel put decorations up in mid-October in the children's department. Thankfully most of the other shops don't start until mid-November.      As a Muslim, I'd been brought up with the idea that Christmas was a religious holiday for Christians. Yet the material aspects seem much more important than the spiritual ones. That is a shame really. If I understand the Christian view of Jesus correctly, he wouldn't have approved of any of this at all.      Well, I personally like to see the decorations when I go shopping in a mall but then again I do not feel pressurised to buy anything - I just enjoy the decorations! Of course, in the US, they don't go overboard until after Thanksgiving at the end of November. Right now it's turkey time!      Spare a thought for the poor retail staff - they'll have the Easter eggs in the stores' warehouses before they even put their sprouts on. Just think how long they've been gearing up for Xmas already. And do you really think they'll be allowed to take the holiday leave to make a week of it up to New Year?      Last year in Cardiff, shops were taking down the Christmas decorations a week before Christmas to put up details of the January sales (which were starting on Boxing Day ?). Ultimately all they will end up doing is watering down the ""event"" into a non-event.      I have 2 children and for me the only way to get them presents they like is for me to start to save up in September so as Christmas comes closer I have enough for their presents and the other things that you need. So for me the Christmas season starts bang on time.      We have a culture that militates against enjoying Christmas. As a nation we work too hard, do too much commuting, come home and metaphorically kick the cat; TV tries to sell us and our kids stuff that we don't want or need, and probably the most long-lived toy is the box the thing came in. CANCEL CHRISTMAS!      Christmas has been so destroyed by commercialism and is so stressful as a result that I start dreading it towards the end of August. The fact that cards and calendars start appearing right after Labour Day (early September) doesn't help. If only there was no sign of Christmas clutter until Advent (end of November)!      I suppose it does start too early. The xmas street decorations are already being put out here, and there's been xmas stock in the shops since mid-October. But on the other hand its nice to have a bit of glitter around as the nights are drawing in, and the longer xmas puddings are in the shops the better!      I enjoy Christmas but I resent the fact it is rammed down my throat for three months before the festival actually arrives. Please, get rid of the constant Xmas-muzak in the shops, and don't put the decorations up until December!      As a boy in the 1960's, I used to love Christmas - it never seemed over-busy and I think my parents enjoyed it too. Nowadays, bang on queue, as soon as the clocks go back, we start the Great Shop. Of course it is a personal issue, but the hype seems increasingly unavoidable. Helen, UK is perfectly right - we are all fodder for the marketing boys - they have us eating out of their hands and the worst thing is, we know exactly what they are doing. And don't get me started on children's TV adverts on Saturday mornings!      Christmas does not start too early but 'Shoppingmas' does. The most widely practiced religion in the UK is now 'Shopping'.     What? Christmas already??? Hang on, it is only just November.... Yes it does start too early.      I think Christmas starts far too early. By the time it actually gets here I'm usually heartily sick of it all and can't wait for things to get back to normal!      We as consumers can do something about this. If I receive anything in the post telling me about 'Christmas special offers' before the second week of December, it goes straight in the bin. If everyone did this, perhaps the marketing reptiles would think again.      Christmas is not about how much money you spend or how many presents you give and receive. For me Christmas is about stopping for a couple of days, spending time with family and friends and relaxing. I really don't care if I get expensive presents or cheap presents, I prefer to consider the thought that went into it. One of my all-time favourite presents cost less than #10.       I have a toddler. It's wonderful - he's just old enough to appreciate all the excitement and celebration, and not yet old enough to understand the advertising pressure or to demand the latest fad toy. Long may it last! I'm really looking forward to Christmas this year! "
HOC HOC-DS -0.76 " Good news for females taking up insurance for the first time. After that insurance is loaded according to personal history so if the boys (of all ages) could grow up a little they just might be able to get better deals.      Well. It has finally been proven then. Women are better drivers. I have thought this for some time now. There is just one thing that bothers me though. If, just for the sake of argument, it was the other way around, would the insurance company get away with over-charging women? I seriously doubt it.      I've had two accidents in the last two years - both of which I claimed for and both of which were caused by male drivers...      It all smacks off discrimination to me. There is a clear case of gender discrimination. If they are going to only supply insurance to safe drivers, then I am safe and male. Why should a dangerous female driver get cover and not me? I wouldn't disagree with their claim but how can they get away with their policy, or should we apply it to other areas? For example, I bet statistics prove men are taller than women on average, so perhaps a shop where all the shelves are at seven feet level, and even if you are a short man they can get stuff down for you, but refuse service to women. I don't think women would put up with it.      Oh dear, the male ego has taken a bashing and is getting in a 'huff'. Facts have been released that women have less accidents than men. This makes them safer on the road. End of story. Men seem to deem the road as theirs and take great offence at the knowledge that women drive better, it's quite comical really. You're not the 'King of the Road', so just live with it.      Having narrowly missed being knocked off my motorcycle by both male and female drivers I would say that there is still room for improvement in both.      At the end of the day I don't think women are any better drivers than men and vice-versa. But I have noticed over the years certain traits among all drivers. Young drivers tail gate and drivers in their 30s and 40s in company cars overtake recklessly. Those in large cars look upon those in smaller cars as a sub-species and the ones who wear hats whilst driving are totally unaware of what is happening around them. Women drivers tend not to let you out of a side turning.      Women safer than men? Utterly preposterous. Women will never make good drivers because they lack spatial awareness. Since prehistoric times men have been genetically programmed to be aware of their surroundings whilst moving at speed. Failure to do so would mean being eaten by sabre-toothed tigers or the like. This is what makes them superior behind the wheel. Women on the other hand are much more comfortable at home in the cave, keeping the fire going. Having women on the road simply leads to more accidents as they are so unpredictable, and this phenomenon gives the insurance companies the leverage to push up everybody's premiums and increase profits. By appealing to the vanity of women in suggesting they are better drivers they are simply ensuring that their shareholders will benefit from increased payouts.      Men who say that women are more comfortable at home in the cave, rather than behind a wheel, should be given raw dinosaur for their tea.      Bernard, UK, refers to women driving in ""less challenging conditions"". Presumably he hasn't seen a school run recently. But when it comes to parking, give me a man any day.      I don't know about the UK, but women in the USA sure don't drive more cautiously or slower than men. I'm far from being a timid driver, but I can't remember how many times women have screeched by me while talking on a cell phone or, God forbid, putting make-up on at the same time! They also are poor in the art of road etiquette and are often quite ignorant.      Women are only better drivers when they are in the passenger seat.      So, ""most men"" lean on their horn and shout abuse do they? This is as sexist as saying most women go crazy once a month. I have found that the goon who drives six inches from my rear bumper is typically male while the goon who regard pulling into the middle lane of a motorway at 50mph is typically female. I haven't seen the statistics but have to wonder how they would look if all accidents were considered and if the lunatic fringes were removed. I would also like to see how many insurance companies would risk the wrath of the 'cry sexism brigade' if they offered better prices to men.      This not it not the correct answer. It is a driver's habit, for both, men and women. I noticed both using mobile phones while driving and that caused accidents. I am deaf a person and don't use mobiles. I drive very carefully and usually take my hearing dog with me to work. Both men and women speed, that's what I noticed in all those years.      I believe women drivers are more careful than male drivers and so have fewer accidents. I think men are more aggressive drivers who will speed more and take more risks. Male drivers also seem to need to react to female drivers. I'm a female driver of a soft-top sports car and I either get male drivers pulling up along side and trying to talk to me. Often they have no idea of what you look like and I have enjoyed several occasions when they've pulled up, looked across at my car and been greeted by a stare from my 60 year old Mother. They also try to race you away from the lights to prove that they can drive their family Ford better then you can drive a sports car. I suggest, when women drive badly they do so because they are pushed to it by pushy male drivers!!      Tracey's point is funny. So if men drive erratically it's due to raging testosterone but if women do the same it's due to intimidation by men? Personally I care little if someone wants go faster or slower than I do but get annoyed by two main groups of drivers. Those that tailgate - especially at speed and in dodgy conditions - and those that dawdle - ie doing 45 in the middle lane of a motorway. In my experience men and women are equally represented in both of my ""idiot"" categories so I'd have to say there was no meaningful difference between the genders.      I bet if you look at the actual statistics you will find that insurance premiums for women are cheaper, but it does not mean they have less accidents, for they do have more per capita. However, the accidents are far less serious, resulting in cheaper insurance payouts. Yes, they are safer.      The statistics imply that any woman driver is better and safer than any man behind the wheel, but that is simply not true. It may be true on the whole, but not necessarily on a one-on-one basis. I think bad driving is more down to the individual than the result of any gender differences. After all, driving really has little to do with the hormones you are born with.      If better is measured in terms of number of accidents then yes. However they are usually more cautious because they often seem to lack confidence behind the wheel, and this can lead to them driving slowly and being hesitant - to the great annoyance of other drivers. Mind you, with the intimidating behaviour of many male drivers it is not surprising they lack confidence.      I dislike driving, always have done, and I can't imagine our roads getting easier from now on. However, I'd feel substantially safer if the drivers around me were all women. I know this because my missus tells me often enough.      The insurance statistics do not lie, and my observations during my 15000 miles per year support them. I accept that there will always be some exceptions. Young male drivers are the worst, and a disturbing number of them do not lose their dangerous tendencies as they grow older. The ""bad women drivers"" myth is as false as the ""dangerous old drivers"" myth. The problem is that both of these groups are highly susceptible to intimidation by bully boy males.      On the road women are generally more cautious and less aggressive. Men undoubtedly display overtly aggressive behaviour and guard ""their"" territory more fiercely. I drive around 1000 miles every week and I get to observe driver behaviour in all weathers and traffic volumes. The more traffic around and the worse the weather conditions, the more dangerous most male drivers become because they do not adjust their driving style - hence the number of motorway concertina accidents.      Women are certainly safer drivers; but that is because they take fewer risks: they rarely drink and drive; rarely go above the minimum recommended speed applicable to the road conditions, tyre conditions, visibility etc; and rarely get distracted by a really sexy girl, whilst listening to some blaring music on super car stereo. But are women better drivers? I think not.      I don't care for which sex is the better driver as long as we all drive carefully and avoid causing accidents.      Women have less accidents per year which is all the insurance companies are interested in, as they use yearly premiums, but women also drive far less on average than men during a year, and drive less in more challenging conditions (rush hour, motorway etc). Per mile driven men have less accidents, which is surely the real measure of ""safety"".      If the evidence bears it out, then it must be accepted as true. So much for gender stereotypes. I'm sure further research will fail to explode the supposition that men are better cooks than women.      Women are safer drivers. They drive at lower speeds and thus cause less serious accidents than men, fact. However the question raised was are they better drivers not safer drivers? How many female formula one drivers are there? None. Why is that? Because men are better drivers.Women submit less claims. That is true. Do they give figures on how often women drive away from minor bumps with unattended vehicles? If they could measure actual accidents rather than claims submitted I have a suspicion the statistics would not be quite so favourable. Personally I prefer to judge each individual on their own merit and not on some demographic of their sex.      Yes it is true- at last it has been made official!!Most women drivers do not speed (so much so that they have to slam on their brakes!) , rev their engines, drive nose to tail, shout abuse, lean on their horns, etc,like most men do. For some unknown reason men seem to think that all of the above will get them to their destination quicker. Women are simply more careful when driving and that is a fact. This is the reason why our insurance is lower. Please men make the roads safer for all of us-just calm down and keep your distance!!      I believe that women are safer than men but we do seem to trust them! If you look at cars with couples or families driving, 8 out of 10 times the man is driving. In my household it is because I can't stand the constant ""passenger driver"" antics - playing with the radio, pointing out lanes with (supposedly) less traffic or the reminders that it's time to change into another gear. It would be nice to believe that in other cars it's simply because the man's a better driver!      If better means safer, then yes women are better. Its about attitude, probably due to confidence in one's ability. Women are shown to have significantly more accidents in manouvres and parking. For men it's when they're overtaking and on bends.      Women have less accidents than men - but above all the accidents are less serious. Women drive slower and more carefully. And they drink less when they know they have to drive.      There's plenty of research that shows that in any normally distributed population, men appear at both ends. In other words, the very best drivers are more likely to be men and so are the very worst.      I've never been beaten pulling away from the lights so I think I'm a better driver than most men.      Sad to think that there is even a need for this discussion. There are indeed good drivers and poor drivers - what does it matter what sex they are? Haven't we got beyond the ""I am Tarzan, you are Jane"" phase yet? Political correctness obviously hasn't quite filtered through. I like to think of myself as competent (don't we all?), but that doesn't mean to say that I don't commit faults whilst driving. We all do. Mind you, I don't get much opportunity living in a country where women aren't allowed to drive!      Women might make mistakes, but only men seem to make a virtue out them.      I have seen women on the M25 cutting up as many people as men (in fact one drove from the outside lane across 3 lanes of fast moving traffic and down a slip road) and I have also seen a woman almost mount the pavement because she was yakking on a mobile phone. Once or twice I have been driving at 40mph in an appropriate zone and been overtaken by one. Women aren't better than men. Men aren't better than women. There is only one distinction and that is good drivers and bad drivers and we all fall into at least one of those categories at one point in our driving careers. Let's stop the argument now, eh?      With men it's a pride 'thing'. Take parking for example. If a woman tries to get into a tricky spot and can't then she's just a typically bad woman driver, but if a man does the same thing, then it's ""bad luck mate, that was a tricky space to get into"" Just as in the workplace, women have to try twice as hard than men and constantly have to prove themselves.      Women do have lower premiums but they lack the confidence that men seem to have. Although men drive crazy most of the time they appear more confident. But does this make them better drivers? On the whole if it's one or the other then yes, it does.       Sure women are better drivers. They've had a lot more practice - driving men to drink, up the wall, round the bend etc. "
HOC HOC-EF 0.22 " Interestingly, I've heard many of my fellow Americans say that they no longer will work the extra hours that are expected by employers in this country. Many people have been reminded, in the most horrifying manner, of the importance of family and friends, and the ephemeral nature of success.      Life has gotten to normal for me, but at my college, one professor who teaches a political science course has been going nuts. She has been yelling at or cutting off students who disagree with her views, or who suggest that she read the international press or any news regarding the US's treatment of the Middle East. I wonder if she is even fit to teach at such a diverse college that also includes Muslim students? I'll just say with all due respect that I'm glad I don't look Arabic. I wouldn't be able to stomach the way they are being treated at the moment.      I don't think that the media want life to return to normal. This has been a very exciting time for them: talk of war, terrorists, special forces, rebel fighters, good versus evil - ripping! How could they now stand to return to boring subjects like the new Tory shadow cabinet, foot-and-mouth, fixing the NHS, and London Underground?      The innocent population of Iraq has been bombed weekly for the past ten years. Just how normal do you think their life is? The tragedy in New York was splashed in the media all around the world, and had a high impact in that sense. 1.5m Iraqis have died but everyone has still managed to lead a normal life here in the West, due to the ignorance of the crimes their governments commit.      We will return to normal once we have won the war.      Life is far from getting back to normal for those people living in the Middle East - its only just beginning for them. Its a shame that it has taken such an evil act for the world to wake up to its long forgotten values swept away by the powers of capitalism and all its fallout. Perhaps America will now adopt a fairer foreign policy based upon traditional morals and not just helping countries (e.g. Kuwait) out where it stands to gain oil.      Is life getting back to normal? I think so. These message boards are a good indicator. Last week, the UK citizens and the US citizens seemed like a family uniting. Now, its back to the petty bickering with each other! God Bless the UK and the US.      I hope we never get back to normal. We need to hone the edge of awareness and maintain our unity, which is needed more than ever. We need to educate ourselves as to the potential danger that we are finally aware of after all these years asleep at the wheel. Bin Laden just bit our country, now we're going to take a big bite out of him!      The world is obviously shaken by what has happened. America took the full brunt of the attack, but the tremors have been felt all over the world. The graphic horror on our TV sets, global recession, and an uncertain future all give rise to the fact that times are changing. Things will not be the same, but we need to establish a new level of normality, that will still allow us to go about our everyday lives.      Normal? I don't think so. When there is talk of truck bombs, mobilizations and bio-warfare on every newscast this is not getting back to normal. This is perhaps the second most dangerous time for the US since the Cuban Missile Crises.      I live in New York City. I watched the twin towers burn. I still have no long distance phone service at home and the phone service at work in Manhattan is still hit and miss. The city is still covered with ""missing person"" posters. Every siren makes me cringe. Subway service is still not normal and lower Manhattan still smells of smoke. Nearly everyone I know can tell a story of someone they've lost to the tragedy. So in answer to your question: no, life is most definitely not back to normal. I can only pray that it ever will be for those of us who reside in New York.      I think the prospect of a return to normality is scary. I attend college in upstate NY, and here there are flags hanging everywhere and patriotic speeches printed out and hung on doorways, but everyone seems to be forgetting the attacks that occurred on September 11. They've gone back to their studies, or their parties and their alcohol and forgotten almost entirely about what happened. Watching a movie the other day there was a shot of the Manhattan skyline, with the twin towers still intact. Only I and one other person reacted to this, in a room of seven people. I think the fact that the other people in the room didn't react says that things are getting back to normal, but I fear we are doing so at the expense of forgetting the devastation of the attacks. That in itself is a scary prospect.      When my four-year-old daughter sees an airplane, she still asks if it will fly into a building. Trying to explain to her why someone would purposefully do this without tainting her young mind with hatred is next to impossible. Mercifully, she doesn't yet understand the concept of ""war"". I worry about the world she will grow up in - it will certainly be different than the world of my childhood.      The world was turned upside down on 11th September, and I'm still struggling to right it. I grew up fearing a nuclear attack from Russia. Now we are working together. I grew up secure in the knowledge that good would always prevail. Now I fear evil. I grew up believing that I should love my multi-cultural, multi-national neighbours. Now I am suspicious. Does that mean these terrorists were successful? No. They failed. Because I've started attending church again; I've started reading newspapers from around the world in an effort to understand a perspective other than America's; and I've started smiling at Muslim people on the street because I suspect they are hurting as much or more than I am at this time. I guess good does have a way of overpowering evil after all.      Getting back to normal to me means that every time I now pass a restaurant in our town I will know that the head terrorist once ate lunch there. He probably even passed me on the streets. It is hard for me to trust anyone anymore and even the littlest noises bring out more terror. Just last night, another warped person called in a bomb threat and stopped rush hour traffic on a three mile bridge connecting the city to the north of us. It took three hours for them to declare it a hoax. Even living now with mosquitoes since the dusting planes are not allowed to fly seems such a minor sacrifice compared to what others have gone through. We Americans now know what your world has been like. There is no ""terrorist frontier"" anymore. God bless America, and God bless us all.      Since 1812 when the British burned our White House we've not worried about invasion from outside. We're protected by two wide oceans to the East and West, and two friendly neighbours on our North and South. Oh, it was good to feel safe. War happened in Europe, Africa, Asia, not here. Have things returned to normal? If anyone in my country thinks they have, I have a bridge in Brooklyn you might want to buy,      It will take years for life in the United States to return to 'normal'. Today a small fire in my States Capitol spanned the channels on Television - a few months ago it would have been the third or fourth story in the nightly news line up. But most of the city was evacuated over a blown transistor. The world is on a high state of alert bordering on paranoia, and I do not see an end to this paranoia coming any time soon.      I don't think things in the USA will ever be as they were before September 11th. But in the darkness of the situation there has also been a chance for us to reflect on what's important in our lives. Walking through the city last weekend I looked at the skyscrapers and thought for the first time how vulnerable they looked. I'll never see the skyline the way I used to.      I don't think that life is ""getting back to normal"" just yet. I think it's going to take a while - maybe even years. One thing is certain, at least for me: I have every intention of getting on an airplane this December and spending Christmas in Europe with my girlfriend. As far as I'm concerned, the terrorists haven't won a damn thing as long as I keep the attitude that to me there's no strangers in the world, but rather people I haven't met yet.      I awake every morning to the sounds of army supply planes taking off from a nearby Air Force base. This hasn't been heard since the Gulf War. If America persists in believing things will once again be normal if we can avenge the destruction of the World Trade Center with more senseless killing in Afghanistan, then ""normal"" is a long time in the future.      What is normal? If normal is terror in the world, natural disasters, human suffering, people homeless, people hungry and dying, peace being prayed for and fought for in the name of religion, or government interference in foreign policies to suit their own agenda then yes, we are back to 'normal'.      I don't think life will get back to normal for a long time. Before September 11 the world seemed like such a big place. That has all changed. My world now seems very small and not in a good way. There is also the point that politicians keep warning us about further attacks or worse, chemical or biological assaults. Our world has changed and I wonder if life will ever be ""normal"" again.      What is normal? Here in the UK I have lived my life knowing that at any time, anywhere, an IRA bomb could explode. We know here that there is a very fine line between a freedom fighter and a terrorist and it will never change. There will always be a cause to fight for what is right in their eyes and wrong in ours. America has had its time of peace, protected its turf, but to an extent been blind to the possibilities of deaths by terrorist acts. But the world is much smaller in the information age and the horrors that I have had to live with throughout my adult life have moved continents.      If ""normal"" is where we were before September 11, then I hope we never go back there. From a worldview, our normal was very abnormal. We gave value to that which is fast, cheap and easy. We considered it a crime to be inconvenienced and a sin to be uncomfortable. We had a voracious appetite for food, fuel and entertainment. On September 11, we became part of the real world. Our leaders tell us now that we must get back to normal, or the terrorists will have been victorious. I believe that every painful event in our lives is full of lessons. If this event changes us as individuals and as a nation then all the better. We have already discovered that when we re-examine our values, re-arrange our priorities and re-assess our responsibilities, we have tremendous power. If we can channel that power to our communities, our country and our planet then we will have turned this horrific event into a victory for humanity.      We're often told that ""things will never be the same again"" - after the Omagh bombings, the death of Princess Diana and historically of course during the world wars. In all cases, life does get back to normal. If it didn't we wouldn't be human. I hope that we take forward the lesson from the World Trade Centre attacks that we need to work together as a global community to root out terrorism, but also to live together. A positive response to the plight of the Afghan refugees is a great start.      Just thank God you don't live in Afghanistan. Ask them if things are getting back to normal.      Mercifully like many others, I have remained directly unaffected by this act of brutal terrorism. However ignorance leading to complacency is a dangerous thing. We would be wise to be on our guard. One way or another things won't be the same whether we like it or not. I guess the key is to be vigilant and at the same time pray that NYC will be last of such mindless violence.     I truly believe that this tragic incident has positive effects too. Are we not told that good will be stronger than evil? I am convinced that many good things are happening in people's hearts and lives right now. I want to treasure everyone around me a lot more and make use of the time I have with others instead of staying isolated ""doing my own little thing"". I believe that every single deed of love - however small - counts against the powers of hate and violence.      How can you get on with normal life when everywhere you look you see things advertising more attacks, biological warfare and nuclear bomb attacks?      We've had terrorist bombs already this summer and still life goes on. You get up go to work, take the tube etc because you still have to pay your rent, council tax and other expenses. The only thing that's been different for me since 11 September is the amount of nightmares I have been having. I have yet to have a single proper night's rest and I put a lot of this down to the imagery we see on TV and the incessant frenzy that the media have been stirring up with ""war is imminent"" etc      I stood on the subway last night on the way home with a group of people talking about the US response to the attacks. I then looked around and saw the faces of a couple of Middle Eastern people - what must they be thinking? I felt like just asking the people chatting to just stop and change the subject. This must be a really hard time for the average Middle Eastern immigrant here.     I work at Canary Wharf, where many people both knew someone involved in NYC and who worked here at the time of the IRA bomb. Life goes on as normal, albeit with a heightened level of security - but then we're used to seeing security and police patrols here.      If you don't go on with normal things, then the terrorists have won. We were all shocked by what happened, but life - at least for those unaffected - must go on. As a side point, I don't remember these questions being raised after Lockerbie, at the time of the IRA bombs in Manchester, or even when the WTC was bombed several years ago. We need to move away from the media ""hype"" and speculation surrounding this horrible event and its possible consequences. Yes, there may be another attack, but there may be another IRA attack too. We can't go on sitting around being depressed!      Being so close to the Oklahoma bombing, this incident brings up so many memories. I know from experience that it will take years before NYC will be restored to its former self. I know the bombsite must look like a war zone. I also know that TV does not do justice to the true extent of the damage caused. I am trying to get my life back to normal. But a sadness pervades when I see reports showing people from the Middle East who believe we are the real terrorists.      For those of us not directly involved with New York and DC, I'd say life is getting back to normal. I still wake up in the morning, go to work, face rush hour traffic, rude drivers, and road rage. I still go home in the evening, feed the cats, and try figure out what I want to make for dinner. I'm even beginning to think about starting my Christmas shopping. It seems cold, but life goes on, even though for many who have lost loved ones, it seems as if the universe should stop, just for a little bit.      I don't feel life will get back to normal until the Government makes clear exactly how it is protecting British people at the moment. I have nothing but anxious questions. Are people still wandering at will into the Channel tunnel? Why are so many vicious and known terrorists and supporters of terrorism living freely in Britain? Why haven't those Islamists wanted by Egypt for the Luxor attacks been arrested and deported to stand trial?      Tony Blair has (rightly) made it clear that he intends to protect ordinary British Muslims from attack, but what about the rest of us? Can we have some clear answers, please? Without these reassurances of decisive action here at home, any terrorist attack on British soil seems likely to make a tense situation murderous.      After black Tuesday, life can never be normal again. Things may seem to get normal, but how can anyone forget, even for a moment, that no one is completely secure anymore.      I don't see how anyone's life could possibly be back to normal: 1) A war is looming in the Middle East. 2) the economy is grinding to a halt. 3) our civil liberties are going to be eroded in an attempt to prevent/detect terrorist communication. We can continue to live our lives as best we can, and I for one intend to do so. But life is not ""back to normal"".      I have grown up in London with a constant and very real threat of terrorism, but I have never thought twice about going about my daily business. You cannot change your life for fear of terrible things happening. Americans will learn to adjust, and being ""vigilant"" will become a normal part of everyday life as it is here.      The everyday lives of my people have returned to normal. Our hearts and minds have not. There is a battle lust there now. The only thing that will feed it, is Bin Laden in the final embrace of Old Sparky.      It's certainly not back to normal as far as the media is concerned. The daily broadsheets are still devoting 10-12 pages a day to the ""war on terrorism"" even though nothing much seems to be happening. How much longer can they keep this up? BR>     Living near Stansted airport, I can assure you that it only took 2 days before ""things got back to normal"" - one plane a minute buzzing over my head without a care in the world.      The major influence it has had on my life has been the large amounts of stories in the media. Like most people, I will only fly a few times a year at most, and so any extra delays will be a relatively small time in my year. As for being able to shop as before, I am unable to do as much as I used to do, but this is due to a twenty per cent cut in my take home due to tax law changes brought in by this Government, which also coincided with a drop in demand for people in IT. So the Government has managed to send me into recession whereas the terrorist actions will only have a very small effect on me.      These events have profoundly changed my view of my work. I teach at an elite private university in the US, and simply cannot rationalise teaching the way I have done in the past, in a way that is disconnected from the horrors and challenges of the outside world. It has become apparent overnight what a terribly complicated world we are now living in. In November, many of us watched in dismay as our country elected a leader of such clearly limited intellectual powers. Now it is even more urgent that we find some way of educating our nation so that we can harness the thoughtfulness and intellectual discipline of those who work hardest to hone them. We need to create a climate where intellectuals will feel some moral responsibility for the leadership of their country. I hope I will struggle for a long time with the question of how to achieve this.      I have studied many different religions. I thought I would write to ask what exactly Andy Brown is trying to imply by saying children are made to memorise the Koran. In no place in the Koran does it suggest that killing innocents, causing havoc and oppressing other peoples' beliefs are the way of Islam - in fact it teaches the exact opposite. Besides are children who go to Sunday school or Bible class in this country any different? It is not what you teach it's how you teach it!      While life seems normal again in the UK, there is no doubt another suicide attack is just around the corner. Remember the pictures of schoolchildren in Afghanistan and Pakistan being forced to learn the Koran by heart, being taught that the Western world is evil and that death is an honour to be rewarded in heaven. We have to realise that this threat is enormous and that the world may not be 'normal' as we remember it for many years to come.      It is a yes and no answer. Yes, in a way things are back to normal; folks still go and do their shopping, kids are in schools, but this great country has lost its feelings of security and it will never be the same. I am now nervous to fly and to be in public buildings. There is a huge sense of loss which we are all feeling and I don't think anyone will EVER get over the terrible loss of innocent lives.      After two and half weeks everyone I know seems to have put the recent NY events to the back of their minds and are carrying on as before. Unfortunately for those who lost relatives and loved ones life will never continue as before. But ask anyone a question or raise a point concerning the prospect of war and it is evidently clear that they (and my myself included) are still somewhat concerned about a possible escalation of trouble.      My life never diverged from normal anyway. I was affected by what I saw on television but ultimately believe that the best response to terrorism is to carry on regardless. After all, disruption of our daily lives is exactly what they are trying to achieve.      A great danger is that life will return to normal after these atrocities. The fading of the initial panic is a good thing, but to slip back to normal, i.e. complacency, is to provide the terrorists with another chance. Life should (and largely is, in the UK at least) go back to normal activities of going to work, shopping, eating etc, but we must all be vigilant so as not to provide an easy opportunity for the terrorists.      As coincidence would have it, I was booking a flight right at the moment of the attacks. I took the flight, two days later, without apprehension. Since September 11 one notices more in the way of security measures but apart from that it is business as usual. Rightly so.      To make any changes to how I live my life would be to give in to terrorism. The terrorists affected countless lives on September 11th. Thankfully, I have not been directly affected by their actions and at least until I am, I will not be making any concessions to them. Would I change if someone I knew had been killed? Who knows, but until then they have no right to have any control over my life.      I believe that the lives of every person on this planet has been changed in some way by the horrific events in which the Twin Towers were destroyed. I believe that it is important to use this time to focus on change. With the increasing support for a reaction by allied forces, I believe we should use this as an opportunity to negotiate or form a new world order, promoting peaceful relations with one another, and an end to old conflicts, e.g. northern Ireland and the fighting in Israel. In this way we can all move forward, some more than others, and can ensure that the events of Sept. 11th do not recur.      Apart from the initial shock and disgust at the attacks in the US I haven't changed the way I live or work at all. I continue to work in central London using public transport and frequent the city at weeeknds. Whether it is being used to possible terrorist attacks or just ignoring the threats I find life is too busy to think about what one should or shouldn't be doing for the best. As it is I will continue as normal. Terrorism must not be successful or seen to be. My advice is keep on enjoying life.      There is an enduring sense of grief in New York City that is unlikely to disappear in the foreseeable future. Every time I leave my home I can see the gap in the skyline that has become a tomb for more than 6,000 of my fellow citizens. Nobody I know here has resumed the life we lived before September 11. The pall that has descended on our collective psyche, as well as a feeling that going to restaurants, museums, or shopping seems far less appealing than it once did. The issue isn't fear. It's an abiding sadness that cannot be overcome by resuming ""normal"" activities. I can only pray that this was the last of what Bin Laden has in store for us, but common sense dictates that this is not the case. As I mourn for the victims of my city and my country I am also preparing to mourn for the victims of what is likely to come.      I would have made an effort but I've just been informed by my company that because of the traumatic events half of the company's workforce will be made redundant. Ooops, there goes my effort.      I think we do need to get on with our lives. But also we need to pray and build healthy relationships with people with whom we disagree on some issues. This does not mean that we should condone wrong-doing or not seek justice for it. However, we need to address our own wrongdoings as well.      Life is not back to normal for the people of Afghanistan. It will also not be normal for us until we take a close look at the causes of the anger people around the world feel towards the US - and do our part to change them. The main cause is US foreign policy over the last several decades causing mass suffering for many people throughout the world. Large-scale violence from our side will only fuel further terrorism. For every man, woman and child killed by our sons and daughters, another terrorist is born.      The headlines in our local paper talk of impending war, while many people are wearing red, white, and blue clothing, ""patriotic"" t-shirts and tri-colour ribbons. Cars and trucks have huge American flags attached to their antennas and the stars and stripes hang from almost every house. I don't find this reassuring or patriotic, it gives me the creeps. ""God Bless America"" is a slogan displayed in churches, restaurants and grocery stores. The belief that American lives are more precious than those of other nations, especially Arab nations, makes me feel sick to my stomach. I have had several nightmares directly related to the attacks even though I live three thousand miles away on the West Coast. No, life is certainly not ""normal"". There is an all-pervasive feeling of grief and dread about what will come next. I hope and pray that cooler heads will prevail. Let's start the biggest, most effective campaign for human justice and peace that the world has ever seen. That is the only sensible response.       It's important that we return to normal. My young son demands it of me everyday. When we're at the park or driving somewhere and spot a plane he still bounces in his seat, excited by it, while I watch it go by with a new found apprehension. In saying that, I won't stop flying because of this. I never liked to fly before really, but found that I had to from time to time. I don't want to spend two days in a car travelling someplace that's only a few hours by airplane. There were risks before September 11 and those are probably more likely to happen than a repeat of that terrible day. No one wants to be terrified in the last few moments of their life, but let's hope all the moments before that are spent living instead of avoiding that which might or might not happen. "
HOC HOC-GC 0.36 " How about the drive from Houston to Dallas, or vice versa? 200 some odd miles, terrain as flat as a pancake and when you see either Dallas or Houston, both cities look like clones of each other, same strip malls, same skyline. Come to think of it, the same applies to most cities in the USA.      The most boring place on Earth? Where the most boring person on Earth happens to be.      One word: Ballymena      Middlewich in Cheshire is the most boring place ever. It has 2 bus stops and 2 shops and that's it.      Singapore most definitely. Its citizens need to be reminded to 'smile' from government campaigns.      Britain is the most boring place. Its high criminal activity and ugly personality of its mainstream ""Thatcherised"" population proves this.      I lived in Bonn for 6 years and thought it was quite a nice provincial town. Although it was the federal capital, the locals called it the federal village. I liked it. A US journalist, whilst stationed there about 20 years ago, described it as ""being half the size of Chicago's main cemetary and twice as dead"". I suppose your view is formed by previous experience.      A few contenders - Redruth in Cornwall - a place where the locals still point at aeroplanes, Hemel Hempstead - so dull it makes Milton Keynes look like Disney World. Hatfield is also mind-numbingly bland and must have employed some of the most unimaginative architects ever to sit at a drawing board.      The small seaside town of St Helens in Tasmania. The vacant stares of its citizens (especially at sunset when they gather on the street corners, like extras from Invasion Of The Bodysnatchers. Don't miss booking a room in the principal motel, where the multi-coloured acrylic carpet runs not only across the floor, but also up the walls - no doubt to prevent injuries as guests throw themselves against them in existential despair.      Hull - It's sooo boring the highlight of the day is deciding which hand to use when covering one's nose to avoid the smell of an old fishing town.      Runcorn in the North West of England HAS to be, by far, hands down, the winner. High crime, high teenage pregnancies, one shopping complex, and one night club for 60 thousand+ people. Need I say more!      I'm surprised that a few people have named Singapore as being boring. I lived in Singapore for over five years and found it quite the opposite. It has an abundance of 24 hour night-clubs and live bands. The only thing, which I found boring apart from the political aspect of the country, were some of the expats, who refused to mix with the local people and experience the different cultures of S.E.A. I think that these expats might be the ones who are inclined to say Singapore is boring. There is life outside your condominiums and expat clubs, you just need to participate in the real world!      Whilst serving in Cyprus in the 70's we had servicemen and women sitting around complaining that there is nothing to do, but they were to lazy to get up and do something. People can be boring but not places, a place is only what you make of it unless you live on the Isle of Wight      Thank you everyone who has mentioned MK. It is without doubt the biggest hell-hole on earth. No character, no nightlife, no interesting people, no worthwhile architecture or history - need I go on. It should be bulldozed and forgotten about. Writing this is the most exciting thing that's happened to me this year!      If Phillips thinks Edmonton is boring, he should take a look around his home country, any place in Southeast England is by far more boring. Pubs seem to be the defining element of cultural attraction around here. Guess you have to drink yourself silly to enjoy the place.      If Singapore is as boring as some people think, why are there more than a million foreigners from all over the world working in this small country of only 3 million people? In contrast, Darwin attracts no foreigners because it is such a boring, boring place.      Nothing wrong with Singapore - plenty of fun to be had if you know where to look. Try Brunei or Kuwait if you're after real boredom!      I once drove round and round Bracknell, hyperventilating with rage because I couldn't find a street that was clearly marked on my map. When I finally thrust the map at a passer-by she nervously informed me that I was actually in Basingstoke! Surely nobody who has visited these places truly blame me: Malls, fast food outlets, ring-roads, distinguishing between them is like distinguishing between one fast-food outlet and another, they are identical in a hideous kind of way. Oh, and I've also worked in Slough, Barnsley and Luton. Can you blame me for emigrating?      As a Canadian with a European background, I can clearly understand the reasoning behind renaming Alberta's capital to 'Deadmonton'. Unfortunately, too many Canadians are obsessed with mass-market sports as opposed to the beauty of individual athleticism.      Being an ex-pat Brit I am lucky to live in one of the most scenic parts of the world - The Okanagan Valley (British Columbia). But my main office is based out of Edmonton and I could name many other worse places in Britain and Europe - leave Edmonton alone and worry about somewhere else!      I've been to Basingstoke, Bracknell, Luton, Bedford and Milton Keynes in the past few years (what does that say about my life?!). Having moved to Malaysia, I expected Kuala Lumpur to be a bit more cosmopolitan. Nope. Kuala Lumpur could be twinned with Milton Keynes. There are hardly any buildings here that are more than 10 years old (with more being built every day), an incomprehensible road network, and countless numbers of soulless shopping complexes. Come back Bedford et al - all is forgiven!      Born in a small town in England. I agree that they are very boring indeed. I am lucky to live in one of the most EXCITING places on earth - Waikiki Beach, Hawaii. There is so much to do here, whether indoors or outdoors that I don't have enough time in the day to do it all, so I am NEVER bored. If you are bored in your hometown, try turning off the TV and get involved in a hobby or sport!      I don't know where the most boring place on earth is but this Talking Point page isn't it. I have laughed so hard at these bored and desperate people's expense, I almost feel guilty. I might even start to sponsor them with train tickets to somewhere more exciting.      There are many boring places on earth (most of them English speaking). Here are some warning signs. Claims at ""world's biggest"", ""world's longest"", ""world's tallest"" (ask yourself why are they trying so hard). Boasts of a vibrant multicultural atmosphere (outside of Reykjavik, what city isn't multicultural now). Any place with a monorail or a revolving restaurant. Any mention of equally second rate ""sister cities"" (clearly they're desperate). Can you think of anyone truly interesting from that city (and do they still live there)? The one city that wins (or loses) in all of these categories is Toronto (any city that has a shoe museum as its second biggest attraction should really be avoided).      Bedworth, in Warwickshire, is possibly the only place that makes Nuneaton seem glamorous. The pubs are like something out of League of Gentlemen. This is the town that fashion forgot - stonewash skin-tight jeans, white socks and mullet haircuts are still common. Swindon comes a close second though.      Take it from me, the most boring place is any baseball stadium, a close second would be a computer room full of operators and a distant third, an English cricket ground especially as recent test results indicate.      Adelaide, South Australia is the ""hole"" of the earth.      Most people in Singapore have no real political or social opinions, and some even require the government's assistance in getting a date for a Saturday night, let alone just trying to meet someone. Everyone is too busy worrying (or scared) about what everyone else thinks about them, and neglect their own unique individuality and their expressions. Although it's great that crime is under control and the country is very pretty and litter-free, it just feels like the citizens are living within a sterile and clinical bubble-dome.      By far, Temple City, California is the most boring place on the planet . . . we probably have the largest concentration of bridal shops in the country. I believe last count was 19 within a 3 mile radius . . . It's a strange little place      The most boring place on earth is London W12 8QT.      Saitama Prefecture, the northern overspill of Tokyo, is acknowledged the most boring place in this ""the ugliest country in the world"". A municipality with a population of over a million was created there last year. They polled the inhabitants to suggest names for the city. The story goes the most popular suggestion was ""Dasai-tama"", which means ""Naff lump"".      I certainly second the idea of Basingstoke being one of the worst in the UK, but just try anywhere in Denmark, specifically Jutland. I've had more fun at the dentist!      I am forced by nature to agree with Robert Philip. Ever since the ice hockey player Wayne Gretzky left for L.A., Edmonton has truly been a one-show town - the West Edmonton Mall! Admittedly, it's some mall, but I think that says it all right there, doesn't it?      No contest - Harlow Town, Essex. Beggars belief.      Hale, Cheshire is without doubt the most boring place. Copious amounts of rich people concentrated in one small village serious destroys any community spirit. No one knows his or her neighbours.      March, Cambs. in the Fens, and unlike Luton is not easy to get out of.      I'm working in Basingstoke at the moment, wondering what I've done in a previous life to deserve it. You can spend a night at the Bowlplex with 17-year old boy racers, or, if you're really bored, there is a pub somewhere in town, with a big screen and everything! Someone get me out of here!      I remember Bernard Manning causing similar levels of laughter and offence with a series of comments about an English seaside town (Lytham St Annes). They included such gems as 'the only entertainment on a Saturday night is watching the traffic lights change' and 'they don't bury the dead, they prop them up in bus shelters to make the place seem more active'.      You have obviously never been to Gran Canaria! It is just a big pile of rock!      Chichester, Sussex -     Exclusive, snobbish and conservative. Result - no nightlife, no fun, no hope.      Bracknell. It is without doubt the most uninspiring place on earth.      Definately Jacksonville in Arizona, a one horse town, without a horse! In the UK, I agree with Matthew, Luton must come top - there is no reason for it too be there at all!      Only boring people get bored.      Offshore Nova Scotia, Canada. On board a drilling rig has to be the most boring and foggy place on the face of the earth. Boooooor-ring!      Swindon, where even the pigeons are on anti-depressants.      Hull, after the shops have shut there really is absolutely nothing to do (except leave!)      As the old joke goes: What have the Moon and Derby got in common? No atmosphere!     Judging by his comment, It has to be Gareth ""rasher"" Dart's house.      Crayford in Kent. A place so boring that the residents regard a traffic jam as something worth looking out of your window to watch.      I lived in Basingstoke for 3 years and I thought that was bad enough, until, I went to Milton Keynes for a weekend. Now that really is THE most boring place on Earth!      Dumbarton of Strathclyde is medically proven to be sufficiently dull as to actually induce coma. That is, when I'm not there to liven things up a bit.      My place of work: Long corridors, few pretty women, no one to flirt with, terrible view, grey skies outside, no laughter, terribly dressed colleagues, no tales to tell on our bosses and colleagues concerned basically about themselves and their PCs!      Nowhere is boring, just situations. Bored? Do something!      Bracknell. I'm still trying to scrape enough money together to achieve escape velocity.      Wait till you get married - you can't escape boredom wherever you are.      Grimsby: been there, done that, wouldn't be seen dead in the T-shirt...      It's easy to name millions of boring places. We should be naming boring places that have ""an obligation"" not to be boring because of their size, importance of their country and number of people who actually visit it. So Singapore has the obligation not to be boring - but according to David Thomas, it is. That's the kind of entries I would be looking for. In that case, try Calgary (south of Edmonton) when the stampede's not on... Phoenix, Arizona, is also pretty lifeless outdoors (too hot in summer) and there isn't anything for anyone to do except work or watch TV - which is also boring there.      There are no boring places. There are boring people.      I have never seen boredom etched on people's faces quite so distinctly as those listening to speeches in The House of Lords.      Norfolk is the dullest place on earth, with possibly the exception of Birmingham.      I would have to say that the dull and mediocre, medium sized town is a certain English forte. It is for these places that the phrase ""soulless"" was first coined.      Has anybody ever visited the capital of Europe, Brussels? Definitely for me this should get gold medal for the dull-a-thon.      Yeovil in Somerset is definitely the most boring place in England. At least Luton has a bit of ethnic diversity and a carnival once a year! Yeovil is just so dull.      Ambridge. You can compress everything that has happened during the week into an hour and it's still not interesting!      I like to think that every place has something interesting about it. Maybe you have to be local to get it, but there is some interest everywhere. Even Swindon, Milton Keynes and Barrow in Furness.      I once spent 2 weeks in Hemel Hempstead and wished I'd stuck forks in my eyes instead!      Web-sites that ask boring questions. As for Luton it's not that bad and we do have an athletics track, which I use weekly and international meets just up the road in Bedford      Singapore is ok. Australia is boring, big and empty      Without a doubt the most boring place in the world is Loughborough. The residents have to resort to homophobia, racism and downright rudeness to break the monotony.      Try Solihull, no atmosphere and a dumping ground for middle class executive-types.      My girlfriend's place.      I absolutely, categorically, unambiguously deny that it is Link?ping. We have no less than two cinemas, 6 pubs, and the bus service is very efficient. It's fun. I would much rather live here than Helsinki.      Don't bother stopping over in Folkestone on your way to France. Car parks close at 6pm - that says it all!      The Big Brother house.      Edmonton.      I used to live in Basingstoke. It has the well-known nickname of ""Boringjoke"", but what was NOT so well known: the local newsagents sold postcards of the biggest office buildings in the centre of town because there was literally nothing else However, this does beg the question of who on EARTH was buying them?!      Nowhere is boring as long as you have access to an international airport, a sense of adventure or a good set of friends.      The most boring place on earth is, without doubt, any cricket ground in England.      Barnet.      Try any small German city on a Sunday...      Robert Philip should visit Luton if he thinks Edmonton is boring. We have the oldest shopping centre in Europe (it was the first, and looks it), and a Vauxhall factory that is about to close. We don't have international athletics facilities. The one saving grace is that Luton is easy to get out of, with the airport, M1 and the excellent Thameslink trains leaving every few minutes.      Singapore is the most boring place on earth. No life, no individuality, no fun... BORING!!!      That area just outside the ozone layer. There really is no atmosphere at all.      Without doubt - Milton Keynes!!      My favourite boring place is Dubai, UAE. Friends rave about it. I've been there twice recently looking for excitement. The city sucks. Awful. Absolutely dreadful place. The new airport is the best thing about it. "
HOC HOC-HC -1.14 " The aircraft never lost its status, and the safety features now make a safe aircraft even safer. To the sceptics. Were you the same breed of people who refused to fly the first commercial aircraft because they were new and the rich man's toy? You perhaps come from a line of sceptics who thought the car would never replace the horse? I'll bet you fly 747's now and drive a car?      I do not believe the Paris crash will affect potential passengers on the Concorde. It remains a stunning technological achievement and, for those who have seen it in action, a beautiful and impressive sight. The sooner it flies again the better.      Nothing can compare to a flight across the Atlantic on Concorde, so YES it will fly again and YES it will be full. I had the pleasure of taking a flight from New York back in 97, 3 hours 13 minutes and I was grinning with joy for the whole duration. In this age of the English been beaten at tennis, rugby, cricket etcp., Concorde remains a true English triumph - I for one will be saving towards my next trip as soon as she is re-launched.      High profile cuts both ways. Crashes of ordinary planes get ordinary coverage, the crash of the elite gets elite coverage. It doesn't help that despite there being more crashes of other models, the ratio of the number of successful flights to number of crashes is actually not at all favourable to Concorde.      The Challenger Shuttle disaster hasn't stopped people going into space (never mind that it's not available to civilians). I for one will be deeply disappointed if I never see Concorde fly again; the noise, the poise this plane has is truly the most majestic of all man's creations.      If the average Briton could afford a flight on the Concorde, then we would all have reason to be proud. This way it is actually a shame that there are so few who can afford the flight, whereas the vast majority can't even get decent railway transportation.      It's been nice and quiet here in Reading without that monstrosity roaring over us twice a day. Why doesn't Concorde have to meet modern noise standards to get an airworthiness certificate?      Those protesting at the environmental concerns will no doubt be holidaying in their own back gardens this year or cycling down to Greece. Long live Concorde!      Concorde has always been considered as a creation of genuine British effort. It is an awe-inspiring sight, and indeed would be a terrible shame if its wings were clipped. Its history is not perfect, but then, what other plane has an unmarked record. Boeing 737, 747 and 757 have been involved in many accidents (mid-air collisions, engine failures, hydraulic failures), yet these planes will still be used well into the future. Concorde was an aircraft made beyond its time, and it's beauty will always been admired by those who understand the excellent work that went into it.      I think it's a pity that this noisy, polluting, fuel-inefficient 'rich boy's toy' should ever have been allowed to fly again. Yes, it is indeed a beautiful shape, but those who stare skywards in awe should look at the pollution trailing behind its fuel-inefficient engines. Perhaps those who support this relic don't live under the flight path.      When 583 passengers were killed in a collision between two Boeing 747 aircraft in 1977 it didn't stop people flying them. I don't see any reason why Concorde will be any different. People should remember there are aircraft older, much more heavily used and less well engineered and maintained flying around the planet. The extent to which Concorde aircraft have been used is equivalent to an average five-year-old short-haul airliner. Anyone who thinks Concorde is past its sell-by date is frankly rather ignorant about aircraft.      Concorde is the pioneering first of many of its breed of aircraft, and in years to come, the design will be refined and mass transport at the speed of sound will become standard - with cleaner, quieter engines. We'll take son of Concorde for granted, and wonder what it was ever like to travel sub-sonic.      Two aviation dream trips are transatlantic on the Concorde and a joyflight over Antarctica. If I ever came into money I would do both, despite serious crashes on both.      Everyone seems to quickly forget that nearly every other passenger aircraft has crashed killing many more than Concorde's unfortunate crash last year. There was no mass grounding of any Boeing planes or Airbus! I have been lucky enough to fly on Concorde and it was a magical experience that many more will now hopefully experience.      I think Concorde should fly again - after tests of course. I miss seeing it in the sky.      I think it is completely despicable that Concorde was allowed to lose some of its status in the first place. Other aircraft, eg the 737, have had far greater shadows cast over them... yet because grounding the world's fleet of 737's would not be a commercial option, some of these 30+ year old ""coffins"" continue to fly. Concorde is still in its prime. The BA fleet is one of the best maintained aircraft in the skies and in terms of flying hours has another 20 years of life left in her. There is not another civil aircraft flying that is as well built, tested and maintained. I say put it back in the air now. It's not a question of what it costs to fly or if that is right - it is a part of our heritage of engineering excellence and world-beating design... which sadly we seem to have given away.      It's old, noisy, inefficient and polluting, and it's one of the most beautiful of man's creations. I stood at Clapham Junction last summer as Concorde came in to land. Gliding towards Heathrow with its mighty Rolls Royce Olympus jets roaring overhead hundreds of people on that crowded platform gazed upwards as it was turned gold by the setting sun. An awesome experience! It's a masterpiece of civilisation. It will surely fly again.      Why is this debate still going on? Concorde is safe, not only safe but probably the safest and most advanced civil aircraft of all time! (Ok, the avionics might not be digital LCD displays but they more than do the job !) Come on, you Brits, you have something to be proud of here... That incident in Paris last year had nothing to do with Concorde's safety. The aircraft should never have been grounded.      Some people will always be willing to pay whatever it takes to travel quickly. If they didn't, we'd all still go by ship or Zeppelin. Most 'first world' holiday makers will be flying long-haul at several times the speed of Concorde within 30 years anyway. And let's face it, it's a stunning piece of paper-dart art...      I was fortunate enough to witness the Concorde flying above my house yesterday. It was an awesome sight. We need Concorde for our economy, as the business leaders can be in NY in less than 4 hrs and be back in London on the same day. Let's get it in the sky asap....      Let's see: the Brits have the Concorde, a contraption capable of delivering a hundred or so caviar-eating passengers to their destinations at the speed of sound at a cost of more than $6,000 - an aircraft which caters to those most likely to own Rolls Royces, Bentleys, and Range Rovers. Thank God we have the Brits to balance the evils of greedy, energy-wasting, environment-killing Americans like myself.      Elegant, superior, futuristic, expensive, the list goes on. So will Concorde...      I am surprised at Dr Shuttleworth's assertion that Concorde's engines are inefficient. The Rolls Royce SNECMA Olympus engines of Concorde are exceptionally thermally efficient. I don't believe any other aero engine comes close. Also Concorde is the only aircraft of any description which can fly at Mach two without using reheat. Certainly with afterburners alight at take-off it produces an obvious smoke trail, as fuel is less completely burned in this mode. But having reached cruising speed with reheat off, these engines produce no more pollutants than any other jet engine. Let her fly.      Concorde is no mere aircraft. It is an icon representing the dreams of my generation. I hope for years to come people look up and see what is possible.      Shame they didn't change the engines for quieter, cleaner and more efficient ones whilst they were at it. Concorde belongs to a time when it was performance at any cost - it should be junked. It is exempt from normal noise regulations and it's time the CAA applied present noise regulations to it.      Concorde has never lost its place as the best plane in the sky. Just to see it fly past is a thrill. To fly in her would be wonderful. Come on, she has had only one crash in 30 years. Long live Concorde.      I watched with others at the end of the runway at Heathrow this afternoon as this magnificent plane re-took to the skies. I felt proud as she soared overhead. What happened before was a fluke accident and not like other air crashes. After all this investment and testing I'm sure the same thing would never happen again. I know I'd take my chances to be first back on her and whilst there's people sharing my view there should be Concordes flying.      Of course Concorde will get its reputation back but I for one would much prefer to cross the Atlantic in a helium-filled airship. That would be far more of an adventure than being hurled across the water in three hours and not seeing a damn thing for all the money you paid.      It is magnificent to watch, and nearly everybody turns to gaze at it as it flies overhead, but this does not alter the fact that so many millions are being pumped into a service that is so expensive that it can be used by an elite few. And despite fares being so high, they do not cover Concorde's operating costs. Passengers travelling on BA's standard aircraft have been subsidising Concorde passengers for years - if they were not, the tickets would cost #10,000 or more.      What people are failing to realise that even if you perceive the 'jet-set' to be outdated and old, another fact remains - that especially for BA Concorde provides huge profits for them from people that are willing to pay for it. This allows people who don't wish to take Concorde to have cheaper, more competitive, economy seats because BA has more money. That is something that many people who don't like Concorde for some bizarre reason are failing to see.      Why not? The DC10 suffered repeated (and fatal) issues with rear cargo door failures many years ago. It is still flying today but is re-branded MD-11. The improvements were made (both to new and existing aircraft) and the result is a safer aircraft. Concorde should now be THE safest plane to fly on given all the attention in the last year. Shame that the attention hasn't been the most ecological though!      Who cares? Most people can't afford the price of the ticket anyway. Like other rich people's toys, it is of little consequence to most of us.      I would like someone to explain to me what sort of need motivates anybody to pay all that money to be in New York in 3.5 hours rather than pay twenty times less and get there in 7? What is the point, apart from boosting one's ego?      Let the ticket sales speak for themselves.      I first saw this wonderful plane fly in the early 70's at the age of 10 and have always wanted to fly in it. I still hope this wish will come true. The aircraft is truly awesome and I can't think of another with a better safety record.      The fact that the crash was on video and each and every second of its fatal fall was broadcast into every living room in the western world, might have left a lasting impression. Concorde may be 30 year old technology and already beyond its design life expectation, but there is nothing else in this world which allows an ordinary (non-military) person to experience life at Mach 2 Concorde for ever      Concorde may be safe, but will the Americans let it fly over their cities ?      Living in Concorde's hometown I have longed for the day of seeing this most elegant plane grace the skies once more. Concorde has brought pride to this city and the country for 30+ years. Never again will a British government be prepared to fund a project of this risk or size. This disaster did not occur because of any intrinsic faults with the aircraft but a poor maintenance routine and the most unfortunate set of circumstances. Let us be proud of our heritage and wish Concorde every success for the future.      Whoever is daft enough to blow #6,000 on a flight ticket is daft enough to be taken in by what is essentially a PR whitewash job. The Concorde had several close shaves and it was sheer luck that there weren't more crashes.      Concorde is a high-profile aircraft and 90% of the concerns have been generated by the media. It won't be long before the Paris incident has faded from most people's memories and I'll be enjoying the sight and sound of this magnificent aircraft on its approach to Heathrow.      I live and work right under the flight path for Concorde and when it flew over my office, there was a crowd of people over by the window to witness the beauty and the power of this awesome aircraft.      Did it ever really lose its status as the most stunning plane ever to grace our skies? What other plane makes people stop and stare in the same way as Concorde? Even at standstill it is a work of beauty - a classic piece of design. Now they have instigated the safety upgrades I'm sure it will soon be attracting its regular passengers back. Having flown on Concorde shortly before the tragic accident, I would certainly have no qualms about travelling on it again.      Of course people will remember that one Concorde crashed. I imagine that when stepping on their holiday flight, it suits them to forget that substantially more civil aircraft of other types have been involved in disasters. An event such as the Concorde crash captures a disproportionate amount of attention, just as a particular car crash involving a Mercedes in Paris. Other cars crash too - but people are shocked when they hear that something perceived as technologically superior has appeared to fail even although, in both of these cases, the blame lay elsewhere.      Can it regain its status? 3.5 hours London to JFK is not status, it's fact. It's thirty years old but there's still no better or safer way to cross the Atlantic. Supersonic transport is still the future even if Boeing claims otherwise. With the new evidence coming out about the medical problems arising from long, cramped flights, Concorde seems more sensible than ever. Also, why does no one ever complain about the pollution from military supersonic aircraft? There must be hundreds of thousands in the world? I'm saving up now.      As a young man, I watched with awe as Concorde was tested around the skies of Oxfordshire before entering regular service. I have never seen a more graceful aircraft, and I would love to fly on it. Despite the unfortunate disaster, it has never lost its status and will grace the skies once again.      I used to enjoy watching Concorde go over Bracknell at 11 o'clock each morning - I thought that living under the flightpath was a positive benefit! But that was because there are so few of them; a Concorde every 15 minutes would be thoroughly annoying.      The tragic events of last year's horrific crash highlighted an interesting fact. People were not only mourning the loss of human life, but the loss of the aircraft as well. Perhaps this gives an indication of just how highly we ( and the French ) regard this fabulous aircraft. The sooner it gets back into the skies the better.      The Concorde is a dinosaur and belongs in a museum, along with the outdated jet-set mindset.      Absolutely: many of those now flying in First Class across the Atlantic have only one question - when will Concorde be flying again? In terms of safety, actual accidents per departure are however more than for the 747, contrary to what Robin has written, since there have been so few Concorde departures in comparison to 747 departures.      I would expect that Concorde's role will now change gradually away from business travel, and more towards leisure. That said, I can't comprehend why anyone who isn't under severe time pressure would ever want to fly Concorde. Compared to more modern aircraft it's noisy and cramped, and the ride at subsonic speeds is hardly smooth.      I am sure it can regain its status as rich people's transport and extremely polluting plane quite easily. I think this is a waste of money and time and hope Concorde will never fly commercially again.      In or out of the sky, I think it is the most elegant man-made device ever to fly. I have no doubt that it will regain its status within months of regular flights beginning again. If BA ever want a volunteer passenger, then I would certainly be prepared to be one.      Sure, many airplanes have crashed over the years - although there is precedent for both results (remember the Comet). I would fly on the Concorde, once a problem is identified it is reasonable to expect that it is solved. Of course the ticket price is still a bit high.      Can Concorde retain its status and prestige? Yes, absolutely. The aircraft itself is not inherently unsafe; last year's crash was a tragic chain of events triggered by a piece of debris on a runway. The aviation authorities have insisted on measures to prevent the unlikely occurring again, and I think most of Concorde's regular passengers will use it as they did previously - to save time. I flew to New York on Concorde back in 1996. It was a wonderful experience and I'd fly again on it tomorrow if the opportunity arose.      Why was this question not an issue when TWA Flight 800 went down? Or after any of the other fatal crashes involving Boeing made aircraft? This so-called ""controversy"" is just media hype and it only serves as further testament to the special status that Concorde rightly enjoys as a part of your history. Besides why should we worry, most of us will never have the means to travel this way?      The Concorde did not crash due to an aircraft fault, but rather debris. Precautions have now been taken to further minimize those risks. Why not let her fly again? As for the noise and pollution. Start work on developing quieter, more efficient engines. Sure the cost will be great, but the benefits should be greater when looking in the long term.      I think similar issues faced the loss of the Titanic: a national flagship which resulted in a tragic loss of life and destruction. And yet today we find new liners being produced all the time and most people feel perfectly safe travelling on them. With respect, I don't think the Concorde disaster should be treated any differently to that of any other disaster.      Given the favourable stats - one crash in over 30 years - I'd have no problem using Concorde. But then perhaps Concorde's higher profile meant that even one accident could destroy public confidence for good. I hope I'm wrong...     Yes, I think it will regain its status. The accident was not down to a flaw in the plane itself but a terrible sequence of consequences that could never be planned for. Concorde is still the only plane of its type and probably will be for decades to come. It has flown for 25 years undergoing the incredible stresses of supersonic flight and it has performed the job very well and it is still capable thanks to the excellent design and engineering abilities of its manufacturers. Tragic accidents do happen and as human beings we need to remind ourselves that we are not infallible. However that should not deter us from progress.      Yes. This is the greatest and most glamorous aircraft in the world. Airbus should immediately start planning on a new supersonic passenger aircraft to replace Concorde before it gets too ancient.      Concorde is distressingly noisy. Surely the millions of people on its flight path deafened for 3 minutes every day have some weight against the privileged few who save a few hours? Concorde is an embarrassing relic and should not be resurrected.      Was Concorde ever that unsafe? Concorde has had 1 accident. The 747 has had a few disasters and larger numbers are killed yet no-one ever says stop 747s from flying.      Yes, of course it can! There will be plenty of business travellers willing to pay the cost of faster transatlantic travel and plenty of aviation enthusiasts to bang the drum for British and French engineering. This doesn't mean that we should forget those who died but if one tragedy stopped everyone then GNER would have gone out of business last year.      This was the first fatal accident involving a Concorde, the planes have flown millions of miles in the time that they have been in service. You have a better chance of winning a double rollover lottery than you have dying on a Concorde. The work done has made an already safe aircraft even safer.      I would love to fly on Concorde.      I am afraid that despite an enviable safety record it will take a very long time for those video images of that burning, stricken plane to fade from the public memory.      If I drove my car down the motorway and my tyre got punctured by a chunk of metal which had fallen from another vehicle and I lost my life as a result, would they ban all types of my car from the roads? The whole Concorde business has been typically blown up out of all proportion. Yes, of course it will all be OK again. The ""nanny politicians"" went completely overboard as usual.      Firstly, can I remind everyone that Concorde was a joint Anglo-French venture. Yes, Concorde will regain its status as long as it doesn't crash again. It is arguably the most beautiful plane ever made and is legendary but is really a bit like a Rolls Royce car, no one really needs it, except of course British Airways. If it can still fly technically and is economically viable then why not let it continue?      Why is it that when a Concorde finally crashes there is a debate whether it should ever fly again? If this attitude were standard across the board, the Boeing 747 would have been mothballed in the 70's. "
HOC HOC-LQ 0.11 " Having lived on the County Down coast for twenty years, power cuts were quite common mostly due to stormy weather so we always had a few candles or Tilley Lamps set aside for the occasion. Be prepared for the expected. Here in Canada the 'expected' means owning a snow shovel, burying water pipes twelve feet down and having a block heater on your car etc. The unexpected is always going to play havoc. The ice storm in Quebec caused power loss for several months for some people. Don't blame NIE.      I'm not criticising the efforts of the maintenance crews - rather I'm praising their dedication to patching up what is pretty obviously a network hopelessly lacking robusticity and resilience. How come telecoms companies can keep power flowing to business and household phones, and yet those whose supposed speciality this is cannot do so.      One answer, Keith - IN IT FOR THE MONEY!!! The only ones who actually CARE are the linesmen on the ground.      Regarding Keith's point, telecoms companies convey low-power signals which are far easier to handle than the heavy electrical loads of power transmission. Sadly, it's the old trade-off between price and reliability, as underground cables are five times the cost of overhead power systems.      Yet again Northern Ireland people think about no one but themselves. They don't think about the EMPLOYEES at the other end of the phone who have to listen to the grief that people give to them. We pay bills to keep a good service, and at the end of the day we can not blame an individual or an organisation for these problems. After all, anything made by man can be broken by man AND nature. At the end of the day we could be worse off and have no roads or electricity. I think we should be thankful for what we have, and in times with power remember those in worse off countries.      For a country that encounters bad weather on a frequent basis, problems always seem to arise! - Will the services ever be adequately prepared?      Maybe if people actually had to deal with the rantings of people on the phone they might be more understanding. As for the money you are right. Over here at the first sign of a problem the second question always is ""Will I be compensated?""      It doesn't make sense for us to be prepared for any possible weather conditions, it's all about balance of risks. Sooner or later despite our arrogance we will learn that man against nature isn't going to work and that we need to work with it not against it. It says a lot about how complicated our lives are that we can't survive without electricity for a day.      Welcome to the real world. I can only remember one big snowfall back in the 60's when we were snowed in for a week! I chose to come to Canada to live in the early 70's, and there is not much point grumbling about the snow and ice. You could say I am biased, working for a cable manufacturer, but here we put the hydro lines underground in and around the cities. So we don't get blackouts too often. Maybe when the system was revamped in NI, consideration should have been given to putting the electricity lines underground. It is more expensive initially to replace an overhead line with an underground line, but over the life span of the cable it more than makes up on this expense. Also, utilities in north America have massive tree pruning budgets and fulltime crews for cutting back branches and limbs away from power lines in the countryside.      I won't criticise Northern Ireland Electricity for the power losses - we cannot expect daily life to go on as normal under extreme weather conditions. And their laudable engineers did get the power on again fairly quickly, despite the atrocious weather. However, I am not at all impressed by NIE's call centre. I was sent a special ""winter information"" pack a few months ago with a phone number to ring if the power goes off. When I rang it, I only got an unhelpful recorded message and was unable to find out any information about the extent of the power cuts or when we might expect to be reconnected. What happened to the big investment in NIE's call centres?      We lost power in our house (near Larne) in the middle of Monday night and it was restored at 11.00 on Tuesday morning. Yes, it was freezing cold in the house and it was pretty inconvenient, but I think we have to expect these things when we have unusual weather conditions. Nobody can expect NIE to employ extra staff and resources above normal requirements, just in case we have a storm, and I was certainly impressed with how quickly they sorted out our problems. "
JOC JOC-12A-01N 0.78 "Remember you can leave your ""thoughts"" here about this news story, or react to other people's opinions. Personally, I am worried that because the rocket launch was a failure, North Korea will restart testing nuclear weapons next.  I felt relieved to hear the news that the rocket launch failed, but now I am worried, too. I can't speculate what North Korea plot to do next.  Fortunately, this time, North Korea's long launch rocket failed . But, it may success next time. It is too late that. Then, people who live around North Korea confront more fear than now. I argue that Japanese government should emphasize that North Korea must not test rocket launch and nuclear weapon again. If not , in near the future, North Korea's rocket or nuclear weapon took a heavy toll of human lives.  I think Japan should continue to impose economic sanctions on North Korea whether or not its missile test failed. Anyway, North Korea's missile test and nuclear testing can be great threat to the countries around it, including Japan. We have to criticize North Korea for its provocative acts and send the messages to it through economic sanctions.  I became worried when I first heard this news. The rocket launch failed, but that time Japanese government's response was not sufficient. I think that the Japanese government must prepare more in case rocket launch is successful.  I am worried whether scientists concerned with this failure will be killed. As soon as Kim Jong-Un get this state, he purged a high officer who had made a mistake. Therefore I think that he may purge the scientists too. ID12040 I felt worried and fear about this news. As my classmates said, Japanese government should keep more strict watch on North Korea's words and actions especially concerning nuclear. Because as we know, nuclear power can destroy everything. Also I claim Japanese people need to have a sense of crisis.  The purpose of North Korea's rocket launch was to inspire the nation, but as a result, the failure emphasized lack of consideration and it made the nation disappointed. I'm afraid that the irritation caused by this failure will give rise to North Korea's more drastic actions.  When I knew this news, I felt relieved. However, at the same time, I felt fear. It is because I thought North Korea would test again. Japan is near North Korea. So Japan should be more careful than now, and it is important for Japan to cooperate with other countries. I hope peace will be brought on earth soon.  This news made me sad. I agreed with ID12044 about Japanese government. They have a role of protecting Japanese. However, their react after failing of missile was terrible. They should learn how to protect our own country and people as a neighbor of North Korea. I thought this incident became a good opportunity of thinking about system of Japanese government.  When I heard about the news, I was worried could Japan actually shoot down the rocket. This time, Japan took nearly 1 hour to confirm that North Korea had launched the rocket. I think Japan need extra strategy to protect Japan.  Just like everyone else i felt relieved too, and also anxious about what will North Korea do next. and also same as ID12044 and ID12033, that i think we need to take another look at how Japanese government will correspond to the emergency.  I'm disagree about ID12011's opinion because I think civilization society must think about North Korean's human rights. In my opinion, China must cooperate with United Nations Security Council's resolution because when it comes to North Korea problem, United Nations Security Council's resolution always rejected because of China.  I felt relieved when I heard the news. It is not first time to hear the news about North Korea's rocket. I am worried that they will do something dangerous again. I think Japan should watch for them more carefully.  I feel less safe after the rocket failed. North Korea will find out why the rocket failed and they will learn to launch a rocket successfully . Next time, they might do better so I don't feel safe.  North Korea I was reaffirmed that it is a very dangerous country by this time of missile launch. I do not know whether the missile is fired, I think, need to be more cautious because they may be fired missile to Japan time.  I am relieved that there was no damage and victim. However, I think that North Korea fires the rocket again. Other countries should pay attention to North Korea more.  When I heard the news for the first time, I didn't worry about it and I thought that everyone too made a fuss about it. However I heard that rocket debris crashed off Kunsan, I felt fear suddenly. I reconfirm North Korea is very dangerous, so the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family its government.  the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family FROM its government  the nation of North Korea had better purge Kim family FROM its government North Korea is wasting its money. They should use the money for food to save its citizens, not for launching missiles. It is very dangerous that North Korea is still considering to continue on inventing weapons. Countries like America, Korea and Japan should keep on putting on pressure to North Korea, and should keep on working persuading North Korea to stop making weapons. In order to persuade North Korea, we need more help especially from China.  I deeply regret that North Korea launched the rocket. This country spend much money on arms not on food for its people. Furthermore, the US heard the launch and decided to stop the support of food. I worry about the life of North Korea's citizens. I strongly believe that North Korea should abolish dictatorship as soon as possible. I hope that North Korea gets the democratic government and society.  First , I was relieved that no one was injured in this rocket launch. But I have strong anxiety about the future of Japan and North Korea. The people of North Korea are under bad food condition. And Japan government is not ready for North Korea's military action. We must think about the future of East Asia and act for peace.  Like most of the responses here, I felt relieved. Thinking about world peace, this act must not be allowed. Problems that North Korea has caused between the other countries are not only this, there are many others. Governments of Japan and other countries must more strongly condemn the country.  I think that North Korea should use more money for food for the citizen, too. They should do that for their country's stability. Thinking about our history, there were many governments that failed because they ignored their citizen's feeling. Even if they have the strong army, they should not think lightly about citizen's power. For example, they should think about the Arab Spring.  I was relieved to hear that North Korea failed to launch the missile. Always we can't predict North Korea's action, besides the interior of there is lack of stability now by changing leader, so we should pay attention more.  It was a relief to hear that none of the people has been affected by the rocket. But my primary concern is other countries' nuclear test. 3 days ago, India launched a missile. It cannot say that India may do and North Korea must not do. We must not launch a missile whatever the reason we have.  I'll revise my opinion to receive criticism from ID12047. Partly, I agree with ID12047. Japan should also persuade China into joining in United Nations Security Council's resolution in order to show much stronger condemnation. But, in reality, it's very hard job. China is said to gain much profit from trade with North Korea. If so, Japan will continue to take strong measure to stop North Korea's provocative action.  I thought that North Korea doesn't govern to the people, though its name is Democratic People's Republic of Korea. After I saw this news, my opinion is more strong. North Korea have to spend money to destroy the nuclear energy's factory and solve starvation.  When I heard this news on TV, I was terrified and gave up on North Korea. Whatever reason they have, they must not launch long-range rocket. Because Launching long-range rocket must be a factor threatening world peace, of course around Asia. I think North Korea will try to launch long-range rocket again. We shouldn't miss their action.  I think the Japanese government has a serious problem. When North Korea's long-range rocket launched, America got information about launch immediately. But, Japan took much time to confirm the launch. I fear that if North Korea's long-range rocket breaks up above Japanese territory. So, I think Japan should take a hard look at crisis management.  North Korea's government says the every people agree with current politics, but it has many problems -exile, Illness and hunger, for example-. I think the highest priority should be given to the health and happiness of the people! I think it is very terrible that North Korea's rocket broke up around Japanese territory. If it had become reality, we might have suffered damage. And I think, if it were not for countries like North Korea, our world would be peaceful.  As lest of others comment on the blog, I was also relieved of the failure of the DPRK's launching the missile. But, I think most Japanese does not realize the threat of that since they, I mean DPRK, always fail to do such a thing. Maybe that is not good thing so, we Japanese need to be more aware of it.  In my opinion, we should think this problem from various angles. To be sure, North Korea should be imposed some sanction from other countries, as it disturbed order. If economical sanctions will be imposed, however, many people in North Korea will suffer from hunger and poverty. I wonder if people who are blameless should be punished. I think the most important thing is to show North Korean government how to manage itself and to go along with other countries.  I have my opinion that however North Korea's rocket launch gave rise to criticism all over the world, North Korea will launch rocket again. But because of criticism by countries around North Korea, North Korea will fail to achieve its aim, supply of food and money and oil and so on.  This North Korea's rocket made me think anew that North Korea is a very dangerous country. I think that they have more important things to do than reinforcement of military affairs, such as improvement of citizen's poverty and hunger. The launch failed, but I think they will launch a rocket again. In case of it, Japan have to be more careful and prepare systems perfectly.  I have been interested in North Korea. So I was very surprised at this news when I heard it first time. I thought something might changed better after Kim Jong Il's death in North Korea. In fact, however, nothing changes against what I thought. Rather, North Korea goes worth. Someone should revolutionize the structure of North Korea. The launch of rocket failed this time. But North Korea is still serious threat to Japan. So we must pay attention to North Korea.  I think this launch accelerate North Korea's isolation in the world. The ""satellite"" cost a lot of money that would improve the people's life such as food, health and education. In the country, lot's of children around my age are starving and only a few upper class people lead a luxury life. Japan have to make effort to improve the situation.  Luckily, this time the launch project has failed. But there's no guarantee that next time the result will be the same. Needless to say its very dangerous. Japan must continue to do economic sanction, and we Japanese should be cautious about that country.  When I first heard this news on TV, I really felt sorry for the North Korean citizens who suffer from hunger and insanitary conditions. The governments of this company never try to use their money to solve such problems, or even more, they spend a lot of money launching those rockets. . . . which will never be of use.  I am interested in North Korea. I felt relieved that there were no casualties. And the horror of North Korea was felt again. The government of Japan should addressed more quickly. So Japan should pay attention to North Korea carefully. I want keep more attention to the news.  Despite North Korea's provocation fell to the failure, they will continue to provoke. The countries bordering North Korea such as South Korea and China are now undergoing severe political changes, North Korea will never disregard this chance. I think not only bordered countries but UN have to intensify the pressure toward North Korea to stop it's provocation.  When North Korea failed to launch the rocket, Japanese government failed also. It failed to get information about the rocket. It didn't know whether the rocket was launched or not, and needless to say, whether the launch was succeeded or not. I suspect Japanese government have the ability to save Japanese people in a crisis.  At first, I thought it became safer after North Korea failed to launch the missile. A sense of security that Japan has a great technique reliably enough to intercept the missile supported my thought. But an article which I read after the english class made my mind. The article said that Japan has a 80% success rate in intercepting the missile. I was very shocked about it. If North Korea succeeded in launching the missile, it produced a number of casualties 20% of the time! We cannot guarantee that next time will be safe like this time so I thought Japan should improve the technique of interception as soon as possible.  Having read this article, I recognized the sense of crisis and thought about what Japan should do to cope with it. But, what I want to say is that Japan should not just criticize North Korea for conducting things such as launching missiles but should try to know why they are doing this kind of provocation, and then we should find a solution.  I think the main purpose of North Korea's long-range rocket launching was to boost national prestige and to congratulate Kim Jong-Un for assuming the new leader. However North Korea's rocket launch failed. This failure to launch the rocket showed that North Korea lost prestige in a new order. Therefore I'm worried that North Korea will carry out the third nuclear test. Japanese government should watch out North Korea's action continuously. Concerning Japanese government reaction this time, I agree with ID12031's opinion. Japanese government needs to reexamine the ways of providing people with information to save nation.  I'm relieved to hear that North Korea's long-range rocket failed, but also I feel very scary. There are some reason. First, I believe international relations is not good between North Korea and Japan. As everyone knows, there is the issue of abducted Japanese taken to North Korea. Some North Korean doesn't like Japanese, and it makes situation worthier. If a launch is successful next time, it is obvious that Japan would be threatened more than now. Second, I think North Korea takes pride in own country and abilities, and this failure will lead them to make better rocket enthusiastically. I expect they will try hard again and again and success in launching a rocket in near future. It scared me a lot. To cope effectively with a terrible situation, I consider that Japan should gather more information about them. Only a few information, we are not able to do anything good for Japan.  When I heard that North Korea planned to launch the rocket, I was indignant at a lack of repentance. If I remember correctly, this is the third time to launch the rockets or missiles without the approval of North Korea's neighbors, like Japan. I speculate that this launch is for celebrating Kim Il Sung's birthday or appealing Kim Jong-Un's authority. Also I guessed that it would not be going to be well, so my guess was exactly right. Now, I am relieved that no one was killed in this matter. But I am afraid for the safety of the scientists of North Korea. Because the leaders have executed cruelly many people made blunders or resist the government. Since the leader changed, this action has been activated. If worst comes to worst, they have already died. North Korea may run a nuclear test or launch the rocket again in the future. In order to save the nation certainly, I suggest that the Ministry of Defense improve the system to announce. And needless to say, we should keep to paying special attention to this matter.  As the article said, North Korea's long-range rocket failed. I am relieved to hear that. However, now I am worried about what North Korea does next. If they are going to make new rocket, it will make matters worse. I really want to say that Japanese government should think about North Korea's actions.  Failure of the launch of the missile made me relieved. However North Korea is still furthering military development, so there are some uneasiness left. Military affairs of Japan is not prepared, so Japan will be threatened in North Korea. To solve this@@@Japan should elaborate the armament and the measure for protecting its own country rather depending on foreign countries.  Many people say that they feel safer after North Korea failed the rocket launch, but I am not one of them. I am rather afraid that North Korea creates another rocket, likely to be a stronger one, to actually attack Japan. I think that the Japanese government has to be more desperate to prepare for anything that can happen. It is very important that the government makes Japanese citizens always aware of the danger they are facing and have them ready for escape.  I think North Korea will make a better rocket next time from experience of this failure. Japan should have a better military to protect own country.  I felt worried about North Korea's future. Because I would expect Kim Jong-Un to reset his country, govern people to guarantee good life of people but he ordered rocket launch. To launch rocket and nuclear missile means North Korean people is more severe life. Now North Korea is further isolating itself by engaging in provocative acts. I think that many countries, especially China and Russia should put pressure on North Korea.  I was relieved to hear the news and I want to ring an alarm bell. Certainly North Korea failed to launch the missile. But a nuclear test will be made again. The national government did not show North Korea strong manner. I think this is the problem.  I disagree because I think that Senkaku island is Japan's island.  I think that Japanese government is really weak about diplomacy. So I think we need a strong leader like Mr. Ishihara.  It is fear to have felt, when I looked at this news for the first time. Although the missile test went wrong this time, next, it may succeed. If it is a nuclear missile, Japan destroys completely. Therefore, a foreign country needs to put pressure more. So I think it is a international problem.  I felt that even if the leader was changed, North Korea didn't change, or even got worse. The old-fashioned political system in this country need reformation, and should be democratized. To realize this, the most important partner of the North Korea, China should make move to change this country, but I think it is difficult.  i also think it is very terrible that North Korea's rocket broke up around Japanese territory  i think Japan should not have a better military to protect own country.  I think North Korea's rocket is terrible.  I am worried whether scientists concerned with this failure will be killed. As soon as Kim Jong-Un get this state, he purgeD a high officer who had made a mistake. Therefore I think that he may purge the scientists too.  I strongly agree with this comment. Japan is near North Korea and Japan has no organization for battle. Of course, pacifism is very important and indispensable, but I thought that how we deal with the problem of nuclear terror. At the same time, I like South Korea, so I care about the country and issue of north and south.  I partly disagree with the opinion above. I suppose what we Japanese must do first to deal with the problem is to talk with them. We lack that effort. Japan has declared not to have the force in order to keep its country safe. As a world's first model, we Japanese should think the way to solve such problem without the military force.  I think nuclear weapons are frightening. Abolition of nuclear weapons should.  According the article , North Korea's long-range rocket failed. I hear the news, I feel relieved.  I think, this news is so terrible. In fact, North Korea's rocket launch failed. But, if North Korea complete this technology, they surely aim at Japan. I'm afraid of that. And, I get angry at Japanese government. North Korea is near to Japan. But, information about this happening was so slowly. The government have to tell important things to nations more quickly.  This time their rocket launch failed, and we are relieved to hear that. But it is not sure whether they will fail again next time. so we should prepare. But we can't shoot down their missile without other nation's help. In this case, it was US surveillance satellites that monitored the launch. And needless to say, we should maintain good international relations with China and South Korea. It is impossible to keep North Korea from using a nuclear weapon and assaulting other countries, without the cooperation of all nations. But should North Korea alone be condemned ? Many countries still have a nuclear weapon and other dangerous weapons. They don't use them now, but no one can declare that they will not use them forever. Certainly, North Korea is dangerous. But we shouldn't forget North Korea is not the only one nation that is dangerous.  When I heard the news, I was very surprised. I was anxious for the launching. I want North Korea to behave on common sense and don't want them to make world dangerous. Also I think Japanese authority should have courage to say no to them.  I agree with the opinion because I think Japanese diplomacy as weak knee. Japan will be worried, if the stance change.  Many people make fun of North Korea's failure in launching the rocket but because their military powers are quite violent, no one will be laughing when they succeed. I thought that North Korea's experiment in launching the rocket was fearing for Japan as we do not have military powers to fight back.  Many people are forced to live a poor life in North Korea but still they cry when Kim Jong II died and they have high respects for their leader. I think this is because they don't know how the government works in other country and how people live in those country. I think that if North Korea has a money to make weapons, government should use those money to help nation have a better living. This missile problem might seem like it is a problem between North Korea and the country around North Korea but I think this is a problem essential to settle, to make North Koreans living better too.  I feel so terrible. If Japan might be attacked by North Korea with rocket, I couldn't sleep easily. I want to be peace.  It is lucky that nobody got injured this time, but if the North Korea restart testing nuclear weapon we have to be aware of them always. That means we will have to carry so much stress in our life. Needless to say that is not the way people live, so we have to solve the problem immediately.  North Korea should realize that they have been accused of their action by many countries. And, they are received an economic sanction, so they should refrain from provocative behavior. But, we can not solve the problems only by sanction. We have to negotiate with them positively.  We do not never do war. Even if we are attacked by rocket launch which made in North Korea. Because we know it's terrible to do war by our experiences. So we should talk to them and find peaceful resolution.  I feel relieved to hear the news that the launch failed. Also I think we have to be a good terms with North Korea. If North Korea has hostility for us, North Korea may try to fire the rocket again I think that Asian countries around North Korea should impose sanctions on that country. As it is, North Korea repeat rocket launch.  I think so too. I can't speculate what their plot to do next too. So we should think about them carefully. We must not look at this problem as bystanders. "
JOC JOC-13A-02N 1.95 "I was surprised at reading this article. Because, gun was made by printer. This means that anyone will be able to make gun in near future. I think to own weapon for self defense is wrong. We have to reduce weapon in the world. So, we need ruleS of plastic gun. I hope that 3D printer useful for development of the world.  I think it is very dangerous to distribute the blueprints for the gun online. Getting the blueprints online means that lay public can make guns for themselves. Of course, gun is a dangerous substance, and there is a possibility to cause a horrible accident. I consider that 3D plastic printer is convenient, however, I think we have to think about how to use it over and over.  I thought this is a awful news. The reason is that a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone, so making guns will be very easy thing. If this happens, people in countries which ban gun use can get guns illegally. Illegal possession of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns before they are completely available online. I think regulations through the Internet is effective measure for example.  This news gave me a great impact. That is because guns can be produced by 3D printer. I think this new development will give us bad luck in the future. This reason to think so is that gun will be more easy to make and more popular than ever before. More people have guns than ever before. Murders happen because there are guns in our life. If you want to reduce the number of murders, you have to reduce the number of guns. However, the new development will increase the number of guns. In short, the news will produce bad luck, no good luck.  When i read this article, I was surprised. To tell the truth, I didn't even know much about the 3D printer. Of course, 3D printer is an epoch-making invention because it makes it possible to copy all kinds of things. However, according to the article, I also think that it causes serious trouble if you used it in the wrong way. If anyone can make his own gun easily, it will bring chaos. There is no need to get a gun easily. I hope the US government will make a new strict regulation about this situation early.  I was surprised that guns can be produced by 3D printer. I think that new invention may inflict damage on us in the future. If guns can manufacture easily, people can get them easily rather than before. However, if the government does not enact law, people may abuse them. So I think that the government should tighten up regulation.  So I think that the government should tighten up regulation.  I think the plastic guns are very dangerous. That cannot be detected by walk-through metal detectors, and that can kill people. People with the plastic gun can take a plane without being by the metal detector. I watched a news that a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. After all, we shouldn't have not only plastic guns, but also usual guns.  When I first know about the 3D printer, I was really amazed at its function . The invention of 3D printer is a great achievement, but I have a concern about the outcome of it. The 3D printer can produce guns. It means in the future everyone will be able to produce guns easily. This situation is really dangerous. So there should be some kind of regulations when we use the 3D printers.  I cannot see the handgun directly. Because I see the handgun via comic books and televisions, my image of it is the weapon just to kill people. After I read this article, I hit upon a question, ""Is there a need to improve the handgun?"" If the handgun develops, such the plastic handgun which is undetectable like this article or further miniaturization, the number of people killed will increase. I think that it's wasteful and miserable to use human intelligence not on something to save people like medical science but on something to make people grieve like an atomic bomb. Developments of new products need much time and money. We had better invest our exertions into public happiness or utensils which make the society more convenient instead of something which is doubtful whether legal or illegal.  I have not known about 3D printer until I read this article and was very surprised at the function of 3D printer such as making the plastic handgun. I think that invention of 3D printer in itself is so amazing, but spread of 3D printer is dangerous, because everyone can get weapon such as plastic handgun. Therefore, I suggest that government of each nation should regulate using 3D printer to keep safety in future.  First of all, I was surprised at this news by knowing that I thought that it would be in the future and have already realized. But I felt awful simultaneously. The blueprints of the gun can download online that written in this article, it seems that peoples who downloaded it are more than 60, 000 peoples in Japan. That is, it can be said that is theoretically possible for peoples in Japan able to print the gun from data. And if 3D-printed gun were to spread widely, anyone would be able to make gun, and no customer buying history and no criminal record of the gun couldn't help spreading. In this way, there are many risk when 3D printers spread to home, but also said that may cause a revolution in relation to design and manufacturing. If we can get design like the gun, we may be able to print things at home without bothering to go shopping. When it becomes so, our lives probably will become convenient more than expected.  When I read this article, I was simply impressed by the advance in technology. Not long ago, we could not print something in various colors but only in black and white. Now we can compose guns by 3D printers! How cool is that? Of course it is not appropriate for ordinary people to make guns. However, I think plastic guns should be allowed by laying down some rules. The reason is that the advance in technology is a result of improvement in human intelligence, and we should approve and admire that. To consider plastic guns as a symbol of the human intelligence, we had better think of the way they can be used peacefully. First, the government should ban putting blueprints of guns online so that ordinary people cannot easily make them. Second, police authorities should arrest people who are having guns with no permission as soon as they found them. For now, I can only think of these rules, but I am sure there are many other rules to be set.  Guns are only instrument that injure person, this is my opinion. I think that we should not produce guns because this behavior falls far short of a peaceful world and using these weapons is gangsterism. But it is also a fact that it has been taking a long time and a great effort for producing guns, and it curb a useless war. I accept this fact and think of gun this after time.  Many people say that the guns made from plastic are really dangerous because they cannot be noticed with metal detectors. These guns would make terrorisms and crimes easier to be performed, but probably we can't create the perfect regulations to prevent them from being spread across the world. People developed technology so highly and rapidly that our moral standards don't keep up with it. I'm afraid that someday we'll be killed, or now we might be being killed, by our own technology, which has been out of our hands.  Why Cody Wilson developed 3D-printed  handgun?To self-defense of civilian?Just a curiosity?I think he should not have to developed and to published blueprint on the web all the more, because in the U. S, the accident by gun for children become a issue. By the way, I recall the terrorism in Boston. I thought we can't notice who is a terrorist, if 3D-printed  handgun will be made in standard home, it's become more difficult to find dangerous person. So I propose exploit 3D-printed  bulletproof vest.  This news clearly showed us that a 3D plastic printer had an enough ability to copy such a complicated product accurately. It means that 3D printers would play a very important role in the manufacture of industrial products in the near future, since they could help people who don't have special facilities make products or develop their inventions. On the other hand, I strongly disagree with the idea of publishing the blueprints for the gun online, because it will allow everyone to make guns. This makes it easier for terrorists and radical criminals around the world to get arms instead of smuggling. Cody Wilson should make use of the great skills of 3D printers in a peaceful way.  I think it is a bad news because people should not use force easily. 3D-printed  handgun must change our ideas about force. Perhaps, we will regard 3D-printed  handgun as a toy even though we can kill a man by it. If we have a strong power, we must take on responsibility for it. But, 3D-printed  handgun may make us forget the responsibility by getting easily. So, I oppose 3D-printed  handgun.  At first, this news sounded interesting to me because we can make anything easily by using 3D-printer . However, it means anyone can make weapons like this article. It is so dangerous. I think 3D-printer  is good thing and I want to use this for fun but I never want to use this for fighting or making weapons. So we should think about this problem and make some rules to use 3D-printer  for example, ""Making weapons by using 3D-printer  is prohibited. "" In my opinion, all guns should be banned by the low. So if this 3D-printed handgun has destructive power as equal as normal gun, this gun is also had to be regulated. But The United States does not even have sufficient ""normal"" gun control. I doubt this gun is banned in real.  I was surprised that guns are produced by 3D printer. I think 3D printer is the very useful instrument. A great achievement of technology such as 3D printer can produce guns. It is full of inconsistencies. I think the gun is one of the most dangerous instruments. The guns can kill people. The guns cause dangerous matters. I hope that the guns are banned in the world.  I feel that I'm very terrible about this news while I admired innovation. Now, 3D plastic printer has not yet become a common sight , however, some other time, it will be spread to the general public. When it became so, on the one hand, we get convenience and originality. On the other hand, we will have the risk. The risk is very serious. It means that a terrorist brings in a gun in secret and is usable to hijack an airplane. The gun which is not discovered in a metal detector makes it easy that someone perform terrorism. For reasons of the above, I think this technique is splendid, but it must be prohibited from making a gun by using a 3D printer.  When I watched this news for the first time, I was surprised very much. Why he would show a figure of setting of the gun? He has got rid of value of one invention. The new technique has turned into the weapon. I think that ""the technological change"" is synonymous with ""the evolution of the weapon"". The science does the life of people usefully, but makes danger at the same time. It is sad that the invention such as the 3D printer is applied to a weapon.  I didn't know anything about 3D-printed handgun, and I am surprised to know that there is such a thing. The fact that handguns can easily be made is too dangerous. There are many shooting incidents happening in America and it will only encourage these affairs. It is necessary for people in America to think about the meaning of guns ownership.  I was so surprised to watch this news that Cody Wilson innovated 3D-handgun . 3D-handgun  can be made easily, cheaply, so it means handgun is more familiar to us. It is true that Cody Wilson is the great inventor, but he cannot contribute to the world and his invention may make the world worse. Especially, in the U. S. A, as it's law permit people in the U. S. A to have handgun, the invention of the 3D-handgun  will let them get and use handgun more easily, and may cause a lot of shooting incidents, in my opinion. So I agree Charles Schumer's opinion that 3D-handgun  should be banned. In Japan, it's law prevent people in Japan from having handgun. However, the invention of weapon, such as 3D-handgun , may invite shooting trouble in Japan. I think that we have to think about the danger of having weapon, in order to avoid the damage of weapon.  I strongly criticize the 3D-printed  handgun. This is because the development has very dangerous effects on all countries around the world. If the plastic gun is permitted, anyone who has a 3D printer and plan of the gun can get power to kill others. Moreover, the gun is not detectable by metal detectors, and so the police cannot determine who has the gun. As a result, not only in America, but also in all countries around the world, the number of murders will sharply rise. From these reasons, the 3D-printed  handgun should be banned in the world.  When I read this article, I felt very scared of the fact making handguns by 3D printer. I think we have the familiar image of the printer. Nowadays, almost families have the printers and often use them. So I am afraid that we can be easy to create handguns in the near future. though it is not illegal for people to have them in U. S, I think making them by ourselves is more dangerous than that. The government should pay attention not to make them easily and spread them illegally.  I was surprised at this article, when I first read it. Because it is easy to make the gun. If we can really make it, I can't sleep deeply. Because a person may sight me. I think to make it is very dangerous, so the government should prohibit to make new gun with 3D printer. In the world, people invented the useful things, but is it OK!? People maybe surpass the line which God allow people do. We should think about the moral range!! When I read the article, I was surprised at the technology of 3D-printed handgun and at the progress of technology. However, I felt danger at the same time. Permitting everyone to hold the gun means that everybody has the power to kill persons. This will make it easy for the people such as terrorists to get their arm strong. Once the blueprints for the gun is published online, it is difficult to delete it. So I think that we should think about it again and again.  Well, I don't understand why they've made a new type of gun today. These days there are many controversy about gun regulation in the U. S because of the unstoppable occurrence of gun tragedy. President Obama has mentioned the reinforcement of the regulation. The U. S is at the turning point. Therefore the development of the plastic gun is out of the step with the times. Plastic gun may worsen the situation. Why do you have to make a new type of gun?To save your life?For what you call 'a self-defense'?Why does it has to be plastic?To pass metal detector test?It really sucks. No matter how they might think, I don't think those guns will make us happy.  First of all, I was surprised at the news in two ways. One is the existence of an 3D printer and its technology that can even make handguns. The other is to have a handgun is common for people in America although the matter is now controversial. I cannot understand why Americans feel such great interest in guns. Also, I wonder if they don't get satisfaction from an air gun. I think a gun made from plastic is very dangerous because the general public will be able to own it easily. In my opinion, guns only become tools to hurt people or to bring chaos to the society, having a plastic gun should not be allowed. In conclusion, I hope legislation immediately to make a gun with a 3D printer illegal.  I was really surprised when I read this article. I did not even know about 3D printer until I read this news. I think it is amazing that we found many kinds of new technologies but we need to be careful how to use them. I think it is really dangerous if anyone can make their own guns easily. It will bring us chaos. I think the US' government should be more careful about guns and should make more strict rules.  Surely it makes me feel anxious about plastic-made handguns, but it's difficult to restrict these guns, because, in the US , people have the right to have guns legally. In fact, Obama is having a hard time to make a gun control law. Rather, what I concern is that the Government makes the 3D printer illegal thanks to this affair. The printer itself is so hopeful that NASA has bestowed a $125, 000 grant on a research corporation to pursue the development of 3D-printable food(according to http://arstechnica. com/gadgets/2013/05/3d-printable-food-nasa-wants-a-taste/). We shouldn't see this problem in a single aspect.  I think gun made by 3d printer should be banned because it is copy but it can be used as a gun. 3d printer is epoch-making but has a lot of dangerous sides. However , if we use it in a true way, we will feel it is very convenient machine.  Surely, 3D printer makes the standard of living because anyone can create whatever they want to create. But, creating the matter that can be harmful for other people or unlawful like gun is probable. So creating like this must be banned, and it will be excellent if that can.  I don't see why 3D-printer  handgun issue is so controversial. Of course it seems to be dangerous that anybody can make handguns easily by using 3D-printer , but there are so many dangerous things, which can kill people, around us. For example you can make poison gas by mixing dish washing liquid or whatever. I think this 3D-printer  issue has given us a vivid impression and that is all. I mean our daily life will not change even if 3D-printed handguns spread.  It's really surprising for me that the technology of 3D printer has been available in such a way. And in my opinion, from the point of view of safety, the gun should be banned despite it includes the parts of steel.  This should be illegal. Because people can make weapon which can kill people very easily. More important is this gun is made by plastic. Because of this a metal detector becomes useless. So it becomes very hard to find guns.  In the US, it is impossible to ban using guns because guns are too common to ban. But I think if the guns become more available, people will get less attention to human's life. So, I think spreading 3D-printed handgun may make more amount of terrible or criminal cases. Of course, guns are useful to protect owner's body from something dangerous. But they must know they all can be criminal by using it and regulate within bounds.  I watched 3D printer also on television immediately after reading this report. I think it dangerous that a gun can be made also from whom if I use this printer. However, I think that 3D printer is uncanny and useful. I think that it is necessary to make law so that 3D printer cannot be abused. Then, I think that everybody can use 3D printer in comfort.  I already knew that there is the technique of the 3D-printer. However I was surprised to know that this technique can make a gun. Because I did not think that it could make the thing which a strong shock hung like a gun. This technology is very convenient. But it is clear to become the big problem when people can easily make a gun in this way. I think that legal regulation is ineffective. I hope that the system which people can't produce the dangerous material is made.  I was surprised to hear this news very much. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. It is awful!! I hope that the casualties case using this gun does not happen.  If the blueprints of the gun would be published online, we would be able to make guns ourselves by 3D printer. I think this easiness is terrible. The easier we can get guns , the more accident or criminal happen. 3D printer is probably convenient but we should restricted carefully what is allowed to make by the printer and what is not. Otherwise, our safety would be endangered.  Guns are shouldn't made easily. We have to ban the plastic guns;otherwise we will live in a dangerous world in the future. there are many risk when 3D printers spread to home, but also said that may cause a revolution in relation to design and manufacturing.  After I read this article, I was really surprised about handguns can make by 3D printer. Also I felt scare about the news. This is because near the future, if 3D printer will spread to the public, a lot of people are able to get handguns easily. In Japan, there is a law of control guns strictly, but if 3D printer guns were spread, that law will not able to work anymore. I think this situation will bring more crime. So I think we need some laws about 3D printer which control weapons strictly.  I was surprised when I read this news. Plastic handgun can be made by 3D printer. So everyone can get plastic handgun easily if everyone become to use 3D printer. But plastic handgun is very dangerous and it can kill someone. So I think that government should not allow to make plastic handgun by 3D printer.  I think the news that the world's first gun made almost entirely by a 3D plastic printer has been successfully fired in Texas is very serious problem in the world. It is because plastic guns are cheaper than metal one. And also, you can make them easily if you have a 3D printer. So the peace might be broken by gangsters who have plastic guns. It is true that plastic guns are not as powerful as metal one because of the difference between raw materials. However, they would be powerful weapons because of technical innovation. Governments in the world should make building a gun with a 3D printer illegal.  I was impressed very much, when 3D printer was made. It is because 3D printer can make various things if a plan is got. However, 3D printer will also make a dangerous thing to us. This occurrence will give us fear. We should eliminate a dangerous plan from the Internet. And we would like to use wonderful 3D printer safely.  After I read this article except the last paragraph, I was surprised at the 3D plastic printer gun, and I think it will become very strong and portable weapon. But I red the last paragraph, I was angry that it became illegal. Of course The Undetectable Firearms Act is good law because any guns which cannot be found by metal detectors enable us to do an act of terrorism. So any guns which are not made of any metal is illegal. But the gun of Wilson is inserted metals, so metal detectors can find out it. In addition, 3D plastic printer gun has been successfully fired in test. So it has no problem about security. So I think it should be legal, and Undetectable Firearms Modernisation Act are illegal.  I think that printed handgun shouldn't be permitted. I don't intend to criticize American Gun Culture. But I think that gun should be use by adults who use for protecting themselves and their family. If printed handgun is spread, children can get handguns easily and children who don't know meaning and usage of gun have accidents. And simply, easier americans get guns, more accidents are connected with guns happen. So I think printed handgun shouldn't be permitted.  It is wonderful technology to develop 3D-printed handgun. Many people probably don't imagine this new gun. We can make gun more easily with low material cost. However, this gun also have a lot of risks. Recently, the accident related with gun happened in U. N. More and more people think the gun should be regulated strictly than now. On the other hand, many people still think we should have guns for protection of own life. So the demand of the gun is high even now. Under this condition, it is difficult that we regulate illegal gun with 3D printer completely. We should know how to live safely in gun politics.  I read this article both comfortably and uneasily. Of course its very exciting that we'll be able to make 3D-printed gun far more easily and with less cost. But simultaneously this technology will be very very dangerous. A dangerous thing like this gun will be made too much easily by the normal people who buy this 3D-printer. Recently lots of incident have been led by gun in the US for example. In even Japan, this sort of incident will be likely to increase by these technology. We must be cautious for this news.  It was really surprising to read this article. I got some knowledge about 3D printer at a museum in London, but I didn't know that even handgun can be made by it and 3D printer is so practical now. Of course, I agree with making 3D-printed handgun illegal. If handgun become available so easily, the number of killed people must increase much. I can't imagine the world people can acquire such a terrible one. However, I think it means that current technology are advancing highly, and we can apply in many place. For example, if we have a 3D printer at home, we can try shoes on, and it will make more common to buy something online.  I think we should make the international law about 3D-printed handgun. I thought it's very interesting to make handgun by 3D printer but it is also dangerous when I read this article . Furthermore, if technology progresses, a gun without metal will be made. I think. Then, what do we do? The gun is undetectable when it is tested by metal detectors. We cannot deal with the situation. . . In addition, American president, Mr. Obama, asserts to regulate to have gun in a whole nation. So, now I think we should make the international law about the gun and we will make safe using 3D printer.  Now, in America, the gun is illegal and most of people have it to protect themselves. It is no doubt the innovation will be the cause of encouraging the ""gun politics"". people would be able to get it cheaper and easier. Certainly, the technology is really amazing and surprise, but I'm afraid it would be abused by someone.  I was so scared hearing the news. It is like dynamite produced by Einstein which is used for war against his view. I think technology should be used for the purpose of improving our lives and affording us happiness. I know it is said that 3D printer has many worthless points. By using it, you can reduce the cost of trial manufacture, and you can produce easily an unique, only one thing in the world, such as private memorial things and so on. It is clear that it is never anything frightening us. Therefore, I agree with making building a gun with 3D printer illegal. I think the legislations should be introduced rapidly. In addition, I think that some function of 3D printer, which make it impossible to produce every arms, should be developed. we can't completely control lawbreaker, but we can lose the root.  If the 3D printer prevail among public citizens, this type of guns will be easily available to anyone. For sure, we should strengthen the current law to prevent it. Laws, however, never have a power to stop crimes perfectly: in fact, laws against murder do not necessarily prevent it. So we have to come up with new effective measures that reinforce the laws as soon as we can;otherwise the crime rate will be assumed to be even higher in the near future and the tragedies like the terrorist attack in Boston will increase.  It is true that gun made by 3D printer is very useful, especially we can make it with low cost and easily. But if it is spread in the world, we cann't sleep comfortably and even go around own house. We never allow it.  I agree with ID13013's opinion. The world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation about this kind of gun. As he said, it is one of the good ideas to restrict to download the blueprints. Even though it is not commonplace for people to own a 3D plastic printer yet, it will spread in the near future. If it happens, people will be able to make many kinds of things including dangerous things, and the society will be in danger. So it is important to solve this issue quickly.  I red your comment and I had different ideas from you. Of course your idea isn't mistake completely, but it is too pacifism. I think wars are never gone unless human is exterminated. So weapons are needed forever. In Constitution of Japan a war is prohibition, but it means war of aggression and it doesn't include war of aggression. So we must have weapons for attack of foreign country. Japanese is Peace at any price mind set including you, but weapons will be needed someday. So the skill to make guns by 3D printer is so useful! I agree with ID13048's opinion. I also did not know about 3D printer until I read this article. The spread of 3D printer for private citizens is so dangerous, because they can make weapons and use them easily. Therefore, I think that the government of each countries must establish new law over treatment of 3D printer and increasing consciousness of danger to 3D printer is must.  I disagree with naoeID13018's opinion. Of course guns injure person. But in US, policemen uses guns to keep the country safe and some people uses guns for their hobbies, such as hunting. I think it is difficult to call them ""gangsterism"". You should think why guns became being needed before you declare guns are only instrument that injure person.  I agree with your opinion. I also think it is dangerous horribly that the plastic gun readily available. I came up with it to regulate it in each countries, but it is insufficient when viewed from the standpoint of counter-terrorism. So, I feel the plan to regulate it using the international law of you is great.  I partly agree with ID13062's idea. When I saw the news on TV, I knew that this technology has affirmative sides. For example, 3D printer is applied to making clothings and medical instruments. So governments of each nation should regulate the risky use of 3D printer such as making plastic handgun by it. I think it is important to make sure of the facts, understand a use of the technology and think carefully about it.  I disagree with your idea. It is not wonderful technology to make 3D-printed handgun, it is dangerous idea. We hope peace world. We hope the world nobody has weapons. I think if people can make gun easily, it is not good for us at all.  I agree with ID13036's idea. Not just plastic guns but usual metal guns should be prohibited. In the US, people buy guns to protect their families and property, yet guns took their precious lives. The fact that anyone can make plastic guns easily means that anyone can kill people around them easily. It must not be allowed.  This news was shocking to me. Guns can make easier than before, and are made by general person like us. It is really dangerous i think. If guns are made by children or criminals, that's really serious news! Of course blue print gives us a lot of good skill, but also it is really danger. So we have to make a mature rule when we use a 3D printer.  I agree with kajikosei's opinion. It is surely this technology is very comfortable, but it is more likely to be abused. However the technique is necessary to make our life better more. I want to establish the regulation method before this technique is generalized I agree with him. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment.  i agree with you. guns only can harm people, we cannot create its too much. a nation have to make a law to ban the plastic guns and guarantee the safety of citizens.  I didn't agree with Keisuke. I think the fact that 3D plastic printers can make guns means that anyone becomes able to easily make a gun, if he or she has no knowledge about it. So I want to insist 3D plastic printers have to be illegal! When I read this article, I was amazed how sophisticated today's technology is. Today's technology becomes more and more convenient. Actually such technology improves our lives, but we should be careful the way we use it. It could be danger if we use it wrong way.  I disagree with your opinion. Actually development of 3D-guns includes some risk, but it can improve technology. Today, technology is always around our lives. We can no longer live without technology.  I absolutely agree with you. The legal regulation like the law is not always effective. So we need to do something more fundamental about this issue.  I can't agree with you. I can understand you mean that dangers in the world are not diminished, and 3D printer has a big impact but that is all. However I think it has greatly positive and negative effects on our daily lives. As we deal with every one thing seriously, the world we live can be changed .  I was not interested in a 3D printer very much, but when I read this article, I get interested in the technology. The technology has some dangerous points, but I understand its useful points. However, guns are very dangerous. I think 3D printer need some rules so that it is not used for bad things.  I read your comments and [ agree with your opinion that handguns can make by 3D printer. This means anyone can have handguns near the future. . I think we have to make the rules or laws about 3D printer and use with safety. In Japan, we are more peaceful than other countries so, we have to keep or improve this condition. . . . !! I think this machine is an epoch making invention but it will be a weapons when people use this in a different way. If everyone can make some weapons with using 3D printer, this world is filled with weapons and cannot live safety. So I also think we should make a rule or law of 3D printer. If we can use 3D printer safety , it will be a good entertainment.  I think this news is awful. The reason that I think making guns will be very easy thing when a 3D plastic printer is available to everyone. if this happens, people can get guns easy. The existence of guns surely results to confusion of society. Thus the world authorities should discuss carefully the regulation of these guns.  I'm really surprised to hear that news . As ID13036 said , a child who was given a gun by his parents killed his sister. This news made me think that all nations should ban people from using guns freely . However, if the company publishes the blueprints for the gun online , people all around the world, for example Japan , where people can't gain guns freely, will gain guns more freely. All nations should discuss how to use 3DS printer carefully.  I think your opinion is nice one. but it is difficult to remove gam from society. Because gun has not only but point. For example gun help defense by my self.  3D printing is revolutionary idea. I want this technology used safety. If it is used for bad thing such as making guns, it surely harms many people. "
JOC JOC-13A-05N 1.9 "It was shocking for me to hear that more and more people are complaining about the noise of children, as Japanese society ages. However, it was interesting to know the reason why compliments are increasing: aging society makes people less accustomed to hearing and tolerating the noise of children. This should be taken seriously in Japan today, because declining birth rates could be worsened by the problem. If many people keep the stance, young women will not have a choice but to give up child-bearing. Then, the number of taxpayers who have to pay for social security will decrease, while the number of elderly people is increasing rapidly. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi mentioned in the passage. We really have to push child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda to make people think more and more children are needed for future Japan. I would also like them to notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises.  Japan has a problem now. It is aging Japan. These days the number of children is decreasing and the number of older people is increasing. The number of labors in Japan will be decreasing in the future if this situation is continuing. It is high time we started to take steps against this problem. However, ""aging Japan complains over the noise of children"". In other words, ""As Japan's population declines, intolerance of children and the noise they make is increasing in a society getting less accustomed to hearing them"". This is a serious problem. We should have a wider mind. If we cannot do that, Japan will not continue to stay superpower in the world. Why? Because old people play by money, but they cannot make money. Young people can make money and support old people. So, now young people is needed. Consequently, we must be tolerant of the noise of children.  I got angry about the complainers. Children are noisy by nature, and they learn many things by playing and romping. I think declining birthrate seem to make less interest in children. I realized why the declining birthrate is becoming a big issue. Japanese people pay too much attention to their businesses and less attention to their kindnesses. And the national character caused the results. Should we demand reparation for child's growth? Should we require fines when we are disturbed our silence? If people have a little wider mind, the troubles will decrease and Japanese birthrate may increase.  To tell the truth, I was often uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and because of that they should be noisy. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. I think the number of children who are noisy because they try to get their own way is increasing recently. That's why I was upset about those noisy children. However, after read this news story, I thought there was some truth in what it said. I agreed with Maeda, who said fewer children makes people less accustomed to hearing the noise they naturally make. I also agreed with Hosaka, who said, ""Of course we need to be considerate towards people living in the neighborhood, but it is impossible to make places where children play in total silence. "" So, it's may be important that we come in contact with children and give more chance or place for them to play actively.  I agree that children are not a social nuisance. Children betray their straight feelings, that's why they are vigor and noisy. But we adult no longer have that candidness. If children became keeping quiet like a doll, the world would lose energy. I think the noise which youngsters make have a power to make people cheerful. In additional, the housings nearby school or day care center must be reduced the price. So people living in the neighborhood should tolerate some noise.  I also think that it is true that it is impossible to ask children to sit still all day long so they do not make noise. I do not like children because they always make noise. But I understand it is what cannot be helped. So, parents should discipline a child so as to children will not be put to shame in the future. It is no exaggeration to say that the future of children depend on the disciplining of children by parents.  It is natural that children make some noise when playing outside. Those who complain about the noise children make definitely used to make noise and sometimes used to bother their neighbors when they were children. In addition, I think people should realize that not just parents but all the people in a whole society are responsible for education of children. When I was an elementary school student, I played outside with my friends living nearby my house every day. Their parents and elderly neighbors always greeted playing children and made us greet them back. Moreover, sometimes they told us to be careful of cars and bicycles, not to damage walls and flower beds, and not to make too much noise. Through these kinds of communication with neighbors, my friends and I learned manners in a society. I really appreciate my neighbors who brought me up in a different way from my parents' or school's ones. Recently, it has come to be difficult to help young parents and bring up children by a whole society. However, people have to understand how hard taking care of children is, and afford to worry about young parents and children. I hope that people keep a warm eye on them and communicate with them more frequently so that the number of complaints will decrease.  I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood when , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan.  This might sound ""incorrect"" but I am rather a person who complains about the noise of children. Those noises are simply annoying especially in crowded places. Moreover, I dislike a sort of common sense that everybody should like children and be kind to them. If I say that I don't like kids, many people will think that I'm a cold-hearted person. It is obvious that the declining birth rate problem is serious, tho. To solve the problem, a fundamental reform for the overpopulation in the metropolitan cities, such as Tokyo, is needed. The government cannot force its citizens to be tolerate of the noise children make, but it can lead them by reducing the stress of their life in overcrowded cities.  I was surprised to read this news. I think running around making noise is unavoidable to some extent and, should be allowed. First, It is necessary for the growth of children to play cheerfully. Almost all the people might made noise when they were children , and they become adults. Why are complainer angry so far? I can't understand them and think they are selfish. It is reasonable to complain if children make noise too much at midnight, but people should permit it in the daytime. Second, it is necessary to make the environment that parents can bring up a child without extra anxiety as a falling birth rate measure. If parents are worried that they are complained to people living in the neighborhood , they may hesitate to have a baby. This is a bad influence for the whole Japan.  I also feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children is natural things, so I can allow it and it is unbelievable that a lot of people complain about the noise of children. Therefore, I want many people who complain about it to remind of their childhood and kindness of neighborhood.  I think the government, day care centers and the neighbors should make every effort to overcome this issue. The government should inform more neighbors and other people of the risks that low birthrate and aging society brings such as problems of pensions or decline of the laboring population. And the day care centers should take measures to avoid the conflict. For example, they should more often take children to remote parks where children can play without caring others. And the neighbors should find some hobbies they can enjoy outside the houses where they do not feel unpleasant. The noise causes mainly in the daytime, so the neighbors should go out actively.  I think that the noise children make should be allowed. It is unfair of people to take children to task for their noise, because most people make noise when they are children. In fact, it is natural that children make noise, so it is impossible to ask children not to make noise. In my opinion, the noise is important for children. When children play with their friends, they are sure to make noise. In other words, the noise is their means of communication that they can express their feelings. Therefore the noise is indispensable for growing up. Of course, their parents need to pay attention to their noise, but it is quite wrong for their neighborhoods to sue them. We don't think the method of decreasing the noise, but we ourselves have to be more tolerant of their noise. If Japan is more broad-minded toward children and their parents, its birthrate will be increasing.  I think the noise of children is natural things. We should be tolerant for the noise of children because everyone made noise when they were children. In the first place, a man who is not able to allow this noise must cause trouble for someone in no small way. To allow each other is important.  It's true that people feel it noisy if children play outside. And it often happens to me when I study at home and It is disturbing, but I think we have to bear their noise because it's natural and everyone used to be like this. On the other hand, people have to care their children not to disturb neighborhood at night and in early morning. According to this article, there are many complaints about children's noise now. I think it is problem about not only low birthrate but also weak neighborhood's bond. In old days, people can be tolerant to the noise maybe because they know about each other. children are more noisy but much purer than usual people. And If people spend a few minutes with children and know their purity, they can put up with their noise.  I was shocked by having got to know this fact. ""We were once told not to take the children for a walk"" because they make too much noise"", said Ms. Maeda. I thought that it was amusing. Naturally it is things that a child frolics. And it is because it is wrong to consider that it is noise. However, although Japan has various problems therefore, it is such a situation. I think that there is probably the necessity that a child understands that it is not social trouble.  Come to think of it, in my childhood, my parents told me ""go outside rather than stay home"". I used to had a lot of time near my house. The neighborhood maybe felt so noisy, but My neighborhood have never got angry with me For the children, playing with their friends are essential for their mental or physical growth. Certainly, they sometimes don't notice their wrongdoing. At that time, people should point out to them. I'm sure such a tolerance of children is necessary in our society.  Recently the number of people who cannot tolerate something has been increasing. I'm from Wakayama, where is not so dense with people. Therefore the number of people who complain about the noise that children make is small. When I was an elementary schoolchild, I played in the school ground, but residents near the school didn't complain. I think this problem is not only because a declining birthrate but also a population density.  I'm sad to know such a complaints get increasing in Japan. As far as the idea is majority in our society, we cannot stop Japan's bad progress for more aged country and we can never re-improve the birthrate. Of course, some complaints are unreasonable and others are reasonable, so I am not going to deny all their criticism about the noise children often make. Still, I insist people should permit children to play outside merrily at least during the daytime because it is the most important activity for children to grow up soundly. Maybe different from many parents' opinion, it is not the most significant education to force their child to study hard from early age. This is because a toddler learns surprisingly numerous things voluntarily. Therefore we had better not restrict children's spontaneity.  When I read this article, I never believe there are people who accuse about noise at the court. It is natural that children make a noise. When people who hate a noise are childhood, did they not make the noise at all? Such a thing is impossible. When I was young, I made noise at a house, a kindergarten, a road, a shop, a train too. I think that children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly I thinks that there is no help for it that a child is noisy. It is recognition to raise a child in Great Society not to be enough in present Japan. We should be gentle for the noise of the child more. However, I can understand the feeling of a person thinking that child is noisy. It is that a parent warns a child with moderate condition to be important. It is wrong to complain for a parent making an effort.  When I read this article, I was shocked to know there are complains about the noise of children. But thinking carefully, I have also complains over it and do not like children because they are so noisy. Calmly thinking, I realized I should change my idea. Children go through so many and various things outside. In that way, they develop their senses and grow up robustly. The complain will put pressure on people having children . However, Japan has the lowest rate of children in the world. According to this article, Japan will be aging and will get less used to hearing children. I am afraid of the future of my country. Children make the future of the country. Considering this problem, I agree with the idea of Kuniko Inoguchi. I thought people should think about the complain over once more and understand that children are not a social nuisance. By pushing child-bearing issues to the top of social agenda, we need to decline the number of the people who think the complain are acceptable and to form a society filled with hope.  When I read this article, I felt that modern society has lost tolerance, so I felt disappointed. Everyone was a child and everyone has experience that plays outside and speaks in a loud voice. In spite of this, as they become adults, so they lose their memories of childhood. That there are many adults are uncomfortable with the noise of children is real. I think society like this accelerate more and more aging society with fewer children. Because young people loses the feeling that wants to give birth to and bring up children. Therefore if we can remember our childhood just a little bit, the noise of children may not become a social problem like this. To continue Japanese society we should have tolerance and it is necessary to make the environment people easy to bring up children.  First, I'm surprised at the expression of ""noise"". I have never thought the sound children make outside noisy, so I have never call it noise. And it is unbelievable that people complain over it just because they aren't used to it. In my opinion, children are precious for all Japanese people, facing aging society, so we should be more tolerant toward their voice and sound.  Reading this article, I felt that Japanese people have become to lose their tempers easily not only for the noise of children. For example, on the jam packed train, some people get angry for others' hand touching his body with strong. Moreover, other people get angry even for bumping others on the street. As for the noise of children, they get more angry than usual. As the article says, one of the reasons for these situations is the law birthrate. It seems to me that this problem is one of the most important problems that Japan has to solve as early as possible. The law birthrate means the small labor force in the future. As a result, Japan will get less revenue than now, and be obliged to reduce the scale of market. To solve this problem, we should promote the nation's welfare, especially child welfare. Concretely, we should increase the number of nursery schools and admit the childcare leave. Furthermore, to allow children to play to their hearts' contents, each of us should overlook the noise of children.  Compared with other noises, it is easy to make a complaint to the noise of children. I think it is necessary to generate the atmosphere that we should cherish the children foe an investment for the future . So, I want the justice to rule in favor of children.  When I read this article, I was surprised by the intolerance of the complainer. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, my and my friend's voice were noisy, but I hadn't be scolded for the noisy. Furthermore, we were praised that 'You are cheerful. Children should be so. ' These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience.  I think those opinions in the article are kind of extreme arguments. I don't think low birthrate and feeling of young people that they don't want to have a child are caused by only this noise problem. Although the number of waiting children for day care centers became zero in Yokohama these days, it is not enough yet in Japan. The number of childcare workers and public facilities like parks are also not enough. The social system that women can feel easy to work hasn't be established yet. Therefore, I think it's not Just about intolerances and just saying children are not social nuisance won't solve the condition. Tough I understand that people who can't tolerate noises and sue are not ordinary and normal, and that it is natural for children to make din, of course. To tell the truth, I can also agree with their feelings, I can't help to be irritated if I always have to hear the din. I think where the day care center is opened is clue to solve the problem. In my living city, elementary school and kindergarten are next-door and house are away from there. I know, in sprawling city it is difficult to do. . . . To sum up, it is so complicated that I can't say high-sounding ideas like we should tolerate for the future! not bit but din or noise In Japan , the number of children is decreasing yearly. That is why people tend not to bear the noise of children. But, it is wrong that being intolerance about the noise of children. Because all the people used to be children and make a noise. In spite of this fact , complaining over the noise of children is somewhat strange. To solve this problem , the way to co-exist between children and the others should be thought.  I can understand children's feeling to play outside and make some noise because I used to be like them and do like them. Every adults was a child and they shouted more than children who live now. I cannot understand why they complain children. As Japan's population declines, we should be kind to children and their parents. If more people don't want to have their kids, Japan would become weaker.  I think that noisy children is better than quiet children. Of course, romp is not good. Children can become noisy because they are healthy and obedient. If too pay attention to others when childhood, will save a stress. Anyway, parents have to pay attention to neighbors for good relations of neighbors. It should be happening never that children are accused.  I think why the noise of children attracts somebody's attentions now. I want to question how was the old days! I think nothing can be done about it. Children are such creatures as making a noise. It is a process in which all people has passed. We should endure it more. Because children set a limit to play outside. I think the government should make the society more livable for children. And then population that children aged between 0 and 14 years old will increase.  It is common that the children are noisy. I think most children cannot sit still for a long time. It is also common that many people dislike noise of children. I like children and I cannot understand people who dislike children, but they are not ill-natured. I hope that all people come to understand children.  The place I'm living has many children, so we can hear voice of children playing and baby's crying voice. Those sound let me be warm feeling and make my smile. Neighbor's baby is so cute and kids are so funny, so I like this place. When I was elementary school student, I was a member of the club of baseball, so I played baseball every weekend and I played in the park with my friends. We run in the park, throw the ball, ride on a swing and climb a tree. There are my cherished memory. I learned ""what is friendship"" by playing with my friends. But now, many park ban ball playing, and we have few place to play baseball or football. Where can children play? A decade ago, children can play on the road, and they had a conversation with neighbors. At the time, people helped each other, and town was peace. By contrast, we don't greet with neighbors. I think it is not just a problem between children and neighborhood, it is serious issue of society as a whole. Old man in Japan increase future, many aged person need assistance, so we have to help to each other in the neighborhood. And I want to ask the person who complaining to children's voice sounds, when you will be old, who help you? It is a young man isn't it? They are kids now, so we have to make a environment that is easy to child rearing.  I think that everyone knows and understands that children make noise. But this noise is like the evidence that they live and it is no use complaining. So I am very surprised at the content of this article. The people who are complaining about this forget to be brought freely with making noise and be watched by adults who didn't feel angry or stress. They should recall their childhood and tolerate.  I was surprised when I read this article. I do understand why people complain about the noise of kids but I think they should be a little bit more tolerant. Kids make noise by nature and they learn a lot of things by playing outside cheerfully. I think most of the people have the same experiences. I agree with the statement ""As society has fewer and fewer children, people get less used to hearing them. It's a vicious circle. "" I think the society is making the situation worse. If there will be less children, there will be less taxpayers in the future. We need to take this problem seriously to make our future better.  I think that low birthrate and longevity are a problem which must be solved. However, they are not easy problems. It is necessary to fight against this problem not only by the party concerned but by a society as a whole. Japan is not in the environment which child-rearing tends to carry out. I am anxious about the future of Japan as at now. I think that low birthrate and longevity are the subject assigned to us.  I was very surprised that declining birth rate causes such a problem. I like children. However, I can understand people's complaints that children are too noisy because they have high-pitched voices and talk loudly. But most people can satisfy about it because children cannot help making noise. I think that this problem is caused by people being narrow-minded in recent years.  I like a child. Children are noisy. However, I think that such a portion also has loveliness. They must also have had the same time. The residents of the area should have attachment to nearby children. Then, the children should help you in the future.  It is unbelievable that people in Japan complain of noise children make. It is true that that noise make people uncomfortable. But people in the world absolutely experience childhood. At that time, we all did trouble. In spite of this, complaining about children is wrong. We should see them with warm eyes.  When I read this article, I was surprised and I think that there is no help for it that children are noisy. We should be gentle for the noise of the children more. When I was a elementary school student, there were a lot of places to play outside and I played a lot. Maybe, our voice were noisy, but I had not be scolded for the noisy. These days, people became selfish I feel in my everyday life. We should be more tolerant to the other and have more patience.  After I read this article, I understood the reasons of decreasing birthrate are not simple. The reasons which I had known are only women's advances into society and a tendency to marry later, but this article taught me a society getting less accustomed to hearing intolerance of children. But it is natural that the voices of children are noisy and I can admit them because children are so cute. So I think the recent people become not to think children are cute. But it is difficult to make others think children are cute. I think the solution of this problem is making a lot of chances to play with children when we are young for example junior high school student goes to a kindergarten or a nursery school as a class. Actually I went to the near nursery school as a class, of course children are so noisy , but moreover children are cute. I think what we make such a chance makes people like and want children.  I think it is natural that children always cry out, because their job is to play and to be scalded. They don't know something, so if people scold, they can know something. In Japan, people are aging. people perhaps think ""what is bad?"" But it is very bad! For example if old people increase, who make buildings?, who rescue?, who save a town? So, people should make baby for Japan.  I think it is natural thing that children are noisy and restless, but I agree about the feeling of people who complains over the noise of children. When I studying restaurant or cafe, I am irritated at children who are running around the shop. Birth rate in Japan is decreasing year by year, so we get less used to hearing children noise. Then, we are unused to children's noise and feel annoying to that. So that the basis of the problem is Japanese declining birth rate. We need to think more seriously about that problem and find the way to solve that problem.  I think we should involved in making a good environment in which people are tolerant to the noise of children. I have two reasons for this. First, what we can do to cope with the problem which article says is to change the way of peoples' thinking, because it is impossible to ask children not to make any noise . Children are immature and being silent is really hard for them, so when when we tackle this problem , it is not children but adult that should change. Second, we should prevent trouble that intolerance of noise of children results in vicious circle. In Japan the birthrate are getting lower, so we have to take action for this by making people tolerant to the noise. Because of these two reasons, I think people should change their mind and try to make the environment which is good for education.  I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem. I sometimes feel that children's voice is noisy. However , We have to accept it. By accepting it, children will grow up freely. It is unavoidable to stop decreasing population so we have to increase the number of children. In order to do so, we should make the environment where children play freely.  I think It is natural that children make noise, however noises made by children sometimes make problems. Talking about myself, I used to irritated by the noise made by a small boy next my house. He often shouts and cry. As a result, my neighbor told his parents to make him calm. Considering these problems, children's noise can be problem.  It is natural that children and old people in a same society. And you cannot reject children. Cannot reject the natural phenomenon that children make noise. Now Japan is facing super aging society. We must coexistence with all age people. And it is fact that we should make environment that aging people comfortably living to.  I think the noise of children is natural and we have to tolerate it. Then, we should not take it as a noise but as a part of live. We all made noise when we were children. But now, people who don't be accustomed to hearing it complain about the noise. Although they also didn't play completely silence. Government should inform people of the problem of declining birthrate more. If people understand the importance of children, they will make efforts to protect them and make atmosphere which they grow up healthy.  I think it's big issue when I read the article. There are two points. First, birth rate. Recently, Japanese birthrate has been decreasing and the number of children is more uncommon than before. so, the noise of children can be more irritate people. Second, education problem A large number of mother have to do all things about their children by social system. So, in many cases fathers should work on day time and only mother should look after their children. I think we should solve these problem. For example, we make many space for children and mother etc. .  I was shocked very much that the percentage of children aged between 0 and 14 years old in Japan is the lowest in the world and less than half the global average of 26.8%. It is a very serious problem. Of course, I understand people who complain about noises, but children's noise is unavoidable. I expect all the people in Japan grasp the seriousness of the declining birthrate in Japan and accept children's noises.  I agree that the situation in Japan prevents the birthrate from rising. Of course, I feel irritated when hearing too noisy yelling of children at night, but in the daylight the noises of children seem quite natural ones. People should be more tolerant indeed. But what should be improved is not only the tolerance of the people. Compared to other countries, such as the U. S, the child care systems seem not very good. We all should become more tolerant, and change the social systems as well.  I agree with ID13019. I lived near a nursery school, and that school had a sports day. Having a sports day is good, but every year, the sports day was the same weekend when I had tests. The sound from speaker and noise children made irritated me. However, when I was a child, the sound that my school made in a sports day irritated people near the school. I think ID13019's suggestion is effective.  I disagree with ID13018 because she only referred to the parents' responsibility. Of course, discipline is necessary. However, only disciplining prevent children from growing. Instead of accusing parents and children, we should be tolerant.  I disagree with your opinion because he thinks that there is nothing we can do about making noise by children . I think that if parents discipline children, children understand it is not good to make noise in public.  I agree with ID13042's opinion. I also think children are vigor and noisy, and they aren't social nuisance. Unless they act as they want, our lives lose power to live. So adults should have wider heart to tolerate them. And to make the world nearer to children's lives, the idea that the housings nearby should or day care center must be reduced the price sounds nice to me.  I would agree with ID13061's opinion. What Maeda and Hosaka said in the text makes sense. Though it is true that we should be tolerant of the noise that children make, they ARE still noisy and sometimes annoy us.  I agree with ID13052. Everyone makes noise when they are children. So, I also think it is unfair to take children to task for their noise. Today, their many people who always look after their own interests. Complains of those people will accelerate the decline of the number of children and birthrate. So, I think the noise children make should be allowed and people should have a broad mind too.  I think it's natural for kid to run around and make noises. Are children these days really getting more noisier and have bad manners than before?I don't think so. The reason why many people came to think them annoying is that the environment has changed. In this technological century, people became lonely and come to live by themselves. Communities are shrinking smaller and smaller and many of them are collapsing. What we have to do is not to shut those kids' mouth but to improve the education environment and make a child friendly society. Tolerate and considerate society will benefit not only the kids and parents but also the whole members of the society, I think.  I agree to your opinion. The environment is what we have to think of. It is obvious that children can't think more than adults. We should think more and be tolerate for children and for ourselves in this aging society. Considerate mind and action against children will make the society more comfortable and last long term.  I agree with your idea that we should accept the noise of the children and make good environment for them. Surely, in Japan the number of children are decreasing now. So we should stand their noise and bring up them by surrounding people. We should have tolerance heart.  I agree with his idea. We all know everyone used to be children and make some noises. So people should be more tolerant with the noise of children. And I think it is very good idea that we need to think about the way to co-exist between children and the others.  I agree with you. Everyone was taken care of in society at the time of the child. Although this, one think child is annoying after growth to adult. I think this is very selfish. And children will shoulder the future destiny of our country. I think that we should become tolerant.  I always played TV game at home, I was very quiet, because I was very hard to play it! My mother also say ""Play at the park!"" I say ""YES"" But I go to my friend house, because I can eat a lot of cake! I agree with you. Children should make a noise, that is natural. The only thing we need to teach to children is ""You should be filled with curiosity many thing around you. "" instead of ""Do not make a noise everywhere!"" I agree with the idea of Kinuko Inoguchi. We have to set forward child-bearing issues. The social agenda is that to make people think that curious  children are needed for our future. I would like parents and adults to @@notice that it is not good for young children to be forced not to make noises. Children should have curiosity everything, make a noise, and be blown away a lot of things.  I agree with her. Most of people have the same experiences when they were children, so they should be lenient with them. Children will become leaders in the future.  I agree with ID13010's opinion. It is natural that children make noise. We should not get angry at it, because children learn various things in play. We should watch them warmly I agree with ID13035's opinion. I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news.  I'm agree with your opinion that people should watch children warmly, because it is impossible for children to make no noise. So we should understand children and tolerate their noise.  I disagree with her. I know that it is natural for children to make noise. However, sometimes the noise make the neighbor irritated. Children do not know that their noise cause problems, so their parents ought to talk them not to make too much noise.  I was shocked by this article first. Children shouldn't be noisy? BUt after reflection, I noticed Japan's society is changing little by little. This society is aging little by little. Like old days play by lots of children should be cared not to disturb the lives of elderly people.  Once people complains over the child noise, parents may wither. If Japanese birth rate declines thanks to this, it's too late. Surely people are tend to be under stress, but it cannot be a reason to complain about noisy children. As long as the connection with local community disappears, we must care about what we do or say.  I can understand the claim that children are noisy. Sometimes I feel so when I stay at home. But we must tolerate such feeling. Children consists of foundation of a country. We have to educate them freely.  I would like to complain to these complainers. For sure, parents should always keep their eyes on their children and be considerate toward other people. However, it is very natural for children to make noise and all of us used to do it in our own childhood. With the widespread use of compute, children have less chance to play outside today. Playing loudly is absolutely needed for children to grow up soundly. Considering today's aging society and Japan's future, adults should be a little more tolerant toward noisy children.  I think modern children don't change comparing with old one's. I think what change is environment. Now, communities are collapsed. People are alone. So people don't tolerant people. I feel sad about this news. When I was a child, around people tolerant toward me and once in a while I was scold. So I was raised by not only my parents but also people around me. I hope people around children get tolerant toward children and children should be raised local people.  I think Japanese have to have patience with noise that children make. Because making noise is good and important thing for children. So it is necessary for children to make noise. So Adult have to put up with noise that children make.  I agree with your idea. I also think children are vigor and noisy, but they aren't social nuisance. And your idea which adults should have wider heart to tolerate childrens is totally same as me!! I was so shocked to know more and more people are complaining about the noise of children because it is natural that they make some noise when playing outside. The saddest thing is that some Japanese aren't afford to permit the noise of the child.  I agree with your opinion. We should accept and patient the children's noises. Everyone was child, so we (adults) should watch stare children.  I feel uncomfortable because of noise children make many times. However, I understand making noise by children , so I can allow it and I want everyone to forgive these noises.  The situation surrounding the birth rate is harsh indeed. Society seems less accustomed to children. But the faults lie in the parents as well. Many of them seem to take it for granted to be treated specially, and children and parents with no common sense are increasing. Both society and parents have to compromise each other, otherwise this problem has no solution.  I think so serious the situation. Our social member decrease so our burden is more. The problem is so hard. We should solve the problem"
JOC JOC-13A-05O 1.75 "True I think the noise children make is big and the noise sometime makes people uncomfortable. But I think the noise should not be eliminated. it's because obviously it's impossible and if possible, it unable children to play, run, sing, etc, freely: children cannot have freedom. Also according to this article, since the number of children is decreasing those who feel the noise uncomfortable they make. If there were a campaign that children's noise is eliminated, the number of parents who want to have children would be decreasing. To prevent "" negative chain"", Japanese government have to enforce a law which gives parents hope to have children.  According to this article, the more number of children decrease, the more number of people can't stand noise which children make. When I live in my parents' home, my family and I were disgusted' about noise which a child lived in the upper floor made, but now I think we didn't get used to children's noise as this article says. Of course, parents who have children take care about excessive noise, but nobody can't stop children play freely. Children should enjoy their playing and we should have mind accepting children. If we don't have sympathy each other, the number of children decrease rapidly. We have to think this problem seriously.  When I read this article, I was surprised because I didn't think so much people couldn't put up with the noise children made. It may be true that such noise is very annoying for some people, however, I think we have to considerate for other people around us. Also, declining of the number of children is getting severe problem recently. Therefore, we all understand the matter and to do actions we can do to solve the problem. As for women, I think it is very good that the government gives them financial support because I hear many women concerns about not having enough money.  When I read this article, I was surprised because I don't think children's noise make me annoying. There voice are very cheerful and symbol of peace Japan.  I felt sad to read this news. When I was a child, adults didn't complain about the noise of us. I want adults to remember time when they were children. Probably, adults would not complain when present adults were children either. Aging society is one of the most serious problems of Japan. So, I think that it is necessary to keep the environment where children can play freely.  I was surprised to hear the bad news. I think the voice of children is not a nuisance. On the contrary, I am refreshed by that. When was a high school student, I lived near a park. I always heard the lively voice when I was studying. It didn't irritate me at the time. All people had a term to go outside and play with a loud voice. Thus, we should not complain about that. I hope that people in Japan become more tolerant about children.  If one resource lean one side, the other side become harmful to the opposite side, and both sides go bad. I hope more and more people notice this nonsense, and tackle this matter in cooperation.  I agree with you. All children have a right to play freely. Adults should not complain about that only because they are noisy. They have to receive it because the noise of children is natural thing. They should notice that they also played freely in their childhood. I hope all people to be tolerant and comfortable about the noise.  I was very sad to read this article. To tell the truth, I am sometimes repugnant to the noise of children, but each time I reflect on it. When I was a small, I was supposed to be very noisy. All the people are noisy, too. Therefore, we should stand the noise of children to some extent. Children must be raised by each region.  I agreed with your thought. I wonder why some people complain children's voice . it cannot be said that children voice is not loud, but children is normally loud , and we might be loud in daily life. So people must be more acceptable and look children warmly.  When I read this article, I felt that adults should act like adults especially in front of children. People who are now complaining about the children's noise also used to be children, and I believe that they use to make noise when they played outside in their childhoods. These complaints would also affect other adult's motivation to make kids, which leads to the low birthrate and longevity society in Japan right now. I think people should be become tolerant about children's behavior to create a better society which children can grow up freely. I really hope these situation improves by the time when I become a parent.  When I saw the title of this article, I could understand it. I was sometime uncomfortable with noisy children simply because I couldn't compose myself in that situation. Of course, children are active and I was noisy in a childhood. However, it doesn't mean they may do everything what they want to do. The role to teach it is their parents. I think this news can read the undereducation of the parent from this thing, too. I have been taught from my parents, so I followed that I must not do it not to do it. It's important for a parent to make the place where you may be upset about a child and a bad place certain and tell. For a parent to copy a child again, there is also a possibility that a pro-self body can't do the distinction. Therefore an adult should also be careful of itself. "
JOC JOC-13B-05N -0.84 "I was surprised to hear the news. The brain uses sleep to wash up the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. This is very important findings. I think please continue to research the brain and sleep.  After reading this article, I realized that sleep plays an important role for us to live. I didn't know that Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease is related to sleep, so I was surprised to know this fact. It means that if we don't get enough sleep, it will increase the risk of diseases. So I think I need to change my sleeping pattern because I don't sleep well these days.  I agree with newcatnewcat's opinion. Sleeping pattern is related to diseases. This surprised me. I have to change it.  Although I knew a little that sleep is necessary for the brain to arrange information people have, I was surprised to know that sleep washs away the waste toxins in the brain. If this cleaning mechanism of brain is studied more and something would be discovered, diseases such as Alzheimer or Parkinson may be cured. It is true that the brain controls almost all the human, so studying of brain should be encouraged more. However, science and technology must not be abused. To achieve this, education in science and ethics should be emphasized. I hope that technological development contribute to the happiness of people.  I learned that the sleeping is so important through this article. In fact, I don't have enough time of sleep. Yesterday, I couldn't sleep because of meeting. The day before yesterday, I went to bed at 3 o'clock and wake up 6 o'clock. I have a sense of crisis to not only skin but also brain.  Reading this article, I was not very surprised and was relieved because I already have had my pattern of sleep. Basically I sleep at 12 and get up at 6. However I was very surprised at some part of the story. The vital function does not appear while the mind is awake. By the lack of sleep, the toxin proteins may accumulate in our brain. The build up will lead us to many conditions which lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease. Because these risk are lurking, I hope that the study will be more advanced. At the same time, I thought I should be careful not to break my sleep pattern.  I'm happy to read this news as this article justifies my idle slumber.  I usually sleep for 7 hours and I often said it is enough, but for me, it's not enough. It is often said that sleeping is good for our health and I think so, too. However, I didn't know that sleep cleans the brain. At first, I didn't have the idea that there are damaged proteins in the brain. Maybe I have less damaged proteins than other people. I read this news and I thought I should sleep for 7 hours.  This article is so useful for me. I have not known about function of the brain until now, but I have believed sleep is very important action for us and taken a sleep enough time. Therefore, I could reconfirm importance of sleep. I would like to cherish sleep.  I have never heard the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. Now, I understand why I have a poor memory. My brain cannot wash the brain enough because of my short sleep, and there might be a lot of toxins. Anyway, this is just a joke. I know it is the only excuse for me because I am supposed to take enough sleeping hours. So, I have poor memory by nature. However, if it work effectively, I will use sleeping time more importantly.  I realize the importance of sleep. Of course, I have heard that sleep is important for our health. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. I did not know Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease are related to brain cells, either. I would like to take enough sleep in order to my health.  Although I knew that sleep is good for we are in good health, I was surprised that there is a role to get rid of harmful toxins that sleep produces in the brain. I also thought and It looks there are many that the functions and mechanisms of the brain has not been elucidated yet. That's why I think the brain is a place that is hidden a lot of potential. And taking a good quality sleep for the brain is essential. I cannot help but make light of taking sleep, but I thought I should make much of taking sleep all the same.  I think it is amazing that scientists have found that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. As they suggest that problems with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease, it means that they would be cured if science in technology advances more, like ID13013 says. In addition to that, I am expecting scientists to find the way to cure insomnia, because it is also well-known that a kind of sleeping disorder causes insomnia. When it comes to myself, I usually fall asleep within 5 minutes after going to bed, and it is the best time in a day that I truly feel comfortable. For purpose of this, I do not understand why some people have trouble sleeping, and I feel sorry for them as they cannot know the happiness of sleeping. To solve this problem, I would like scientists to study the mechanism of sleeping more.  I was surprised at the news because I did not know that the brain worked so hard during I was sleeping. I wonder when the brain takes a rest if it works all the time. I think it may possibly work all the time. I understand a brain plays an important role as far as we live.  I think sleep is necessary for human to live healthfully. I knew that sleep is important, but I often stayed up late when I wanted to watch TV, play games and do my homework. Actually, I usually regret that I didn't sleep enough because the next day, I can't wake up early and I am sleepy all day. So I decided to sleep as long as possible especially when I have exams. I should study beforehand otherwise I can't clean toxins and memorize something new. I keep this article in mind to use my brain in a best condition in the exams.  I could know by this news that Sleep is necessary for our lives. However, I sometimes stay up late or sleep for short time. According to this news, my body may have a lot of toxins. Besides, short sleeping leads to illness such as Alzheimer and Parkinson. I afraid of it. So, I want to have enough sleep from now on.  I have thought that the brain don't sleep any time. So, I was surprised when I read this article and I knew the system of the brain. And I was happy to know it. I want to know about the brain more.  This news made me very happy. It is because the news justified my sleep. I want to sleep more! From now on, if I late for class, I will excuse myself for coming late ""It was because my brain washed away the waste toxins!"" It would make teachers angry, however.  Whenever the test term, I try to sleep at least 3 hours, because I believe sleep organize memory in the brain and I can't get a good score without sleep. In this news, if we can't get a sleep, our brain ware damaged by toxin. So we have to sleep not only to organize memory but also to protect our brain from poison. This is good reason to explain to my parents ""why I'm always sleeping until noon at holiday. "" Anyhow I have learned sleep is important! But I have a night shift today!! haha! I want to sleep. . . umm. .  Well, I didn't know that! I did recognize the importance of sleep but I didn't know the flood wash up my brain during sleep to wash away poisons(however it is uncertain how much this new discovery is reliable). This means if you keep awake for a long time and never sleep. your brain will go bad , or maybe get rotten by the poison! That's awful. I'd better sleep more, maybe during class. HAHA just kidding -  I felt the importance of sleeping. I knew that it is useful to fix the memory. However, I don't know this effect of sleeping. Then, I make up my mind to sleep longer for my health. Of course, it is important to stay up in class, too.  The more studying come out, the more importance of sleep we get to know, I felt this when I read this article. And, it's possible that much knowledge on sleep hasn't found yet, so I'm thinking to take my sleep more seriously, because the students at universities tend to like not to sleep and play at bar, karaoke room or something like that. I heard that it's difficult for sophomore to attend even second period lesson. It must be very easy and usual when they are high school students and before then. We are already next to workers, so should have awareness as an adult and take care of ourselves with knowledge and some device.  I was so surprised to hear the news and this news makes me sad if this news is true. Of course, I knew the sleeping have a big role in fixing memories, however I don't know it may have another important role in brain such as removal system. The removal system should be needed for human health in my opinion, and so I have to make up my mind to keep more sleeping time because I don't have enough time to sleep every day. I hope this study will contribute to the diseases which have not been solved.  When I read this article, I was very interested because I take a lot of sleep every day but I didn't know the reason why people always become sleepy, so I have wanted to know a system of sleep until now. To know about this research in the article made my happy, because I take a lot of a sleep. So my brain may be very clean.  After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleeping can wash away the waste toxins built up during my hard day's thinking. . . In these days, I often go to bed at 2am and wake up at 7am. It's not enough sleep for me, so I have to try to go to bed earlier than now! When I read this, I understood this view and thought, too. Of course, everyone knows sleep is important. But we understood it vaguely. In my opinion, many students in Japan tend to stay up late and always feel sleepy. So there are a lot of short sleeper! For example, I took little sleep, about 3 hours, recently. Probably with this effect, I feel very bad and keep having headache. Short sleep makes my health bad surely. I realized again good sleep make good health.  I felt that too! If the sleeping is the correct thing for our health, why it must be banned to sleep at any time! Of course it may not be a good thing to sleep when or where we shouldn't sleep, for example in the daytime or during the class. But if it is our body's reaction to keep us healthy, I think it may not be great to be scolded in such situation. Even if it is idle, it may be nice if we take care of our health.  After I read about the news, I felt the importance of sleeping because I had thought the time I sleep is useless and I can use it for better thing if I had a little stronger mind. And I'm trying to begin to take a new habit to get enough sleep. I want to continue the habit not to get diseases in the future.  Until reading this article, I did not know the meaning of sleep well. I thought it's only putting the memory in order. So I thought that the shorter we sleep, the better our life is. But reading this article and learning about""waste removal system"", I began to think sleep is very important. From now on, I want to get more sleep for health. Although right now is the middle of the night . . . . . .  I thought there was the sleep to rest , but it is not true. We use the sleep to wash up the waste toxin, and memorize. When people have a lot of homework, they don't sleep. But it is very bad!! Because they memorize to sleep. We have to sleep to memorize!! I read the report and sympathized. I also think that sleep is important. Unless we go to sleep, energy does not come out of them. And sleep is required in order to wash an unnecessary toxin. To be sure, sleep is required although we cannot do it at all during sleep. I would like to sleep firmly from now on.  I know that a brain needs to sleep to put memorizing order. But facilities of sleep for brain this article said are new to me. My environment of sleep is so bad. I often sleep without noticing it. I sleep not on the bed but on the floor keeping the television turning on and keeping the light switching on. So I think that I don't receive the benefit of sleep very well. I may be Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in the future. I fell I must improve my sleep habit.  After I read this news, I found sleeping is very important for my body. Sleep plays a critical role in thinking and learning. Lack of sleep hurts these cognitive processes in many ways. It impairs attention, alertness, concentration, reasoning, and problem solving. This makes it more difficult to learn efficiently. I would like to go to bed airier from today.  I have known that sleep is essential to live, but I have not known that reason. I read vital function don't appear to be possible while the mind is awake, I am convinced why we need sleep. When I was a high school student, as summer homework, , I looked over materials about sleep and felt sleep is very interesting field. And, sleep is concerned with not only Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, but also lifestyle-related diseases and depression. I want research about sleep advanced.  To sleep cleans the brain of toxins is very interesting. Sleep is still important for human healthy. There is some more secret of the human functions. I think that to solve the human functions as difficult as to solve the universal secret.  It is very surprising to me that sleep actually cleans the brain of toxins with fluid. I think we can someday strengthen our ability of memorizing and realize the health of the brain by sleeping well of course and studying the elements of the fluid and so on.  When I heard this news, I was very surprised. Because the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins. I think such problem with the brain's cleaning mechanism may contribute to the diseases.  I have not known about function of the brain during sleep. I learn function of the brain by reading this news. Sleeping is very important for us. These days, young people cannot sleep enough. I hope that this news is known by many people in the world. Sleeping is good for ourself.  Until I read this news, I had vague knowledge about sleep. I knew that sleep was important for us and kept our health, but I did not know that sleep washed away the waste toxins in our brains. I cannot imagine that cells in my brain shrink during sleep and fluid flows in the gaps between brain tissue. Recently, lack of sleep among young people in Japan has become a social problem and so they, including me, should notice the function of sleep and sleep enough. Finally, discoveries in science kind of this may improve our lives and lead us to the right way. Although I know but little of science and technology, but I want governments more to support studies of science.  The findings of this research are very interesting. It was amazing that sleep removes the waste toxins from the brain. I had only thought that sleep made the body get relaxed and recover from tiredness. The government and companies should help this research financially so that a lot of new facts about the brain's waste removal system would be found out. I hope that the way to cure Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease will be found in the near future and all the patients in the world will be able to share the benefits.  This news is very interesting for me. I cannot sleep long time recently because I was being very busy. However, I read this report and noticed the importance of sleep. I was the first to have heard that sleep washes a brain. I want to get more information about toxins. I think that I will sleep the longest possible time from now on.  I like sleeping. Not, I love sleeping. We usually sleep everyday. Our body need sleep. Especially our brain need sleep to act. This news said that sleep 'cleans' the brain of toxins. When we waked up, we feel clear or not so. In case that we felt clear, our brain was cleaned much. I shall clean my brain by sleeping right now! I find sleeping very important for human being after read this article. I usually sleep for 7 hours and I think it's better to keep this. But I heard long sleeping is not good for human body as well. So I want to know about long sleep.  I know sleeping is so important to maintain our health, but why is it so important? I don't know about it. I often hear that sleeping arranges our memory. So I was surprised sleeping washes away the waste toxins build up a hard day's thinking. Today, sleeping must not be solved perfectly. I wish more research will be conducted about sleeping mechanism.  I knew that sleep is important for our health before read this news. However, I think many people don't get enough sleep. We will sleep 20 years for 80 years if we sleep for six hours per day. Therefore I want to get the sleep of good quality.  Since when I read this article, I've tried to sleep as long as possible too because I want to clean my own brain every day. The information of this function encourages us to sleep long and raises the quality of sleep.  Of course, I know that sleeping is important for our body to keep our health, because my parents always said so when I was kid. But I didn't know why sleeping helps to keep our health. I never know that the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. That fact is fantastic!! I really surprised when I read this news. Sleep is good for us, and good for our body.  Before hearing this news , I tend to sleep longer. Hearing this news , I was relieved because long sleep is not wrong thing.  Are you ok? I worry about you. And I can't sleep well, because I have many things which have to do. I wanna sleep.  I have understood sleep is important for health. But I didn't know it related diseases. So I became worried about my sleep style. For example, how many hours do I always sleep in a day, in a week, in a month and how does my sleeping condition ? And I am concerned that new sleep can clean the old toxins not to be cleaned past.  I was surprised that sleep plays an important role to live. I thought we sleep to rest our bodies and brains, but according to this article, the brain is always working. I learned the importance of sleep, so I think I should take enough sleep.  I agree with your opinion. I think many companies and researchers spend money on research brain to find out the way to cure diseases. I hope the number of patients suffer from Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease decrease.  I think it is very difficult for brain to sleep because people use brain a lot. I was surprised at the effect of sleep. I didn't know to sleep make their brain clean. I will sleep more, and I want be clever.  I agree with your opinion. Sleeping is more important than I thought. The same as you, I tend to stay up late so I don't have enough sleep. Therefore, in order to keep our heath and memory, we have to sleep in earlier time than now.  I was very surprised at the truth that brain cells shrink during sleep to open up the gaps between neurons and allow fluid to wash the brain clean. I think the mechanism in our body works really nicely.  I agree with this opinion. I want the researchers to continue research the connection between sleep and brain and utilize the result of the research.  Improvement of technologies by human being is remarkable. Before I read this article, I was already sure that sleep takes a crucial role to live. Still researchers need to have such a scientific proof to make more progress. So, that research was important. Actually I don't know exactly about brain or cells but I can say the development of research about human body helps us keep healthy.  I think so! I reconsidered my sleep style by this article, too. We should take care of our health more! And you should get more sleep! I agree with you. Sleep is important for our health. I understand concrete device of the sleep. We should take sleep more.  When I first read this title I was very surprised because I believed that sleep make our brain only take a rest. And the fact that toxin is generated in our brains everyday also astonished me. The article was very interesting and at the same time made me want to know the negative aspects of sleep I was really surprised by this article and I found it is interesting. Now I know sleeping is important to keep ourselves healthy. I don't think I get enough sleep everyday but I should take longer sleep.  I realized the importance of sleeping. I knew that the lack of sleeping lead to the loss of brain cells such as Alzheimer's or Parkinson's disease in this article. I really thought I should sleep enough to work the ""waste removal system"" and living a long life! I was really surprise to hear this news. This is because I didn't know the brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins built up during a hard day's thinking. Also after I read this news I realized sleep is very important for us. I love sleeping so that I'm really happy to sleep and work that system and living long and healthy life!!! I was also surprised to read this article. I also thought sleeping enough time is only to rest my body. So I thought I did not need to sleep long times but it was wrong. I wonder why sleeping so long times links early death.  I agree with you. This news justified my sleep. If we do not have enough sleep, our brain cannot work and not good for our health. However, you cannot justify your tardy! I feel the same way , because I don't have much time to sleep these days. Like you, my body may have lots of toxins, so I should improve my life style and have enough sleep .  I am shocked by this article. Of course I knew that sleeping is vital for the health and shortage of sleep does harm to health. But I did not know shortage of health led to diseases. I decided to review my sleeping style with notice.  I became too. I thought to sleep make us more clever. If we don't sleep enough we will not be clever. So I want to sleep more. Let's sleep more.  I don't sleep well, too. My sleep is very irregular. So I should change my sleep cycle for future myself.  Yes, I agree with you, and I also haven't heard brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins!! That is amazing! So we should make time to sleep much more.  I think so too. however busy you are, you should sleep property time. And I also want to get more information about toxins. What kind of toxins it is? How to remove it ?And, How long we should take hours of sleep? I agree with you. The more we know about brain, the more we live comfortably. Therefore, I want to know about brain's function.  Sleeping pattern is related to diseases. This surprised me. I have to change it.  I learned that the sleeping is so important through this article. I don't have enough time of sleep. I have a sense of crisis to not only skin but also brain.  I learned the same thing. I thought it is just to be tired if we can't sleep. But I learned it by reading this article. So I will sleep well.  I am interested to read your comments. It is excellent that you have decided to sleep as long as possible especially when we have exams. I want to study beforehand so that I can sleep enough through exam weeks, like you have said. However, it is difficult for me to do that as I usually study just before the exams, because I do not feel like studying when exams are not coming up soon. It's not good, is it? I agree with your opinion. before read this article, I didn't think sleep is important . however I learned sleep is important. so I take a lot of sleep from now I was surprised at the news too. I thought that the brain is sleeping when my body was sleeping. After now, I want to treat carefully about my brain.  I am interested to read your comments. The more we know about brain, the more we live comfortably.  I knew a little that sleep is necessary for the brain to arrange information people have. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins.  Of course, I have heard that sleep is important for our health. However, I haven't heard that brain uses sleep to wash away the waste toxins.  I think long sleep is not bad thing. But hear too long sleep is not good for your health. So you should keep it in mind.  I have the same opinion. I knew that it is useful to fix the memory. However, I don't know this effect of sleeping. After I reading thin article, I decided that I would take more sleep for my health.  I have same thought as you. To get sleep is more important than I think. It relate to our health. Now I often sleep at 2am, I know this is bad for my body. So I'll try to sleep more earlier.  I agree with you. Sleep is important for our health. We take 7 hours to sleep, and we usually have to clear our brain in order not to sleep in our classes.  You are so good student! I'm little surprised you at sleeping 7 hours every day. My sleep is often 3~4 hours. I didn't know sleep clean the brain, either. So I'll follow you to sleep more.  Enough sleep is essential for our health, but the time we start to sleep is also important, I think. I want to sleep before or behind 0 am.  I agree with your opinion. Sleep is important for us. We should take sleep more. (I couldn't log in my account. ) I felt the same feeling, too you. And I decided to review it. I agree with you! I was surprised by this news too. I think sleep is very important activity for human to live. When I am busy, I think drowsiness is trouble for me. But it is also important thing for our body and it inform us of need of sleep. When I sleepy, I think I go to bed.  I agree with you. We have to change the life pattern, because we tend to get not enough sleep during university life, right? It's really surprising enough sleep make avoiding disease for us.  When I read this article, I was very interested because I take a lot of sleep every day but I didn't know the reason why people always become sleepy, so I have wanted to know a system of sleep until now. To know about this research in the article made my happy, because I take a lot of a sleep. So my brain may be very clean I completely agree with you. We are university students and we have to study hard, so our bedtime tend to get earlier and later. We should take care of our sleep.  I was surprised because for me cleaning and brain are really different words and I can't find any relationship between these two words. don't know the cleaning brain and shrink. I thought shrinking brain makes me fool. So, I was surprised . I thought I don't want to shrink my brain! at first. It was really interesting that brain wash it's self during sleeping. If the research improve, people suffering Alzheimer and Parkinson's diseases may be saved.  I often try to steady my sleeping time. But, over few days, I am tired of it and give up. Recently, I cannot sleep well, so the fatigue remains next day. I would like to know the good idea.  This is a really interesting finding. Someday, scientists may invent medicines or something to save our sleeping. Then we could live other ways and the way we work and study would also change. But I want the scientists to leave us the huge happiness to sleep in soft and warm beds.  Alzheimer's and Parkinson's disease are hard to cure, so I hope the scientists can find the way to cure them. However, on the other hand, it is important for the scientists that the Government or something support their study economically. I think we shouldn't make such situation that a creative studies are hard to receive the support.  I surprised when I read this news. I know that sleeping is important for human. But sleeping is more important than I thought. And I think that I need more time to sleep.  I don't agree with you. These kinds of researches may be useful and innovative, but they are also breaking the habits of human. Many of human morals are based on their lives and habits. So to preserve the moral, we should be too scientific and systematic.  I agree with you. Now that we know the lack of sleep leads to the diseases, we have to review our life style immediately.  I felt importance of sleeping too. I don't know this effect. So I think that I need more sleeping.  I didn't sleep well like you. So I think I have to change my sleeping pattern. I don't want to have disease in the future.  I sleep longer than you. But I think this is not enough. So I think I should sleep more.  I agree with you. sleeping is more important than I thought. So I decided to review it.  I agree with your opinion! I didn't know this function, so I want to sleep more.  I was so interested in this news. Since I was young, I wanted to know why we have to sleep everyday. It is said that our sleeping time occupies 30% of our lifetime. I felt this is useless. But now, I could get information of important role of sleeping. So after that, I will take good care of it.  I thought so, too. Since I got this information, my sleeping was not good. But I could understand the importance of sleep, so I will mend it.  Before reading this news, I have already noticed sleep is very important for our health but I didn't know about this amazing function of brain!! So, to make my life happier and more healthy, I want to sleep more.  l stay up late every night. But after hearing mechanism of brain, I realized importance of sleep. It's surprising our brains work hard while we don't notice. I felt l should go to bed early.  I guessed it's important for us to sleep from way back. But in fact, I don't know the mechanism of brain. So I was very surprised at brain's cleaning mechanism. And I recognized it important again.  I found that sleep is important for not only fixing of memories but also washing away the waste toxins. People learn new things, memorize it, and forget it. I'll think a great deal of sleep from now on.  After reading this news, I feel sleep is very important for us again. Because it can remove some waste toxins from brain and have a big role in the fixing of memories and learning. However the time we need to sleep is so different that I have to sleep more than seven hours but some people do not require much of time. In either case, we cannot live without sleep. So I think it is essential to sleep deeply and regularly everyday.  Since I did not know about such work of a brain until now, this report made me surprised. Because my sleeping hours have decreased after becoming a college student , I have a new appreciation of the necessity for sleep, thanks to this report. Moreover, it turns out that this research leads to sick research, and I came to wish to know deeply about work of a brain. I would like to look for such news positively from now on.  When I read this article, I think that sleeping is very important, so I should sleep more. I haven't had enough sleeping time since I became a university student. But to make my life happier and more healthy, I must sleep more tonight.  Finding new things about sleeping is tremendously important because human beings spend 1/3 of their life sleeping.  I tend to stay up late, so I think I should go to bed earlier for blain to work essentially. "
JOC JOC-13B-06N 1.22 "What Taro Yamaoto did is said to break taboo and I think so, too. I think the position of emperor is quite neutrality. They are neither ordinary people nor politicians. I learned emperor is a symbol of Japan. However, Emperor Akihito may have known the current situation even if not said by Yamamoto. Because he seems always to concern people in Tohoku. Mr. Yamamoto should not have done such thing or he needed not do such thing.  I agree with this article. We think about the risk of another tsunami or typhoon. Otherwise Japan will be dead nation.  I think that Taro Yamamoto should resign from the Diet, too. Political utilization of emperor is a prohibited action. This is the rule. I don't understand why he cannot the letter to the emperor, but I understand ""the lawmaker"" should keep the rule.  I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand the feeling that he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. However, what he did was overly rash. Many people should felt he did not has good sense and didn't know his place on account of his poor deed. If he is a honest Diet member, it is natural that he knows well the way of the Emperor for the Japanese citizen. What he did can not only shake a neutral viewpoint of the Emperor, but also put forward doubts about character of Japanese politicians. He should consider a little more before act and, aware of the influence of his action as the Diet member. I think such a case does not happen any more.  Environmental pollution problems caused by nuclear weapons and war is serious in the world. Japanese released radioactivity, which is 300 times the atomic bomb, into the atmosphere and ocean. Japanese have to recognize the importance of this issue.  I agree with your opinion. I think that Taro Yamamoto should consider the risk which political utilization of emperor. Because Japan separate politics and an emperor by reflect on the war.  I think that Japanese government should abolish all nuclear plants. However, they should not be abolished immediately because of influence of our life. Therefore the government must take the surest safety measures until all nuclear plants are abolished.  Taro Yamamoto should have acted more discreetly because it would have involved the emperor in politics. However, I kind of understand what he wanted to do because he might tried to change the situation. Honestly, I also have little hope for the Japanese Government because it's been a long time since Fukushima nuclear power plant disaster happened but it hasn't seem to have end of the trouble. After I read the article mentioned above, my thought had a little change because it said that the US and Japan would play a role in the cleanup operation. This news gave me more hope. I expect the operation will work well.  I think that the action of the emperor Akihito was really great. Because, he handed a letter to a chamberlain immediately and left no comment. I think emperor Akihito understand the role of an emperor in Japan. If the emperor expresses an specific political attitude, it violates the constitutions of Japan. And critics should accuse of him in public, not in the Internet. I also think Taro Yamamoto should have find other ways to express his opinion.  I think that essentially cause of this disaster is existence of nuclear plant. A lot of people had wanted abolishment of nuclear plant, but the government did not abolish it. Then this disaster occurred, so I think this disaster could be protect in advance. From the above I wrote, I think nuclear plant should be abolished earlier.  I agree with this article. I really think that nuclear energy is not good for the earth. Originally, there is no nuclear energy. But in fact, there is a lot of nuclear energy in Japan. So I think that we should treat this carefully and decrease this little by little. But I also think this plan is low productive because it doesn't solve this serious problem.  I agree with this article. I understand the nuclear energy is not good for the our health or the earth. But in this 21s century, a lot of nuclear power are used. I think that it is necessary for us to be carefully when we use this power.  I really wish that this problem will be solved as soon as possible, and want the government not to cause the same thing again though it's useless to complain about what had already happened. Now The US help us Japan solve it, it'll great if we help one another in the world and have actual good relationship with them in the future. So after Japan's solving the problem, our role will come. There are countless people in need all around the world. On the other hand, I think it's the very time to put all the Japanese potential together! I hope that Japan will become one regardless of who are scientists, politicians or diplomats to solve it.  We notice that there is always a catch in a good deal in this accident. We have believed safety myth of nuclear power. However, we must be careful with the fault of this power. Japan has big energy problem, so we should consider the future of energy immediately.  A disaster can easily cause next disaster. We know the danger of the earthquake. Moreover that earthquake caused a much disaster. We Japanese feared that disaster. We never want to occur the same But his action is wrong and lacks common sense. In democracy we should do political action by right way.  I agree with your opinion. Japanese government abolish all nuclear plants is very difficult as long as I think. I think they should abolish nuclear plants in stages. So, we should continue to think about whole concept of nuclear plants, too.  Recently many people say ""Japanese government have to remove nuclear power plant. "" Certainly, it is true, but I think maybe they are little bit irresponsibility. Because, when government built power plant, people want to make it, and Fukushima people had to move another place, since then, we used huge electricity, but after accident, people say ""we don't need nuclear power plant!"" I think it is too selfish. I think we don't have just to take objection to nuclear power plant, we have to think about how we support Fukushima people.  I agree. I think Japanese government have to abolish. But first of all government have to help Fukushima people.  I insist that breaking taboo itself is a bad thing. I don't think people suffering evacuation life want Mr. Yamamoto to complain about their plight by such a childish way. He should have persuade other members of the Diet and strive to pass a bill that helps victims as a member of the House of Councilors. However, thinking his difficult situation, this standard way could never have succeeded. It is because he doesn't belong to any party, and LDP, the ruling party, has so strong power that they never listen to the opinions of the minority parties or members. I guess that Mr. Yamamoto realized how small his power to change policies was, and handed a letter thoughtlessly. I hope he will keep making steady efforts to abolish nuclear power plants.  I agree with this article. In Japan, the disaster often happens, for example, earthquake in Tokyo. We don't know the time when next big disaster will happen. We people in Japan must really consider the risk of second disaster. The best way is to remove nuclear plant without dangerous accidents. However, this problem is so difficult to solve that people in world have to consider new solution.  I don't think this news is such a big problem. Nothing would happen due to Yamamoto's action because we all know Japanese emperor is unable to speak out anything to politics. It is ordained clearly in Japan Constitution. So why do people make a bother about this? I cannot understand. Naturally it is a fact that Yamamoto did a not admirable action but that had almost no impact on actual politics.  I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.  I think Taro Yamamoto was so ignorance and the emperor Akihito's action symbolize the role of emperor in this country. Taro Yamamoto could find other ways to express his opinion, so I can't understand his action at all.  I agree with you. Taro Yamamoto lacks a sense of responsibility as a member of the Diet, a lawmaker.  I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world.  I agree with you. The nuclear energy is bad in health and danger. The atomic energy is necessary for the present world. We should pay attention to the handling.  I think Japanese government should remove away all nuclear plant in Japan. This is because if a huge earthquake or Tsunami like 3.11 came again, Japan are not be able to revival again. I know there are a lot of reasons to government cannot remove away, but Japan should think more seriously about nations.  I wonder when the situation in Fukushima will be recovered. There are too many problems there. Not only the direct damage of the earthquake and tsunami but also the accident of the nuclear power plants, and the problem of cleaning the radioactive materials are really serious. The actor of the operation , TEPCO has problems in itself too. Hiding the information, its optimistic but not practical point of view, the speed of the action is too dull, and so on. As long as the actor remains dull and fool the situation won't be improved.  I disagree with you because nuclear plant is necessary for our country. Indeed it's very dangerous when disaster happens, but it also supports Japan's economy strongly. So in my opinion, Japan should stop old and dangerous ones and make more durable plants as soon as possible.  I was angry with TEPCO when I read The article. Of course I don't expect TEPCO and its employees, so I'm OK if they get too much salary. But I want them to realize they can rob a lot of life and our health. So, I never want them such a trouble again.  It's not ""agree"". I wanted to write ""angry"".  After I read this article, I thought Taro Yamamoto should have acted more carefully as a law maker. I can understand the feeling that he wanted to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear power generation. But he should not have done that.  This action greatly affect the future of Japan. So , the best attention should be paid to complete this goal.  I agree with naoeID13018. Japan is the only country that was the victim of nuclear bombing and we know the dangerousness of the nuclear power plant. We have to try not depend on nuclear power and make the world safer.  This is very glad news for people all over the world. Fukushima nuclear plants have many risks now. For example, typhoon, rain, tsunami, other earthquake and so on. We need many measures for safeness. We must not consider about money. I think that safeness is most important.  My cousins lived in Fukushima at that time happened 2011 earthquake and tsunami. their house is located very near the nuclear power plants so they were forced to leave their house. And they cann't come back here. They think we can never come back and live in our house. I don't want to happen such as tragedy forever. So this news is very happy for me.  I agree with your opinion. I think many people say their thoughts, making the thing which happens now and then basis of their idea. I really think it is too selfish. We should think more about the support for Fukushima people.  when Fukushima earthquake happened, a lot of radiation flowed in the sea, and it continue leaking even now. However, 3 years passed, people forget about nuclear plants. We should more consider about our country's environment.  I agree with this comment because I also think the emperor is quite neutral. Even though I could understand Yamamoto's thought, it was a thoughtless act. According to the media, we can know how the emperor is considerate of Tohoku people. Moreover, there is the rule that the emperor shouldn't be involved in the government. If he break the rule, it will caused a lot of criticism from the world. So, I thought the action of the emperor Akihito was really great.  I disagree with you because we depended on nuclear before the accident in Fukushima.  I disagree with your opinion. Emperor Akihito is top of Japan so we must have the respect due to his superiors. However, Yamamoto's action is a breach of etiquette. Therefore, it is natural that Mr. Yamamoto is blamed.  Mr. Yamamoto broke the taboo. It is worst, I think. And I had suspect about him. But some people forgot Fukushima's things. So we should remember about them. I think so.  I agree with you. the location around Fukushima Daiichi is far from the place we live, but it's problem in Japan. And it influence Japan badly. So the government have to do their best to solve it.  Mr. Yamamoto's action is not proper as a member of assembly. In Japan, emperor should not have a contact with lawmaker, because it is decided by constitution.  I am against Taro Yamamoto. I can understand he wants to appeal to Emperor for the risk of the nuclear plant. he is a Diet member, he should consider about what other Diet member critic him and make him disadvantage. In my case , I follow the twitter of him. I support him in anti nuclear power, but I can't support his thoughtless behavior.  I don't think so. Taro Yamamoto says good thing. Of course all action of his isn't good, but he does almost good actions. I think only Tepco is bad.  We Japanese can never ignore the problems about nuclear plants. This is really challenging and risky, but no one but us can, and must solve the problem. Leaving them as they are is no longer a solution. I will support the idea to run the risk to make a change.  This is the very difficult problem. For sure Nuclear plants is too much dangerous. We can't say disaster like this time's case never happen. But IN this 21th century, nuclear power is vital.  The tsunami which attacked us brought us the misfortune. Although I was in Ibaraki at that time, I thought the end of the world. We were not able to return to Tokyo during three days. Tsunami came also to Ibaraki. Electricity, water service, and gas stopped, and we suffered troubles very much. And there was a radioactivity problem. I do not want to see that panic. I want a country to direct power towards this problem.  What Mr. Yamamoto did is inappropriate as a member of assembly. I think he broke the taboo because he wanted to change the situation, but I think he should know better than to do such action.  Taro Yamamoto's action might make him hero, but all conditions, like time, place, occasion made him a villain. First, the contents written to the letter is not worth to handing to the Emperor. In short, FEARS about nuclear is weak. Shozo Tanaka handed the letter to the then Emperor about how the people ""actually"" suffering the pollution. I think Taro Yamamoto is nothing but the fool man.  I disagree with you. Because we have no chance to say many opinion. The action was an expression about complain to the statesman. So I think the action is one of an expression . "
JOC JOC-14B-13N 1.79 "It's so exiting news. I really admire the development of technology. If we can take the flying car, it is the best way to go to school. I feel comfortable. Change of how to transport will change economy globally. But the dream won't come true for a while because there are problems about accident and license and runway. The price will be high. So I'm still anxious about taking the flying car.  This is a fascinating news and I rejoice to see the technology advances rapidly. Although there are a lot of problems about the vehicles (e. g. cost per one car, law systems, fuel efficiency, capacity of parking areas, and the like), I hope the time will come when they are available to us at a very low price. If they are introduced, I surely buy one, as even now I am already fed up with Japan's heavy traffic! I was surprised as reading the article. Because I couldn't believe flying car close to reality. I think it is possible to realize flying car only in the Harry Potter's world. The car's wings can fold in behind. I like this point . And to realize generalize, the function in order to fit into normal cars is important. It is not only wonderful point about the news but also anxiety. I am worried about safety about flying car. If the car is completion, the rule of using and the way of emergency must show for safety drive. And need people responsible . Because the car ran out of gasoline in the sky mean the car fall into the ground, town , mountain and so on. That may cause a large scale accident. So, before occurring some accident , they should think the way deal with the accident and show it us. I am looking forward to realize riding the car.  I think that this success of prototype give us dream, but it is long way to make them practical. It i because, in the sky, there are no ways that are maintained. If we drive cars in such places, there would be many accidents. When we bring fling cars into reality, we must think about things like this. However, it is really exciting news for me, because I have watched fling cars in my favorite animation. I seek to the generation which fling cars are seen ordinarily.  I was really surprised to hear this news. Speaking of flying cars, I imagine the cars in the movie of Harry Potter. Of course, Harry Potter is a movie and a fiction, so I cannot believe that this car is real. The day may come when flying cars are the mainstream of the world. Until now, humankind made the impossible possible by a continuous effort, so I believe and hope we can.  I want to buy this car too, but I wonder a deliver's license is the same as now. How about signals, air roads, and air lanes? There are many difficulties, so the generalization of flying cars may be years away.  I was surprised that I read this article very much. A lot of flying cars appeared in my dream, but I cannot yet believe that a car may fly in the sky practically. It is Unbelievable! It is long in coming to look at the real thing.  From my childhood, I have a dream driving a flying car. This news make many people happy. Many people should have dreamed flying with a car once. I am sure that it is difficult to driving it while we're living. However this progress is so big for us and we have to make efforts tl keep this progress.  I had a same image for a flying car when I reading the article. As watching the scene, I wanted to ride the car like Harry potter. I also unbelievable the car close to reality. And your comment made me encourage ! I think your comment especially last sentence is so important thinking. Although I tend to forget the thinking , I try many thing I want to do without fear.  I was surprised when I read this news and I can't believe it. I was excited very much because the thing which I watched by comics in a childhood really came out. The development of the recent technology was great, but I felt they came to here at last. I think that it is good all the more if the death of the traffic accident decrease in this technology. I want you to develop the technique that is helpful for people.  When I read this article, I was so excited to know how developed the technology was! If this kind of car will be released, I really want to try it because I think this will help those, who are very busy and have to commute for a long time. In my case, I go to Keio University by Shinkansen every day so it took a long time and cost too much. I wish I would sleep longer even when I have a class which begins at 9 by using this car! There are a lot of good points about this but I also think there are bad points at the same time. For example, as the article says, it's not unclear whether it will ever fulfill the ultimate promise of the flying car of science fiction and maybe there will happen a lot of accidents because of not having rules on traffic enough. Moreover, we have to think about if there are no problems considering environment. However, this kind of news made us happy and maybe helped many kids have wonderful dream, so I hope the frying car will be practical someday.  This is very exciting news!! Flying car is like a dream and dream thing when I was young. But in this 21 century's science technology are so great and wonderful. I am looking forward to making practical or useful. My dream will come true maybe. I wish that I can see this car and ride it in the future.  I felt excited when I read this article. This invention include our dream. Even if this is a little little little step to reality, I think the step is most important. Above all, just once I'd like to ride on the flying car!!! I want them to realize our dreams. If I am allowed to ask for more, the issue that takeoff and landing require a 200-meter grass strip should be solved in the future. Because, after all, I want to fly immediately when I am stuck in traffic.  I was surprised and excited when I read this article. I remembered that when I watched a flying car in the movie of Harry Potter, I longed to ride such dream like vehicle. I think this flying cars have many problems now. If its problems are solved and it is commonplace for the general public to commute or move, there will be no traffic jam and it will be possible to move quickly. Although I recently obtained a driving license, it will be unnecessary. I am looking forward to riding it.  It is very interesting news. With this car, it will be able that transport for commuters and middle-distance travelers, especially in countries with underdeveloped road infrastructure. But there are some problem . Operating air plane is very difficult and we need to be trained and license. Air plane accident is very danger. There is runway problem also. I think there are still many problems to solve before the fulfillment of the flying car.  I think so too. Actually there is some problems on driving the flying car, training how to fly, licenses, runway. . . etc. But anyway, I will be happy such a car become a real thing.  Flying cars are our dream. In Doraemon's world , cars are flying. A lot of children watch it, so many people have dreamed the world. The advance is wonderful. However, AeroMobil still have many problems. The Road Traffic Law doesn't cover the traffic in the air. Requiring a full airport with a big runway is a big problem. I expect flying cars' spread and I can have the car.  It is so exciting news. Imaging to drive and fly with one vehicle, it seems to be very fan, and scaring a little. I am looking forward to realization of a dream of flying cars.  I can't yet believe that cars may fly practically too. I want to ride flying cars and Maglev train fast. I have been excited.  I was surprised to know this news. I had not thought that a flying car would become real. When I was an elementary school student, I watched the movie, ""back to the future"". I love this movie because of a lot of future instrument such as a frying car. However, the problem will occur If a flying car becomes real. For example, new traffic accidents that we have never had will happen. We have to enact new laws on this invention.  I agree with you. This news makes us expect a rose-colored future. I am looking forward to seeing this invention! I like these kind of stories. I mean future science. From the last century, it has been said that cars fly. And now the dream is coming true! However, I I think flying cars will result in traffic jams of sky, because there are no rules, traffic lights etc. We need those sky traffic system in the near future.  I strongly wish this car will be on sale soon for daily use. It is amazing to know things which have been the dreams of men are now realized. I even hope this car won't need a long runway to fly up, so that I can use it anywhere. It amazes me how science today is improving fast.  I hope flying cars. When I was child, I respect it. So if these cars are made, I am very happy!! I think this invention is so exciting news for human. When I was a schoolchild, I loved Shinichi Hoshi, whose SF involved the flying car. So I was surprised that the SF story had come true. However, I think this invention won't spread easily because of the high cost of flying car . I hope the invention won't be used for weapons like SF.  I agree with you because of having fear that the lack of preparation for this invention. I think we shouldn't be hasty and prepare for practical using this invention in general.  When I read the article, I remembered a scene of ""Harry Potter"". I remember I was so excited when having seen the scene of a flying car. If this dreams come true, global transportation would change greatly and the border of people would blur. I think it will bring good results in current globalizing world.  I was surprised when I read this article. when I was child, I wanted to get flying car. Of course it was impossible to get flying car that time, but now I can make it possible my childhood dream to come true. So, I want to drive flying car right now. I hope that day comes soon.  This is so exciting a news. From the ancient, it is the human dream to fly in the sky freely. This is the case that human chimera may become reality. When I heard that news, from the bottom of my heart, I was astonished by that invention. It's not long before human dreams come true.  I felt exactly same thing with you. It is unbelievable! When I heard this news at the first time, I was very excited because I wanted to fly in the sky in my childhood. However, after reading this article, I feel uneasy for many problems of flying car. There are still many problems like accident. I suppose we mustn't only look at dream, we have to resolve those problems.  This news made me so happy! When I was a second year student in the elementary school, I drew the picture of future car. Its title was ""flying car"". So, I remembered it. At the same time, this news brought back excited feeling of my childhood. I more looked this news up online, I found and watched its promotion video. Many messages were written in the comment column from all over the world. I want to ride in that car soon!!! This news has a dream! It's so exciting! I love the popular American movie ""Back To The Future"" and the flying car ""De Lorean"" (It's a time machine) appear in it. It didn't have wings but it's so cool! When I was a child, I have wanted to drive De Lorean. I'm so excited to know my dream which I had when I was a child will come true possibly. if flying car was very popular in the future, traffic control of sky may be so hard. And I'm anxious about the noise of them. However, I agree to make flying car basically and I'm looking forward to seeing real flying car.  I agree with you and when I read this article, I was so excited to know how developed the technology was! If this kind of car will be released, I really want to try it because I think this will help those, who are very busy and have to commute for a long time. In my case, I go to Keio University by Shinkansen every day so it took a long time and cost too much. I wish I would sleep longer even when I have a class which begins at 9 by using this car! There are a lot of good points about this but as you commented, I also think there are bad points at the same time. For example, as the article says, it's not unclear whether it will ever fulfill the ultimate promise of the flying car of science fiction and maybe there will happen a lot of accidents because of not having rules on traffic enough. Moreover, we have to think about if there are no problems considering environment. However, this kind of news made us happy and maybe helped many kids have wonderful dream, so I hope the frying car will be practical someday.  I remember the movie, ""Back to the future 2"" when I read this article. You mentioned the movie, ""Harry Potter"". I was surprised to know other movie in which a flying car is found! I think that the desire to fly is a primitive hope for us.  In article, it is said that the flying car could become a regular mode of transport for commuters or travelers, especially in countries with underdeveloped road infrastructure. This is very exciting story. But I think it is very sad story that there would be countries whose road infrastructure would not be developed when car could fly.  I felt the wind of innovation in technology. If the flying car is put to practical use, we can go far with a light heart and solving traffic jams is promising. While, it is essential to make the operation of the car easier and consolidate the systems of air traffic. After all is put into place, I am looking forward to rinding the car.  I think so too. I hope this innovation in technology make people's traveling safer and more comfortable.  I was very excited. I am looking forward it too. I wish that I can see this car and ride it in the future.  I have read the book of Shinichi Hoshi too , so I really agree with your opinion. I wish this invention won't lead the situation like SF.  I was very excited to read this article because I like the movie named ""Back To The Future"" in which we can see the car-shaped flying time machine. If this car comes true, I think that we can easily move from one place to the other place far away. However, it may take a long time to be reasonable for us to buy and to be quite safe to ride. I expect Japanese companies develop flying cars earlier than those of the U. S or European countries.  Anything one man can imagine, other men can make real.  It is my favorite proverb by Jules Verne. And flying car is one of the most desired things we can imagine, so I was very excited to read the article. I'm looking forward to making real unbelievable things such flying car more and more in the future.  I agree with your opinion. It is wonderful that flying cars become real, and I want to ride on it as soon as possible. However, we must enact new traffic laws before we ride on flying cars.  I have same dream with you!! I think so too. I hope engineer resolve these problem quickly! I was very excited when I heard this news. The flying car is the one of the human's dream. If this car will be practicalized human will accomplish a splendid achievement again. I dream of the day that I can get on flying car.  I also think that If I could fly freely, it would be convenient to go around the world. If the car will achieving the future, our childhood dream to come true! Many people around the world must have same dream.  I think so. Flying cars will help us to move, but there are many problems. We should consider and solve them in order that the flying cars will be realized.  When I heard the news for the first time, I was so excited!! I think almost men have the experience in imagining to ride a flying car. It is no exaggeration that this vehicle is men's dream. As for a flying car, I can't stop remembering Harry Potter and Back To The Future. Imagining such SF situation would come true, I can't wait to come the time.  When I finished reading this news, I was very fascinated. If a production of such a dreaming car comes true, I want to ride this car. But there are some problem. For example, there are cost and security problems. Gasoline for flying should be needed. Can we find such a lot of gasoline? Security is more important problem. While anxiety of an accident is left, a passenger would be little realistically. We have to settle such problems.  I agree with you. One of the my dreams is to ride the flying car. It is a difficult way to perform practical use of a flying car, but, judging from development of the present technology, may realize it in the future when it does not have so a long it.  I completely agree with you. In such case, there are both of good and difficult side. We can't just admire the progress but also consider the problems which are with it. I would like to admire people who have worked hard for it and we should respect them. Always the people who have never given up have changed the world What an amazing invention it is! It looks like the world of Osamu Tezuka I think. I wish this invention will make us be more convenient and gentle for the earth.  I knew the news of the car which flies in the air , now that a linear motor car is making Japan excited. When Japan could develop the car which flies in the air, that would be one step of an innovative technological advance. I imagine such bright Japanese future. If that becomes a reality, I think a request and the courage are given to many Japanese.  Flying car is so cool!! I was so surprised. I love the movie "" Back to the future "" and have hoped to ride on the Hover board, so I was really got excited. I hope the day that everyone own Frying cars and we can ride them freely on blue sky. This innovation will help people's movement smooth and easy.  I strongly agree with you!!! If they are on market, I absolutely want to get one, but cost is so big maybe. So I want developer to solve cost problem and also environmental problem of car too.  I agree with you. This news is like a dream. I expect that my dream in childhood come true.  I am really interested in this news. This is because it is very cool and if we can use flying car, our way of life may change dramatically! However there are some problems, For instance, if a lot of people use the flying car, there will be a lot of traffic accidents. Anyway I wish someday I use a flying car and go where I want to go the way I want to do!! I agree with you. Of course, there are a lot of serious problem about flying cars. However, as roadway's infrastructure was improved, airway's it will be definitively improved. We can expect that we will be able to use flying cars When I read this article, I was very fascinated and I really admire the development of technology. I want to ride flying cars soon!!!! I approve your opinion. Flying is one of the common dream of human. Moreover, if flying car will become practical, the world transportation way will have changes dramatically. I hope people all over the world share the dream.  I was excited like her to development of the car which flies in the air, too. But at the same time, I hit upon a problem as traffic rule production in the sky. Her opinion was same as me. But she pointed out a problem more accurately than me. This is the reason that I chose her comment.  The article didn't say about the flying car's safety. I think a consumer want the information about safety. Although that is attractive news, I got the impression that the contents have lofty ideals. The classmate comment is the opposite of my opinion. In my opinion, that is important to human right.  There is exactly what I would like to say in this comment. I often imagine such a car. It feels like a dream if i can use that car. But I tend to be a realist. I also imagine that there are some problem.  I feel the same way. Finally this time came. We can fly with a car. How wonderful it is!!!!!! It is unbelievable.  HIs feeling is exactly same as me. (surprised, and unbelievable) I think it is so cool and damn too. And I also imagine ""Back to the future""!!! This flying car is condensed everyone's dream that we've had since when we were children. "
JOC JOC-14B-19N 1.02 "When I found this article, I was interested in this news because at University, I learned Germany and I will visit the country next year. Before reading this article, I knew that there were events to mark the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall. The picture with a lot of balloons made me relieved and feel good and I became more and more interested in the Berlin Wall. As this article mentioned, nowadays, the wall became more likely to be a part of the city and only about three kilometers from 155 kilometers! I have learned about the World War Two and the role of the wall at high school and it was so terrible for people not to move between East and West side. I can imagine that there were many problems, such as shopping to buy food, traveling, working, and so on, and I think that even influenced to each family relationship! I didn't care that 25 years have already passed since the wall was collapsed before knowing this news but I found such events very good because that would help us to remember what happened in the past. On the other hand, I feel sad to think about the problem, ""a new cold war"". I believe that the war cannot bring happiness for people so I hope that such big problem wouldn't become bigger.  We can understand how meaningful for peace the break of Berlin's wall was. As I was born after breaking Berlin's wall and the cold war finished, I can't know how grateful the peace is. However, the young generation like me should feel the importance of peace through this event and solve the problem of new cold war as new generation.  I agree with you because I don't want the new cold war spread to spread bigger. We must try to prevent our next generation from the war.  I really agree with you! We have not experienced war, so we may be careless about international problems but we should care for them and try to make more peaceful world than now.  There are people who think a cold war is a peace because people didn't killed each other basically by balance of power, but I don't think so. Some proxy wars broke out and many people in the world must have lived with being frightened at a possibility of an outbreak of war. The fall of the Berlin Wall is very important incident for not only Germany but also everyone of the East and the West and turning point of the world. I think it's nice to hold such event! People should think about the Cold War and importance of peace and tell young people who didn't experience war and the Cold War fear of war.  The events look wonderful and very fun. I want to visit the events for the 50th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall 25 years later. I think they will be held as long as the world is peace, so I hope that peace will be kept forever all over the world.  I feel enviable that you will visit Germany, and have a opportunity to feel more about the Berlin Wall.  When I read this article, I was surprised at having passed only 25 years since the Berlin Wall had been fallen. I feel the incident happened in the distant past. However some people might tend to forget about it. It's very important to fall the Berlin Wall, because it had shown the end of the Cold War. So we have to remember it. Moreover the world is on the brink of a new Cold War. Therefore we mustn't forget it and make the same mistake twice.  I agree with you! I also think it's very important to tell young people who didn't experience the Cold War because the incident is very important for those who live all over the world in our history. Therefore, they shouldn't forget about that and I hope such great event should be held for a long time! I also want to visit the anniversary event in Berlin because I think it's very nice to see the pictures! Maybe such event can be held because the world now is peaceful, so I also want the world to keep that and this event will be continued forever!!! When I read this news, I wanted to go for this event. It is a very good thing that this event in celebration of Berlin Wall collapse was held. This is because it is the proof that the east and the west were reconciled with each other. However, we must not forget that a lot of people were killed in East-West opposition in the past. According to this article, it is said that the new Cold War begins now. I think that the leaders of all over the world should think about misery of the war to stop this war.  I strongly sympathize with your opinion. Because I was born in the times when we were peaceful, I did not experience misery of the war directly. So, we check war by oneself and must tell a young generation. I think that we can feel importance of the peace by this. This event plays a splendid role in this sense.  The Berlin Wall is known to everyone in the world because it is symbol of the Cold War. In those days, Germany was separated into two areas. Germany's capital was also separated and the separation was the Berlin Wall. Now that is broken but part of that is remained. I think the event like this is good to be held not to forget the horrible war. We should try not to repeat such thing through this event.  This event is very wonderful. It is accompanied by not only the appearance but also the content. I disturb a symbol of the Cold War and think that it is splendid to celebrate the thing that became free. I will think that it is important that I convey the splendor of the peaceful thing through such an event all over the world in future. I go to Germany sometime and want to go to the place of Berlin Wall.  The Berlin Wall had already fallen before I was born. Thus I know this matter through book and TV. I could not understand how important the Berlin Wall is. This wall divided German for two parts, west and east. However, I understood what an impressive matter that was. This matter symbolized the finish of cold war. I thought that I would like to know about history.  I think such an event is wonderful and should be held more. In the event, people can enjoy it and remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany. Handing down tragedy is very important.  After I read this article, I had a renewed sense of the importance of freedom. We should be remembered that The Cold War extracted a price. Some families were separated by Berlin Wall. The weak of society is plagued by international military conflict all through the ages. The nations are meant to protect of human rights. So, I remain dead-set against wars. I pray for peace all over the world.  Of course I know Berlin Wall because it is a powerful symbol of the end of the Cold War. I learned that many Germans had been deprived of their liberty by the construction of Berlin Wall. We know such a painful past. I think the event which marks the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall would be great. Therefore, people who know terrible influence of the war should tell young people that there was a war in the past. We must not forget a fear of war and victims of war.  Time flies like an arrow. a quarter century has passed. It was tragedy that a lot family was separate because of politics. There may be the economic gap between the East and West, but I believe Germany and its people. I really like Germany and hope Germany develop. Every time I hear these kind of news, I feel the cold war is far away. Glory to Germany! I think that it is a difficult challenge to change a national flag. This is because, the national flag is a classic thing and informing the country all over the world. I think they may be dissatisfied with a current national flag, but it can be expected that they disturb a past tradition when they change it. In consideration of a thing that It is not only the thing of current people and I want you to think carefully.  We did not really know the Berlin Wall collapse, but have looked by news and an article many times. It would be an extremely big event for the people of the time, but I think that it will fade onward. However, I think that such an event is very important so that German people do not completely forget it. I think that it is necessary to hand down past trouble because they can live happily like the present. That's why, I think that this event have a very important meaning.  I really agree with you. We know only the peaceful world so it becomes natural. However, I think that we must not forget that we can live happily now thanks to the effort of past people. I think that it is important to remember and save about the Cold War and Berlin Wall collapse by such an event not to leave them.  We can't feel how happiness thing the peace is because Berlin's wall and the cold war finished before we were born. The young generation like us should feel the importance of peace through this event and consider about the problem of new cold war.  When I found the title of the article, I felt my interest rising. I think this event is so wonderful. The World War and The Cold War was over, and fortunately, Japan isn't dragged into a terrible war now. However, many small country are still at war. Besides there is no telling when such a war will break out. We must maintain such a event in order not to wars make people sad.  I was really surprised about this news because I hadn't known that New Zealand is trying to change the national flag. I completely agree with the opinion that that national flags play the important role in identifying their nationalities. If Japanese government tried to change the national flag, I would object to that movement. That's why I love Japanese flag and accustomed to look this flag. This article gave me the opportunity to think about the role of national flags.  I think your remark is similar to my notion. I think all we can do is to preach the horrible side of war to children and it doesn't bring about good things, but dire things.  A collapse in the Berlin Wall was to be significant for peace of the world. The wall has cut the same German people off. The family and their friends sometimes became separate. A lot of people tried to exceed a wall, and passed away. These are the very regrettable time. It was happy for German people that the age has ended. The movement of EU is made after fall of the Berlin Wall, and Europe approached peace. I wish the festival in this time continues lengthily, and that peace is kept.  I think this idea is very good. Although there are big problem between east and west in the 20 century, but there are good relationship now. I hope we will remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany.  I think they are very important events. Because it reminds people how was cold war. And now there are many young people who don't experience the war. So in order not to forget misery of war, such events are important.  I think German people endured a very difficult time. Because Japan and Italy were not separated. Only German people experienced dividing their own country. And we also should remind how terrible Communism was. The difference of quality of life between West-Berlin and East Berlin shows that.  When the Berlin Wall was fallen, I was not born yet. So, I do not know about the real circumstances, but I hear that ""during my live, I did not think the Berlin Wall was fallen. "" from adults. I think the Cold War has a heavy impact to the world. Now, many countries wish the peace of the world, and and are working hard. Like this article, people can get over a difficulty. Although, many problems still exist now, people wish everything would be going well, and fall of the Berlin Wall will never wearing thin with time.  I agree with your opinion. Not to forget Berlin Wall, we should tell young people and we never repeat same suffering from war. As young people, we must also learn more about this problem actively.  There are various histories in Berlin, but ""Berlin Wall"" is well known to everyone. When we go on a sightseeing, we often finish seeing the former site of the Berlin Wall. So it is not easy to understand complicated history. ""LICHTGRENZE (25 Years Fall of the Wall) "" would be the good chance to learn Berlin history for us.  I was born after Berlin Wall had fallen, the Cold War had finished. Also, there are more children who don't know about the Cold War as time passes. I think thousands of balloons are very important for us because they teach us how forerunners acquired the peace and blessing of it.  When seeing the title of this news, I had an interest very much. It's because I got a German lecture. The Berlin Wall is a peaceful symbol. Cold war is the affair in the memory for the generation of the parent and my grandparents, but for us, only an affair of ordinary history. Because we have no memory of a war, we have to be making an effort so that a war isn't caused.  Your opinion is very similar to my opinion. Our generation don't know terribleness of the war, but our grandparents know the war, so we can hear this incident from a person with experience. However, next generation can't hear this from a person close to them, so we have to know and tell the war to them correctly.  I agree with your ideas but the cold war is a balance of the power. This is the fact and also truth. As you say, some proxy wars occurred in the period of the cold war. However, a lot of ideologies countries and civil wars have appeared after the cold war. We should consider which is better the cold war or post cold war.  I don't know what the Cold War is like directly or the meaning of Berlin Wall properly. I studied them from history when I was high school student. But I can understand that we must not repeat war and keep piece, so in that piece these balloons are seriously seriously important.  I agree with you. To protect piece and in order not for this event to fade away, we have to hand it down for next generation. Moreover, we should participate in events like this, for example Hiroshima .  When I read this article, I was surprised at having passed only 25 years since the Berlin Wall had been fallen. In the event, people can enjoy it and remember the memory of age when Berlin Wall divided Germany. So I think it's nice event.  I think so, too!!! I want to visit the event, too! I hope such great event should be held for a long time!"
JOC JOC-14B-28N 1.69 "When I found the headline of this news, I thought it was very interesting for us because all of us are related to ""eating"" and ""health"". Recently, I often drink coffee and perhaps many people are more likely to drink coffee. For example, famous coffee shops such us STARBUCKS, there are always many people and maybe we tend to consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. However, this article reminds us how healthy drinking tea is. I live in Shizuoka, where tea is famous for, so i think I will more cups of tea than now and we should keep our health!!

Through this news, I knew that tea's ingredients are good to our health so we should drink tea. However, we should remember that drinking tea too much makes us worth in terms of the health. We should only three cups of tea a day.  I was really surprised at this statement ""Drinking tea is actually better for you than drinking water. Water is essentially replacing fluid. Tea replaces fluids and contains antioxidants so it's got two things going for it. "" Being healthy is so important for us all human beings of course. I've loved to drink tea for long time, so I'll try to drink more.  When I read the head line, I was interested in it. I drink water every day, but I drink little cup of tea.

Although I think I drink tea as much as possible, everything is said excessive is not good. So people including me after hearing the news , they tend to drink tea so much . But people should revive the news as advice. It is good to drink tea, but it take care of excessive drinking.  This news is good news for me absorbed in a diet. It's surprise for something to excel to have matched water. But is the excessive drinking of excessive genki drink really good for a body? A question is left.  I was surprised to know that tea is not dehydrating and it is a healthy drink. I do not think that tea is bad for our health. However, our ancestors drink water because there is not tea long , long time ago. So, I believe that something we have eaten and drunken for long time is healthier than something we created. I was shocked to know the fact that tea is healthier than water is. We often misunderstand a fact because we believe ""common sense"". We have to remember this lessons and bear in mind.  I think that this article is very important for us. Because the health is one of the things which is the most important in our life. What I was surprised at in particular is that tea is better for health than water. Since I like tea, I always drink it. However, I feel that I drink tea too much. According to this article, the excessive drinking of the tea seems to be bad in health. So, I think that I want to be careful not to drink tea too much from now on.  I know that the correspondence to an emigrant is very severe situation in Japan. However, when I read this article, I felt that the situation was too terrible. All the human beings have human rights inherently. Not to mention it, it is not a thing applied to only a Japanese. As you can see, I think that it is not a permissible thing not to give a foreigner medical care. Japan should think about the acceptance of immigrants and asylum-seekers .  I like a tea more than a water. So, when I read this article, I was very happy. I want to spend healthy life because sicking life is bad for us. If drinking tea is more healthy than drinking water, I drink tea only! I'll try it.  This article is information useful for the girl who worries about health and a diet. It's said that they have the various effect on tea. For example, it was revealed that a catechin has the action against which the flu virus infection is defended. And, Recently, ""Tea-tox"" which makes waste discharge to the interior of the body is popular in Europe and America. I'll try to drink more! This is good news for me. This is because I drink much barley tea in a day. However, this article says only ""tea"", so I cannot know weather barley tea is useful or not. If the tea is pointed black tea, I examine to change my drink from barley tea to tea.  I am glad to read this news because I drink 2 or 3 cups of tea in a day. Actually, for most of the Japanese, drinking tea is one of the most common custom of everyday lives. I personally think we the Japanese should cherish the old tradition such as drinking tea.  I have heard that tea is good for human health. The fact that tea protects your teeth is very surprising. I am from Shizuoka, where is famous for tea. However, I rarely drink tea. After reading this article, I will try to drink tea everyday.  When I read this article, I was really surprised that drinking tea is good for our health, especially cancers, heart diseases, and teeth. I drink a cup of tea everyday and I think it is more delicious than water or some soft drink, so I was happy to hear that. I decide that I would not change my routine which drinks it every morning.  Drinking 3 or 4 cups of tea is easy for us Japanese. We drink tea in daily life without thinking. Moreover. it's good news for us that Tea is good for health. However, I don't think we have to make it a habit. I think drinking tea is our traditional habit and we know how to enjoy it. I don't think it is good to take a cup of tea from a feeling of duty. Although it is important to keep our health, we should enjoy our culture.  I was surprised that tea is such a healthy drink. Recently, I think there is a trend STARBUCKS is cool and many people are more likely to drink coffee. May be i'm one of them. So, i think the consumption of tea decrease. But this is good news!! We are the people in country of Ryokucha. Let's try to drink more tea! I really agree with your idea that to be excessive is not good in everything. After having read this article, I also made a decision to drink more cups of tea, but at the same time, I would try to follow your advice!!! Anyway, I think it is a good thing for us to do what we can do for improving our health!! You said that you drink tea only. However, Everything in moderation. I think that drinking too much tea is bad for your health as might be expected. Health means a lot of different things to different people. If you are health-obsessed, the attitude towards your health has an adverse health effect in a nice little twist.  i was very surprised to see the news because I love tea and I always drink it. I've ever heard that drinking coffee is good for our health before, so it is in the nature of things that tea is healthy because it contains caffeine. But tea is useless when we have heatstroke, we can't recover without water. In that kind of meaning, I think water is healthier than tea.  I think so too. I've never known that tea has a good influence for health though I have known that drinking coffee is good for our health . I also love tea, so I like tea more than ever by reading the article.  I am very interested in your opinion. I like Starbucks, too, and also consider ""it is cool"" to do works drinking a cup of coffee. In addition, when I watched the person who walks while drinking coffee of Starbucks in a town, they looks very smart. I understand that tea is healthier than coffee. However, I think I continue to drink coffee. But, I also want to drink Shizuoka's tea.  I was surprised to know this fact. But I often drink coffee than tea, so I wanted to know about coffee. It is interesting and healthy for us for every restaurants and shops to service tea for free because of helping by government. It lead to promote health fitness of the people.  I was so surprised by this news, and I had drunk tea every day, too. However, it is important that we should not drink it too much. Thus, we don't have to drink more tea than now.  I was interested in this topic because this topic told about health. Everyone wants to live healthy. I was surprised at that tea is better for health than water. I do not drink tea everyday. Therefore, I try to drink tea everyday. However, I think that it is important to pay attention to drinking too much is bad for health.  On the face of this article's headline , I thought that ""what a coincidence! How lucky I am!"" Actually, I'm habitual drinker of tea. In terms of health benefits that tea gives us, I knew a little bit like, it'll protect against heart disease and some cancers. But I didn't know the fact that tea can impair the body's ability to absorb iron from food. As remarked in the article, foods containing iron and tea eaten together are said to disagree with you. So I gonna reconsider my habitual drinking of that fluid. And vice versa, I gonna recommend my friends to drink it to keep themselves healthy. It isn't too much to say that this is the age of Health-minded. So intrinsic power of food like this will catch on among people. In terms of business administration, more and more company should take advantage of this aspect, i think. It'll not only benefit company but make Japan the healthiest country in the world.  I am jealous of you, and What a waste!!! I liked green tea so much I could die. I have heard that Shizuoka tea is more delicious than other region tea. I want you to proud of the staple products of Shizuoka!! I was very surprised when I read this article. I still can't believe that drinking three cups of tea a day is as good for you as drinking plenty of water. I can understand that tea may even have extra health benefits. However I am worried that a person who doesn't drink water, drink only tea will appear. I think that drinking water is so important for our health too.  I think so too. Drinking tea is something happiness or routine for us. So we shouldn't make it a habit. Whoever wants to put into practice may try it.  I myself drink cups of tea, and I am pleased to read this article. As this article said, tea has potentials, which shows the prospective that Japanese beverage companies can sell tea products. But, in my experience, drinking too many cups of tea sometimes makes my body heavier. And there are evidences that too much tea causes urolithiasis. so in the long term, I prefer to drink water mainly.  I liked your comments. I once heard the efficacy of the coffee. It also has the lot of benefits, such as activation of the brain, protection against diabetes and so on. But as one of the tea lovers, I wanna praise its efficacy! I think you have a good point. Owing to its benefits, tea can be a big business opportunity, which might lead a win-win relationship between societies and companies.  I was surprised to find to have tea better for a body than I drank water. There is a kind of much in tea. I'd like to have various tea. But the excessive drinking is bad for a body. Caffeine is in tea. There is dependence in caffeine. This discovery is quite good thing, but I think a balance of the amount which drink tea should be considered.  I agree with your opinion completely!! I am worried about that a person who don't drink water appear. However, I also can trust that tea is health for us. So I would try to drink tea much!! You can be convinced your opinion approximately. But please don't forget that we should pay attention to excessive drinking of tea. If I come, the time when a lot of people carry a tumbler with ""tea"" around is fascinating like STARBUCKS COFFEE, isn't it? When I read this article, I was surprised that tea is healthier than water. For a long time, I have a opinion that tea has some negative effects, like a diuretic. I think that it is not good to drink more than a cup of tea. However, I read this article and changed my mind. It is interesting. I would like to know what food is good for our health or not.  I try to drink tea as much as possible. However, I can't get into habit of drinking tea. As I read your article, it is exactly what I think! If I drink water, I feel guilty or stress. So it is better to care about such a little things. I think also people are healthy as they don't feel stress . If they feel a stress, it is better to stop the behavior. The problem is not only this article but also many thing in an information society. For example, Many women tend to have a interest in a diet. In a real world, there are many information about a way to diet. They believe and try these information. We live in information society, so we need to judge whether information from source or not and care about overdo anything. In short, it is important that excessive behavior is bad. Your comment relieved me of my stress. Thank you so much! I was surprised, too. Since I think water is simple drink so water is more health than a tea. But, I like a tea more than water. I am lucky. I want to be more health drinking a cup of tea.  I didn't know that tea is healthier than water, so I was very surprised when I read this article.

JOC JOC-15A-11N 1.55 "Self-driving cars have being people's dream for more than 50 years. I am sure that everyone in the world dreamed about having a self-driving car. I am both surprised and excited when I first time heard a news about self-driving cars. Safety problem still exists but when this difficulty is cleared self-driving cars will be a new common sense.  According to this article, I think self-driving cars are safe, but I am not so much interested in it now. Indeed, it was the one of many people's dream. However, it has been unwanted for me since I got my driver license and knew the pleasure of driving.  I think ""hacking"" is biggest problem of self-driving car. Self-driving car has to connect to internet every time due to download map data, traffic data, temperature data, and so on. In that process, if someone would break into the car system, he ware possible to access driving-system. It's extremely dangerous. If he or they were terrorists group, I can't imagine the injury. Automotive companies face very difficult security problem, but it's good opportunity to improve security research.  As for the development of the self-driving  car, safety is always regarded as important. Two self-driving  cars did not clash with each other this time, but will not avoid the accident if self-driving  cars increase in the public road. I think that I want them to aim at the realization of the automatic driving car after improvement of the further precision because two automatic driving cars did not have the malfunction.  Because I do not have a driver's license, I do not understand it, but there seem to be many people who make a drive a hobby. When a company pays more attention only to the development of the self-driving cars and does not pursue the comfort of the common car, I think that I feel sorry for the people.  When I read this article, I changed my thought to self-driving  car. I thought self-driving  car is not safe completely before. What two self-driving  cars avoid each other is amazing.  I was surprised at self-driving  cars are certain to safe. I haven't known the test till read this article. Efforts of companies making self-driving  cars will be rewarded and these cars will be common in 10 years. But we should drive the car carefully whether the car is a self-driving  car or a car.  I was very surprised when I read this article. I think that development of technology is remarkable. I do not have driving license, but a lot of my friends have it. Therefore I want to it. However, if we can ride self-driving  car in the future, we do not need the driving license. I think it's wonderful if accident decrease, but I am fearful that riding self-driving  car.  When I heard this news I felt terrify because I believe the safety of self-driving cars. The development of this new technology will caused many merits, but Today's companies' method is wrong. They see only the goal that prevail this new things. So, I think the process for the goal is important. In this world, it's difficult to do something rightly all, but they can make an effort to do rightly. In this article, this case is used for raising the trust for the self driving cars. Don't you think it is not correct? There is some accident as for it, but this is unlikely to see the light of day. The company should improve their existing thing before developing new models.  I have the exactly same idea too. I was surprised and I got excited when I read this article. Even though safety problem still exists, we should make use of these systems when the problem is solved. Though I wonder if we need a license for self-driving car, because you are actually not driving.  When I read this article, I think self driving cars have terrible aspect. People doing research don't complete self driving car's system. I want them to enhance this new technology's quality. Also, We have believed such a wonderful car. Self driving car is the dream of many people who love cars. But, some people are worried that there aren't drivers licenses. I think that's good if people don't drive because there won't be any terrible accidents.  I think so, too. Self driving cars are not safe. I think we cannot driving safely without being careful. The researchers must do more and more experiments not to happen terrible accidents.  I think so , too. Self driving cars are not safe. I think we cannot driving safely without being careful. The researchers must do more and more experiments not to happen terrible accidents.  I know how you think!! If we depend on self-driving, it ensures that our lives is safety. But what is the point of getting license since then??"
ACA ACA-AMM-001 0.88 "HOW TO RECOGNIZE FOSSILS Fossils are not rare. We have seen how millions of fossils may make up the rocks themselves, crammed together layer after layer to form formations thousands of feet thick. The present land surface is a thin skin on top of a thick record of the past preserved in the rocks. Once scientists began to collect the record of past life they soon came across the problem of how to order and arrange the huge variety of fossil forms they recovered. In order to understand what they had found they needed to classify the fossil organisms into particular kinds, more or less similar, to impose an order on what would otherwise have been a vast and chaotic mass of different and apparently unrelated relics. The urge to order the natural world appears to be an innate characteristic of human beings: ‘a place for everything and everything in its place’. But classifying animals and plants, living and fossil, is more than just an attempt to find a convenient way of slotting them into different categories, like stamps in a stamp album, for neatness and convenience. The classification of the natural world is supposed to reflect the great ordering process that itself gave rise to the variety and diversity of animals and plants that are alive today: the process of evolution. Animals that look similar are classified together, and not only that, they are also closely related in an evolutionary sense (or put another way, they share a common ancestor). So when we look at the grimacing gestures of a chimpanzee and wonder at the almost ludicrous parallels with our own behaviour this is just part of a whole host of behavioural and anatomical similarities that show without doubt that we ought to be classified with the apes (we are all of us primates), and that we share a distant ancestor with our diminutive caricatures. Evolution has driven man and the chimpanzee further apart from our shared ancestral species, and in evolutionary terms the chimpanzee is as advanced as we are, although man dominates by virtue of numbers and adaptability. Few people are offended today, as they were in the last century, by the thought of man and the chimpanzee being classified together by virtue of a common ancestor which has been extinct for probably more than three million years! But enough family likeness remains to make the chimpanzees' tea-time a most popular attraction in zoos all over the world. A word of caution here: not all similarities indicate relationships with evolutionary significance. Some similarities can be misleading, because animals can superficially resemble one another that are not closely related in an evolutionary sense. Often these resemblances are the product of a similar mode of life. Both tortoises and armadillos are animals that carry around their own suit of armour, and at first glance we might think they were related. But a little further investigation shows that tortoises are cold-blooded reptiles that lay eggs, while armadillos are in many respects typical warm-blooded mammals bearing their young alive. Obviously tortoises and armadillos cannot be classified together in spite of their similarities. When classifying fossils even more care is necessary because we have not got as much evidence to go on as with living animals. We cannot see directly whether a fossil animal was warm or cold-blooded when alive; often the evidence is indirect and depends on careful study of little bits of bone. The palaeontologist is like a detective trying to reconstruct a full story from a few  fragmentary clues. He must be careful not to follow any ‘red herrings’ that will result in him classifying his fossil on the basis of ambiguous similarities. He must distinguish snakes from eels, tortoises from armadillos, on the basis of the bones presented to him. To do this, he must have thorough familiarity with the living fauna, because the information on living animals is so much more complete. We shall see in the next chapter how carrying comparisons with living animals too far can result in curious and inaccurate pictures of the past. Distantly related species may come to resemble one another closely. Slow worm (left ), snake (right ) and amphisbaenid (bottom ), probably all descended from different ancestors, and reached their similar shapes along separate evolutionary pathways. The number of species of animals and plants living today runs into millions, and similar numbers of species have probably lived on earth for at least part of the earth's history. Perhaps it is fortunate that the fossil record preserved only a fraction of the truly stupendous total number of species that must have lived since the Cambrian, for otherwise the scientists' task to catalogue 600 million years of life would be an impossible one. It is not surprising that new fossil species are discovered daily, and indeed the amateur collector has a good chance of finding a new species of fossil, if he looks hard enough and learns to recognize what he has found. There must have been an increase in the number of different kinds of animals and plants since the Precambrian; for example, the conquering of land alone gave rise to a multitude of new opportunities for the colonizing organisms, resulting in an increase in the total number of species. Within the marine environment itself some palaeontologists believe that the overall richness of the marine fauna was established early on, say by the Silurian period, and that there has not been a great increase in the total number of species living in the sea at any one time since then, although of course the kinds of organisms inhabiting the sea have changed many times. And there have been several major episodes of extinction (Chapter 6), when the cast of characters in the sea changed almost totally. Although the number of  species may have been at least approximately the same in marine environments for the last 300 million years or so the kinds of fossils have changed repeatedly, so that, for example , in marine limestones of Silurian age the shelled brachiopods may number dozens of species, whereas in similar looking limestones of Eocene age no brachiopods at all can be found, but there may be as many species of gastropods of kinds unknown in Silurian rocks. Even by the beginning of the Cambrian period, when fossils start to become easy to find and many different kinds of animals had acquired preservable hard parts, it is possible to classify the fossils found in the rocks into broadly similar groups. Nearly all of these groups correspond with major divisions of living animals, so the broad base of classification was established by the Cambrian. These major groups continued to evolve throughout the following 600 million years, and they include the distant ancestors of our living fauna. Not all the major living groups of organisms were present in the Cambrian, however, because the colonization of the land did not take place for another 200 million years, and so there were obviously no direct ancestors of land plants around, or of most of the land animals with which we are familiar today. The major groups into which we can fit almost all fossils from the Cambrian onwards, and all the living fauna, are called phyla (singular:phylum ). To identify any animal properly, the first stage is to determine to which phylum it belongs. Of course even the phyla themselves originated from unknown ancestors, and they all ultimately derived from the first living cell. Fossil evidence for some of this early history is shrouded in obscurity, hidden in the vast stretches of Precambrian time, but as is shown in Chapter 7 more evidence is being discovered each year. Some of the answers are only now coming to light as we find out more about the structures of the proteins that go to make up living cells themselves. By the time organisms had become sophisticated enough to have hard parts, evolution had already defined the phyla, and the great natural framework for classification had been almost completely constructed. At the opposite end of the scale from the phylum is the smallest unit of classification usually used for fossils: the species . To be strictly accurate a species can be defined precisely only in living animals, where it refers to populations that can interbreed under natural conditions, and which produce offspring that are capable of further reproducing their kind. In practice, many species are recognized by having some peculiarity of shape, behaviour, plumage, colour and so on, that reliably set them apart from all other similar species. Obviously we shall never know whether fossil species were capable of interbreeding until somebody invents a time machine, and we can go back and see for ourselves! So our fossil species are defined in a rather practical way, as showing some consistent difference or differences from all other related species. Because of the patchy nature of the fossil record many species (particularly of large vertebrate animals) are known from only one specimen; some of these are of almost inestimable value, which is why museums have to take good care of their material. Every species has a unique scientific name. The species are ‘christened’ when a scientist describes them for the first time, illustrates their peculiarities and publishes the name in a scientific journal. The species name has two words:Tyrannosaurus rex is a familiar example. The names are usually derived from Latin or Greek —‘Tyrannosaurus ’ means ‘tyrant lizard’and ‘rex ’‘king’so the animal is appropriately described as King of the tyrant lizards:rex is the specific name , unique to this species. There may be other dinosaurs, which are similar to Tyrannosaurus rex , but belong to another species. These may be included in the same genus — Tyrannosaurus —but will be given a different specific name. Some species are named after their collectors, so if our new species of Tyrannosaurus were collected by a Mr Jones it might eventually be christened Tyrannosaurus jonesi . Incidentally, the generic name always starts with a capital letter, and the specific name with a small one, even if it is named after Jones. In this chapter typical examples of the kinds of fossils most commonly encountered are illustrated by beautiful specimens. Very few fossils have everyday names, and so the scientific name is used. Once a few have been mastered it is surprising how quickly the most ponderous sounding scientific name acquires a familiar ring. The scientific name has the great advantage of being the same all over the world, so the language of nomenclature is a truly international one. Between the species on the one hand and the phylum on the other there are a whole series of intermediate categories of increasing  inclusiveness. Several genera (plural of genus) may be grouped together in a family , several families together in a superfamily , and the superfamilies themselves are clustered into classes , two or more of which combine to make the phylum. It all sounds rather complicated, but it does serve a useful function in ordering the almost countless number of species in the most economical way. All the species within any of the units of classification descended from a single, ancestral species. We need not worry about families or superfamilies in this book, but classes often correspond to everyday groups of animals. In the phylum Mollusca — the molluscs which include the majority of sea animals with shells — the class Gastropoda includes all the snails, and the class Bivalvia all the clams (mussels, scallops, etc.). Many of the most familiar fossils, like the trilobites, are classes within larger phyla. Plants are classified in much the same way as animals, but just to make things difficult the largest units of classification are not generally called phyla but ‘divisions’. Many of the plants familiar in the garden — Dahlia, Chrysanthemum, Fuchsia — are generic names which have come into common language. The fossil record of plants is rather patchy compared with that of some animal phyla. Partly because of this the broad level classification of plants is still being argued. We will now examine the commonest and most important kinds of fossils, the kinds that the reader will be able to find when he starts a collection. The groups of organisms described have certain special peculiarities that set them apart from all others, and once these features are recognized the group to which the fossil belongs can be confidently identified. Each group is illustrated in the plates by a typical species, but of course all the groups contain many species, and any specimen the reader is likely to find will probably differ from the one chosen for illustration in several details. Most accounts of the different kinds of fossils start with the simplest organisms and work towards the most complex, often ending somewhat selfishly with man. This can give the impression of a simple evolutionary tree: single cells to many cells, shellfish to fish, and then land vertebrates. This is not correct. Although single-celled organisms are obviously simpler than complex animals like ourselves, many single-celled organisms have continued to evolve actively since they lived in the ‘primaeval soup’. It is known that some of the unicellular organisms in the sea today are only one or two million years old (very little in geological terms), in fact they are probably as young as man himself! Very simple and very complex organisms have lived side by side for a long time and both have evolved together. True ‘living fossils’ are really rather rare, and the term can be applied to both simple and highly complex organisms that have outlived the time when the earth was populated with many more of their kind. It is easier to describe simple organisms first and move on to complex ones but this is just a convenience of arrangement, and we will follow this procedure here. Some of the most important fossils are extremely tiny: these will be discussed in a later chapter, and what follows is concerned with the forms that can be recognized from hand specimens. When they are first chipped out of the rock such fossils will often be partly concealed by matrix. To identify them it is usually essential to clean off most of the enclosing rock, otherwise one can be misled by superficial resemblance. The rule is never to try such cleaning in the field — it nearly always results in a pile of rubble and a frayed temper. THE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FOSSILS AND HOW TO RECOGNIZE THEM SINGLE-CELLED ANIMALS — PROTOZOA (Colour plate 2) A large and heterogeneous collection of organisms are grouped in the Protozoa, including all those animals that can lead an autonomous existence as a single cell. Most are microscopic, and many have no skeleton and therefore lack a fossil record. The flexible amoeba, which is the protoplasmic ‘blob’ of popular imagination, is a familiar protozoan without much potential for fossilization. A few protozoan groups secrete hard tests (shells) which are very common fossils, but again most of these are too small to be easily spotted in the field. They are of great geological importance, however, and we shall return to them later in this book. Such testate protozoans have a record extending back to the Cambrian. A very few protozoans secrete skeletons of (for a single cell) gigantic size, and these also occur in such numbers that they form conspicuous and common fossils. Particularly in rocks of Eocene age the coin-like nummulites are important as rock builders. Nummulites are  known from England, but they are most numerous in the Mediterranean and eastwards, where they form limestone formations of great thickness. The pyramids of Egypt are constructed of limestone blocks in which the species Nummulites gizehensis is conspicuous (opposite p. 64). Nummulites are a giant kind of foraminiferan, an important group of rock-forming organisms as far back as the Carboniferous (and with ancestors in Cambrian rocks), and which still form deep sea oozes today. Most foraminiferans require a microscope for their study. Another group of giant foraminiferans flourished particularly in the Permian period: these are the fusulines. Instead of being about the size and shape of a coin, the fusulines are spindle-shaped, with a round cross-section tapering at both ends; fusuline limestones again form thick rock sequences, particularly in Russia and the Orient. Both fusulines and nummulites are divided into many small chambers internally, and details of their internal structure are used to classify them. Both groups seem to have flourished in exceptionally warm, shallow seas in the tropics of the Tethyan region. THE SPONGES — PHYLUM PORIFERA (Colour plates 1, 3) The sponges are an important group of many-celled organisms, with the individual cells specialized for particular functions but rather loosely aggregated. Some sponges have the property of being able to ‘rebuild’ their colonies of cells if they are mashed up. Marine sponges have a long fossil record from the Cambrian onwards, and at many localities they are abundant enough to be important rock formers. They have been prominent reef-building organisms too, often in association with bryozoans. Not all sponges contain hard parts capable of being fossilized. The skeletal elements of those with hard parts are fine, often branching elements called spicules . The spicules may be only loosely associated within the sponge tissues, or may be more or less fused to form rigid skeletons. Two major divisions of sponges are distinguished on the composition of the spicules: the glass sponges have a skeleton composed of silica, one of the few examples in nature where this material is used as a basis for a skeleton, while the calcareous sponges use calcium carbonate for their spicules. Both kinds have Cambrian representatives and both flourish today, the glass sponges being especially numerous in deep-sea environments. The sponge skeleton is highly variable in shape: many are cup or flask shaped, others spherical or cauliflower-like, while some form flat plates folded together, or are encrusting. A successful group of sponges has taken to boring into the shells of other organisms. In detail, sponges are distinguished by the form of the spicular structure, and the ways these combine to form the skeleton, as well as the overall shape. Although sponges are widely distributed in the fossil record they are particularly numerous and easy to collect in Cretaceous rocks in Europe and North America, where dozens of well-preserved species have been described. Sponges are often preserved inside flints, which were originally deposited as hard layers within the Cretaceous chalk. As they are much more resistant to weathering than the enclosing chalk, the flints remain behind when the chalk is eroded away. Flints containing sponges may be incorporated into younger sediments (they are then known as derived fossils ), and it is not unusual for such flints to be dug up in suburban gardens around London — a long journey from the Cretaceous seas. The calcareous sponge Raphidonema faringdonense from the Cretaceous of Berkshire, England. This sponge with a calcite skeleton was obtained from a gravel, an unusual type of rock in which to find fossils It is a broadly cup-shaped sponge, rapidly expanding from a narrow base. The minutely porous external surface is covered with irregular bumps. number of species of this genus have been reported from Cretaceous rocks, and related genera occur back to the Triassic. Species related to this one occur in France, Germany, Italy and Switzerland. Sponges vary a good deal in size and shape. The specimen shown has a height of 7 cm. Specimens from unconsolidated gravels are not difficult to clean, any adherent sand grains being easily removed using a stout pin. CORALS AND RELATED ANIMALS — PHYLUM COELENTERATA (Colour plates 4, 5, 6, 9) The coelenterates are a varied group of organisms with cells organized into definite  tissues, a mouth surrounded by tentacles, and a stomach. The tentacles are arranged in a circlet about the mouth, and the coelenterates are typified by such radial symmetry. The majority of coelenterates have a jelly-like consistency, and the group includes the familiar jellyfish and sea anemones, as well as the smaller hydroids commonly kept in schoolroom fresh water tanks. Coelenterates come in two main designs: they are either attached with the tentacles surrounding the mouth waving like an animal flower in the water (polyp ), or free floating with the tentacles hanging down, often as fine as hair (medusa ). Coelenterates have stinging cells which they use to paralyse their prey. It is surprising to find that the soft-bodied jellyfish have any fossil record at all, but in fact they have the longest one of the phylum. Casts of the stomach cavities have been described from Precambrian rocks in many parts of the world, and many different Precambrian jellyfish have now been named. It   is certain that the seas of 600 to 1000 million years ago swarmed with drifting medusae, just as they do at present. These free-floating coelenterates are therefore both primitive and ancient. Some groups within the coelenterates have developed the ability to secrete a hard skeleton, of which by far the most important are the corals (Class Anthozoa). The lithistid sponge Pemmatites arcticus from the Permian of the arctic island of Spitzbergen (left ). The sponge skeleton has weathered out of a limestone. Unweathered specimens are sometimes difficult to see on the rock surfaces. This sponge superficially resembles a living bath sponge more than the other sponges in this book, being bun-shaped, with a minutely pitted external surface. Pemmatites species are known from a number of localities in the Permian and Carboniferous of Europe . This specimen has a diameter of 7 cm. To obtain a hand specimen we rely on the differential weathering of the sponge and the matrix. Some related forms are better studied in polished section like the corals. Section across a typical rugose coral (Palaeosmilia , Carboniferous) A coral is essentially a sea anemone which supports its body by a skeleton of calcium carbonate. This first happened early in the Ordovician (some believe even earlier), and there were no doubt simple polyps in the Cambrian and Precambrian from which the corals evolved. The secretion of a skeleton gave the corals a great advantage over many other coelenterates; supported thus they could overcome the lack of rigidity of their soft tissues and grow large. Many coral species form branching colonies in which hundreds of individual polyps live on top of their own houses. Other forms remain solitary — a single polyp. From soon after their inception colonial corals started to live together in large masses with one or many species forming large, mound-like, wave resistant structures — coral reefs. Many organisms other than corals also contribute to the construction of the reef. Fossil reefs are one of the prime sites to look for fossils of many different kinds besides the corals themselves. Corals can be divided into several major groups. In the Palaeozoic, corals looking generally similar to living reef corals may be only distantly related, if at all, to our present day fauna. These rugose corals can be solitary, or massive in large reefs; in either case their skeletons are composed of the form of calcium carbonate known as calcite . The finest details of the skeletal structure are well-preserved, and the corals can be cut and polished, or studied in thin sections (see p. 57). The detailed structure of the individual plates that combine together to build the skeleton are the basis for the classification of the corals, as well as the general form. The most obvious of these building elements are plates arranged radially, looking like the spokes of a bicycle wheel in section (septa ). In rugose corals the septa usually have a basic four-rayed symmetry in each corallite. Rugose corals are common fossils in rocks of Ordovician to Permian age. Alongside the rugose corals low cushions or branching masses of a different kind of calcite coral are often found. These have much smaller corallites usually only a millimetre or two across, and the septa typical of rugose corals are absent or inconspicuous. These are the tabulate corals (Colour plate 5). Both rugose and tabulate corals are extinct. Devonian corals,Heliophyllum corniculum . These silicified specimens have been weathered out of the rock. They are small, simple corals with a gently curved form. Note the deep cup which was occupied by the polyp (the living coral animal) in life. Corals with this simple form are known from Ordovician to Carboniferous rocks, but there are differences in detailed structure. Heliophyllum has numerous species in the Devonian of Europe and North America. Length of the whole coral is about 3 cm. Corals looking superficially very like the rugose ones are found in Mesozoic and younger rocks, and are important on reefs today (scleractinian corals). Their calcium carbonate skeletons are composed of the mineral aragonite , chemically the same as calcite, but with the atoms arranged in a different way. The septa in these corals are often arranged about a six-fold symmetry so that they are fundamentally different from the Rugosa. Oddly enough, although they are younger than the rugose corals, the aragonite composing them does not preserve very well, and it is easier to find beautifully preserved examples of the older Rugosa. Scleractinian corals are found in small numbers in Triassic rocks, and are abundant in Jurassic, Cretaceous and younger rocks, particularly in past and present tropical regions. Jurassic reef coral,Stylina alveolata This massive coral is now composed of calcite It has been recrystallized, because in life it was composed of the mineral aragonite — chemically the same as calcite, but with a different crystal structure. The matrix is a yellow limestone common in the European Jurassic. Rounded, massive coral composed of individual corallites with about ½ cm diameter. I he septa that line the edges of the corallites are here very short. The little cups occupied by the polyps in life have been exposed by the weathering. There are a number of species related to this one in coral reefs and clumps of Jurassic and later age The specimen is from Nattheim, Germany; related species of Stylina occur in Jurassic limestones in Europe, eastwards into Asia Minor, and in the US. Diameter of the entire colony is about 10 cm. THE GRAPTOLITES — PHYLUM HEMICHORDATA (Colour plates 7, 10) The graptolites are an extinct group of colonial organisms, with a geological record extending from the Cambrian to the Carboniferous. For many years they were regarded as colonial coelenterates, but it is now certain that they are unrelated to the jellyfish and their allies, and in fact are distant cousins to a small group of tube-dwelling organisms with little fossil record, which belong to the minor phylum Hemichordata. Hemichordates are a primitive group that probably share a common ancestor with the chordates (including vertebrates). The graptolites swarmed in the seas of the Ordovician and Silurian periods. They are usually preserved as flattened impressions, which retain little of their finer detail. The impressions generally show a serrated edge like a saw, each ‘tooth’ being the crushed tube (theca ) that housed an individual of the colony (zooid ). The colonies vary widely in shape: some are shrub-like, with numerous slender branches, others have only a few, or even a single branch. The bushy ones (Order Dendroidea-dendroid graptolites) are the more primitive, and were generally rooted to the sea floor. The few-branched forms, which include the Order Graptoloidea or planktonic graptoloids, were derived from the dendroids at the base of the Ordovician and were successful and prolific until the early Devonian. They then disappeared, to be survived by their more primitive bushy relatives. The number of branches and the arrangement of   the thecae are important in their identification. The graptoloids are one of the important groups used in dating rocks. They evolved rapidly and spread widely, and with a little experience a glance at an assemblage of graptolites on a shale surface can be used to determine the approximate age of deposition of the rock. Most of the later graptolites had only a few branches and, in the Silurian, species with only a single branch tend to dominate the assemblages. One advantage of graptolites is that they occur predominantly in former oceanic environments — the deeper water shales or limestones discussed in Chapter 3. Their preservation in inner shelf habitats is much more unusual — although not unknown. Whether the graptolites were not living near shore, or whether the conditions were not right for their preservation, are questions that have excited some argument. Whatever the explanation, other organisms, like trilobites or brachiopods, were more numerous in such sites, and have been used to date the rock sequences in the absence of graptolites. Eight-branched graptolite,Dichograptus octobrachiatus,Ordovician. This graptolite has eight equal branches, each lined with many tiny tubes in which the individual animals of the colony lived, although most of the microscopical details have been destroyed. Dichograptus species are very widespread in the early Ordovician rocks. Some species have very slender branches. This species is found in the eastern United States, Texas, Britain, Canada and Australia. The diameter of the colony is 6cm. Brachiopod (left ) and bivalve mollusc (right ) compared, showing difference in symmetry when viewed sideways, reflecting fundamental internal distinctions BRACHIOPODS — PHYLUM BRACHIOPODA (Colour plates 8, 11, 12) A first collection of marine fossils will almost inevitably include a brachiopod or two. Brachiopods have one of the longest histories and one of the best fossil records of any invertebrate. They are already present in early Cambrian rocks and are still with us today, although living brachiopods tend to be rather inconspicuous in shallow waters. But during the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic they occurred in such profusion in inshore sediments that they are frequently important components of the rocks in which they are found. Brachiopods have two valves, and this gives them a superficial resemblance to bivalved molluscs. The drawing below shows that bivalves and brachiopods really differ in fundamental symmetry, and the differences in the shell reflect even more profound ones in the internal, soft anatomy. Brachiopods have probably always filter-fed, living off small organic particles brought on currents. The particles are harvested by a lophophore covered in cilia — which serves the dual purpose of both creating a current and catching the food. Most brachiopods were attached to the substrate by a stalk, and the hole through which the stalk entered the shell can often be seen on the fossils. This method of food-gathering and the inactive mode of life may seem sufficiently dull for us to anticipate that the brachiopods would have changed little in their long history. It is true that one brachiopod —Lingula — is one of the most famous ‘living fossils’. Lingula -like species, looking much like the living form, can be found in rocks as old as Ordovician. But the other brachiopods have been far from evolutionarily inactive — they have gone through several major proliferations and diversifications, and suffered dramatic major extinctions as well. In the Ordovician and Silurian periods they became adapted to life in most marine environments, but were particularly numerous in shallow water habitats, in some cases forming whole banks, as mussels do today. Although generally small (and hence easily collected) some species grew to 1O cm long or more. Some brachiopods are smooth, but   many became corrugated or ornamented with course or fine ribs. The margins of the valves are often wavy, and deeply folded in other species. Long spines on the exterior of the shell were developed especially during the Carboniferous. Even more profound changes happened in the internal structures of the brachiopods, partly those concerned with supporting the lophophore — these changed from simple loops to complex ‘doubled back’ structures, or to fantastic spirals and whorls — all presumably designed to increase the ways of food-gathering, and its efficiency. Quite complicated tooth-and-socket hinges were developed between the valves. Although the variety of brachiopods in the Jurassic and Cretaceous is somewhat less than in the Palaeozoic, they are still very abundant and varied fossils. It has been suggested that their slow decline in the last I00 million years or so has been caused by the commensurate rise in diversity of filter-feeding bivalve molluscs, which ousted them from their former habitats. It is an attractive idea but one difficult to prove; in any case many of the greatest successes of the bivalves have been in life habits that the brachiopods never adopted burrowing and swimming free for example). Brachiopods fall into two major classes; the more primitive have shells composed of calcium phosphate plus organic material and hinge development is imperfect — hence their name, inarticulate brachiopods. Inarticulates can be recognized on the rock from their shiny lustre. Lingula is one of the best known genera. Inarticulates were numerous in the Cambrian and Ordovician periods. The other class, the hinged brachiopods (Articulata) have shells composed of calcium carbonate, and they comprised more varied and abundant group as fossils. Though their long history from the early Cambrian to the present different groups of articulate brachiopods rose to prominence only to decline. As with other invertebrates the combination of brachiopod types in an assemblage gives a quick clue to the age. Modern studies rely particularly on the internal structures for their identification: some brachiopods with similar exteriors can have very different ‘insides’. But the overall shape of some kinds is distinctive enough for quick recognition — the large spiriferid brachiopod shown on Plate II is unlikely to be confused with any other, and brachiopods of this type are abundant in the Carboniferous limestone. Above all it is the sheer variety and abundance of brachiopods that give shallow water Palaeozoic assemblages of fossils their distinctive ‘feel’. The brachiopod Macrocoelia expansa is a common species on this slab of Ordovician age. These brachiopods are preserved in a distinctive way. The rock surface is covered with both internal and external moulds. No trace of the original shell material remains. The enclosing matrix is a fine-grained sandstone, and the original calcite shell material has dissolved away to leave impressions of the shells on the sandstone. This sort of preservation is very common in European Ordovician and Silurian rocks. The fine radial ribbing is characteristic of many such brachiopods; internal moulds show the impressions of strong hinge teeth (showing as hollows on the rock surface). Species like these are abundant in rocks of Ordovician age, often forming shelly bands. This species is from Near Meifod, Wales, but similar species are very widespread. Precise identifications are difficult, and require expert knowledge. The rock specimen is 20 cm across. Jurassic spiriferid brachiopod,Spiriferina walcotti . This elegant brachiopod is characterized by its broad shell, thrown into folds at its margin. The hinge line is wide. Faint concentric growth lines can also be seen. The species shown here is from the Lias rocks of England and its close relatives may be found worldwide. It does not exceed 3cm in length. Fossil lamp shell,Terebratula maxima , Pilocene of East Anglia, England. The specimen shown has both its original valves preserved, and looks today much as it did when it had just died. This Terebratula is a particularly large brachiopod, as its Latin name ‘maxima ’ implies. One of its valves is larger than the other, and that valve has a circular opening at its apex, through which a fleshy stalk passed which served to attach the animal during life. It lacks the strong ribbing seen on many brachiopods. Species superficially resembling Terebratula maxima may be found all over the world in rocks going back at least to the Jurassic period. Its close relatives, in the Tertiary rocks, are rather rare. Adult shells are 10 cm or more long. SEA MATS — PHYLUM BRYOZOA (Col. plate 13) Bryozoans are an important group of colonial organisms which form encrusting mats on other marine shells or rocks, or branching, leaf-like hummocky colonies on the scale of a few centimetres. Their colonies can often be seen on seaweeds stranded on the shore, where they resemble a fine, white net attached to the darker weed. They are rather common fossils from the Ordovician onwards, and in spite of their small size can be abundant enough to be important as rock-formers (especially in limestones). Bryozoans found as fossils have calcium carbonate (calcite) skeletons that have a high chance of being preserved, and the fossil forms seem to have been exclusively marine (some living bryozoans live in  fresh water). A microscope is essential for their proper study, but even with a hand lens a glance at the surface of a bryozoan colony reveals a number of tiny openings. Each one of these openings, was in life, occupied by an individual of the colony (zooid), a minute animal with tentacles covered in cilia, that entrapped passing microorganisms and edible particles. Larger colonies would have hundreds of individual zooids. In more advanced bryozoans of the Mesozoic to Recent individual zooids have become specialized for particular functions — some have become totally modified to curious, snapping structures looking remarkably like miniaturized parrot heads, which may function to prevent the settling of larvae of unwanted alien organisms on the bryozoan colony. The zooids themselves are, or course, not preserved as fossils — we only have their vacated homes. But from a study of detailed thin sections through the colonies we can deduce a good deal about the growth (astogeny)of colonies of bryozoans long since extinct. Although they were filter-feeders like the graptolites the bryozoans have not taken to free-floating planktonic existence — they are characteristic benthic organisms. They are divided into a number of groups on the basis of details of structure of the individual ‘boxes’ that housed the zooids, and the construction of the colony. It is always worth examining the surfaces of fossils like brachiopods or sea urchins to see if the fine matted or delicately branching colonies of bryozoa are preserved on their surfaces — they are easily overlooked. Other bryozoan colonies are more immediately conspicuous, particularly the stout, twig-like branches of the Palaeozoic trepostomes, which can make up thick limestone beds, and formed their own ‘reefs’, or the large, often net-like colonies of the ‘fenestrellids’ common in the Upper Palaeozoic. A relative of the latter, the curious, screw-like Archimedes is shown on p.65. Bryozoans are quite commonly preserved as internal moulds — the calcite skeleton is dissolved away leaving only the sediment fillings of the chambers once occupied by the zooids. In this case they can present a different appearance, a host of little tubes combining together into branching twigs or nets. Such preservation is usual in sandy or silty rocks. The variety of colony structure in the bryozoan exceeds that even in the corals, and ranges from compact humps to cobweb-like branching colonies of exceptional delicacy, and their small size in no way detracts from the beauty and variety of form they display. MOLLUSCS — PHYLUM MOLLUSCA The molluscs are one of the most varied, successful and numerous of the invertebrate phyla. Thousands of living species occupy every marine habitat from the shallowest to the deepest abyss, and, as every gardener knows who has tried to protect his vegetables against marauding hordes of snails and slugs, they have been remarkably successful in making the transition from sea to land. the most primitive molluscs lack a shell, but the most diverse groups, and those that concern us here, have well-developed hard parts that are readily fossilized. Molluscs have the lower part of the body developed as a muscular foot , which may variously function locomotion, digging or swimming. The molluscs were ultimately derived from a soft-bodied creature somewhat like the living flatworms, but the acquisition of hard parts happened very early on, low in the Cambrian of before, and by the Ordovician the important living classes were well established. A few molluscs, like the slugs and octopuses, have secondarily lost their shells, having developed other means of protection. As with the other phyla, the great span of geological time has seen different groups rise to prominence, decline, to be replaced by others. But unlike the brachiopods the molluscs are probably as diverse today as they have ever been. Measured by their total living weight (biomass) molluscs are one of the most important groups in the whole marine biosphere: the swarms of squid in the oceans are the match of any species of fish. The level of organization achieved by the most advanced molluscs, for example the octopus, is the most intricate and sophisticated of any invertebrate: one cannot over-estimate the importance of the Mollusca in shaping the patterns of marine communities we see today. Different molluscs fill most of the possible ecological roles available to marine organisms: some are voracious hunters, others graze on algae or feed directly on organic material in muddy sediments, others again are filter-feeders. The great majority of molluscs have a minute, planktonic larval stage, a small ciliated object bearing no resemblance to the adult, that drifts as part of the plankton until ready to settle and assume its mature form. Thus even bottom-dwelling molluscs can be dispersed widely   over long distances, and are quick to colonize vacant sites that appear in the ocean (new volcanic islands like Surtsey, for example). Most molluscs are small, a few centimetres long and some are really tiny, but a few species have attained considerable dimensions. The most famous (or notorious) is the giant squid at 15 m or more in length, but some of the extinct ammonites and nautiloids were of similar dimension, and were the largest shelled animals ever to have lived. Fossil glass sponge,Hydnoceras tuberosum from the Devonian of New York.This exceptionally large beautiful sponge is preserved in full relief in a fine sandstone. Hydnoceras is a Devonian and Carboniferous genus, but glass sponges of similar general form (but without knobs have a History going back to the Cambrian, and surviving species today. A large species with length of 20 cm. The giant foraminiferan Nummulites gizehensis (nummulites) from the Eocene of Egypt. Numerous species of this species are preserved together, actually forming the rock — an example of fossils as rock builders. The small, lentil-shaped fossils are a separate form of the same species. The ‘coins’ are up to 4 cm across. 3 The hexactinellid sponge Coeloptychium agaricoides from the Cretaceous of Westphalia, Germany. These two specimens are beautifully preserved, extracted from a matrix of white chalk, which gives them their colour. Species of Coeloptychium can be found in England and elsewhere in Europe. The ‘cap’ of this specimen is 8 cm across. 4 The solitary rugose coral Cyathophyllum sp., Devonian of Devon, England. Sections have been cut through well-preserved coral in limestone. The gaps between the walls of the coral skeleton have been filled with calcite, showing up as the lighter colours of the sections. The longer diameter of the section is 6 cm. Corals are often best sectioned like this one to reveal the internal structures. 5 The tabulate coral Halysites escharoides (chain coral) form The Silurian of Ohio Falls, USA. This massive coral has weathered out of limestone because the material of the coral is slightly harder than the enclosing matrix. Large numbers of tiny oval corallites are linked together to form chains. Specimen 10 cm across, part of a larger colony. 6 Fossil brain coral,Coeloria labyrinthiformis (Scleractinia). Miocene, Antigua. Polished section. Long meandering corallites with thin septa form a dense meshwork to give this coral an appearance like the labyrinth implied in the specific name. Specimen 8 cm across. 7 Dendroid graptolite. Dictyonema flabelliforme , Ordovician, North Wales (European geologists often regard rocks with Dictyonema as latest Cambrian). The large colony of this net graptolite is preserved in a light-coloured shale. Of the many species of Dictyonema only a few have a colony as regular in shape as this one, which can grow to a length of more than 20 cm. 8 Lingulid brachiopod,Lingula beani , Jurassic, Yorkshire, England. These tongue-shaped brachiopods are composed of calcium phosphate, with a shiny lustre, contrasting with the clay matrix. 9 Pliocence coral,Septastraea forbesi Maryland, USA. A massive coral with irregular knobs, composed of corallites with a diameter less than ½ cm, with polygonal outlines, and with about twelve prominent septa like the spokes of a wheel. The specimen is 10 cm long, and is a fragment of a much larger colony. 10 Tuning-fork graptolite Didymograptus murchisoni , Ordovician, Wales. Several of these graptolites are preserved on the flat bedding surfaces of a black shale. The Graptolites are flattened, and their original skeletal material has been destroyed. Didymograptus species of this type have a distinctive shape like a tuning fork. Individual specimens grow to a length of 5cm or more. 11 Brachiopod,Spirifer striatus , Carboniferous, Kildare, Ireland. This barachiopod had a wide hinge line, and the apertural margin is deflected downwards to form a broad ‘v’. The radial ribs are more numerous than those of the related brachiopod Spiriferina p. 63. These specimens are 5 cm across. 12 The rhynchonellid brachiopod Cyclothyris difformis , from the Cretaceous of Devon, England. Wide, ribbed shells with a small beak projecting from the upper valve, the lower valve is deeply convex. Cyclothyris is found in both Europe and North America. These specimens are 3–3½cm long. 13 Net bryozoan,Fenestrellina plebeia , Carboniferous of North Wales. These net-like bryozoa form colonies large enough to be conspicuous fossils. This is particularly the case when as here, they are preserved in dark shales, the white calcite of the animal's skeleton standing out against the background. Fenestrellina species are widespread in Carboniferous rocks, and colonies are generally 5–6 cm across, but may be 10 cm or more. 14 Trigoniid bivalve,Scabrotrigonia thoracica , Cretaceous, Tennessee. A single valve of this species is exceptionally well-preserved showing the finest details of the shell structure. The radial ribs ‘chopped up’ into little knobs are characteristic of the trigoniid bivalves. The shell is very robust, and inside there are very few, powerful hinge teeth. The longest diameter of this specimen is 5½ cm. 15 Carboniferous bivalve,Aviculopecten planoradiatus , Derbyshire, England. For a fossil of this age the preservation is remarkable, because the original colour banding is preserved, showing as broad, V-shaped patterns. The single valves are preserved in a fine-grained limestone. Pectinid shells have grooves widening towards the margin, and, at the apex, flattened ‘ears’. Length, 3 cm. 16 The gastropod Desmoulia conglobata , from the Pliocene of Italy. As befits its relatively young geological age, the specimen is preserved with its original shell material. It has been sliced longways to show the internal structure. Note the columella,which is twisted like a corkscrew. Length, 4 cm. 17 Jurassic nautiloid,Cenoceras pseudolineatus , Dorset, England. Specimen largely preserved as an internal mould. A section cut and polished through the specimen (on the right) shows the internal chambers filled or partly filled with calcite. The internal mould shows the gently-curving suture lines. The specimen has a diameter of 7 cm. Peculiar, screw-like bryozoan,archimedes sublaxus , Carboniferous. The calcareous skeletons of this distinctive species have weathered out from the limestone matrix. Whilst most bryozoa require microscopic examination, a few form colonies large and distinctive enough to be easily recognizable. This is one such form, with its colonies forming peculiar miniature helter-skelters. The genus is named after the famous Greek philosopher, and inventor of the ‘Archimedes screw’. Numerous Archimedes species occur worldwide in rocks of Carboniferous and Permian age. The colonies grow to a length of 5 cm. Larger species have been described. Because the molluscs are such a large and varied group, with such an extensive fossil record, we shall consider them below in their various classes. Accurate identification of molluscs is a skilled business, and there is a vast literature describing fossil species, but it is easy to recognize the most important types preserved in fossils. The fossil record, particularly in the Cambrian, is still turning new and fascinating kinds of molluscs, some of them really weird, and a few of these will be touched upon after the most  important and familiar groups have been described. Tellin bivalve,Tellinella rostralis . Eocene. The original shell is here preserved in a sandstone. In life the tellin would have had two valves, but only one is preserved here. The species has an elongated form, which is extended at one end into a shovel-like tongue; fine concentric ribs are nearly parallel to its margin. Species somewhat resembling that shown are numerous in the Tertiary marine formations, and similar species live today in sandy sea bottoms. This species is from the Eocene of Belgium; related species are very widespread. The specimen is about 3 cm long, but may grow larger THE CLAMS — CLASS BIVALVIA (Colour plates 14, 15) In clams the body is enclosed in a pair of valves, which in most species are mirror images of one another. The valves are composed of calcium carbonate, are quite strong in most species, and hence easily fossilized. Between the valves a springy ligament keeps the valves in a gaping attitudes — the position used for feeding. If danger threatens powerful muscles can snap the valves tightly shut, and once a bivalve has closed itself in this way it can be very difficult to force it open — it has ‘clammed’ up. the strong muscles leave scars on the interior of the shell at the places to which they were attached (usually two in each valve), and these muscle scars may also be seen on fossil shells. To make the the hinge strong and efficient there are usually complex arrangements of teeth and sockets there, and the arrangement of these articulating devices is very important in identifying the different kinds of clams. So it is important to find the internal structures in fossil bivalves, as in the brachiopods. The clams use their foot for digging and movement generally. The group has adapted to a range of marine and fresh water habitats where they are often filter-feeders. Their fossils often occur gregariously as they lived, forming beds largely composed of fossil shells. Many living species burrow into sand or mud, sometimes to a considerable depth — these species maintain contact with the sea by means of long siphons , tubes that permit the passage in and out of water and bring to the animal both the necessary oxygen and the small organic particles on which it feeds. Other species are attached to rocks by means of tough threads (byssus ) that enable them to hang on even in turbulent situations; mussels can colonize even the most inhospitable rock surfaces in this way. A few bivalves have become free-swimming — such pectinids can escape predators rapidly by ‘clapping’ their valves together. Still others have taken to burrowing into wood or even into limestone, and fossils of these curious animals can be found lying in their home-made burrows (see p. 21). With such a wide range of adaptations it is not surprising to find that the shapes of bivalves are highly varied — some are globular, others flat and plate-like, some like razor shell (Ensis ) have become greatly elongated to avoid burrowing, and some in forms of the usual ‘mirror image’ symmetry has been lost. The thicker shelled  species often carry a distinctive sculpture, which is also important in identifying fossil species. Fossil gastropod Poleumita discors,Silurian. The shell is preserved in calcite, with a limestone infilling. The topmost whorls of the shell are broken off. this is a very ancient snail with a flat nearly disc like form, with fine growth lines and occasional courser knobs. The outer perimeter carries a raised ridge. Gastropods of this kind are typical of Ordovician and Silurian strata, where there are a number of genera and many species of comparable form. This species is from the Wenlock Limestone of Dudley, England. Similar species can be found in Silurian limestones all over Europe and North America. The specimen has a diameter of 6 cm. Gastropods of this antiquity preserved in limestone can be difficult to clean. In this case the shell material is a little more resistant than the enclosing limestone, and the specimen has been weathered out of the rock in good condition. Most bivalve fossils are a few centimetres long; the ideal size for collecting. But a few giants are known. The Cretaceous genus Inoceramus sometimes grew well over a metre in length; fragments of this particular genus are frequently important components of the soft, white Cretaceous limestone known as chalk. The giant clam (Tridacna ) of modern reefs is a familiar living goliath, but reports of it greedily trapping divers are legends of dubious veracity. The bivalves have long geological history, with a few doubtful species known even in Cambrian strata, but like many other molluscan groups they really become established and diverse during the Ordovician. By the end of the Ordovician they had already radiated into many of the niches they occupy today. Their story from then on is one of slow, but steady, increase and diversification. Bivalves seem generally to have evolved at a slow canter rather than a brisk gallop (see ammonites pp. 73–6) and some living bivalves have a very long ancestry; the small sized genus (Nucula ) has relatives in Ordovician rocks not very different from Recent species. But the ancestors of many of the modern bivalves arose during the Mesozoic, and unlike many of the animals in this book the bivalves were affected in a much lees dramatic way by the Mesozoic-Tertiary extinction events that extirpated so many other major elements in the marine fauna. In spite of their general conservatism the bivalves did produce some short-lived, bizarre forms with no living survivors. Most extraordinary of these are the Cretaceous rudists (p. 47) a group in which one valve became modified to a long cone, on which the other valve rested like a lid, the whole effect being most un-clammish. Some clams have shells composed of the form of calcium carbonate known as aragonite (like scleractinian corals) which is easily dissolved away when they are entombed in sediment: this leaves the clam preserved as an impression on the sediment of its internal and external surfaces (internal and external moulds). It is important to collect both ‘halves’ of the fossil to get an accurate representation of the shell — the external mould will preserve the overall shape and sculptural details, while the internal mould shows what the teeth and muscle scars were like. The reader may be confused to find what we here call bivalves, referred to in other books as pelecypods or lamellibranchs — these are just different names for the same animals. The name accepted by most scientists today for the two-shelled class of molluscs is also fortunately the simplest — Bivalvia. THE SNAILS — CLASS GASTROPODA (Colour plates 16, 18) ‘Slugs and snails and puppy dogs' tails’— there seems to be something in the popular imagination that finds snails slightly repulsive. But this class of molluscs includes not only the greatest number of living molluscan species, including those that have most successfully colonized land, but also some of their shells have a financial value that may even be out of proportion to their aesthetic qualities. The gastropods are molluscs with a single, usually helically-coiled shell, with the foot modified into an efficient creeping organ with a head usually with eyes and tentacles, and with a rasp like feeding organ (radula ) composed of a series of pointed teeth. The gastropods have become adapted to a very wide range of habitats, from high mountain streams to deep oceans, and each habitat type has its own species confined to it. Fresh water gastropods are different from  marine ones, and within the marine habitat itself the gastropods are strongly zoned ecologically, so that even on the same shore different species will be found in different areas according to their relation to the tide marks, degree of exposure, their diet, and so on. Usually such fine habitat details are not preserved in the fossil record, and the gastropods we find are a jumble of shells displaced from their original microhabitats. Many gastropods are grazers: they use their radula to rasp away at algae. Some feed more or less directly on sediment, from which they extract edible particles. There are a large number of living species that are predators, some species using the modified radula as a kind of poison dart, others employing it to bore neat, perfectly round holes through the shells of prey (often bivalves) in order to get at the nutritious interior. Some of these predators are specialists concentrating on one particular prey   type. It will now be clear why you can sometimes find so many different fossil gastropod shells together in a single fossil deposit. Fossil limpet gastropod,Symmetrocapulus tessonii , Jurassic. The species is preserved with its original shell, its interior being filled with limestone. The fossil shows well the original concentric growth wrinkles. Fossil limpets of this kind are generally rare as fossils, and the amateur will be lucky to find one. This specimen is very rare indeed. It is from the Jurassic limestone of Les Moutiers en Cinglais, France. It is 11 cm long — large for a limpet-like mollusc. Fossil sundial shell,Architectonica millegranosa Pliocene. The well preserved shells of this gastropod have been washed almost free of their enclosing silty matrix. The low spire of this species, with a minutely beaded ornament, and the sharp rib around its outside edge, are features that discriminate this species from other gastropods. This species is one of a fairly large genus that survives today. They are uncommon in the tropical or subtropical molluscan faunas of the Tertiary. Species resembling this one in general shape are met with in rocks of Cretaceous and younger age. This species is from Orciano, Italy. Diameter about 3cm. Gastropod,Harpagodes wrightii , Jurassic. This large gastropod is preserved in an oolitic limestone. The long, stout spines are an unusual feature which discriminates this species from other gastropods. Note that the surface of this species bears encrusting oysters of a species that took advantage of the hard surface of the dead gastropod. This species is a real rarity. It was discovered in the Great Oolite limestones of Gloucestershire, England. A few related species occur in the Jurassic. The longest diameter of the specimen is nearly 15 cm. Cleaning out gastropods from oolitic limestones can be a lengthy business. Usually the weathering has done part of the job, but thereafter a combination of small chisels and stout needles (to prise away individual grains) is needed. Always remember to keep clear of the soft calcite shell with these tools. Typhis pungens , a fossil gastropod, Eocene. These specimens are well-preserved in a clay matrix, some of which adheres to one of the specimens. Such spiny little fossils are unlikely to be confused with other gastropods. Note also the oval aperture surrounded by a narrow rim. There are a number of Typhis species, with various numbers and arrangements of the spines. Fossil Typhis are frequent fossils in the Eocene rocks of Europe. Typhis still lives today — in the seas around Japan, for example. The series of fossils shown here demonstrate the different sizes gastropods of one species attain. The largest here is 3 cm long. The gastropod shell can vary from a millimetre in length to several tens of centimetres; many are thick and robust, others delicate and fragile. While the majority are coiled in an upward spiral, some are modified into simple, cap-like forms (like the limpets), and others are coiled in a flat plane, like a ram's horn. Some genera have high spires, with many turns of the shell visible externally, others have low, broad spires in which the last whorl overlaps the earlier ones. Perhaps more than any other group of molluscs the gastropods are remarkable for  the variety and beauty of the external sculpture on the shell, which may be covered with a delicate tracery of ribs and lines, or stout spines, or fine prickles. Many species have the aperture flared, or extended into a long tube (siphonate forms). Sometimes you can find a lid (operculum ) preserved as a fossil, that closed the aperture when the mollusc withdrew into its shell. All these characters are used in the identification of fossil species, but of course the colour patterns that may be characteristic of living species are not available in the great majority of fossils. Like some of the bivalves, some gastropods had shells composed of the mineral aragonite, and these are usually preserved as moulds: but a cast taken from the external mould will replicate the fine detail of the external sculpture. Right The Pliocene gastropod Busycon contrarium . As with most fossils of this comparatively recent date, the shell looks now much as it would have done when the animal first died, except for the loss of pigment. This gastropod is unusual in that its aperture lies on its left-hand side, not on the right as in most other species. Its specific name ‘contrarium ’ indicates this. Its low spire and long, projecting apertural extension are also characteristic. Forms related to this species are quite widespread in the Pliocene. The specimen is from Florida, USA. The species still lives in the seas off Florida today The specimen is 6 cm long — but like all gastropods, smaller or larger specimens can be found according to growth. Far right The Eocene gastropod Athleta spinosa . These exquisitely preserved gastropods are largely free of the enclosing matrix, and look now much as they would have done 60 million years ago. Gastropods of this type are characterized by strong ribs produced into spines, a long aperture, and relatively low spire looking rather like a Mayan pyramid. There are many similar species, widespread in Tertiary times. These specimens are from the Eocene of Grignon, France, but similar species occur on most continents The specimens illustrated range from 2–4 cm long, according to the stage of growth they have reached. Many species of Athleta occur in clays, and the matrix can usually be removed with only gentle washing to give fine, clean specimens. The species shown here is in a crumbly limestone, easily removed with gentle brushing. There are small helically-coiled shells present even in Cambrian rocks, and it seems likely that the gastropods diverged from the other molluscs late in the Precambrian. By the Ordovician the gastropods were a varied group present in a variety of shallow water habitats. As might be expected most of the Palaeozoic gastropods belong to primitive groups: a few of these primitive snails survive today as inconspicuous members of the Recent fauna. By the Carboniferous many of the shapes we see in living gastropods can be matched in the fossils, but despite these similarities the majority of the Palaeozoic forms were not closely related to their living analogues; this is another example of similar-looking forms evolving independently probably in response to similar life habits. It was during the Mesozoic that the forms ancestral to many of the living gastropods evolved. In particular the adoption of predatory habits was a new departure for the gastropods, and was in part responsible for a proliferation of the group unmatched in their Palaeozoic history. They continued to evolve with undiminished vigour through the Tertiary, and their fossil remains are nowhere more abundant than in the ‘crags’ of later Tertiary age. The gastropods are one of many groups that record the faunal changes connected with the advance and retreat of the Ice Sheets during the Pleistocene. The invasion of the non-marine habitat probably first happened in the Carboniferous, but relatives of the living land snails are rare before the Cretaceous, at which time the familiar Helix made its first appearance. The slugs were derived from this group by reduction of the shell, at which stage they become distinctly less qualified to have a fossil record! Gastropods can leave other evidence of their activities. Grazing species leave characteristic winding trails, and these have been  tentatively identified as fossils, but with the usual caution that the trail makers themselves are never apparently preserved at the end of their tracks. NAUTILOIDS, AMMONOIDS, BELEMNOIDS, SQUIDS — CLASS CEPHALOPODA (Colour plates 17, 19, 20, 21) The cephalopods include the most complex and ‘advanced’ of the molluscs, and are a group of the greatest geological, as well as biological interest. They have muscular tentacles in a well-developed head region, highly efficient eyes which are similar in construction to those of vertebrates (although obviously independently derived), and they feed with the aid of strong, beak-like jaws. They are predators, and probably always have been, and it may have been the adoption of hunting habits that favoured the development of high intelligence. Certainly, living cephalopods have a sophisticated nervous system and a relatively large ‘brain': octopuses seem to be capable of very rapid learning. Perhaps H. G. Wells made the right choice when he cast octopus-like animals in the role of intelligent alien invaders in The War of the Worlds . The cephalopods evolved from another (gastropod-like?) mollusc at some time during the Cambrian, but their earliest history is little known. Like most other molluscan groups they rapidly diversified in the Ordovician. These early nautiloids were probably predators also, and if this were so they may have been the first rapidly moving, efficient hunters in the sea. Their impact on the marine communities of the Ordovician must have been profound. The presence of efficient predators would have acted as a stimulus in the evolution of other groups: even algal grazers would be compelled to evolve protective devices or rapid reproductive strategies to outpace predatory depredations. We have seen how many animal groups diversified during the Ordovician; the rapid evolution of nautiloid cephalopods at the same time may be more than coincidence. Rapid movement in cephalopods is achieved by expulsion of water from a muscular funnel beneath the head. Most of the living cephalopods also have an ink sac which injects a smoky fluid into the water when the animal is threatened, under cover of which they can make their own jet-propelled escape. Since living Nautilus does not have an ink sac, this must have been a protective device evolved at a later stage in cephalopod evolution. Many cephalopod species behave gregariously today, travelling in swarms in pursuit of their favourite prey (often small crustacea). Fossil cephalopods belonging to one species are often  found together in large numbers and this may reflect similar gregarious habits, but there are other possible explanations — for example, concentrations of fossil shells may have been sorted by currents. The living pearly Nautilus ; section showing its internal division into chambers NAUTILOIDS The earliest cephalopods found as fossils are nautiloids and they also have the longest history, because the living pearly Nautilus belongs to the same group. The single Recent genus scarcely reflects the diversity attained by the group in Palaeozoic seas, and more than a hundred different genera have been described from the Lower Palaeozoic alone. Sections through the living Nautilus (see p.72) are often sold as ornaments, and well illustrate the distinctive features of nautiloid hard parts. The body of the animal occupied the cavity at the end of the spiral — the living chamber. Behind the living chamber the rest of the shell is divided into smaller chambers. As the animal grew it secreted a wall (septum ) between the body chamber and the chamber immediately behind — walled off part of its home as it were. Running along the middle part of the shell there is a narrow tube — the siphuncle — which connects the living chamber with the earlier parts of the shell. The empty chambers are usually supposed to have been filled with gas, which help to give the animal buoyancy , and via the siphuncle the animal can vary its buoyancy to control its position in the water column. Some of the early nautiloids deposit calcium carbonate in the voided chambers, which may also have been connected with controlling buoyancy. Where the septum meets the body wall it does so in a smooth curve. Internal moulds of fossil nautiloids often reveal a series of such lines marking the boundaries of the chambers — these are known as suture lines . All nautiloids have simple suture lines. When they first appear in the early Ordovician the majority of nautiloid shells are straight or slightly curved; they are ‘unwound’ forms. Some of these straight orthocone nautiloids achieve considerable dimensions, several metres long, and they must have been formidable predators on the other marine animals of the time. Quite early in their history some partly coiled or even tightly coiled species evolved, and the various coiling types seem to have coexisted successfully side by side. Some of these early nautiloids occurred in such abundance that they are conspicuous enough to form an appreciable part of limestone formations — the ‘Orthoceras Limestone’(Ordovician) is one of these, widely distributed through Scandinavia. The nautiloids achieved their widest range of adaptations and greatest variety of form in the Ordovician and Silurian periods, with various coiled forms, straight, pipe-like forms, and curious dumpy species with restricted apertures that may have adopted a sluggish (possible filter-feeding) mode of life. Thin sections show a great variety of internal structures important in accurate identification. In the Devonian period the nautiloids were still abundant and varied, but they suffered a slow eclipse coincident with the rise of the ammonoids. Nonetheless unlike many of their Palaeozoic companions, they survived the late Permian extinction, and the ancestors of the living Nautilus even underwent a minor evolutionary burst in the Mesozoic, where forms quite similar to the pearly Nautilus can be common fossils. And in the end the nautiloids even survived the ammonites, the molluscan group that evolved more rapidly and more spectacularly than any other. AMMONOIDS (‘AMMONITES’) The ammonoids were derived from the nautiloids probably during the early Devonian, and from the Carboniferous until the Cretaceous are among the most abundant of fossil groups, in some rock types dominating to the exclusion of most other members of the fauna. Ammonoids differ from nautiloids in the suture lines being wavy or crimped; this of course reflects an elaboration of the outer part of the walls (septa) separating the chambers in the earlier part of the shell. The siphuncle in most ammonoids runs not through the middle of the whorl but along the outer edge. There has been a lot of debate about the reasons for producing complicated patterns on the suture line; what advantage would this have given the ammonoids over their nautiloid ancestors, that allowed for the explosive bursts of ammonoid evolution? It cannot be coincidence that the folding of the septal walls occurs at the point where they meet the body shell of the animal; this is a point of relative weakness, and all good joinery benefits from strengthening the joint. The earlier ammonoids had gently wavy sutures, and many of the Mesozoic ones had sutures almost incredibly folded and contorted, so it looks as if natural selection were generally favouring increase in the elaboration of the folds. One simple explanation, which is attractive  and plausible, is that the strengthening enabled the ammonoid shell to withstand the hydrostatic pressure at relatively great depths in the ocean — they need not be confined to the surface waters or to relatively shallow depths. Certainly individual ammonoid species became extremely widespread, and oceans were not a barrier to their distribution. They became masters of the pelagic realm, possibly swimming in schools like their distant relatives the squids. Like living pelagic animals they had preferences for particular water temperatures; different types of ammonoids were found in high or low latitudes. Since the disposition of continents has changed, these ‘faunal realms’ offer a method of deducing the distribution of past climatic belts. Ceratite ammonoid,Ceratites nodosus , Triassic. This specimen is an internal mould in limestone, and shows the suture lines well — the boundaries between chambers on the inside of the shell. This ammonite has only a few strong ribs, with a number of small tubercles in addition. The looping form of the suture lines is also characteristic Ceratites are typical of Triassic rocks and there are numerous related species differing in details of ribbing and suture lines Such ammonites are plentiful in marine limestones of the right age across the continent of Europe (though not in England). Related forms occur in America The specimen shown here is from Göttingen. This specimen has a diameter of 6 cm but some are larger. Jurassic ammonite,Promicroceras planicosta . Numerous small specimens are preserved higgledy-piggledy in an impure limestone. Some retain their shell, others show the dark internal moulds. Small size, unbranched and strong ribs, giving the shell a ramshorn appearance, are important characters This form has a number of related species, but the situation is complicated by the fact that some large ammonites have inner whorls looking rather like Promicroceras This specimen is from the Lias of Somerset, England. Individuals do not exceed 2 cm in diameter. Whatever the reasons for their change from their nautiloid ancestors, the ammonoids were an enormously successful group: thousands of different species have been described, and their variety is so bewildering that many specialists devote their lives to studying only the ammonoids of a particular, short time period. The changes that they underwent are an infinite set of variations on a relatively limited number of themes. Most important, perhaps, are the characteristics of the suture lines, which are displayed on internal moulds. The mature shell size also varies from small species a few centimetres across to giants of a metre or more in diameter. Some species grew in such a way that the last whorl overlaps the inner ones; often these species become flat and discus-shaped: it has been suggested that this was a more ‘streamlined’ shape for active swimmers. Other species have squat whorls, the whole ammonoid being so tightly rolled up as to be almost spherical. The exterior surface of most ammonoids is covered with ribbing — dense on some species, sparse on others — the ribs often split into two or more smaller ribs as they pass over the back of the whorls. Many ammonoids additionally carry spines, warts, tubercles or lumpy excrescences, so that the large shells can look positively burdened with sculpture. It is difficult to imagine that such species were rapid swimmers. Others, particularly the discus-shaped forms, were smooth externally. All these features are used in the classification of the group. A particularly puzzling aspect of the ammonoids is a great resemblance between external shell features that can be produced at different times by otherwise unrelated ammonoids. Such homoeomorphs are presumably produced in response to very similar life habits. The origins of a particular homoeomorph can usually be deduced by studying the internal features (in particular the suture lines), or by tracing its derivation from geologically older species in underlying beds. It is only in relatively recent years that two sexes have been recognized in ammonoid species. They were originally thought to have been two closely related species occurring together in the same rocks, but these ‘pairs’ were so consistently found together that it became more and more probable that they were sexual forms of the same species. The smaller of the two is considered to be the male, which also tends to have rather stronger ribbing, and sometimes a differently shaped aperture from the larger female. A group of belemnites,Acroceolites subtenuis , Jurassic. This fine group of belemnites is preserved on a soft shale. The belemnite guards themselves are composed of calcite There are very many belemnite species in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks, sometimes occurring in vast numbers. They require expert determination. The specimen shown here is from the Jurassic shales of Yorkshire, England, but similar species occur worldwide. The longest specimen shown here is 9 cm long. Some belemnites are as much as twice that length. Anomalous ammonites: the Cretaceous genus Nipponites. About × 1½. The early ammonoids of the Devonian (Anarcestes and allied genera) have only gently sinuous suture lines. In the Carboniferous a great variety of forms with highly zig-zag suture lines are a distinctive group of ammonoids usually known as goniatites . By the Permian-Triassic the suture lines of many ammonites had begun to assume the highly crimped and complex form that was to characterize much of their later history; the ceratites of the Triassic combined broad loops and tight folds in a distinctive pattern (see p.74). It was in the Jurassic that the ammonoids achieved their greatest flowering, when the clays and shales of the period may be solid with the remains of their shells. The whole gamut of shell shapes, ornaments, and sutural complexity was present during this time. Their rise was not, however, one of simple and progressive increase in variety. At several times, notably at the end of the Palaeozoic, they suffered massive and largely unexplained extinctions, a few survivors giving rise to the variety of forms that followed. In spite of their success they seemed to be vulnerable to extirpation in a way that some of the less imaginative molluscs, like the bivalves seemed to be immune. The group persisted, successfully, into the Cretaceous, at the end of which period the whole group, apparently rather suddenly, became extinct. We shall return to this sudden death of an important group in Chapter 6. No description of the ammonoids is complete without mentioning the heteromorphs These are forms which abandoned the usual plane spiral mode of coiling, and instead became partially or even completely uncoiled, or became twisted in some other fashion. Some forms (Turrilites ) adopted the helical spire, and were it not for the obligatory suture lines it might be possible to mistake these species for large gastropods. In others the coils became loose, like a watch spring. Still others developed a bizarre backward hook in their mature stage. The extreme heteromorphs are perhaps to be found in the genus Nipponites , which looks like a tangle of whorls where any obvious semblance of symmetrical coiling seems to have been lost (see left), and Baculites which is virtually straight after its earliest whorls. Most of these heteromorphs were derived from ‘normal’ ammonoids, but there is one  famous example where an uncoiled form actually gave rise to a conventional-looking ammonoid by coiling up again! Heteromorphs are particularly common in, but by no means confined to, Cretaceous rocks. At one time it was supposed that the ammonoids were suffering from ‘racial senescence’ at that time and that the uncoiling represented a kind of genetic exhaustion. This resulted in their reversion to resemble some of their earliest ancestors (the straight nautiloids) and squared with the observation that some of the heteromorphs even reverted to simple, wavy sutures again. However, the heteromorphs were extremely successful and widespread, and they are accompanied by, and even survived by other species with a perfectly usual appearance. The explanation lies in something less mysterious than ‘racial senescence’. Far from being an expression of decline the heteromorphs show the ammonoids adopting new (and successful) life habits. Some of them may have become bottom living, crawling hunters for which a gastropod-like shell would have been more appropriate. Loss of active swimming habits may have rendered the complex suture lines superfluous. But their displacement from a dominant role in the pelagic habitat may have accompanied the rise of squid, sepioids, and octopods. Ammonoids, heteromorphs included, are almost without parallel as stratigraphic indicators. They evolved rapidly and spread widely, and have a range of distinctive characters to help the investigator in his identifications. Study of evolving populations of ammonoids has produced very fine subdivisions of Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks, and their only disadvantage, curiously enough, is the feature that makes them so attractive to collectors. They are large, and hence the chances of recovering complete specimens from all boreholes is relatively low. Microfossils (Chapter 8) are often used in their stead for subsurface work. BELEMNOIDS The cigar-shaped belemnoids ('belemnites') are common fossils accompanying the ammonoids in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. The fossil is an internal skeleton (enclosed within the body) of a squid-like animal, in a way comparable with the cuttle bone of the living cuttle-fish. The solid calcite of this internal skeleton makes the belemnoid a resistant fossil, and fragments are common survivors of erosion, often picked up on ‘Recent’ beaches. The chambered shell (phragmocone ) is less conspicuous — it is tucked into the broad end of the fossil guard, where the series of closely-spaced septa reveal the cephalopod nature of these otherwise somewhat featureless fossils. Belemnites vary from small fossils a centimetre or two long to large specimens tens of centimetres long: of course these are only a fraction of the size of the living animal, with their tentacles extending well beyond the guard. The belemnoids disappear from the fossil record at the end of the Cretaceous, but some of the group gave rise to living squid-like animals, and so they are not to be regarded as extinct in the same, final way as the ammonoids. OTHER MOLLUSCAN CLASSES Some molluscs are found as fossils which belong to groups other than the familiar ones described previously. Although they are rarer fossils, some of them are of such interest that they are worth mentioning here. One of the most exciting are the Monoplacophora. These are a group of extremely primitive molluscs, which are found in any abundance only in Lower Palaeozoic rocks. They are usually simple cap-shaped shells looking somewhat like limpets, but on their internal surfaces they carry a series of paired muscle impressions. Many authorities regard the Monoplacophora as lying at the root of the other molluscan groups; gastropods, cephalopods and even bivalves may have been derived from them. For many years they were known only from fossil representatives and were believed to be extinct. It was an amazing discovery to find that monoplacophorans were still alive and well — living ones were dredged from the deep ocean in the early 1950's. Not only that, the living form had hardly changed from its Silurian predecessor (see p. 77). The monoplacophorans really reached their acme in the Cambrian, with curious forms having shapes that have never been paralleled in other molluscs (Yochelcionella ). Another odd group that did not survive the Palaeozoic were the Rostroconchs. These look rather like bivalves without a hinge. They really are extinct, but managed to compete successfully with the bivalves for a considerable time. Finally, the tusk shells (Scaphopoda) are a long-lived group with a record stretching from the Ordovician to the present. They are the only molluscs with a truly tubular shell, usually gently curved, with an opening  at both ends. They live today with the broad end buried in the sediment, where they forage for food using small prehensile filaments. Their habits have probably always been similar, and if survival is to be taken as a measure of success, their conservative way of life has ensured them of a leading place in the evolutionary marathon. Other animals described in this book have occupied a specific ecological niche where they can quietly pursue their own speciality without embarking on any spectacular radiation in the manner of the ammonoids. It is a curious paradox that often the most spectacularly successful and numerous organisms are also those with a finite geological record. Primitive molluscs: Monoplacophora. Silurian fossils very like the ‘living fossil’Neopilina (above ), and the peculiar Cambrian form Yochelcionella (below ). THE ECHINODERMS — PHYLUM ECHINODERMATA Sea urchins, starfish, sea lilies and sea cucumbers are living echinoderms — the ‘spiny skinned’ animals, according to the Greek name of the phylum. It is an appropriate name, for most echinoderms do feel prickly to the touch, and the sea urchins are equipped with fearsome spines. The skeleton of all echinoderms except the sea cucumbers is a relatively strong assembly of calcite plates; the animals are built from an interlocking mosaic of such plates, and mostly the skeletons are rigid enough to have a high chance of fossilization. The geological record of the phylum is accordingly excellent. The echinoderm skeleton is not a truly external one, like that of the molluscs, for it is surrounded on the outside by a thin skin of living tissue. The mosaic of calcite plates is a particular feature of the phylum, and serves as one of the characters linking together such dissimilar-looking animals as starfish and sea lilies. Another unique feature is the water vascular system, a system of internal plumbing that drives the tube feet : mobile, club-shaped sacs arranged in serried ranks on the outside of the animal, which operate in harmony to convey food to the mouth, or in locomotion. They have a well-developed nervous system. Most echinoderms also have an unique five-rayed radial symmetry in the overall shape of the skeleton. This five-fold (pentameral) symmetry seems a peculiar number to be present over such a wide range of organisms. Why not four, six or thirteen? The answer is still not clear, but what is certain is that the five-rayed plan was established even in the Cambrian in a number of diverse echinoderms; it is evidently highly functional. In detail the echinoderms show evidence of bilateral (mirror image) symmetry, from which five-fold symmetry was probably derived. Once acquired it is rarely lost, even in echinoderms like sea urchins that (perhaps) could also function on a different symmetry pattern. Each plate of an echinoderm is composed of a single crystal of calcite, whereas all of the organisms we have discussed above have skeletons composed of felt-like masses of tiny crystals. Broken echinoderm plates ‘catch the light’— the single crystals break along cleavage planes and so present a uniform reflective surface. Many rocks are composed of a high proportion of echinoderm debris, which is easily recognized because of this optical property. Through their long history the echinoderms have never left the sea, but within their preferred medium they have adopted most of the life habits available to marine organisms. They include grazers, feeding on simple plants, scavengers, mud eaters, filter-feeders extracting microorganisms from currents, and some efficient and versatile hunters. Like other marine organisms they have a planktonic larval stage that assists their dispersal, but almost all adult echinoderms lead a bottom dwelling  existence; a few sea lilies have successfully cast off their anchorage to the sea floor and become widespread swimmers. The echinoderms are such a varied and important group that the different kinds have to be considered separately. I should add that some of the most interesting echinoderms are also some of the rarest — peculiar, plated animals that do not fit comfortably into the array of living forms. Many of these occur in the Cambrian — it is as if the echinoderms tried out various designs before settling for the successful models that mostly survive today. The echinoderms are a phylum closely allied to the Chordates — including the vertebrates, and both phyla probably have a common ancestor in the Precambrian. SEA LILIES — CLASS CRINOIDEA, AND OTHER STEMMED ECHINODERMS (Colour plates 22, 23, 24) Crinoids are abundant and important fossils from the Ordovician to the Tertiary. They are still abundant at present, although a little less common in shallow water sites than they were in the Palaeozoic and Mesozoic, but they are conspicuous and varied components of deep water faunas. The great majority of the group have long stalks, which are anchored to the bottom. The main part of the animal consists of a cup (or calyx ) to which the stalk is attached at its upper end, and from the top of the calyx stretch long arms, which are five in number or more usually a multiple of five. The arms are often repeatedly branched. The distal parts of the arms carry fine pinnules , which are instrumental in gathering the fine, water-borne food such as micro-organisms on which the animal feeds. Since crinoids often occur together in large numbers ('gardens') with their arms waving in the currents, it is easy to see how they came to acquire their botanical analogy. Food grooves in the arms channel the food to the mouth, which lies in the centre of the calyx. Stem, calyx, and arms are all made of calcite plates. The stems are often common fossils, even when the calyx cannot be found — many of the ‘crinoidal limestones’ are composed largely of stem debris. The individual plates of the stem slot together like a stack of coins; they are termed ossicles . These can be round, or five-sided, up to a centimetre or so across, and have a small hole in their centre; the stems can look like corals to the casual observer, but where they are broken they show the typical echinoderm reflective surfaces. Detailed classification of the crinoids is based principally on the way the calcite plates are arranged on the calyx with the number and branching patterns of the arms, the external sculpture on the calyx, and important internal features of the cup connected with the nervous and respiratory systems. In detail they are a very complicated group. Complete specimens of fossil crinoids are rather rare, and deserve pride of place in anyone's collection. Complete cups are more common — many of them were evidently rigid, and they are easily preserved as fossils. There are famous examples where whole ‘gardens’ seem to have been preserved, with the arms frozen, as it were, in motion, and even the roots at the base of the stems in place. Crinoid,Onychocrinus exsculptus from the Carboniferous (Mississipian ). The species is preserved in relief in limestone, which is very fine grained, and retains many fine details. The long stem of this crinoid, with a small cup at the top, and stout arms composed of easily visible calcite plates, these first arms themselves dividing, are some of the more important characteristics of this species. There are numerous Carboniferous crinoids not unlike this one, which require expert knowledge in their discrimination. This specimen is from Illinois, USA, but forms related to it may be found in Carboniferous limestones in many areas. The specimen is 15 cm long. The crinoids have had an eventful geological history. True crinoids are doubtfully known before the Ordovician, but once established they diversified rapidly in the manner we have seen repeatedly with other groups. They soon spread to a variety of habitats, but in the Palaeozoic they were conspicuously abundant in relatively shallow environments. The most mouthwatering specimens tend to be found in limestones — famous sites are in the Silurian rocks of England and Mississipian rocks of the U.S.A. The group as a whole had a   major crisis in the Permian, during which most of the Palaeozoic forms died out. A very few of these survived into the Triassic. In the Mesozoic there was another great radiation of the crinoids, the typical forms having flexible arms, and it is crinoids of this kind that survive today. Some of the most famous crinoidal deposits are of Jurassic age, and marvellous specimens have been collected from the Lias rocks of Britain and Germany. A new and successful innovation was the evolution of stemless crinoids — some of these acquired pelagic habits, and during the Cretaceous the genera Marsupites and Uintacrinus (see p.79) were widespread enough to be useful marker fossils. Some of these stemless forms developed grappling hooks at the base of the calyx — with these they can attach in a favourable site, and move when conditions become adverse. Such feather stars are very numerous in some reef habitats today. The long and varied history of the crinoids demonstrates how well the echinoderms have attacked the problems of filter-feeding. The stemless crinoid Uintacrinus , widespread during the Cretaceous. Natural size. Fossil crinoid (sea lily),Dizygocrinus montgomeryensis,Carboniferous (Mississipian ). The specimen is unusually complete for a fossil sea lily, and lies on a fine-grained limestone. There is a certain amount of crushing of the cup beneath the arms. The stem is broken off. Note the fine, thread-like pinnules attached to the arms — used by the animal to trap food particles — and the thin and flexible stem. There are quite a large number of species in Carboniferous and Permian rocks which resemble the species illustrated here This species is from the limestones of Keokuk, Iowa, USA. The arms of this specimen have a length of about 4 cm. Blastoid,Pentremites spicatus,Carboniferous (Mississipian ). The specimen is preserved in its original calcite; its lack of distortion may be seen from its perfect five-fold symmetry. The five finely striated food grooves, which in this view occupy much of the surface of the animal, are typical of the blastoid. The name ‘blastoid’ is derived from the Greek for ‘bud’because of the resemblance of the animal to a flower bud. Pentremites is a large genus with many species in limestone of Carboniferous age, particularly in the Mississipian limestones of North America. This specimen is from Grayson co., Kentucky, USA. Similar species occur in North and South America, and related genera almost worldwide The specimen has a diameter of 3 cm. In the Palaeozoic rocks there were other stalked filter-feeding echinoderms, which failed to survive the crisis at the end of the Permian, weathered by the crinoids. These extinct groups can exceed crinoids in number and variety at certain horizons, and they were evidently competing on equal terms. The blastoids (class Blastoidea) had compact cups up to a few centimetres long, with five broad food grooves running down the sides (lacking crinoid arms). In life the food grooves were flanked by lines of delicate armlets (brachioles ) which served to gather the food. Blastoids are sometimes abundant fossils in rocks (usually limestone) of Silurian to early Permian age, and their perfect, compact pentameral symmetry makes their calices among the most attractive of fossils. Like crinoids they evidently grew in gardens, for their remains (especially in Carboniferous rocks) tend to occur packed together in thousands. Cystoids (class Cystoidea) are even odder animals: often rather irregular bags of calcite plates, or if composed of a few plates these may carry powerful ribbing. The five-fold symmetry is often hard to detect in the calyx as a whole, although five food grooves are usually developed. They are a primitive, but very interesting, group with Cambrian origins, and reached their greatest variety in the Ordovician. Some of them evidently lacked a stem, and must have lain loosely on the bottom. There are several more groups of odd echinoderms in the Lower Palaeozoic rocks — some of them only recently discovered, like the bizarre helicoplacoids, which look like nothing so much as spinning tops (see p. 84). All are of the greatest interest, and any plated animal from the Cambrian is likely to be an important specimen. Sometimes these early forms are found as moulds — the original calcite having dissolved away. The external moulds then present a characteristic appearance, like the impression of a mosaic pressed into the rock. It is well worth keeping a   special watch for fossils of this kind when hunting in Cambrian localities — it is still perfectly possible to discover a completely new kind of echinoderm! 18 Eocene gastropod,Voluta muricina . The species is beautifully preserved, retaining something of its original lustre, and all the fine details of its ornament. It is distinguished by its tall spire, elongate aperture, prominent spines, but without the spiral ridges seen on many species. The specimen here is from Epernay in France, and related forms can be found in Eocene clays over much of Europe. Length, 7 cm. 19 Carboniferous goniatite Goniatites crenistria , Derbyshire England. This handsome goniatite is an internal mould preserved in limestone. The mould reveals the suture lines which in goniatites have a distinctive zigzag form. The aperture is broken off along one such suture, giving the specimen a pointed margin. The last whorl conceals most of the earlier ones. Diameter 5 cm. 20 Ammonite,Kosmoceras acutistriatum , Jurassic, Wiltshire, England. This ammonite occurs in a fine-grained grey shale, but has been severely flattened. The original lustre of the shell has been retained. This species is particularly distinctive because of the extended flanges at its apertural margin (lappets ). Longest diameter of this specimen is 9 cm, but some forms grow larger. 21 The heteromorph ammonite,Scaphites nodosus , Cretaceous, Badlands, South Dakota, USA. This species retains much of its original shell, giving it a beautiful pearly lustre. This is one of the later ammonites, in which the normal ammonite plane spiral has begun to ‘unwind’ in various ways. This species has a distinctive combination of fine ribbing and coarse tubercles. Long diameter of this specimen 8 cm; smaller examples are perhaps commoner. 22 Blastoid,Pentremites robustus , Carboniferous (Mississipian ), Illinois, USA. The specimen is preserved in its original calcite with only the slightest compression. The view shown is from the side. The length of the illustrated specimen is 4 cm. In some localities blastoids like this one break easily out of the enclosing matrix, or are weathered out in considerable numbers. 23 The Silurian cystoid,Pseudocrinites magnificus , Wenlock limestone, England. The calcite skeleton of this species is preserved in a grey limestone-shale matrix. The individual calcite plates of which the fossil is composed can be clearly seen. The stem is composed of a number of rings. This rare and peculiar fossil looks rather like a sea-lily without arms, and has more than a passing resemblance to a tennis racket! It has a length of 5 cm. 24 Triassic crinoid,Encrinus liliiformis . The calcite of this species is preserved with a gloss on the surface, in a matrix of slightly cavernous limestone, which is composed of many broken fragments of other fossils. Encrinus is typical of the marine limestones of the Triassic of Europe. This specimen is from the Muschelkalk of Germany. Total length 18 cm. 25 Cidaroid sea urchin,Plegiocidaris coronata , Jurassic, Ulm, Germany. Two beautiful examples of this sea urchin are illustrated preserved in a fine-grained limestone in full relief. Note however, that the stout spines are not preserved on these specimens. Plegiocidaris is found in Triassic and Jurassic rocks of Europe. The specimens have 5 cm diameter. 26 Jurassic sea urchin,Hemicidaris intermedia , Wiltshire, England. This specimen is exceptionally well-preserved, retaining its spines where they fell around the animal as it died. The matrix is a yellow limestone. The long spines of this species are characteristic — they resemble lances used in medieval jousting. Note the prominent articulating tubercles, like those of other cidaroids. The longest spine on this specimen has a length of 7 cm. 27 Sea urchin,Tylocidaris clavigera , Cretaceous, Gravesend, England. Magnificently preserved in its original calcite in a matrix of chalk, this specimen is unusual because it has the spines still joined to the rest of the animal. The ferocious-looking spines, which seem almost too large for the central animal, are mostly attached, but one or two have come adrift. 8 cm across. 28 Spatangoid sea urchin,Micraster coranguinum Cretaceous. This specimen is preserved in its original calcite. It is frequently found also as siliceous internal moulds. Micraster is sometimes called the heart urchin, because of its distinctive shape. Most specimens have a length of 5–7 cm. 29 Sea urchin,Schizaster canatifera , Pliocene, Perpignan, France. The specimen is perfectly preserved — retaining even the finest details of its external surface. But the fine fuzz of tiny spines that covered it in life are not present. This species looks rather like the heart urchin but the petal-like areas are much more deeply sunken, the forward pair very short. Related species are worldwide. It is 8 cm long. 30 Fossil starfish,Archastropecten cotteswoldiae , Jurassic, Gloucestershire, England. The original calcite of the starfish is stained slightly yellow on the surface. The specimen occurs in a fine-grained limestone, one which fortunately splits easily around the enclosed fossils. This species has a small central disc, and long, slender arms. A related genus,Astropecten , occurs in Tertiary rocks, and survives today. Maximum diameter 7 cm. 31 Carpoid,Cothurnocystis evae , Ordovician, Ayrshire, Scotland. This curious species is preserved in a fine-grained sandstone as an external mould — that is, all the original shell material has been dissolved away, but this still allows an accurate view of the original organism, especially if an artificial cast is taken from the natural mould. The greatest length of this specimen is 4 cm. Fossil brittle (serpent) star,(Palaeocoma egertoni , Jurassic Lias, England. A beautiful species preserved in an impure limestone. The limestone was deposited in very quiet water conditions, which accounts for the preservation of this delicate little fossil. The long slender arms are flexible, unlike the starfish shown previously. Other localities for brittle stars include Miocene rocks in Maryland, USA. Maximum diameter 8 cm. Permian blastoid,Deltoblastus delta . These beautifully preserved little blastoids are stained slightly, because of iron compounds. The slender stems, like those of the crinoids are not preserved here. Compared with the other blastoids in this book the food grooves are very long, extending almost to the base of the animal, and occupying much of its surface area. This species may be one of the last of this kind of echinoderm, which did not survive beyond the Permian. This rare species is unlikely to fall into the hands of the amateur, being from a unique echinoderm fauna in the Permian rocks of Amanoebang Province, Indonesia. The largest specimen here does not greatly exceed 2 cm in length. SEA URCHINS — CLASS ECHINOIDEA (Colour plates 25–29) Anyone who has waded into the clear blue waters of the Mediterranean without proper footwear may have encountered the protective covering of the sea urchins. Many of the living echinoids are protected by spines, some sharp and breaking off easily into the unwary foot, others stout and clublike; a few groups have taken to burrowing into sediment, and the spines have become small and felt-like. Under the spines there is a test composed of hundreds of calcite plates. Of course there is no stem — the sea urchins are self-propelled. Looking more closely at the arrangement of the calcite plates the fivefold symmetry is still in evidence — in this group there are five areas of finer plates (ambulacra ) radiating from the centre. Under a lens these small plates show perforations, and during life the tiny tube feet passed through these to assist the animal in locomotion. The perfect polygonal joinery of all the plates is a striking feature of the echinoid test. Some sea urchins are almost spherical, with large strong plates looking rather like shields with a boss in the centre. These kinds of sea urchins carry the stoutest of spines attached to the bosses. Many living sea urchins have undergone a modification of the pentameral symmetry typical of the rest of the echinoderms — they have become bilateral again. Perhaps this is not surprising in animals that are accustomed to moving in a particular direction — they need a front and a back. In burrowing forms the mouth moves to one (forward) side and the anus to the back, which is obviously a sensible arrangement. Some species have become greatly flattened like the living sand dollar, which has a covering of very fine spines and can bury itself in sand with remarkable speed. The sea urchins are among the most efficient scavengers in the sea-hence their somewhat unsavoury association with human effluvia. They also include species that eat their way through enormous quantities of sediment, extracting edible particles from it, and in the process reprocessing all the sediment; some of the fossil heart urchins probably had this habit (see p. 128). These vacuum cleaners of the sea are vital in preventing fouling of the marine environment. Species with club-shaped spines include active hunters (although they tend to hunt sluggish animals like other sea urchins) and they have powerful jaws on the lower side of the animal that can munch their way through a sand dollar as if it were a biscuit. Some urchins use their jaws to make burrows in solid rock. Like other major echinoderm groups the geological record of the sea urchins goes back to the Ordovician. In my experience they are generally rare fossils in the Palaeozoic, but as so often with echinoderms there are localities where large numbers of specimens can be recovered from a bedding plane or two. They must have been gregarious from the start. The early sea urchins tend to have rather a large number of plates in a much less regular mosaic than their later relatives. By the end of the Palaeozoic, echinoids with club-shaped spines and beautifully regular tests had become well-established, and their distant descendants survive today. It was in the Mesozoic that a really considerable proliferation of urchins occurred, and they acquired the importance in the marine economy that they retain. They are abundant in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks, represented both by the spherical spiny forms, and some of those with bilateral symmetry. Isolated spines are common fossils, and useful ones too, because their patterns vary from species to species. Some of the burrowing forms have left their burrows behind as well. In England sea urchins are especially easy to collect from the Cretaceous chalk, where they have been used as one of the fossils for dating the rocks. STARFISH — CLASS STELLEROIDEA (Colour plates 30, 32) The starfish are among the most important of invertebrate predators living today. They make major depredations on oyster beds and the recent activities of the ‘Crown of Thorns’ starfish (Acanthaster ) in chewing up great chunks of the Great Barrier Reef have become a modern ecological object lesson (and, incidentally, a source of funds for many marine biologists). There are two major kinds of starfish (which may not be closely related)— the familiar large, stiff-armed asteroids , and the delicate ophiuroids , brittle stars, with lithe, slender, snake-like arms radiating from a circular central disc. Ophiuroids are especially abundant in deep sea environments, and it is unusual for a deep sea dredge to miss one of these small animals. Asteroids often have five arms, but many species have more — up to about forty. Although they are common today starfish are not generally common fossils, but as so often with echinoderms, they seem to be local in occurrence. Their remains are commoner from the Mesozoic onwards, and at some levels, as in the Cretaceous chalk, they can be found in considerable numbers. Their history goes back at least to the Ordovician, although some of the Palaeozoic asteroids are distantly related, if at all, to the living species. Ophiuroids have fossil representatives as old as Carboniferous. Cassiduloid sea urchin,Pygurus costatus , Jurassic. The species is preserved without flattening in a hard limestone, which fills the interior of the specimen. This species looks rather like a bun, but not highly convex, and with a five-sided outline. The five ambulacral areas — like the petals of a flower — are clearly visible. They are not sunken into hollows as on many echinoids This genus and its allies are quite commonly found in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. This species is from the Corallian rocks of England, but its relatives occur in Europe, North America and Africa. This specimen has a diameter of 8 cm. Related species often grow to twice the diameter. Jurassic echinoids in this sort of preservation in hard limestones are often difficult to clean. Sometimes the natural processes of erosion will etch a perfect specimen. THE CARPOIDS — ECHINODERMS OR CHORDATES? (Colour plate 31) One of the oddest groups of animals covered with calcite plates are known as carpoids (occasionally referred to as calcichordates). Although they have been known for many years their evolutionary position is still hotly debated. They lack any pretence of five-fold symmetry, some are bilaterally symmetrical, but others have no obvious plane of symmetry at all, a most unusual thing for any animal. They appear to have a stem: could they be related to the crinoids? But the ‘stem’ tapers out to a point, and in some cases had a whip-like flexibility; the same structure has been interpreted as a ‘tail’. Similar kinds of arguments can be applied to different parts of these extraordinary fossils. Internally they are really quite complicated, and some possess lobes and channels incised within the plates strikingly similar to the appearance of the brain and nerves in some fishes. Some authorities  have suggested that the carpoids may include ancestors of particular chordates. They have a record going well back into the Cambrian, when it might be supposed that the chordates were undergoing a major diversification. Regardless of whether they include direct ancestors or not, the carpoids do serve to demonstrate the likelihood of evolutionary links between chordates — including vertebrates — and the echinoderms. Carpoids are rare fossils ranging from the Cambrian to the Devonian, when they disappeared completely — unless their descendants live on in one of the chordate groups. Starfish,Crateraster coombi , Cretaceous. The starfish is preserved in soft white chalk, which fills in the interior of the animal. The individual calcite plates can be clearly seen. This starfish has a broad central disc, and slender arms. They are stout plates around the perimeter, but tiny-plates in the central part of the animal. Starfish are uncommon fossils, particularly in this state of completeness, since they easily break into their component plates. A few species generally resembling this one occur in Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. This specimen is from Kent, England, but similar forms occur in the chalk over Europe and in Cretaceous rocks in North America. Related forms survive today. The specimen measures 10 cm across its longest diameter. THE ARTHROPODS — PHYLUM ARTHROPODA There are more living arthropod species than all other phyla combined; if diversity is a measure of success then the arthropods are the easy winners. Arthropods are those animals with an external, usually ‘chitinous’ skeleton (exoskeleton ) and have characteristic legs, feelers, etc., with joints to give them flexibility (arthropod is derived from the  Greek for ‘jointed leg’). They have bodies divided into segments, and their legs and jaws are arranged in pairs. They are mostly small and there is a good physiological reason for this: gigantism is mechanically difficult for animals with external skeletons, and above a certain size it is difficult to get enough oxygen into the organism to sustain activity. Despite this one limitation the arthropods have the most varied habits and habitats of any phylum: they can be found anywhere on land, sea or in the air. They inhabit the driest parts of the desert and the deepest parts of the ocean with equal facility. This is partly due to the flexibility of the external skeleton — it can be modified into wings, fortified into claws, sealed against searing heat, or turned into eye lenses. Segmentation, too, has proved very versatile; individual pairs of legs, or appendages, can be specialized for particular functions without affecting the routine business of locomotion taken by the others; appendages are modified for feeding in a host of ways, for grasping, swimming, spinning, copulating, cleaning or camouflaging. And their small size enables tiny arthropods, some almost too  small to see with the naked eye, to live in crannies, within the soil, between sand grains, and the like. They are truly ubiquitous. Helicoplacoid — a peculiar and puzzling Cambrian echinoderm Tube of polychaete worm, Rotularia bognoriensis, Eocene. Serpulid tubes are preserved here in a siltstone, with parts of the original shell material adhering. The same piece of rock also includes internal moulds of gastropods and bivalves. Worm tubes like these may, at first sight, be confused with gastropod molluscs. The irregularity of the tubes, which become straight near their apertures, distinguishes them from snail shells. Serpulid worm tubes are found in many different sediment types in rocks of Mesozoic and Tertiary age. Some species are very tiny, and encrust other shells. This species is from Bognor, England, but related forms occur the world over. Overall length of specimens about 3 cm. Cambrian trilobite,Wanneria walcottana , preserved on a fine sandstone, with a certain amount of crushing. This is one of the most primitive trilobites known. The crescent-shaped eyes are attached to the middle part of the head. There are a number of similar species from early Cambrian rocks distinguished on the size of the eyes and details of the thorax. The specimen has a length of 10 cm. They are also an ancient group, since obvious arthropods, of primitive kinds, can be found in the earliest of Cambrian rocks. At this time, of course, they were wholly marine. They were probably derived from some sort of segmented worm (annelid)— a few scientists adopt the view that different arthropods may have come from different and separate worms, independently, which became ‘arthropodized’ by acquiring an external skeleton. With certain exceptions, the fossil record of the arthropods is not commensurate with their diversity today, and their probable diversity in the past. Some forms have delicate exterior skeletons that are only preserved under exceptional circumstances (see p. 16). Many terrestrial forms simply did not live in environments in which preservation was possible. So the record of the group as a whole is a bit patchy, with ‘jumps’ in time between one fossil find and the next. Some groups, those with good, solid (and especially calcified) hard parts are frequent and important fossils, with an unparalleled record. A brief summary of the arthropods cannot do justice to all the fascinating specialized groups — sea spiders and mites for example— that have an incomplete fossil record. We shall concentrate on the arthropods with the best fossil record. Some of these are common enough to dominate fossil assemblages, and they are among the most attractive of the common invertebrate groups. TRILOBITES — CLASS TRILOBITA (Colour plates 33, 34, 36, 43) The North American Indians had a name for trilobites that meant ‘little water bug in the rocks’, which shows extraordinary zoological acuity. The trilobites were one of the dominant forms of marine life in the Lower Palaeozoic, known from thousands of different species and found in every continent. Not surprisingly they were among the first fossils to attract widespread attention. They have a high degree of organization and a variety of form that shows how quickly the arthropods were able to exploit the advantages of their external skeleton. All trilobites  are divided lengthways into three lobes — hence their name. They can also be divided crossways into three regions, a well-defined head (cephalon ) at the front, usually equipped with a pair of eyes, a thorax with a variable number of articulated segments, and at the back end a tail (or pygidium ) formed by the fusion of several segments. The parts of the animal we find fossilized are usually only the carapace, the hard parts that formed a protective covering on the back of the animal. If we could have turned over a living trilobite we would have seen an array of jointed legs on the underside, and flexible antennae. The traces of these appendages are preserved in exceptional circumstances, so we do know that trilobites had walking legs gills, antennae, and the bases of the legs modified into primitive jaws in some species. The appendage pairs are generally similar along the length of animal. Few examples of complete trilobites are known and for the most part we have to be content with the exterior skeleton. Photograph of ‘happy buttons’ taken through the lenses of the eye of the trilobite Phacops (see p. 87) of Devonian age. Cambrian trilobite,Elrathia kingi . This trilobite has been preserved in a curious way: the original shell has been thickened by mineral growth, still of calcite, to give the fossil a distinctive, medallion-like appearance This trilobite has a large number of wide thoracic segments, not greatly convex. The tail is wide, well-segmented. The inflated middle part of the head tapers forwards This species occurs in great numbers in the Wheeler Shale of Utah, USA. Related species occur over a much wider area around the margin of North America and in Europe. Complete specimens are usually ½-3 cm long. They are sold in rock shops and souvenir centres, often mounted into jewellery. Moulting in trilobites; breakup of the exoskeleton into several pieces helped the animal shed its old carapace The great variety of form of the hard parts surely shows that trilobites were adapted to a wide range of habitats and life styles. We know that they could live in extremely shallow to very deep-water environments, that most lived on or near the sea bottom, but a few were adapted to open-ocean swimming. They probably had a variety of different habits, some no doubt were scavengers, others sediment grazers, and it seems probable that some trilobites were also active hunters, pursuing worms and other soft-bodied prey, which they shredded using the spines on the base of their legs. The eyes of trilobites include some very sophisticated structures that show they were far from primitive visually. Many species have thousands of lenses — like a fly's eye — which were very sensitive to detecting any movements in their field of view. Others had fewer lenses of remarkably efficient construction; photographs have actually been taken (p. 86) using these ancient lenses in a camera — and they still focus precisely after 400 million years or so. The lenses, like the rest of the exoskeleton, are made of calcite. Trinucleid trilobite,Trinucleus fimbriatus , Ordovician. An extraordinary little trilobite looking like an ancient medallion, preserved in shale, with some of its original exoskeleton retained, coloured by iron compounds. Trinucleid trilobites are blind, and with a greatly inflated mid-part of the head region. Around the perimeter of the head there is a pitted fringe, which is unique to this kind of arthropod. Trinucleid trilobites, with various types of fringe, are characteristic of Ordovician rocks. There are more than 100 species. This species is from Builth, Wales. While perhaps commonest in Europe (Wales, Scotland, Sweden, Norway, Czechoslovakia), trinucleids are also known from North America (Virginia, Nevada and various localities in Canada), North Africa and South America. Specimens do not usually exceed 2½ cm in length. Trilobites vary in length from a millimetre or two to fifty centimetres or more — the ‘average’ trilobite is 5 cm or so long. It is actually rather unusual to find a complete trilobite as a fossil — usually they are in pieces. Trilobites, like most arthropods, grew by moulting (casting off the old carapace and growing a new, larger one) and many of the bits we find are probably the ‘cast offs’ and not the dead animal. During moulting the head split into several pieces along special sutures , the thorax often parted into its individual segments and the tail was displaced (see p. 86). The early moults, ‘baby trilobites’, have been discovered. Some trilobites lost their eyes, probably those that burrowed in mud or lived in lightless parts of the ocean. Many trilobites could enroll when threatened, just like the living woodlouse some of them even evolved locking devices to make their enrollment really secure. In some places you can find dozens of enrolled trilobites together; these are the remains of the animals themselves, not the moults, which presumably perished together after a fruitless attempt to protect themselves from a miniature catastrophe such as a sudden influx of sediment. Typical trilobites of several kinds are present in the earliest Cambrian rocks; they must have had late Precambrian ancestors, but of these nothing is known. They swarmed in the Cambrian seas, outnumbering all other invertebrates in most localities. The trilobites evolved rapidly, and can therefore be used extensively in the dating of rocks at this time. They continued to proliferate in the Ordovician, although many of the Cambrian kinds had died out; in terms of the variety of forms present this period was perhaps their heyday. Several kinds of trilobite failed to survive the end of the Ordovician, but other trilobites were still conspicuous during the Silurian and Devonian. Only a few major groups survived into the Carboniferous, but they can still be locally  abundant. The last trilobites are found in Permian rocks, and before the Triassic they had disappeared forever. We might perhaps hope that one species lingered on, like the brachiopod Lingla , in some inaccessible part of the sea, but as even the deep sea faunas become well-known this possibility is fading. Since many of the extremely ancient rocks in which trilobites can be found are folded or otherwise distorted their remains can often be found twisted or fractured. But in other sites, particularly in limestones, they can be found with every fine skeletal detail preserved. The many different kinds are distinguished by the nature of the segmentation, particularly in the head region, the structure of the thorax and pygidium, the size, position and structure of the eyes, the development of the moulting sutures, and the surface patterns on the exterior of the exoskeleton. New trilobites are being discovered every year, and there is always the possibility of finding one with its legs preserved! Asaphid trilobite,Isotelus gigas , Ordovician. This fine, large trilobite is preserved in relief in a limestone — a common mode of preservation for North American Ordovician trilobites. A ‘smoothed out’ trilobite, with the head of similar size and shape to the tail, and only eight thoracic segments (contrast the Cambrian trilobites in this book). The eyes are small. Asaphid trilobites of many species are common in rocks of Ordovician age. Many grew to an impressive size. Isotelus is typical of the North American continent, where it occurs in many localities. Other asaphids occur in most countries of Europe, especially Norway and Sweden, and widely in Asia and Australia. This specimen has a length of 9 cm. CRABS, LOBSTERS, SHRIMPS AND THEIR ALLIES — CLASS CRUSTACEA (Colour plates 39, 41) The seas today swarm with crustacean arthropods ranging in size from the tiniest krill in the surface waters to giant bottom-living crabs with a reach like that of a man. The majority of crustacea have appendages that are specialized to do different jobs along the length of the animal — some for grasping, some for swimming and so on. Most smaller crustacea have exoskeletons that are rather delicate, and for this reason the fossil record of the shrimps, for example, is somewhat incomplete. Undoubted crustaceans are found in rocks as old as Cambrian, at which time free-swimming species were living happily alongside the trilobites. It is not until the Carboniferous that we start to find evidence of a variety of forms including the putative ancestors of some of the living dominant groups. Crabs and lobsters have the thickest exoskeleton of all the group — one like that of the trilobites reinforced with calcium carbonate — and the fossil record of this important group (only a small part of the whole class however) is much better. Lobster-like animals are found as far back as the Triassic, and both crabs and lobsters are frequent and appealing fossils in Cretaceous and Tertiary rocks. The group was hardly set back at all by the major extinction at the end of the Cretaceous, and has never been more varied than it is today. The most highly  specialized crustacea are probably the barnacles (Cirripedia) and individual barnacle plates are rather commonly encountered in rocks of Cretaceous age and younger. Finally the diminutive, bivalved ostracods are important and abundant fossils, which we will consider with other microfossils in Chapter 8. SPIDERS, SCORPIONS, SEA SCORPIONS, HORSESHOE CRABS — CLASS CHELICERATA (Colour plates 37, 38, 40) This large and varied group of arthropods includes the giants of the phylum, as well as tiny spiders hardly visible to the unaided eye. They are classified together because of basic similarities in the appendages, even though they have diversified into very different-looking creatures living equally happily on land and in the sea. Predatory habits are typical, and many species have specialized clutching appendages, or stinging organs. None of the group is especially common as fossils, but they make up for their general rarity by their interest. Most spectacular are the sea scorpions (eurypterids), which include arthropods as large as any that have lived (two.metres or more in length). Appendages in the ‘head’ region often include powerful claws, and it does not take much imagination to conclude that these eurypterids were among the fiercest predators of their day. They were prominent in the Silurian and Devonian, where they can be found with the fish-like animals that abounded in the fresh- and brackish water deposits of the time, although some of the Ordovician ones are in marine sediments. Some of the eurypterids may even have made tentative excursions on to the land. They are also probably the earliest animals in which two sexes can be certainly identified. The eurypterids are probably allied to the scorpions, which originated in the Silurian or even earlier, and successfully made the transition from the aqueous environment to land. They are abundant enough today in warmer climates to be a serious cause of death in some countries. Perhaps it was the transition to land that enabled the scorpions to survive beyond the Palaeozoic, which saw the end of the sea scorpions. Spiders are known as far back as the Carboniferous, but their remains are principally known fossilized from the Tertiary ambers, where perfectly preserved specimens retain even the hairs on the legs. The Horseshoe Crab (Limulus ) is one of the most celebrated of ‘living fossils’, and it is a genuine survivor having changed little in 150 million years (see p. 91). It is the last of the merostomes the group of fossil horseshoe crabs that were varied and numerous in the coal swamps of the Carboniferous and have a history that extends back to the Cambrian. Why Limulus alone should have survived is something of a mystery. It appears to have rather generalized habits, feeding on everything from worms to clams, which it can crush with its powerful appendages, using the bases of its legs like nutcrackers. It can swim, flipped over on to its boat-like carapace, or crawl. Presumably its ancestors were not so different when they shared the marine habitat with the trilobites. Below left Fossil spider,Eomysmena moritura , Oligocene. This is another amber specimen, exquisitely preserved in its entirety. It is an important and rare specimen. This species has a short and fat abdomen, which preserves something of its original light colour. The legs are shorter than those of the other spider in this book, and the four pairs are clearly visible. This fossil specimen is probably unique. There are species living today related to this fossil species. This specimen was obtained from the Baltic bays. The spider is just over ½cm long Below Fossil swimming crab,Notopocorystes broderipi , Cretaceous. This crab is preserved in a rather soft clay, which makes it more fragile than the other crabs in this book. The crab has a longer body than the other species shown here, and the legs are flattened and held away from the carapace. There are a number of species generally similar to this one in rocks of Cretaceous and younger age. This specimen is from Folkestone, England. Length of the carapace is 2½ cm, but the species grows to more than twice this size. INSECTS — CLASS INSECTA (Colour plates 35, 44, 45) The insects — flies, butterflies, beetles, ants, fleas, bugs, dragonflies, grasshoppers, aphids, wasps, etc. — are the most varied and numerous of the arthropods both in numbers of species and individuals. They are also the most perfectly adapted of terrestrial organisms, inhibited neither by extremes of climate nor altitude. If this book were written in proportion to the number of species in the group the rest of it would have to be devoted to the insects. But the fossil record of the insects is far from perfect — very sporadic and selective. Where insects are preserved they seem to occur in large numbers and in variety, so that a few famous localities have yielded a disproportionate number of the fossil species. Insects are fragile and easily damaged, and it is not surprising that they are sometimes destroyed completely. Many species live, and presumably lived in the past, in inland or upland sites where little sediment accumulates. Naturally the commonest insect fossils are the most durable parts, like the wing cases (elytra ) of the beetles. But their small size also means that insect fossils are easily overlooked and they may be more common than is supposed. The best sites are in rocks originating from sediments that accumulated in quiet, freshwater sites — lake bottoms, peat bogs and the like and they are generally rarer in marine facies. Fossil crab,Xanthopsis rugosus , Eocene. This specimen comes from a clay; the best specimens often occur in slightly harder, nodular layers within the clay. Two strong furrows run across the back of the carapace of this crab, which is knobbly, and, on a fine scale, covered with minute pits. As with Palaeocarpilius powerful claws are held close to the body, like the living shore crab. A number of Xanthopsis species are one of the characteristic crabs of Eocene deposits. This specimen was obtained from a tunnel under London! Similar specimens are to be obtained from elsewhere in southern England, in France, and in the USA. Diameter of the carapace 6 cm. Most insects have six legs in three pairs, and are equipped with wings (a number of primitive forms are wingless). The early evolutionary stages of development of wings are still in question they may have developed from outgrowths of exoskeleton from the body that assisted gliding initially, and then acquired a propulsive function. In any case winged insects were well established by the Carboniferous, when some of the giant ‘dragonflies’(not really a close relative of the living species) had a wingspan of tens of centimetres. No doubt many of the crucial steps in insect evolution took place during the Devonian, but of this phase of insect history there is very little record. In the Carboniferous and Permian the insects were highly diverse, and there is still debate over how closely these forms are related to our living fauna: some forms, like the cockroaches, undoubtedly have a long history. Flight gave the insects the chance to exploit habitats previously vacant, and unrivalled dispersal. The extraordinary flexibility of the group has meant singular problems in their classification, but certain characteristics, like the structure of the mouthparts or the wing vein patterns serve to define major subdivisions. During the Mesozoic some of the most important types of insects still living  — like the butterflies originated. Butterflies have an intimate relationship with flowering plants, which they pollinate, and themselves derive nourishment from the nectar. It is difficult to imagine a butterfly without a plant to feed on, and we have to assume that both the plants and the appropriate pollinators diversified together. Other kinds of insects besides butterflies have used the nectar of plants for a livelihood, including bees and some flies. The living horseshoe crab,Limulus ; compare with Fig. 38. The fossil record of insects is at its best from Tertiary deposits, where amber, the fossil resin of coniferous trees in which insects became entrapped, yield great numbers of exquisitely preserved specimens. Even the most delicate are present. The oldest amber is Cretaceous. The fossil remains of beetles, including the hard elytra, have been extensively used in the interpretation of the climatic history of the Pleistocene ice advances and retreats, because the species of beetle present in peat deposits change in harmony with the climatic fluctuations. PHYLUM CHORDATA The chordates include the dominant living animals, if you measure dominance by size, or the capacity to alter the world. Man is a chordate. The phylum at the present is dominated by its more advanced members — the vertebrates. But in the Cambrian or earlier the chordates no doubt included animals little more highly organized than the contemporary arthropods or brachiopods. A few of these survive. The lancelet,Branchiostoma , one of the standard laboratory animals for dissection, is a primitive chordate (there is a single fossil lancelet from the Middle Cambrian). Hardly anything is known about the fossils from the earliest history of the phylum, possibly because the early chordates lacked hard parts, unless the enigmatic carpoids belong here. The acquisition of a skeleton of calcium phosphate marked the point at which the fossil record began to contribute to the history of the group which, from our selfish viewpoint, we are conditioned to think of lying at the pinnacle of all evolutionary trees. Curiously enough the use of phosphatic material to build hard parts is generally primitive — calcium phosphate shells are nowhere more numerous than in the earliest Cambrian. All chordates have a nerve chord running along the back, and all higher chordates were derived from forms with gill slits. We are mostly concerned with the history of the vertebrates. Once the vertebrates were established they quickly acquired hard parts displaying great complexity when compared with most invertebrate phyla (we should except the arthropods, perhaps). So it is possible to deduce more about the course of evolution from the study of vertebrate  skeletal remains than is possible with most invertebrate groups, but even now, many mysteries remain. As a generality, the fossil record of the vertebrates is not as complete as that of many of the invertebrate groups, and particularly those with a continuous fossil record like the ammonoids. Vertebrate remains are decidedly patchy, particularly the terrestrial species. This is not altogether surprising considering the factors militating against their preservation — break-up of skeletons after death, the necessity to have a skeleton incorporated with sediment, and the activities of predatory and scavenging animals to destroy remains. So land vertebrates in particular tend to come from relatively few sites, which become exhaustively collected compared with most invertebrate localities. Some of the sites are enormously rich, however, and the history of palaeontology is punctuated by quite unscientific feuds between experts trying to find and hold on to the best sites for the most spectacular vertebrates. The more impressive the animal the greater the feud; the fights between Professors Cope and Marsh in the last century over the dinosaur remains of North America include examples of double dealing that would not shame an oil tycoon. Even fish remains are rather local, and do not adequately reflect the abundance of a group that has occupied the seas for more than 400 million years. There is room here to give only the briefest account of the different kinds of vertebrates. The higher vertebrates, fossil mammals and dinosaurs in particular, have been described in so many books that they sometimes seem to have as much flesh and blood as any animal in the zoo. The dinosaurs alone have commanded as much popular attention as the rest of the fossil animal kingdom combined. This reflects their spectacular size and the drama of reconstructions of battles to the death between Tyrannosaurus and its armoured contemporaries. The sad truth is that the average collector is unlikely to recover more than the most fragmentary remains of dinosaurs. The commonest vertebrate remains are of teeth or other resistant pieces. Fortunately the teeth of higher vertebrates can tell us a good deal. JAWLESS FISH (Colour plate 47) The oldest fossil fish, which are the earliest known vertebrates, lack jaws — the mouth is a simple opening — and are covered on the outside with bony skeleton. The first ones seem to have lived in the sea, but by the Silurian the jawless (Agnathan) fish were a prominent component of fresh- and brackish-water sites in many areas of the world, and continued to diversify into the Devonian period. Some of these freshwater fish are heavily armoured and make robust fossils — particularly the headshields. The insides of the shield have been known to preserve quite tiny details of the nervous system, for example. It is probable that the jawless fish lived by grubbing in the sediment, or perhaps by filter feeding, possibly exploiting organic material derived from the plants that were taking to life on land at the same time. A few living jawless fish are the only remnant of this ancient group, and they are highly specialized forms. The hagfish feeds on dying fish using its rasp-like tongue in conjunction with a solitary tooth on the roof of its mouth. The lampreys (Petromyzon) are rather nasty external parasites of other fish, to which they attach themselves with a sucker, and proceed to rasp away at the living flesh. The specialized habits of both these ‘pseudo-fishes’ may have contributed to their survival, when none of their bony-plated relatives survived the Palaeozoic. Modern specialists often divide the jawless fishes into two broad groups, one containing the hagfish and the other the lamprey, with the fossil jawless forms distributed between the two. Jawless fish are particularly common in red rocks of the Silurian and Devonian periods, which was a time when non-marine rocks were widespread, and have survived subsequent erosion. They accompany the eurypterid arthropods (which may have preyed upon them), and we can visualize the rivers and lakes of the time thronging with the first invaders from the sea. The subsequent development of the jaw enabled the vertebrates to exploit a wider range of lifestyles than were available to the jawless fish, and it would not be too gross a generalization to say that much of the evolution of the vertebrates was intimately related to things that happened to jaws. SHARKS AND ALLIES The sharks and their relatives (known by the indigestible class name Elasmobranchiomorphi) are the most successful of long survivors among the vertebrates. Their rapacious habits have been the subject of bloody hyperbole in films and bestsellers, so everybody knows that the shark has ranks of  fearsome, pointed teeth, an elegant, incessant swishing swimming motion, a tail with a long ‘point’ uppermost, and a big appetite. Their skeleton is made of cartilage — bone has not ‘grown into’ the cartilage, as in the higher vertebrates. Their true jaws are of obvious advantage for grasping prey. Cartilage does not preserve as fossil as a rule, so most of the evidence of the shark-like fish rests upon teeth. Sharks of essentially modern type go back to the Jurassic. In the later Palaeozoic a number of shark-like fish include some related to living forms, others whose zoological position is still a puzzle. The Devonian placoderms are an especially exciting group of fish (see p. 4) with powerful, armour-plated heads and frequently fang-like teeth, the function of which is obviously predatory. The lower jaw of these fish is loosely slung to the brain case so that they had a very wide ‘gape’. The trunk was also protected with a shield. This group may include the distant ancestors of the sharks, but they must have been somewhat ponderous animals compared with the streamlined hunters of modern seas. Most of them were dogfish-sized, but Dunkleosteus was twice the length of a man, and was surely the most formidable predator of its day. Sharks of modern type replace their worn teeth with new ones by a sort of conveyor belt system. Isolated, bladed shark's teeth are really rather frequent finds in Mesozoic and Tertiary rocks, often in the absence of any other fish remains. They have a handsome shiny lustre which makes them conspicuous from a distance. The rays are related to sharks, and are in essence sharks that have been ‘squashed’ flat in response to life as rather sluggish bottom dwellers. The mollusc-crushing teeth of rays, with the same lustre as shark's teeth, but formed as low, ridged cushions, can also be found in Mesozoic and younger rocks. The early jawed fish,Cheiracanthus murchisoni , from the Devonian. The fish is preserved in a siltstone nodule, which has partially formed around the body of the fish. The body is of normal ‘fishy’ outline covered with minute rhomboidal scales Note prominent spines which supported paired fins. The species is named after Sir Roderick Murchison, a great pioneer of the study of Palaeozic rocks. Acanthodian fishes generally resembling this one are known from quite complete specimens from Devonian to Permian rocks. Some achieved a considerable size In the Devonian rocks, fishes of this kind are known from (mostly) freshwater deposits in Scotland, Wales, Norway and arctic Canada. This specimen is from Banffshire, Scotland. It is 15 cm long. BONY FISH — OSTEICHTHYES (Colour plates 46, 48, 49) Every experience with an unfilleted kipper demonstrates the aptness of the general name of this group. The vast majority of living fish belong here (18,000 species or so), which rival the insects in their multitude of adaptations and variety of external form. They can live in hot springs, or can be dredged from the deepest abyssal depths of the ocean; the latter are grotesque gargoyles that seem to belong in the paintings of Heironymus Bosch. Some are rapid swimmers gathered together in silvery shoals, others sluggish bottom dwellers spending most of their time buried in sediment. Most have a characteristic arrangement of paired fins, but these can be lost, or fantastically modified to form fans or poisonous barbs. Most species are a few centimetres to a few tens of centimetres long. Their rapidity of evolution is well known: dozens of species have evolved in African fresh water lakes within the last million years. They have as wide a range of life habits as any group, from scavengers, grazers, filter feeders, vegetarians, omnivores, to fierce predators with reputations to rival that of the sharks. A coating of scales is characteristic, and the gills are covered by a movable flap (the operculum ). It would be difficult to overestimate the importance of the bony fish in the economy of the sea. Fish of various sizes feed on the plankton (and on each other), and themselves are food for larger predators, such as seals and many whales, and man. Many of them have bizarre adaptations, as parasites, or as permanent ‘guests’ within particular species of coral or sponge, which it would be impossible to infer from fossil remains. Many have good sight, but there are a few forms which have lost their eyes, some of them living in the lightless world of caves. Considering their abundance in the oceans and rivers today, bony fish fossils are rather rare, and poorly reflect their true importance. Where they occur, however, they are found in large numbers, and in variety. Presumably these sites were protected from the kinds of influence that normally destroy fish remains, such as the activity of scavenging animals that disarticulate the skeletons, or currents. The classic fish sites produce fossils of quite outstanding beauty (see Plate 49) and ones which have considerable monetary value. The fish of the Eocene and later are clearly related to today's fauna, and some relatives of the living groups can be found in Mesozoic rocks. The classification of bony fish is extremely complicated, particularly fitting in the fossil forms, and there are many bones of contention (literally!). The group as a whole goes back to the Devonian (? Silurian) period, and from rocks of this age predatory fish (Palaeoniscus and allies) have been recovered. Some living survivors of these early forms include the sturgeons and bichirs (the former have reverted to a cartilage skeleton). The early fossil bony fish have tails with the long blade uppermost, whereas the more advanced living bony fish have a tail that is symmetrical, and more effective in producing a horizontal thrust. The surface of their body was covered with an interlocking series of shiny scales (‘ganoid’) which are still found in the bichir. One important division of bony fishes includes the lungfish and the ‘lobe-finned’ fishes (including the coelacanth, the most famous of living fossils). This group of fish was also fully fledged in the Devonian, and this is of particular significance because the origin of all land vertebrates has been considered as lying within a species of this group. The freshwater lungfish retain their lungs, which help them to survive periods of drying in the rivers in which they live. Many fish specialists believe that in the Devonian all the bony fishes had lungs (and that the swim bladder of the recent forms was a modification of the early breathing apparatus). It is not an easy business to identify the actual ancestor of the land-going organisms, and perhaps it has not yet been found. For many years there have been proponents of the theory that one of the ‘lobe-finned’ fishes included the ancestor of the tetrapods, and it is not difficult to imagine their stumpy fins, with a fleshy core, making the uneasy transition into a walking leg. Other features do not agree with this, and recently there has been a swing to favour the lungfishes as nearer the origin of amphibians and, ultimately, ourselves. Whatever momentous steps they took in the Devonian, the lungfish and lobe fins have been very conservative since, for the living lungfish are clearly similar to their Palaeozoic relatives and coelacanth lobe fins like the living genus (Latimeria ) are known from Cretaceous rocks. Armoured placoderm fish of the Devonian AMPHIBIANS —CLASS AMPHIBIA (Colour plate 51) Frogs, newts, and salamanders are living amphibians. The frogs in particular are one  of the most diverse of the higher vertebrate groups and peculiarly endearing animals with their lugubrious expressions and vocabulary of squeaks and belches. Yet the amphibia as a whole represent an early level of terrestrial organization; they are tied to water for reproduction, because their larvae have to pass through a wholly subaqueous phase, and desiccation of the adult is a constant danger. The amphibians had their origins in one of the freshwater lung-carrying fishes in the Devonian. We have to visualize the process of change as a gradual one, with progressive forays from the water, until the first animal with true limbs developed (the bony elements of the limb are present in the fish fin). From the Devonian of Greenland and other localities comes a true four-legged animal (tetrapod) that is not far from the ‘fish with legs’ we might have visualized (which is commemorated in its name —Ichthyostega ). But as always it is not quite that simple. The transition from water to land required not only the perfection of a walking limb, but modifications to the hearing system, palate, eyes and so on, and Ichthyostega had already established most of these terrestrial modifications, so it is in no sense an ‘ancestor’, although it has many ancestral features. Bony scales were inherited from its ancestors and no doubt this helped the animal against desiccation . The subsequent history of the amphibians includes a further development of terrestrial forms, but others remained wholly or partly aqueous. These flourished in the waterlogged swamps of the Carboniferous period. The earliest amphibians were certainly predators, and there was suitable prey both on land and in the water. Bony fish,Lycoptera middendorfi , Cretaceous This little fish is preserved in a soft, pale grey shale Like many shale specimens it is flattened, but the still-water conditions under which the rock was deposited have permitted complete preservation of a delicate skeleton. This fish has a rather expanded, frog-like head behind which there are prominent fins; a slender body, which is flexible, supported by a host of tiny ribs, which are clearly visible. A number of related fossil species are known from cretaceous rocks This species is from Cretaceous fish beds in Turga, Nertchinsk, Siberia. Similar species occur in Mongolia and China. It is 6 cm long. The Carboniferous is popularly known as the ‘Age of Amphibians’, and it is true that the amphibians reached a dominance in the vertebrate world at this time which they never again equalled. All of the walking species had the widely-splayed legs that gave them a slow and lumbering gait, but, in the absence of more streamlined animals, they prospered. The group informally known as labyrinthodonts (from their characteristic labyrinth-ridged teeth) included some impressive animals almost as long as a man: perhaps the alligators of the time. Most of the fossils recovered are of wholly or partly aquatic amphibians, the sort that were easily preserved in the coal swamps that were characteristic of the Carboniferous non-marine environment. Other environments, particularly later in the Permian period, which was one of general ‘drying  out’, probably included species that were more truly terrestrial in their habits. But even during the Carboniferous the first true reptiles had evolved, and this was the group that was to make itself wholly independent of the water. The living amphibians have turned the limitations of the aqueous connection to advantage. Frogs have their origins in the Triassic (they are a relatively recent amphibian innovation, and highly specialized). Their tadpoles can exploit bodies of water not excessively populated with competitors, and some are adapted to very restricted niches. The adult frogs have a different diet (worms, flies, etc.), and the species therefore get ‘the best of both worlds’. Frogs throng in almost any site with high humidity and standing pools of water. The large amphibians of the Palaeozoic did not survive beyond the Permian, and so our inferences about their modes of life have to be made entirely from the bony fossils that survive. Palaeontologists recognize fossil Palaeozoic amphibians from their teeth, their flattened skulls and the arrangements of bones on the skulls. They are not generally common fossils, but there is always a chance of turning up a skeleton from the coal deposits, or finding a fossil frog (see Fig. 51) in the Mesozoic. REPTILES — CLASS REPTILIA The living reptiles are almost all predators, and the vast majority are also small, the only giants remaining being the crocodiles, alligators and caymans (and one or two big lizards). We tend to think of the reptiles as somehow past their ‘prime’, but it would be more accurate to say that they had been displaced from the top jobs in nature, while more than holding their own in the shop floor. The warmer the climate the more they are in evidence, because the living reptiles are ‘cold blooded’(without their own internal heat regulator) and they cannot successfully live in very cold climates. Living snakes and lizards are highly varied, and manage to live in some environments (e.g. dry deserts) where the mammals are pushed to survive. Most living reptiles and all of the primitive ones lay eggs, and this amniote egg, from which perfectly-formed baby reptiles hatch, marks the complete emancipation from the necessity of returning to water for reproduction. And a scaly skin solves the problem of drying out even in intense heat. Add to this the change in orientation of the legs in many reptiles, which can be used in an efficient running action, unlike the ungainly waddling of the amphibians and it will be apparent why the reptiles were better adapted to terrestrial life than the amphibians, and why they largely displaced them. This was far from instantaneous, and the Permian period saw both advanced amphibians and early reptiles living side by side. The reptiles were probably derived from an amphibious ancestor, probably early in the Carboniferous. Once established they underwent a number of evolutionary ‘bursts’ in which diverse kinds of reptiles occupied a variety of habitats, the most spectacular of which was the dinosaur radiation in the Mesozoic, to which we shall return later. by no means all of the large reptiles that are found in the Mesozoic rocks are dinosaurs — the reptile groups that took up life in the sea or the air were only distantly related. One of the most important steps for the complete colonization of the land was the evolution of herbivorous (plant-eating) reptiles, tapping a prolific and nourishing source of food that opened up a new dimension to the ‘food chain'. Larger and better herbivores meant larger and more ferocious carnivores to prey upon them, scavengers to clean up the mess, and a whole host of subordinate trades for other animals. The reptiles underwent tremendous changes in their skeletal structure, their jaws and their teeth during over their history of more than two hundred million years, some of the predators developing razor sharp rows of fangs, other herbivores losing their teeth and acquiring beak-like jaws. At some time in the Permo-Triassic one group of reptiles (‘mammal-like reptiles’) actually gave rise to the warm-blooded mammals, which were to lead a rather subordinate existence during the heyday of the dinosaurs. And the birds probably had their origin in a particular group of dinosaurs. So in a sense the reptile dominance is still with us, transmuted by time and evolution. The scenes of Jurassic or Cretaceous landscapes in picture books show dinosaurs swarming over the landscape, giving the impression that we know the whole story. The truth is that there are a few sites (especially in North America) where abundant remains of complete animals have been recovered, and from which a passable idea of the fauna of the Mesozoic can be obtained, but there are still great gaps in our knowledge, and many of the dinosaurs are known from a handful of individuals, or even a single specimen. There are doubtless still new kinds to discover   33 Trilobite,Calymene blumenbachii , Silurian Worcestershire, England. This trilobite is exceptionally well-preserved, retaining its original convexity and shell-material. A convex trilobite with the lobation of the middle part of the head distinctly defined. The thorax has thirteen segments. 8 cm long. 34 Giant trilobite,Paradoxides ‘spinosus’, Cambrian, Bohemia. This large trilobite is preserved in a black mudstone, slightly crushed. The swollen mid-part of the head expands forwards. There are many thoracic segments extended into spines, and a tiny tail. There are a number of Paradoxides species, which include some of the largest trilobites. This species is relatively small for the genus (15–20 cm); some species approach 60 cm in length. 35 Fossil rhagionid fly Chrysopilus sp., Oligocene. This insect is exquisitely preserved in amber. The amber was at one time polished to make a pendant with the fly as centre piece. This is a Baltic amber specimen from East Prussia. Living Chrysopilus live in marshy areas in Europe, their larvae growing up beneath the soil. The fossil is just over l cm in length. 36 Devonian trilobite,Phacops rana , Ontario, Canada. This species is beautifully preserved in limestone in full relief. With luck the amateur collector should be able to obtain specimens as splendid. A convex trilobite with eleven thoracic segments. The mid-part of the head is covered with coarse tubercles and expands forwards; the eyes include a few, very large lenses. Complete specimens are usually in the range 3–8 cm. 37 Sea scorpion (eurypterid)Eurypterus lacustris , Devonian. The sea scorpion is preserved on a fine siltstone, and is exceptionally complete. Fragments are more usual. The rather fat body, with distinct segmentation, and a long tail-spine are characteristic; the head region carries appendages of grasping aspect. This species is from Canada, but eurypterids occur on most continents. 38 Fossil horseshoe crab Mesolimulus ornatus , Jurassic, Solenhofen, Germany. The horseshoe crab is preserved on a flat-bedded limestone. Some of the original flexible material of the skeleton still remains. The king crabs have a nearly circular carapace, beneath which powerful legs helped the animal to swim and catch prey. Note the long pointed tail spine. This specimen is 8 cm long. Larger fossil examples are known. 39 Fossil crab,Palaeocarpilius aquilinus , Miocene, Libya. This perfect and nearly complete crab is exceptional. The white colour is because of the white limestone matrix. This beautiful crab has a wide carapace, with a few faint depressions on its upper surface, and a spiny margin. Powerful pincers are held close to the body, also equipped with a good ‘cutting’ edge. Carapace measures 6 cm across. 40 Fossil spider,Abliguritor niger , Oligocene. This spider is encased in amber. The colour of amber is related in part to its age — darker amber is usually older. The spider, less than 1 cm long, is perfectly preserved except for its soft parts. This fossil is known only from Baltic amber, the source of many famous fossil arthropods. 41 Fossil lobster,Thalassina anomala , Pleistocene, eastern Australia. The original shiny cuticle of the lobster is here preserved in a yellow, limy matrix. All the legs are attached, some partly concealed. This species has long thorny pincers with little upturned ‘fingers’ at the end. It also has the distinction of being the youngest fossil in this book. Length, about 12 cm. 42 Fossil millipede,Euphoberia ferox , Carboniferous. This fossil millipede is preserved inside a nodule of siltstone (part and counterpart of the specimen are shown). Each pair of legs, shows as white, hair-like lines on this specimen. This specimen is from the coalfield of Yorkshire, England. Similar species occur at Mazon Creek, Illinois, USA. Length 6 cm. 43 Spiny odontopleurid trilobite,Acidaspis coronata , Silurian, Worcestershire, England. This spiny little trilobite is preserved in a fine-grained hard limestone. Most of the original detail of the skeleton is still visible. Trilobites of Acidaspis type have thoracic segments extended into long spines, which also fringe the head and tail. Complete specimens are generally 2–3 cm long. 44 Fossil dragonfly,Cymatophlebia longialata , Jurassic, Solenhofen, Germany. The dragonfly is splendidly preserved on the flat bedding plane of a limestone. Much of the fine detail is preserved, especially on the wings. Dragonflies have stiff, long wings, with finely netted veining, long slender bodies, and large eyes, which are well seen on this fossil. Longest wing here has a length of 7 cm. 45 Fossil ant,Iridomyrmex geinitzi , Oligocene. Ants frequently got caught in the pine resins that were destined to become amber, and numerous fossil species have been recognized. This specimen is from Baltic amber. Living Iridomyrmex are found principally in Australia and South America, with a few species in India. Length about 4 mm. 46 Fossil lungfish,Dipterus valenciennesi , Devonian. The specimen is flattened, 18 cm long, but otherwise exceptionally complete on a bed of fine siltstone. It has a long body with overlapping scales, with a concentration of fins at the hind end. This specimen is from the Achanarras fish bed, Caithness, Scotland, a famous locality. 47 The armoured fish,Bothriolepis canadensis , Devonian, Quebec. The trunk of this armoured fish is preserved in a fine-grained siltstone. The original bony material is well-preserved. The 5 cm long trunk is composed of a few, very large plates which have a tuberculate ornament. In front there is a pair of powerful, flattened appendages which are hinged on the side of the body 48 Eocene bony fish,Pristigenys substriatus , Monte Bolca, Verona, Italy. This exquisite fish is preserved flattened on the bedding plane of a flaggy limestone. The original outline of the fish is clearly visible. This fish has a deep body, narrowly compressed from side to side, very large eyes, prominent fins on both the upper and lower surfaces of the body, and a manlike tail. From tail to mouth the fish measures 10 cm. These other groups of reptiles lived alongside the more spectacular dinosaurs during the Mesozoic: turtles, lizards and crocodiles The dinosaurs have dominated the popular conception of the fossil reptiles, sometimes to the extent of seeming almost synonymous with the word ‘fossil’! The group includes by far the largest of terrestrial animals ever to have lived (Brachiosaurus ), creatures to dwarf the largest bull elephants. The predators that preyed on the giants were even more spectacular, and by now the name of Tyrannosaurus is so well-known that it seems to be one of the first tongue-twisters mastered by small children. Of course there is little chance of an amateur collector acquiring an appreciable part of one of these great animals, but in the right site fragments of dinosaur skeletons may be picked up. The term ‘dinosaur’ includes a number of really rather separate groups of animals, with more or less independent evolutionary history during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. The real giants were the lumbering sauropods (Diplodocus, Brachiosaurus , etc.), four-legged dinosaurs, with enormously long necks only matched by equally long tails. The giant predators that walked on their hind legs (Tyrannosaurus, Allosaurus and other theropods) share structures of the hip bones with the sauropods that show they are more closely related to them than to the rest of the dinosaurs. These latter (Ornithischians) include some animals that walked on their hind legs like Tyrannosaurus , but with vegetarian habits (Iguanodon , the first dinosaur to be discovered); the group also includes various types of vegetarian armoured and plated dinosaurs, often shown in pitched battle with their carnivorous contemporaries. These well-protected dinosaurs each diversified into a number of genera; the three main groups are: the stegosaurs of the Jurassic, with paired plates along the back and a nastily spiked tail (Stegosaurus ); the ceratopsians, horned, rhinoceros-like dinosaurs of the Cretaceous, including the familiar Triceratops ; the spiky armoured ankylosaurs, tanks on stumpy legs. Specialized ornithischians in the late Cretaceous were the remarkable duck-billed dinosaurs, animals that lost their front teeth and had arrays of tiny grinding teeth at the back of the jaw that were continually replaced, like those of the shark, and must have been able to cope with tough vegetation. Some of the duck-billed forms  evolved crests and protuberances on top of their heads. All the dinosaurs, vegetarian and carnivore alike, became extinct at the end of the Cretaceous period (see p. 135). A whole range of other reptiles were present in the Jurassic and Cretaceous; none of them are dinosaurs. They include the products of the spread of the reptiles back into the aqueous environment from which their distant ancestors emerged, and, for the first time in the history of the vertebrates, the conquest of the air. The marine plesiosaurs , with their long flexible necks and sharp teeth, were formidable hunters of Mesozoic fish. The limbs were modified into efficient paddles, perfectly adapted for sculling through the water. Even more streamlined for marine life were the ichthyosaurs ('fish lizards'), which, as their name implies, include species that look remarkably fish-like, although perhaps the better analogy would be with the porpoises, a group of mammals that ‘returned to the sea’, and may fill a similar role in modern seas to that of the ichthyosaurs in the Jurassic. These marine reptiles have a higher chance of preservation than many of the terrestrial species, and their carcasses often seem to have sunk to the sea floor, so that some localities have yielded numerous complete specimens. The Liassic (Lower Jurassic) rocks of Europe furnished many of the magnificent specimens which are now on display in museums. Some of the ichthyosaurs include baby individuals within their skeletons which either implies cannabalistic habits, or, more probably, the ability to give birth to their young alive. Isolated vertebrae of marine reptiles (see Fig.50) are one of the reptilian fossils that are the easiest to collect. The pterosaurs, flying reptiles, also had their origins in the Triassic and became widespread and varied during the Jurassic and Cretaceous. Like the bats, the pterosaurs had membranous wings stretched between highly modified arms and ‘hands’ and the fore part of the legs; unlike the bats some of them grew to an enormous size and the front support for the wing was provided by only one finger of the hand, grotesquely extended. Most of them, and particularly the larger ones, combined slow, flapping flight with gliding, spending a large part of their lives effortlessly aloft. As in the case of the sauropod dinosaurs they seem to have got bigger and bigger during the Cretaceous — some of these later pterosaurs are supposed to have had wing spans exceeding lo metres, which would make them almost comparable to a man-made glider. Why this large size evolved is something of a mystery: it may have been that larger gliders cruise at slower speeds without ‘stalling’. Quite how these amazing animals landed and took off (if they did) can only be guessed at. Like the plesiosaurs and ichthyosaurs, they were successful and varied for a long time, but all three groups failed to survive the Cretaceous. Examples of the two major kinds of dinosaurs, showing the structure of the hip bones which distinguishes them. Above saurischian (Tyrannosaurus ), below, ornithischian (Scelidosaurus ) Other groups of reptiles were not exterminated at this time, even though their fossils may be found in rocks as old as those that yield dinosaurs and the other spectacular, extinct groups. Crocodiles and lizards have a fossil record extending back to the Triassic, snakes to the Cretaceous. The turtles and tortoises have almost as long a history as the crocodiles. The fused, bony plates that protect their soft parts make  them well-nigh invulnerable. All the long survivors show every sign of flourishing today: one might suppose that the tortoise will continue its lumbering progress no matter what catastrophes may come to pass in the future. MAMMALS — CLASS MAMMALIA Mammals animals with mammary glands that suckle their young — were certainly present during the Triassic, and were a continuous if subordinate component of fossil faunas throughout the acme of the dinosaurs. It was only after the demise of the ruling reptiles that the class had the opportunity to capitalize on the evolutionary advantages which propelled them to the dominance they have enjoyed ever since. Many of the early mammals were probably insect eaters, as are many of the primitive representatives of the group today. Small mammals were present in the Triassic — shrew-like animals with long noses, and probably insatiable appetites for smaller items of the fauna. We can imagine animals like these darting through the undergrowth in search of food while the colossal reptiles lumbered obliviously around them. It would be wrong to suppose that there was no evolutionary activity among these early mammals: in fact there were considerable changes, which by the late Cretaceous had established early members of several of the principal groups of mammals which dominate the terrestrial world today. The marsupial (pouched) and placental (womb-bearing) mammals had separated, and lived side by side. Many of the early mammalian remains are fossil teeth. More than those of any other vertebrate group, the teeth of mammals have changed in distinctive ways, and the different types of mammals can be reliably identified from a study of their dentition alone. This is particularly fortunate, because teeth have a high fossilization potential, exceeding that of other parts of the skeleton. The sediments filling caves or fissures in limestone are frequently repositories for fossil teeth. Sampling for mammal fossils often involves the patient sieving of great quantities of sediment to extract the fossil teeth. If you are very lucky you might find a whole jaw (see p. 100). Mammal jaws often have specialized teeth for particular jobs — nipping, chewing, biting, gnawing teeth and so on— which function in perfect cooperation between the upper and lower jaws. Mammal teeth often have distinctive patterns of crests or bumps (cusps ) that serve to identify large groups within the mammals. Teeth for grinding vegetation are often large and ridged, while the rodents have their fast-growing gnawing teeth at the front of the jaw. The most specialized dental structures of all are probably the baleen plates of the largest whales, modified for straining plankton from sea water. The evolution of mammals after the Cretaceous was both extremely rapid and very complex, and we can do no more than give the roughest sketch here. Compared with what was happening in contemporary marine invertebrates, the visible changes in mammalian skeletons during the early part of the Tertiary were fast and dramatic; it did not take long before the roles of larger herbivores and carnivores were filled by mammalian animals. By the end of the Palaeocene, only a few million years from the Cretaceous extinction of the giant reptiles, there were representatives of many of the living mammalian orders, including, for example, the primates (the order to which man belongs), the carnivores (cats dogs, and most living predators) and the rodents (rats, mice). The history of the mammals in the Tertiary involved not only this one major diversification, but several, with major extinctions between, so that the largest mammals of the earlier parts of the Tertiary are not related to the large mammals of the Recent. The roots of our present European fauna extend back to the Miocene. The whole story is complicated by the fact that this was also the time of break-up of the supercontinent Pangaea. Mammalian faunas on isolated continental fragments could evolve, at least for a time, separately from faunas in other parts of the world, producing a whole series of peculiar animals that have no direct relationships to animals with a similar mode of life elsewhere. The obvious example is Australia, which was separated early, and in which the marsupial mammals had the opportunity to adapt to a whole range of ecological niches, which they managed with remarkable success in spite of a low cranial capacity and a primitive mode of reproduction. Some of the largest marsupials (Diprotodon ) seem to have survived to a time tantalisingly close to the present. Similarly, in South America a whole range of peculiar mammals evolved largely in isolation, including giant sloths, specialized grazing species, and the extraordinary glyptodonts (see p. 100). A lot of argument among mammalian palaeontologists  seems to centre on how and when links between North America, Europe and Asia existed, resulting in interchange and invasions of animals between the two regions. It is clear that some groups of animals, like the proboscideans (elephants and allies), are much reduced now compared with the late Tertiary, both in variety and geographic distribution. A late stimulus for the evolution of distinctive mammals was the Pleistocene Ice Age, although a variety also became extinct at this time. A number of species, adapted to the widespread cold conditions, roamed widely around the northern hemisphere, including woolly mammoths and rhinoceros, and extinct species of tigers. On the other hand interglacial periods were very much warmer than conditions in temperate latitudes today, and these climatic fluctuations resulted in periods when hippopotamus and tropical rhinoceros thrived in the areas occupied by Europe's capital cities today. With the final retreat of the ice many of the cold climate specialists perished (possibly with the help of man), although some of the species that accompany them, like lemmings or musk ox, survive today in the harsh conditions of the arctic tundra. BIRDS — CLASS AVES Fossil birds are distinctly rare, and to find a well-preserved and complete example is a palaeontological event. The evolution of flight led to generally light and fragile skeletons, and it is perhaps not surprising that avian fossils are so uncommon, and when found, so often fragmentary. The derivation of the birds from a reptilian (possibly dinosaur) ancestor is certain, and because the earliest fossil bird,Archaeopteryx , is Jurassic in age, it is usually assumed that the split from the reptiles occurred in the earlier part of the period. Unfortunately, there is much that is not understood about the history of the birds between Archaeopteryx (see p. 101) and the good assemblages of fossil birds undoubtedly related to living species in the   Eocene and Miocene. Cretaceous birds are generally scarce, and some of the ‘toothed’ birds that are known, like the flightless, aquatic Hesperornis , seem to be difficult to relate to any of the living species. It is probable that like the mammals the roots of the great variety of living birds are to be found in the Cretaceous, but fossils, which could document this, are only now slowly coming to light. Right The Berlin skeleton of the early bird,Archaeopteryx  Left Some of the specialized mammals which evolved in isolation in South America: top Glyptodon ; middle,Toxodon ; bottom,Megatherium  Below Lower jaw of Pleistocene bear showing typical mammalian specialization of teeth: sharp canines, chewing teeth at the rear FOSSIL PLANTS The fossils of plants are some of the most attractive that the amateur collector is likely to find. Those plants that concern us here were terrestrial or lived in bogs, rivers or lakes. Like animals that dwelt on land, the terrestrial flora also arose from ancestors that lived in the seas, a change that is known to have happened before the end of the Silurian. However, marine algae were very important in the early history of the evolution of the earth, and they are described in some detail in Chapters 7 and 8. They are not generally conspicuous fossils in the field. A few algae, however, produced hard calcareous skeletons, and were abundant enough to produce small gardens beneath the sea. Such calcareous algae (see Plate 52) have a long history, extending back into the Precambrian, and they are still numerous today. They were often components of reefs, and in some environments it is the algae that bear the full brunt of the attack by the breakers on the exposed, seaward side of the reef. They are also important rock builders; in northerly latitudes today limestones are being formed from the skeletal debris of such calcareous algae as Lithothamnion . The first land plants must have been derived from a marine alga. We have to visualize this as a very gradual process, the early transitional plants perhaps creeping across mud flats, or partially submerged. The change involved the production of a protective ‘skin’ to ensure that water loss to the atmosphere was not excessive, and the stems had to acquire sufficient rigidity to stand up without the support of surrounding water, but also the cellular structure had to allow the passage of nutrients to the growing shoots (ultimately, a vascular system). The evolution of such a plant could not have been achieved at a single stroke. Reproduction in these early plants was by means of minute spores. Quite a variety of Silurian plants are now known, and by the end of the Devonian it is apparent that most of the problems of terrestrial living had been solved, to the extent that large tree ‘ferns’ of the time would have had dimensions comparable with forest trees today. The fossil record of plants is not good enough simply to ‘read out’ the story of their evolution by collecting from successively younger, non-marine rock formations. Some of the earliest plants do not appear to be the most primitive, and vice versa . True, there is a general drift through time towards more complex plants, more perfectly adapted to life away from water, but primitive species have persisted alongside the innovations. The fossil record is full of curious plants that do not fit comfortably into classifications — this is one of the things that makes the study of fossil plants so fascinating. Consequently there are arguments among botanists about the relationships of many plants, living and fossil, and some classifications have quite large categories containing only a few plants, which may be rare. Not all of the major groups will be described here, but only those that are likely to be found by the non-specialist collector. Some important groups, like the mosses and liverworts, have a sporadic fossil record extending back to the Carboniferous, but they are not likely to be encountered without a special search. Plant fossils are often to be found in particular beds, reflecting conditions of deposition that were just right for their preservation. Of course, the rocks that contain abundant plant remains are mostly those which were deposited in freshwater lakes, or on deltas, or the fossilized remains of peat beds. There were probably plants living in hilly regions from quite early which have left little fossil record, and this may account for some of the gaps in the preserved fossils. Many fossil plants are now more or less black, carbonized (‘coalified’) compressions. In some cases, however, the fine structure, even down to individual cells, is splendidly preserved, and these are the most important specimens from a scientific point of view. The problems of associating the different organs of the same fossil plant species were mentioned earlier in this book (p. 23).. Right Seed fern,Trigonocarpus parkinsoni , Carboniferous. These fossil seeds are preserved in a relatively coarse-grained sandstone. Although they are uncrushed, only parts of the original seed covering remain — so that they are largely internal moulds. They are the seeds produced by the fern-like plants such as Mariopteris , but because they are difficult to link with their foliage they have been given separate names. The three raised ridges on their surface are typical. Seeds of similar type have been found associated with a number of the Carboniferous seed-fern leaves. They are from Ayrshire, Scotland; length, 2 cm EARLY LAND PLANTS — DIVISION PSILOPHYTA The earliest land plants, to be found in Silurian and Devonian rocks, had simple shoots that arose from a creeping ‘axis’, which were little different in structure from the shoots themselves. Leaves, if they were  present at all, were humble scales or spine-like projections. The upright twigs often branched in a simple way, forking into two, and then into two again, and sometimes terminating in little capsules that carried the spores. The plants are often preserved as dark markings on shales, and were less than half a metre in length. The best-preserved examples, from which their cellular construction has been described, are from the Devonian Rhynie Chert (p. 17). FERNS — DIVISION PTEROPHYTA (Colour plate 60) Right Some of the commoner types of fern-like foliage from the Carboniferous Such foliage often belongs to the seed ferns, rather than the true ferns The feathery and delicate fronds of the ferns make them among the most beautiful of the foliage plants, and they attract a fanatical group of devotees dedicated to growing exotic species in inhospitable cities. They are also a very ancient group, with many Carboniferous representatives and a number of preferns in the Devonian as well(plate 59). Then as now they are generally preferred humid environments in which to live. They reproduce by means of minute spores, which form in clusters on the undersides of the fronds, or sometimes on specially modified fronds. To be really sure that one is dealing with a fossil fern it should be possible to see the spore cases, because other kinds of plants can produce fern-like foliage. In practice, many of the fossil fronds that one finds are sterile, and for these there a number of form genera , units of classification based on the shape of the fronds alone (see p. 23). Although many ferns are low herbaceous plants, they have periodically attained the dimensions of trees; forests of such tree ferns exist today in humid regions, for example in New Zealand. Large ferns were present as early as the Upper Devonian and different genera as large or larger were significant components of forests during the Carboniferous to Cenozoic. In these cases one never finds a whole tree fossilized, and it is necessary to piece together the whole plant by making intelligent guesses about whether a frond of one kind is persistently found with a particular fossil trunk. SEED FERNS — DIVISION PTERIDOSPERMOPHYTA (Colour plate 57) Many of the fern-like fronds that can be found in Carboniferous rocks belong to an extinct group of plants sharing a common ancestor with the ferns, but distinct enough to be regarded as entirely separate. These seed ferns had much-enlarged female reproductive bodies — forming true seeds which were fertilized by pollen born on separate organs. Some of the seeds hung like bells from the ends of the ferny frond, and in some species they were several centimetres long. The plants were generally bushy shrubs, but some may have been climbers, and others robust enough to form small trees. A lot of the species belonging to the commonest of the Carboniferous and   Permian ‘leaf genera’— like Neuropteris, Alethopteris and Mariopteris were seed ferns of this kind (rather than true ferns), but associations of seeds with foliage are extremely rare. The seeds themselves (see p. 103) can be locally common. Although they are commonest in rocks of the Late Palaeozoic, some Mesozoic plants have been regarded as a later branch of the seed ferns. Fossil fern,Onychiopsis mantelli , Cretaceous. This delicate fern is preserved in a very fine-grained sandstone, which fractures rather irregularly. Slender and delicate branching patterns with many fine subdivisions are characteristic of this kind of fern. There are a few similar species, known rarely from rocks of Cretaceous and Tertiary age, distinguished on the branching patterns of the fronds. This specimen is from Sussex, England. Related forms occur in North America. The total length of the frond is 12 cm, but it was originally part of a much larger plant LYCOPODS — DIVISION LYCOPHYTA (Colour plates 53, 54, 56) Many of the great trees of the Carboniferous were lycopods, the trunks of which contributed largely to the formation of coal. This large and important group of plants is represented today by a mere four genera of humble herbaceous plants —Lycopodium, Selaginella, Isoetes and Phylloglossum — living fossils which have survived with little change from the Mesozoic or even the Carboniferous. The lycopods have long, narrow leaves like little straps, each of which leaves a characteristic scar on the stem at its point of attachment. The plants reproduced by means of spores, which were born in cones; the spores were often of two kinds — large (female) megaspores up to 2 mm in diameter and much smaller (male) microspores. The study of the spores of these plants is important in correlating rocks of late Palaeozoic age. The large trees had extensive roots, which grew nearly horizontally through the soil, repeatedly forking, and often bearing long rootlets. Fossil roots (Fig. 5 6) are quite common, and may be preserved even when the trunks are not. The distinctive patterns formed by leaf scars are visible on fossils of the bark, which is often found in coal and in the deposits overlying ones containing roots. Lepidodendron has many spiral rows of lozenge-shaped leaf scars, while Sigillaria has long rows of elliptical scars; both are very common fossils in association with coal measures. Cones are much rarer; these are about the size and shape of an asparagus spear, with rows of cavities, which contained spores, so that if they are flattened they can appear almost segmented in the manner of an arthropod fossil. Some of the best specimens of trunks were preserved cell by cell in silica, and these show even the finest details if they are cut and polished. The lycopods can be found in Devonian or even Silurian rocks, but they are generally uncommon in rocks younger than Permian, and all the tree species apparently disappeared before the end of the Palaeozoic. HORSETAILS —DIVISION ARTHROPHYTA (Colour plate 58) On any walk through a bog or fen one can see the delicate shoots of the horsetails, looking almost like miniature fir trees, sometimes clustering into dense masses. If one plucks a piece from one of these plants it will almost certainly break along one of the numerous joints that divide the whole plant into segments, right to the tips of the branchlets. These joints give the arthrophytes (‘jointed plants’) their scientific name, and the little whorls of tiny branches produce the bushy appearance which accounts for their popular one. There is only one living genus of horsetails —Equisetum — although its many species are very widespread. The group were formerly varied and numerous, and even included trees perhaps 20 metres in height. The horsetails reproduce by means of spores, which are born in small cone-like structures at the tip of the branches or on modified shoots. They are among the easiest of fossil plants to recognize, for even flattened stems retain the characteristic jointing, and the feathery distal branches cannot be mistaken for anything else. The flattened whorls are particularly easy to recognize, and are frequently encountered in the soft, dark shales associated with coal seams. As with so many of the primitive plants the arthrophytes had their heyday in the Carboniferous after a probable origin in the Devonian. Because they are common in aquatic environments they have a rather good fossil record, and are not uncommon in freshwater sediments of Jurassic and Cretaceous age. It is a mystery why only one genus of this formerly diverse group should have had the capacity to survive to the present day. CYCAD-LIKE PLANTS In the forests of the Mesozoic there were large numbers of trees and shrubby plants that looked at first glance like palm trees, with leafless stems crowned with bouquets of stiff, large leaves, deeply divided into long, unbranched leaflets. These were cycads and bennettites. A small number of cycad genera survive in the tropical and subtropical regions today, but they are much less conspicuous today than they were 120 million years ago. The resemblance to palms is no indication of their true relationships, because the cycad-like plants were not true flowering plants like palms. They do, however, have a most extraordinary fructification, a large knob arising from  the centre of the crown, looking something like a corncob, and bearing numerous, very large seeds. Nowadays botanists divide the cycad-like plants into two major groups which may not be particularly closely related: the Cycadales, which include the living species, and the Bennettitales, an important Mesozoic group of plants which have smaller fructifications scattered among the bases of the leaves. Marie Stopes, who later became a famous pioneer of birth control started life as a palaeobotanist interested in the cycads. Some specimens of the trunks of bennettites (see p 107) are among the most spectacular of fossils, and they even attracted the attention of the Etruscans, who included them among their sacred relics more than four thousand years ago! The amateur collector is most likely to come across the cycad foliage, with its characteristic narrow central rib and flat leaflets. Their fossils are commonest in Triassic, Jurassic and Cretaceous rocks. Reconstruction of a Carboniferous coal swamp, showing large lycopod and cordaite trees, an amphibian, giant dragonfly and millipede CONIFERS — DIVISION CONIFEROPHYTA The conifers are as varied and successful a group of plants today as they have ever  been. But again they are an ancient group with ancestors back in the Carboniferous forest, a melting pot for plant evolution. Botanists are not fully in accord about how many separate groups of plants there are within the conifers, and they are all lumped together here. The fir cones of modern species will be familiar to the reader, often littering forests in their thousands, and containing seeds, which may be equipped with wings. The close, needle foliage of most modern conifers, which seems as much immune to desert heat as arctic cold, was probably derived from lusher leaves in the later Palaeozoic. In the Carboniferous swamps large trees with leaves, of the genus Cordaites grew to 30 or more metres in height, with long slim trunks terminating in branches that bore strap-shaped leaves up to a metre in length. The cordaite ‘cone’ was a longer and more complex structure than that of any living conifer. The leaves of this tree are rather common fossils, striped with longitudinal veins that give it a superficial resemblance to the leaf of an iris. Most of the steps leading to the modern conifers   seem to have taken place by the end of the Palaeozoic; no other group of organisms of such antiquity has retained such an unbroken hold over vast areas of the earth as the conifers. Some primitive conifers, like the monkey-puzzle tree Araucaria, have survived with little change since the Triassic. Large trunk of a bennettite Cycadeoidea , Cretaceous, USA. These conspicuous fossils are often over half a metre across. Left Varied shapes of leaves of fossil ginkgos, typically Mesozoic, with photograph of fossil example, natural size (below ). Right Frond of a cycad,Nilssonia kendalli , Jurassic. The fossil is preserved on the surface of a fine-grained siltstone. There are many other fragments of plants in the same block, but the frond is unusually complete. Cycad leaves have characteristic flattened leaflets arranged in rows on a very slender axis. There are a number of species of Nilssonia from the Jurassic distinguished on the form of the leaflets. Related genera include many species with a wide distribution, and there are living representatives occurring in tropical regions today. This specimen is from the famous plant beds of Yorkshire, England. Other well-known bennettite localities are the Black Hills of Dakota and from Maryland, USA. The frond has a length of 15 cm. The long-leafed plant Glossopteris (Plate 55) is something of a botanical puzzle, but probably belongs within this broad group. It is common in later Palaeozoic rocks of South Africa, peninsular India, Australia and South America, and is thought to have lived almost exclusively in the cooler areas of the supercontinent Pangaea (p. 32). The ginkgos are often placed in a separate group. They are represented today only by the maidenhair tree Ginkgo biloba , one of the obligatory ‘living fossils’ to be found in every botanical garden, and many parks in inner cities. Ginkgo leaves are particularly beautiful, perfect fans with splayed veins, and specimens of this general type are found in many localities from rocks of Triassic age onwards (see p. 108). The Mesozoic ginkgos were a varied and numerous group of plants, but unlike the spruces and pines they slowly declined in variety throughout the Tertiary. FLOWERING PLANTS — DIVISION ANTHOPHYTA (Colour plates 61 64) The flowering plants dominate the floral world today, except perhaps in the lonely spruce stands of the Arctic. They are the broad-leaved trees, the grasses, and myriads of tiny creeping plants, as well as the showy flowers which attract man and pollinating insects (p. 91) alike. Their diversity is truly extraordinary: in tropical forests there are hundreds of species of trees alone. Yet a good deal of this diversification probably happened in the last 70 million years, during the Tertiary. However, like the mammals and the birds, the flowering plants certainly originated, and probably did much of their evolutionary groundwork, during the Mesozoic and especially the Cretaceous. The details of their origins are still not clear. For one thing, flowers do not readily fossilize — and leaves alone can be misleading. The flowering plants (angiosperms) appear almost ready-made in the Cretaceous, and many of these fossils can even be placed into living genera. There is still much to discover of their even earlier history, and we hope that the crucial steps did not all take place in some site where fossils have little chance of preservation. Whatever their early history, fossils of flowering plants — leaves, seeds and wood — are common in rocks of Tertiary age. They do not even have to be rocks deposited under fresh water conditions, because wood and seeds are perfectly capable of drifting long distances before becoming waterlogged enough to sink to the bottom of the sea. Leaves, however, tend to be preserved in the deposits laid down in lakes and the like. Where the sediments are fine-grained the leaves form fossils of exquisite beauty, preserving even the finest veins, which can be directly compared with the leaves of their living relatives. Another mode of preservation of Tertiary plants is beneath flows of lava (Oregon and the island of Skye, for example) where whole floras can be preserved in enough detail to reconstruct the detailed botanical ecology of the time. Fossil plants are of great use in plotting the many shifts of climate that happened during the Tertiary: a humid-tropical flora may be found in what is now an arid region, or a warm-climate flora may be found in an area that is now decidedly cool. This makes the assumption, of course, that the plants have not changed their habits since they were fossilized. During the dramatic climatic fluctuations of the last ice age — warm to cold to warm repeated several times — the flowering plants acted as thermometers for the climate, sensitive recorders of the shifts that affected everything from beetles to man. Oligocene sumac tree,Rhus stellariaefolia . These leaves are beautifully preserved in a flat-bedded and very highly fissile shale, laid down at the bottom of a fresh water lake. Long, graceful leaves are divided into about twelve spindle-shaped leaflets with undivided margins, and a terminal leaflet. Each leaflet carries a prominent vein in the middle. A few other fossil species of Rhus are known from the Tertiary rocks. Living sumacs are familiar in temperate regions, their leaves turning a beautiful dark red late in the year. The specimen shown here is from the renowned Florissant beds of Colorado, USA. Other fossil Rhus have been recovered from Eocene rocks in Colorado, Utah and California. The longest leaf here is 12 cm long."
ACA ACA-AMM-002 0.51 "BRINGING FOSSILS BACK TO LIFE In this chapter some of the ways in which palaeontologists determine the way fossil animals lived are described, reanimating the dead fragments to build up a living creature. Since popular ideas of life in the past are often founded on vividly coloured reconstructions of ‘The World in the Jurassic Period’ and the like, it is important to remember that these imaginative scenes are all inferences from bones, and similar fragments. In fact there is nothing fixed about such interpretations, because the way the fossils are understood may change over the years, but it is usually some time before new discoveries percolate into the popular presentations. Even the most solid-looking dinosaurs may have changed their habits in the last few years! Many different lines of evidence may be used to flesh out the bare bones of the fossils. The first of these is the evidence of the rocks from which the remains were recovered. The sediments themselves reveal much about the environment of deposition, as was shown in Chapter 3. It is important to establish whether the fossil animal actually lived in the environment which furnished its sedimentary cover, or whether its remains were swept in from some other place. Fortunately it is usually easy to spot such intruders. The type of sediment and the associated fossils will show whether the environment was marine, freshwater or terrestrial, providing the basic information into which the ecology of the animal has to be accommodated. The sediments themselves may have preserved some of the tracks left by the animal (p. 20) to give direct evidence of its past activities. From the tracks alone it is possible to be certain of the bipedal stance of certain dinosaurs, and to measure their stride. The character of the rocks, and their setting in the past geography at the time when they accumulated, diagnoses the climatic setting in which the extinct fauna lived, and climate imposes certain restraints on possible modes of life. Savannah animals differ from those of tropical rain forests, and these again from inhabitants of the tundra at high latitudes. Looking at the fossil animal itself, the first necessity is to reconstruct it as accurately as possible from its fragmentary remains. Sometimes this is a very complex business, particularly for vertebrates with numbers of small bones. To proceed from the reconstruction to an assessment of probable life habits two different but complementary approaches are used. One method attempts to compare the structures of teeth or limbs or some other feature of the extinct animal with living analogues . These do not have to be biologically related organisms. The basic argument is that structures that are closely similar were probably adapted to a similar function. Sometimes these similarities are quite obvious: the ferocious teeth of a predatory dinosaur are a sure indication of hunting habits, with hardly a glance at the fangs of living mammalian carnivores. But the structure and functioning of grinding or chewing teeth in other mammals, in which opposing teeth co-operate in action, and which can be matched in extinct, unrelated mammals, is a much more subtle matter, involving detailed studies on the operation of living dental systems to help elucidate the functioning of fossil ones. The technique of ‘hunt the analogue’ is a favourite one practised by palaeontologists, but it is certainly not a foolproof one, because there are many fossil animals that defy comparison with living organisms, and some analogues do  not stand up to detailed scrutiny. The second method tries to analyse the structure of the fossil almost as if it were a piece of engineering. If the fossil is constructed in a certain way, then there are only a limited number of ‘jobs’ that the structure could perform. The idea here is to decide which of the possibilities is the most likely one. This assumes that nature only manufactures efficient designs. For the most part this is a reasonable assumption to make. Most animals today do seem to have bodies that accord well with the functions they have to carry out to survive: flyers are aerodynamically efficient, active swimmers have suitable streamlining, herbivorous mammals have teeth appropriate for grinding plant food, and so on. Ideally one could construct a model of the fossil to test out these various functions in experiments, but the number of examples where the analysis has been pursued this far are limited. Of course it can never be known whether the right answer has been reached (unless somebody dredges up a ‘living fossil’ from the depths of the ocean)— there are only varying degrees of probability. But the best answers are probably obtained where the functional design of the fossil points to the same life habits as a living analogue, and where both are consistent with the geological circumstances in which the fossil remains occur. SWIMMING TRILOBITES There are thousands of different kinds of trilobites. All of them were marine and all of them are extinct. Since many kinds of trilobites co-existed at any one time they were probably occupying different ecological niches, behaving in different ways, corresponding with the wide variation in shape that they show. We can use the methods described above to elucidate some of these occupations, and get a glimpse, albeit an imperfect one, of the trilobite as it lived. I will take an example where all the methods can be used, and where all point in the same direction, so that the answer is probably correct. Most trilobites were broadly oval-shaped being rather longer than wide, not greatly convex, and with eyes that occupy perhaps a quarter of the length of the head. There are a few trilobite species, however, with enormous, globular eyes (see below). By examining the way these animals were put together it is possible to suggest a likely mode of life. Giant-eyed Ordovician trilobite, seen from the top and side. Twice its natural size. Enlargement shows a section through the lenses to show the direction of the field of view. We can take the eyes first. The trilobite eye was of a compound type, and each lens was made up of a calcite crystal. From the optical properties of this mineral we know that the lens was able to interpret light coming from a direction more or less at right-angles to the lens surface. So we can deduce what the field of vision of our globular-eyed trilobite was, by looking at the directions in which all the lenses face. It turns out that our animal was able to see in almost every direction — upwards, downwards, sideways and forwards, and even backwards, because the eyes bulged out beyond the line of the rest of the body. Most other trilobites have a predominantly lateral field of view. If the animal lived on the sea bottom, it seems unlikely that it would have eye lenses specialized for looking downwards , and we begin to suspect that the animal habitually dwelt above the sea floor. Other features of its shape are consistent with this. At the   edge of the eyes are a pair of long spines, and these point downwards at a steep angle, at very awkward attitude for resting comfortably on the sea floor. Most ‘normal’ trilobites have a more or less horizontal rim around the forward margin, which may have rested on the sediment surface. The thorax of the large-eyed trilobite is remarkably long compared with the average trilobite (compare Fig. 33). The convex, middle part of the thorax contained the musculature that operated the appendages (which, as usual, are not preserved), and the relatively large volume of this region shows that the musculature was powerful. The construction of this giant-eyed trilobite suggests that it lived an actively swimming life well above the bottom, and possibly in the surface waters of the sea. Of course because there are no living trilobites we cannot find direct confirmation of this hypothesis, but we can look for other arthropods that have the same modifications of the eyes, for example, in the present day oceans. The analogy is found in such ocean-going amphipods (a kind of ‘shrimp’) as Cystosoma , which also has enormously expanded eyes, looking like headlamps, compared with its bottom-dwelling relatives (see above). In fact many of the arthropods that inhabit the water column have large, globular eyes of this kind. 49 Fossil bony fish,Lates gracilis , Eocene. This fish is preserved in a fine-grained limestone which preserved most of the skeletal details of the fish (but not its colours). This is a stout-bodied fish, something like a perch in general proportions, with long, low fins on upper and lower rear of the body (fin rays finely divide near their ends). Head to tail the fish measures 17 cm. 50 Vertebra of the Jurassic pliosaur,Liopleurodon species, Kimmeridge, southern England. This is only one vertebra of an animal much too bulky to appear in a book of this size! The original porous bone has been consolidated to become much heavier than it would have been in life. Diameter of the vertebra is about 10 cm. 51 Fossil frog,Rana species, Miocene, Spain. This species is preserved in a soft shale, but one which allows for the skeletal anatomy to be preserved in its entirety. The outline of the soft parts are also clearly displayed, so that the animal has been preserved almost in frozen motion. Frogs are one of the more numerous of amphibian fossils. Specimen 12 cm long. 52 Fossil calcareous alga, belonging to the genus Coelosphaeridium , Ordovician, Ringsaker, Norway. These spherical algae are preserved as internal moulds in a mudstone, the original calcite having disappeared. Canals within the algae stand out as rods in this kind of preservation, which is common in Ordovician rocks. There is a central sphere visible on one of the specimens. Related forms are spread over much of the world in Ordovician and Silurian times. Individual globes have a diameter of 1½–2 cm. 53 Fossil lycopod bark,Lepidodendron rimosum , Carboniferous, Newcastle, England. This is a typical ‘coal shale’; shales and silts occurring between productive coal seams often contain impressions of the plants that went to form the coal. The plant material itself is converted to black carbon. This fossil bark is typified by its lozenge-shaped leaf scars arranged in spiral rows. This fragment is 1O cm long. 54 Fossil bark of the lycopod tree,Sigillaria laevigata , Carboniferous. This specimen lies on a slab of mudstone, the specimen itself having been converted into coal-like material — that is, into carbon. Sigillaria bark is covered with little horseshoe-shaped scars (leaf cushions). It is found in North America (Canada and the US), England, Belgium, France, Germany and Russia. This piece is 9 cm long. 55 Leaves of the enigmatic plant,Glossopteris linearis , Permian. Many of these long leaves are preserved on the bedding planes of a siltstone. Glossopteris is characterized by its long strap-shaped leaves, which have a conspicuous midrib, with many fine, smaller veins branching off it to form a network. Its classification in relation to other plants is still unsolved. These leaves have a length of 7–8 cm. 56 Fossil root,Stigmaria ficoides , Carboniferous. This root is preserved as an internal mould, in a tough sandstone. It has been slightly crushed. The infilling sandstone is derived from the fossil soil over which the root was growing. Stigmaria is the name given to roots of the giant lycopod Lepidodendron (this page). This specimen is 15 cm long, but roots have been found which attain a length of 14 metres! 57 Leaf of a Carboniferous seedfern,Mariopteris muricata , Staffordshire, England. The specimen is preserved in a hard claystone nodule, which preserved the leaflets in relief. This is quite a common preservation in coal measures. Microscopical details are not so well-preserved, and the fossil is, of course, only a fragment of a larger plant. The leaflets are attached to the axis along their entire base. 6 cm long. 58 Fossil horsetail,Annularia sphenophylloides , Carboniferous. This specimen is preserved as a carbonaceous compression on a very fine-grained and well-bedded sandstone, a preservation common in Carboniferous rocks. The little circlets of flat ‘leaves’ born at regular intervals on the jointed stems serve to distinguish this plant from others in the Carboniferous coal-shales. 8 cm long. 59 A ‘prefern’,Archaeopteris hibernica , Devonian, Kilkenny, Ireland. A fern-like plant, beautifully preserved in a yellow sandstone. The original material of the axis shows up black against the background of the rock. The large frond carries many branches, on which there are numbers of leaf-like pinnules — more or less alternating on either side of the branch. The specimen is 25 cm long. 60 Fossil fern,Sphenopteris laurenti , Carboniferous, Derbyshire, England. The frond of this fossil fern is preserved as a compression on the surface of a fine-grained, mica-rich siltstone. Some of the original fine detail on the leaflets is preserved. Reproductive structures should really be found to distinguish it from other, superficially fern-like plants. This frond is 9 cm long. 61 Fossil poplar leaf,Populus latior , Miocene. The leaf is excellently preserved on the flat bedding-plane of a limestone laid down under fresh water. Poplar leaves have an elegant outline resembling that of an arab minaret. This species has a finely toothed margin; a large, wide leaf born on a long stem. This type of tree has a history extending back to the upper Cretaceous. Length of leaf is 18 cm. 62 Miocene maple seeds,Acer trilobatum . Seeds of the maple family are typically in pairs, joined at the base, with flat ‘wings’ that help the seeds to disperse. Seeds of Acer are rare compared with the leaves, which can be found in rocks dating back to the Cretaceous period. This is from the Oeningen, Switzerland. Seeds are about 3 cm long. 63 Miocene maple leaf,Acer trilobatum . This leaf is exquisitely preserved in a fine-grained, flat-bedded marly limestone. Although much of the fine detail can be seen most of the tissue of the leaf is destroyed. The leaf is divided into three parts with a broad central lobe (finely toothed) and two flanking lobes. Simple, distinct veining can also be seen. The leaf is 10 cm long. 64 Fossil flower,Porana oeningensis , Miocene. These beautifully preserved flowers are from the Oeningen deposits like the maple leaf and seeds illustrated here. Fossil flowers are extremely rare because of their delicacy and because they are shortlived. These flowers have five oval petals, finely veined. No details of the stamens are present in the fossil state. Diameter of the flowers is about 2 cm. Giant-eyed living crustacean (Cystosoma ) If it is correct that our trilobite lived above the sea bottom, actively swimming in the water, there are certain predictions we can make about its geological occurrence which can be tested by looking in the rocks. Most bottom-dwelling trilobites preferred to live at a particular water depth, or on a particular type of sea bottom (mud, sand or lime). No such restriction should apply to our large-eyed species; it should be found with all other different kinds of trilobite assemblages without preference. This has been proved in several places: in some arctic localities it is found with trilobites that lived at great depths in the muds of the Ordovician ocean, while in Canada the same species occurs mixed with the inhabitants of the shallow-water seas, where limestones were accumulating. By the same token the free-swimming trilobite may be expected to have a very wide geographical distribution, for oceans would be no barrier to it. And again this proves to be the case: our example is found in Arctic Canada, in the high Arctic  island of Spitsbergen, thousands of miles away in what is now the desert country of Nevada and Utah in the United States, in western Ireland, in Russia, and in northwestern Australia. So in this case the different sources of evidence all point in the same direction, whether derived from a detailed consideration of the way the trilobite is constructed, or by analogy with living animals with similar adaptations, or from the evidence of the rocks or the distribution of the fossils. These giant-eyed trilobites of the Ordovician were active swimmers in the surface waters, as near certainly as we can ever know. There are all kinds of different questions we can ask about the life habits of these trilobites, which are not subject to the same kind of careful scrutiny. What did they eat, for example? Because we do not have the legs preserved, it is not possible to see how the mouth appendages functioned in feeding, and neither are the stomach contents preserved. So here there are only more or less likely speculations. Active swimmers in the surface waters of the present oceans are likely to feed directly on the plankton, and the trilobites may have had a method of harvesting large quantities of minute food. Or they may have been hunters after larger prey, in which case when appendages are eventually discovered they may prove to have adaptations for grasping and manipulating larger food. Puzzles remain, even though we can be certain of the rudiments of the story. CONTROVERSY AMONG THE GIANT DINOSAURS The giant sauropod dinosaurs like Brachiosaurus were the largest land animals the world has seen they weighed more than 80 tonnes and present quite different problems in the interpretation of their life habits from the diminutive trilobites. Such spectacular animals have obviously attracted much attention, and one might suppose that the problem of how they lived would have been satisfactorily solved long ago. Most of the popular books showing the Mesozoic giants in their natural setting portray them wallowing about in swamps flanked by deep vegetation, their bodies largely under water. Surely an animal of this bulk, it was argued, must be partly supported by water, and their relatively inconsequential teeth must have been adapted for chewing on the kind of soft, luxuriant vegetation that flourishes in and around swamps. Because their nasal openings were on the top of their heads they could even continue to breathe if it became necessary (see p. 115) to totally submerge. Recently the life habits of the giants have been looked at in a way that disproves most of these traditional notions. Consider the structure of their legs. The sauropods have relatively long, pillar-like legs, resembling those of the elephant, the largest living land animal, and may have been well adapted for supporting the huge bulk of the animal. The feet of the sauropod are small (relatively speaking!), with short, stubby toes, yet animals that walk on soft mud tend to have spreading feet to distribute their weight more evenly. It is difficult to see how the compact feet of the sauropod could avoid becoming stuck fast in the soft, muddy bottom of a lake. If the dinosaur did, after all, live on dry land, then the long neck could have usefully functioned to allow the animal to browse the high foliage of trees (see p. 116). It has been suggested that an animal of the size of Brachiosaurus could not have breathed under water because of the pressure on the lungs. Their fossil remains seem to occur with other animals and plants, which are generally accepted as terrestrial. There is even some evidence from the tracks they have left behind that Diplodocus and its allies moved about in herds. They may have been the gigantic reptilian analogue of the elephant, and it may be no coincidence that the elephant also has its nasal openings on top of the skull, with the nostrils in this case sited at the end of the trunk it has been suggested that some sauropods may have had a proboscis of some sort. The balance of evidence seems to be swinging away from the original idea of swamp-dwelling giant dinosaurs to fully terrestrial habits. But other aspects of the dinosaur living habits are still more strongly debated. In the last few years a powerful controversy has arisen over whether the dinosaurs as a whole were cold-blooded, like all living reptiles (and there is no doubt that dinosaurs were reptiles), or warm-blooded, resembling mammals in this respect. Cold-blooded animals have to ‘warm up’ before they can be fully active; that is why lizards and snakes bask in the sun in temperate climates. For this reason they cannot cope with climates having greatly extended winters. Warm-blooded animals have the same body temperatures at all times, and can be more continuously active, but they use far more energy — and hence need more food — than cold-blooded animals of the same size. The posture of many dinosaurs, and particularly the carnivorous theropod dinosaurs, was fully erect with the legs beneath the body, and unlike the sprawling legs of living reptiles (see p. 116). The long back legs of such hunters look highly suitable for running, and as they did so the long tail may have been held erect as a kind of counter-balance (see p. 116). For any kind of prolonged activity, warm-bloodedness would have been a distinct advantage. Under the microscope even the bone structure of these dinosaurs looks more like that of living mammals than cold-blooded reptiles. On the other hand it can be argued that the sauropods like Brachiosaurus were so large, and with a relatively small surface area through which to cool compared with their enormous volume, that their cooling rate could have been slow enough to allow them to sustain more continuous activity than smaller, living reptiles. It has also been argued that the small mouths of the giants simply could not have downed enough food to support a warm-blooded metabolism, particularly plant food that needs a lot of processing before it becomes available as energy. The armoured or plated dinosaurs include some species that seem too heavily burdened with protective armour to have been very active, but this does not necessarily mean that they had to be cold-blooded. Protagonists of the warm-blooded theory will show some of the horned dinosaurs charging over the Cretaceous plains like furious reptilian rhinoceroses! One idea about the life habits of the dinosaur giants, published in Joc and Colette at the Natural History Museum in 1935 The warm-blooded supporters tend to ally themselves with the supporters of a theory about the relationships of the dinosaurs. This is that the dinosaurs, or a close dinosaur relative, included the ancestors of the living birds. Some of the smaller, and most certainly highly active dinosaurs were about the size of a chicken, and there is more than a passing similarity between a running ostrich and the kind of reconstruction that shows fleet-footed, running dinosaurs. The point is that birds themselves are warm-blooded, like mammals, and if birds and dinosaurs are as closely related as now seems likely, then it obviously increases the likelihood  that the dinosaurs themselves may have been warm-blooded. The pros and cons of this theory are the subject of much contentious debate by experts, but it would probably be correct to say that the greater number of specialists believe that at least the more bipedal of the dinosaurs, including small and large carnivores, were warm-blooded, active animals. A lot of the argument among the authorities on these animals is about the equivalence or otherwise of certain bones in dinosaurs and bird skeletons (and particularly the Jurassic bird Archaeopteryx ); this makes for rather dry reading for the layman. But the end-product is the accurate reconstruction of the Jurassic and Cretaceous terrestrial world, over which the dinosaurs were indisputably dominant. GRAPTOLITES — FLOATING COLONIES In the 1830s and 40s geologists were beginning to unravel the mysteries of the early Palaeozoic rocks. The past world recorded in the rocks could not have seemed more alien. Many of the organisms that left fossil remains were of kinds now extinct, although some, like the trilobites, could obviously be placed into a phylum with many living representatives. The graptolites, however, were initially completely enigmatic; they were first described as plants! Their remains were so abundant that they could not be ignored. Their colonies, looking like so many miniature hacksaw blades, often completely covered bedding planes, and usually they were found in the absence of other kinds of fossils. It also became apparent that they could be useful in subdividing the intractable stretch of time from Late Cambrian to Silurian; they changed in obvious ways from one rock formation to the next. Ones with numerous branches seemed to dominate the earlier rocks, ones with fewer branches were later, while in rocks we would now recognize as Silurian and early Devonian, forms with but a single branch (or stipe ) were abundant. With the discovery of better-preserved material it became apparent that the graptolites consisted of rows of tiny cups which were interconnected by a common canal — they were colonial animals. As noticed (p. 59) it is now known that the graptolites were an extinct branch of the phylum Hemichordata, an insignificant group today, consisting of a few encrusting colonial organisms. How did these mysterious organisms live? In this case it is difficult to apply argument from analogy, because the graptolites  are really rather different from any animals now alive. The modern hemichordates are all encrusters and virtually all colonial organisms (such as corals or bryozoa) are bottom dwellers in the sea. On this argument the graptolites should have been bottom dwelling-colonial organisms, living by filtering small particles of food from the water. Some of the graptolites (dendroid graptolites) were shrubby colonies, looking very much like living hydroids or some bryozoa. These were equipped with ‘roots’, and an inference of bottom-living habits seems eminently reasonable for them. But the great majority of the class, including all those with typical saw-blade profiles (graptoloids) which were widely used in the dating of rocks, certainly lacked any kind of rooting structure. When they were looked at in more detail it was found that the colonies grew from one single tube (sicula) which is often facing in a different direction from the tubes inhabited by the rest of the colony (see below). A slender rod (nema) usually grows from the top of the sicula. Since some of the graptoloids are large and robust, this slender rod seemed an inadequate basis for attachment to the sea floor, particularly in any sort of turbulent environment. Then there were some forms, like Phyllograptus (see p. 118), in which the colony grew over the slender nema to leave no visible means of attachment at all. It begins to look as if the graptoloids could have been free-floating animals, of a kind without any living counterpart. Left A modern reconstruction of the life habits of the giant sauropods, which could scarcely be more different from the 1935 version Centre left The posture of a dinosaur compared with that of a living reptile Bottom left The active, running posture of a dinosaur in the modern interpretation Below Growth and budding of a graptolite colony, enlarged about 20 times Now the geological circumstances in which the most abundant graptolite faunas are found can be introduced into the argument. The most typical occurrence of these fossils is in dark, often sooty, black shales. In many localities graptolites are the only fossils to be found, but they occur in abundance. Sometimes they occur with cherty rocks that contain the remains of indubitably planktonic radiolaria. Some, at least, of the graptolitic black shales are what we can recognize, with the hindsight of plate tectonic theory, as the deposits laid down of the edge of the continental shelf, in a truly oceanic environment. These are frequently associated with volcanic rocks of oceanic type. So there seems little room for doubt that the graptolites were capable of living in an open-ocean environment. The fact that they occur in shales without other benthic remains makes it very likely that they were free floating, and this is consistent with the way some of the species were constructed. Dead graptoloids simply drifted down to the bottom where they were preserved by dark muds at a depth at which there was little oxygen in the water to support bottom-dwelling organisms. A few examples have been found where a number of graptoloids seem to have been associated together attached (by the nema) to a ‘float’. Other species seem to have the nema extended into a kind of vane. There may have been some species which were attached to floating seaweed. Of course, many graptoloids also drifted into shallower water, where they are associated with a more normal kind of fossil assemblage. Like the pelagic trilobites, individual graptoloid species are very widespread, which is what one would expect of an animal with the wide ocean as its habitat. It is not surprising to find that the widespread  species have been used extensively to correlate rocks between different continents — they form the standard for the Silurian period, where the graptolite faunas are nearly the same all over the world. Above Phyllograptus , a graptolite colony with no means of attachment. About twice natural size. Above right A sample of the different shapes achieved by the brachiopods: different shapes for differing modes of life In this case a combination of geological evidence and the evidence of the shape of the animal itself has been used to say something about how the animal lived. Many problems remain. Which way up did they float? Were there species adapted for living at particular depths? Why did graptoloids have an evolutionary trend from many branches to few branches? There are plenty of different answers available to these questions, but, like the metabolism of dinosaurs, no concensus has been reached as yet. ANIMALS WITH TWO VALVES Graptolites, trilobites, and dinosaurs are all extinct, and so in the examples we have considered so far there is no direct recourse to the study of living animals to help us bring our fossils back to life. Any analogies have to be with living creatures that are distantly related in the zoological sense, although there may be reasons to suspect that they have similar life habits to those that the fossil animals once enjoyed. Some of the fossils with the simplest construction are those with the soft parts encased within two valves, principally the bivalves and the brachiopods. These two groups of animals are quite unrelated, but both still have living representatives in the oceans, and so it is possible to look at living animals to help with the interpretation of fossil examples. Of the two, the bivalve molluscs are much the most significant in the sea today. The brachiopods are still numerous in some environments, but these tend to be rather inaccessible, such as in the deep sea, which inhibits their direct study in the field. Most brachiopods lead a rather uneventful life, attached by a stalk to a hard surface, like the underside of a rock, or another shell, filtering food from the surrounding sea water. There is nothing to suggest that the innumerable fossil brachiopods had any other method of feeding. Yet it is obvious that there are a great variety of shapes (see above) among the fossil forms, many of them unmatched in living species. There must have been many different ways for brachiopods to exploit their simple mode of life. For a filter-feeding animal, it is sensible to  separate the inhalent current, bringing food, from the exhalent one, which carries away waste products. Brachiopod feeding is carried out by the lophophore (p. 61), a ciliated band usually carried on a loop, which also creates the currents used in feeding. Many brachiopods have developed a broadly wavy margin of the valves (see below), with the middle bent downwards. This form of the shell reflects the separation of the feeding currents from the exhalent currents. Currents pass in through the sides of the shell, over the ciliated lophophore where the food is extracted, and then out through the depression in the margin of the valves. The lophophore is supported in several different ways. In some species the support is on a spiral made of calcium carbonate (see p. 120). This increases the length of the lophophore available to extract food from the feeding current, and so increases the efficiency of the process. Brachiopods begin to seem rather more complex animals than their simple shape suggests. Many species have a finely folded margin, crumpled like corrugated cardboard. Since the shell grows at the margins, a ribbed shell is produced, with fine or coarse ribs according to the species. A ribbed shell of this kind is often stronger than one without ribs (for the same reason that corrugated iron is used for roofing), and it is probably no coincidence that ribs may be developed on bivalves too. But the wavy margin may serve another function. For one thing it increases the length of the margin, allowing the animal to admit more food per unit of length. The wavy margin also prevents the entry of irritating particles of sand, with which the animal cannot cope. However, there is still a problem at the crests of the corrugations, where the gap between the valves is larger; many brachiopods solve this particular problem by having fine, hair-like spines which cover the crests of the corrugations, and so prevent the intrusion of unwanted particles. Wavy valve margins in brachiopod. Note also the ribbing. Four times life size. Although most brachiopods were attached to a firm substrate by a stalk which emerges through a hole in the pointed end of the animal, there are some in the fossil record in which there is no opening for such a stalk. These must have lain freely on the surface of the sediment. In some of these species one valve is greatly thickened. This is likely to have been the lower valve, and fossils are sometimes found in ‘life position’, which confirms this. The other valve sits in the thick one like a lid, and the whole animal is curved so that the margins of the valves were kept clear of the sediment. The end result is an animal that looks very much like some kinds of oyster, although a glance at the internal feeding structures shows at once that they are brachiopods, unrelated to the bivalves they superficially resemble. Some species had long spines (anchors?) attached to the lower, thicker valve. Unlike the brachiopods, many of the modes of life of living bivalve molluscs can be more or less directly matched in fossil   examples. So by studying how the life habits of living bivalves are reflected in the shapes of the shells we can make deductions about how the fossils lived. A major difference between brachiopods and bivalves is that the latter are capable of moving freely, using their foot to crawl or dig. Of course, some bivalves, like mussels and oysters,do remain fixed throughout their adult life, and it is possible that these fill the ecological role today of some of the large brachiopods of the Palaeozoic. Some of these lived in shallow water sites and were gregarious like mussels. But since brachiopods were unable to do many of the things that bivalves do very efficiently, it would be unwise to attribute the decline of the brachiopods to diversification of the bivalves. Above Swimming in bivalves: living Chlamys escaping starfish predators Right Burrowing bivalve mollusc in life position; the siphons retain contact with the surface Left Spiral supports for the brachiopod feeding system, preserved inside one of the valves, and etched out with acid Burrowing bivalves, which are typically found in the soft bottoms of shallow seas today, dig themselves down into the sediment, where they escape the attention of many predators (except birds with long bills!). Many of them retain contact with the surface of the sediment by means of long siphons (see left), which enable them to breathe and feed on small organic particles. Most bivalves with siphons develop a gape at one end of the valves, so that they do not close  entirely in the region from which the siphons protrude. It is easy to recognize such gaping valves in fossils, and there are accompanying changes on the internal structure of the shell which are associated with species with long siphons. Hence bivalves as old as Palaeozoic can be identified with some confidence as ancient burrowers. It can be confirmed by discoveries of fossils preserved in their life position. Often the process of ‘digging in’ is assisted by a characteristic pattern of chevron-shaped ribs on the surface of the shell, which are also obvious features of some fossil shells. Such V-shaped ribs are not found on brachiopods, which have never developed the capacity for burrowing. Other kinds of bivalves have used their capacity for free movement to the utmost by becoming efficient swimmers, clapping their valves together like castanets to move through the sea to find new feeding grounds or to escape the threat of predators. These bivalves have fan-like shells, often strongly ribbed (Chlamys ). While the bottom-dwelling or burrowing bivalves mostly have a pair of strong muscles to pull the valves together, in the swimming forms the muscles have become modified so that there is one particularly powerful muscle, centrally placed, to produce the powerful clapping movement that propels the animal through the water. This muscle leaves a conspicuous scar on the inside of the shell, an impression which is easily preserved in the fossil state. So it is possible to deduce swimming habits in fossil bivalves by comparison with the living forms. These swimming habits go back into the Palaeozoic, to the Carboniferous or earlier. There are a few bivalves which are found in rocks deposited in the same sort of black shale environment that was mentioned above in the discussion of graptolite life habits. Some experts maintain that these molluscs were able to swim in the open ocean, or that they were attached to floating seaweed: some such mechanism has to be invoked to explain how these bivalves came into an environment that lacked bottom-living animals. I have only selected a few examples of deducing modes of life from these fossils with two valves; the examples could be multiplied many times. The most important point is that relatively complicated life habits can be inferred from a careful consideration of the anatomy of even the simplest looking animal, particularly when there are related, similarly adapted animals for comparison. PALAEONTOLOGICAL ENIGMAS Every now and then the fossil record throws up fossils which are palaeontological puzzles. They are obviously the remains of some kind of animal, but the problem is to decide what kind. They tend to be rather rare, preserved in a special way. And, of course, like so many palaeontological matters, they stir up arguments between specialists who think they have a way of solving the enigmas. Some of these puzzling fossils are quite small. A few years ago a minute fossil only about 2 mm long was recovered from limestones of Ordovician age, and christened Janospira . It looks remarkably like a trumpet. The ‘mouthpiece’ and the ‘horn’of the trumpet are both open, and a coil hangs down from the middle. The end of the coil is closed, and it seems reasonable to assume that the animal started growing as a coiled shell. Then it must have changed its mind, and started to grow in two directions, a narrower tube into the ‘mouthpiece’ and a broader one into the ‘horn’, and there is some evidence that the ‘horn’end continued to get wider and longer. The problem is that it is hard to equate this kind of growth with that of any known animal group. It looks like some kind of mollusc, but no mollusc fits easily into this pattern of growth; various people have suggested it might be some kind of snail, or perhaps a monoplacophoran (see p. 76). It remains a puzzle. It is found along with fossils of planktonic organisms and it is possible to explain the change in growth between coil and trumpet as a change that happened when the larval shell settled on the bottom. But since virtually all phyla of animals have planktonic larvae, this is no help in solving the puzzle. A palaeontological enigma:Janospira , a small Ordovician fossil of unknown relationships Some larger fossils are even more puzzling. A number from the famous Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale of western Canada are so strange that they have even been claimed as the representatives of ‘extinct phyla’. Certainly they are difficult to accommodate comfortably in groups alive today. One of these,Hallucigenia is shown opposite. This curious animal has  what was probably a gut and a set of tubules arising from it; below this are curious pointed structures. What can it be? One suggestion is that early on in metazoan evolution there were a number of experimental designs which were not to give rise to direct descendants; naturally these do not fit into the pigeon holes based on living animals. Hallucigenia may have been one of these. There are problems with designating these as new phyla, not least that nobody can define a phylum objectively, and my own view is that, marvellous though these animals are, we should still try to relate them to other organisms (fossil and living). Hallucigenia would defy all such attempts at the moment."
ACA ACA-B2K-006 10.19 "VACUUM SOLUTIONS WITH NON-ALIGNED POLARIZATION The purpose of this chapter is to describe the known exact solutions for colliding gravitational waves in which the polarization of the approaching waves is not aligned. The first solution of this type was obtained by Nutku and Halil (1977). A further generalization of this solution was attempted by Halil (1979), but this has subsequently been found to be incorrect and so will not be considered here. The Nutku-Halil solution The Khan-Penrose solution discussed in Chapter 3 describes the collision of impulsive waves whose polarization vectors are aligned. Nutku and Halil (1977) have generalized this solution to give one which describes the collision of impulsive gravitational waves with non-colinear polarization. This is the most simple solution of this type. In terms of the Szekeres line element (6.20), the metric functions of this solution can be written in the form  (13.1) where  (13.2) and α and β are constants such that(α -β) is the angle between the polarization vectors of the approaching waves. This solution can be seen to reduce to the Khan-Penrose solution (3.9) when . It may also be observed that the functions f and g are given by  and . This solution has been analysed in great detail by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984). Their approach commences by rewriting the field equations in the form of Ernst's equation as described in Chapter 11. It can then be seen from (11.20) that Ε is the associated Ernst function. Chandrasekhar and Ferrari were then able to show that the Nutku-Halil solution is obtained by the simple choice of Ernst function given by  (13.3) where p and q are real constants which satisfy the condition . It is always possible to use a rotation of the type (12.9) to put , and in this case  and . It can easily be shown that the Ernst function Z associated with this solution is given by  (13.4) It may be observed that (13.3) is in fact the Ernst potential which leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. This reduces to the potential for the Schwarzschild solution when  or . Thus the difference in the polarization of the approaching waves in this situation can be seen to be equivalent to the rotational parameter in the Kerr solution. Taking the Ernst functions as (13.3) or (13.4), it can be shown that the boundary conditions described in Section 7.2 can only be satisfied if  and  It is then convenient to transform the null coordinates such that and . Thus the form (13.2) is obtained uniquely from the Ernst function (13.3). It also follows from this that the approaching waves necessarily contain impulsive components. Expressions for the components of the Weyl tensor 0, 2 and 4 describing the wave and interaction components have been given by Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984), though in a notation which differs slightly from that adopted here. However, it can still be clearly seen that this solution is a generalization of the Khan-Penrose solution in which the approaching impulsive waves have different polarization. Apart from the initial impulsive waves on the boundaries  and , the interiors of regions II and III are flat. It can also be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is the same as that of the Khan-Penrose solution. There is a curvature singularity on the space-like surface  in region IV, and there  are fold singularities in regions II and III which are identical to those described in Section 8.3. It may also be pointed out that Ernst (1986) has shown that  the Nutku-Halil solution can also be obtained using a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation, with the seed metric being the isotropic Kasner metric. The Panov solution Panov (1979 b ) has applied the generation method of Geroch (1971), described in Section 12.3, to obtain a non-colinear solution from a colinear one. In terms of the metric functions in (6.20), Panov started with a colinear solution U ,V , and M of (6.22) with . He then worked with the Killing vector  which is (12.25) with  and . This enabled him to put , and hence , and also from (12.30), and , where . With these expressions, the metric components may be derived from (12.23), giving  (13.5) where, from (12.28),P 3 must satisfy  (13.6) or, more conveniently,. (13.7) It is worth pointing out that, if the initial Killing vector had been taken to be , which is (12.25) with  and , an equivalent transformation would have been obtained with  and . This would have given an identical set of equations, but with V being replaced by -V , and P 3 by P 2 . In terms of the Ernst formulation of the problem described in Chapter 11, the above transformation implies that, if Z is a real solution of (11.18), then a new complex solution is given by  (13.8) where  must satisfy the equations  (13.9) Panov then took the initial solution to be the totally general solution of Szekeres (1972), which can be considered to be equivalent to the general solution given here by (10.16). He has thus determined a general class of non-colinear solutions, and he was able to show that, when the appropriate boundary conditions have been applied, the approaching waves necessarily have variable polarization. It has already been shown that the new solution obtained using a Geroch transformation will automatically satisfy the required boundary conditions if these are satisfied by the initial solution. In this case, it can also be seen that the new and initial solutions have the same singularity structure. The Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution Chandrasekhar and Ferrari (1984) have shown that the associated Ernst function which is contained in the Nutku-Halil solution can be written as  (13.3), where . Now, it is well known (see Chandrasekhar, 1983) that this is the Ernst potential that leads to the Kerr solution for stationary axisymmetric space-times. However, as described in Section 12.4, Chandrasekhar and Ferrari have also shown that, for the colliding plane wave situation, the Ernst function may be regarded either (a) as containing the metric functions, or (b) as a potential for those functions. When the Ernst function (13.3) is considered as containing the metric functions, it leads to the Nutku-Halil solution described above. However, when the same function is considered as a potential, it then leads to the Kerr solution. Thus part of the  Kerr space-time must also be considered as a solution of the colliding plane wave equations, though in this situation the coordinates have a different interpretation. This alternative interpretation of part of the Kerr space-time has been described in detail by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ). Essentially it may be considered to have been derived from the Nutku-Halil solution using the Neugebauer-Kramer involution described in Section 12.4. We start here with the Ernst potential given by , so that(13.10) where . According to(12.36), the first metric function is then given by  (13.11) and, from (12.34),w is given by  (13.12) where  (13.13) With this,(13.12) becomes  (13. 14) which can immediately be integrated to give  (13.15) where c is an arbitrary constant. Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos have chosen the constant of integration in (13.15) such that when . The reason for this choice is associated with the convenience of aligning the coordinate directions with the shear axes on the surface  on which the two waves mutually focus each other. Accordingly we set . (13.16) A variation of this constant is equivalent to making an Ehlers transformation as described in (12.16–18). With (13.16), may now be written in either of the forms  (13.17) For purposes of simplification, it is convenient to introduce the terms  (13.18) In view of(12.43) and (13.1), in this case we must have . (13.19) The metric function M can also be obtained from (12.42) and (13.1), giving . (13.20) These expressions now complete all the metric functions contained in the line element (11.4), which may now be written as . (13.21) After some rearrangement, this may be written in the more convenient form . (13.22) in which Y does not appear in a denominator. In order to show that this is indeed the Kerr solution, we first relabel the parameters by putting  (13.23) which satisfies the condition  for arbitrary constants M and α. It is also appropriate to introduce the new coordinates r and θ instead of t and z given by  (13.24) where it may be noticed that, using the previous notation,. The remaining coordinates may also be transformed by putting  (13 25) It is also convenient to introduce the definitions . (13.26) With these substitutions the line element (13.22) may then be written in the form  (13.27) which after rescaling d s is the standard form of the Kerr solution. For this solution to describe the interaction region of colliding waves, the coordinates must satisfy the inequality . With (13.24), this implies that  (13.28) which is satisfied only by the region of the Kerr space-time that is inside the ergo-sphere. This is not unexpected, as this is the only region of Kerr space-time in which the Killing vectors are both space-like. The plane on which the two waves collide is given by , or by  which is between the two horizons. The hypersurface on which they mutually focus each other, which is given by  or , is here given by  which determines the horizons of the  Kerr solution. Thus, the curvature singularity which usually occurs when , in this case, is replaced by a coordinate singularity which is normally interpreted as a horizon of the Kerr solution. The components of the Weyl tensor inside region IV can be derived using (11.10) and have been evaluated by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos. The space-time is of algebraic type D and, in particular, it may be noted that  (13.29) The curvature is clearly non-singular as  except in the aligned case  (or ). In this case only, the surface  corresponds to a curvature singularity. In the interaction region t is a future pointing time-like coordinate. It thus follows from (13.24) that r is also a future pointing time-like coordinate which increases from the collision at  to the outer horizon at . In this case a possible further extension beyond the horizon would present no problems. It may be noted, however, that if the signs of the expressions for t ,p and q in (13.24) and (13.23) are changed, the Kerr metric (13.27) is still obtained but the orientation of r is altered. In this case, the collision at  is followed by the inner horizon at  and any extension would lead to a future time-like curvature singularity at . The difference between these two solution has been further analysed by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). It is the latter case that has been described by Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) in which there is an extension beyond the horizon at  which contains a time-like singularity analogous to the ring singularity of the Kerr solution at . Since this singularity is time-like, it would be missed by most observers. In the other case, which has been given explicitly above, there is an analytic extension which is the asymptotically flat exterior Kerr solution. It may be pointed out, however, that in both cases the extension beyond the horizon is not unique. When considering the question of the character of the coordinate singularity at , Chandrasekhar and Xanthopoulos (1986 b ) have given a transformation by which it can be removed. They have found it convenient to introduce a decreasing time-like coordinate given by . The transformation  (13.30) then removes the coordinate singularity at , or . This provides an analytic extension beyond the Cauchy horizon which is another part of Kerr space-time. This extension, in one case, is followed by a time-like curvature singularity which corresponds to the source of the Kerr solution. It may be seen that the singularity structure of this solution is very similar to that of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution described in detail in Section 10.5. In fact this solution reduces to either of the two cases of the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution in the limit as  which is the limit as the polarization of the approaching waves become aligned. The non-singular case occurs when . It may be noted that in this limit , the rotation of the Kerr solution vanishes, and the solution reduces to the same part of the Schwarzschild space-time as the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution. It is now appropriate to consider the extension of the solution into the prior regions I, II and III which describe the approaching waves that give rise to this particular interaction. The metric (13.21) may easily be extended into region II simply by replacing both t and z by u . It turns out to be convenient to make the coordinate transformation . (13.31) With this, the line-element in region II takes the form  (13.32) where . The line-element for region III is identical to (13.32) except that v replaces u . Both these line-elements are then continuous with the Minkowski space (3.6) in region I. The plane wave metric given by (13.32) has the single component of the curvature tensor given by . (13.33) It may immediately be observed that the approaching waves have variable polarization except in the aligned limit . They include an impulsive component and a step component. As in the degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solution, the singularity structure is thus complicated by the fact that the solution contains impulsive waves on the wave fronts  and  which form the boundaries of the interaction region. The presence of these wave components introduces  additional distribution valued singularities at the points , and ,. As described in Chapter 8, these point singularities ensure the existence of fold singularities on the surfaces  and  in regions II and III respectively. The profiles for the approaching waves in both cases have been described in more detail by Hoenselaers and Ernst (1990). They have shown that, in the case where the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the inner Kerr horizon, the amplitude diverges towards the fold singularity which is thus a non-scalar curvature singularity. On the other hand, when the Cauchy horizon corresponds to the outer Kerr horizon, the amplitude decays towards a quasiregular fold singularity. Other solutions It may be noticed that the solutions presented in the previous two sections have been obtained using the generating techniques described in Sections 12.3 and 12.4 respectively. Other techniques may also be used, both in isolation and in various combinations. Since they involve the same Ernst equation, it is clear that all the solution generating techniques that have been developed for stationary axisymmetric space-times in recent years can also be applied to colliding plane wave situations. A number of papers have recently been published which present new colliding wave solutions using some of these techniques, and it is likely that many more such papers will appear. Most of these concentrate on a description of a particular technique and how it may be adapted to the colliding wave situation. At present, however, there is less emphasis on the physical significance of the particular solution generated. Nevertheless, solutions with a number of parameters have been obtained, and general classes of solutions have been defined. Ideally, one would like to be able to specify the particular solution corresponding to an arbitrary set of initial conditions. Such techniques are available in the axisymmetric case, and may soon be extended to the colliding wave situation. The initial attempts at the solution of this problem are mentioned in the next chapter. So far most of the explicit solutions that have been presented have involved impulsive wave components. In the notation of (7.11), they have used . Much less attention has been given to smooth-fronted waves of finite duration. Some further general aspects of cases involving impulsive components have been clarified by Ferrari (1988). In particular, it has been shown that the proper time between the collision and the subsequent singularity is  inversely proportional to the square root of the amplitudes of the impulsive components of the approaching waves. This time is also affected by their relative polarization and is a minimum when the approaching waves are colinear. This result also applies to solutions which contain a Cauchy horizon rather than a curvature singularity. In addition, Ferrari has also shown that the shock waves which accompany the impulsive waves only affect the rate at which the Weyl scalars diverge on the singularity. Having made these general remarks, we may now briefly review the new exact solutions that have been presented. The generation techniques themselves will not be described in detail here. First, there is the important class of solutions that has been obtained by Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 a , b) using the inverse scattering method developed by Belinskii and Zakharov (1978, 1979) and Carr and Verdaguer (1983). Using this method, they have obtained a two-parameter class of colliding wave solutions with non-aligned polarization. This in fact is a generalization of the soliton solution of Ferrari and Ibañez (1987 b ) described in Sections 10.4 and 10.5. The Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution has been obtained using as seed the Kasner metric. They utilize the Belinskii-Zakharov soliton technique with two real poles. The resulting metric for region IV is singular on the space-like surface , except in a particular limiting case. By extending the solution back into regions II and III, it can be seen that the approaching waves must have both an impulsive component and a step component with variable polarization. The limiting case of the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution is particularly interesting. It is of type D, and can be shown to be part of the Taub-NUT solution in the Taub region where there are two space-like Killing vectors. The line element can be written in the form  (13.34) where p and q are constants satisfying . It can immediately be seen that, when  and , this further reduces to the two colinear degenerate Ferrari-Ibañez solutions that have already been considered in Section 10.5. The structure of this solution has been further examined by Ferrari and Ibañez (1988). Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 a ) have shown that an Ehlers transformation (12.13) applied to the Ernst function of the Nutku-Halil solution (13.3), together with a simple coordinate transformation, yields a non-colinear generalization of the Ferrari Ibañez soliton solution that was described in Section 10.4 but only with even integer values of the parameter α. This generalization is in fact contained in the solution of Ferrari, Ibañez and Bruni (1987 a , b). A further generalization extending the Ferrari-Ibañez-Bruni solution was reported by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 a , b), with a full derivation given in Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988). This solution contains three arbitrary parameters. In stating this solution, it is convenient first to define the function  (13.35) where a , α and β are the arbitrary parameters, and where . (13.36) With this definition, the Ernst function for this new solution may be written as  (13.37) When , this reduces to the Nutku-Halil solution. With , one obtains the Kerr-NUT solution with α being the NUT parameter. The subcase with  and  becomes the Schwarzschild-NUT space-time. Transforming (13.37) using the Neugebauer Kramer involution produces another three-parameter family of solutions with the alternative Ernst function given by  (13.38) With , this reduces to the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution. Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1987 b ) have also found a simpler realization  of the Geroch group of transformations relating colliding wave solutions. With this, they have obtained a generalization of the  above solution in the case when . A further generalization of the  solution is also obtained using a Neugebauer-Kramer involution. It was pointed out by Ernst (1986) that the Nutku Halil solution can be derived from the isotropic () Kasner metric by applying a double-Harrison (Bäcklund) transformation. The Kerr space-time of the Chandrasekhar-Xanthopoulos solution can also be derived from Minkowski space using a double-Harrison transformation. It therefore seemed reasonable that other colliding wave solutions may be generated by applying double-Harrison transformations to other Kasner metrics. This procedure has indeed been successful. It was used by Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser (1988) to determine the solution described above in (13.35) to (13.38). The effect of a double-Harrison transformation can be deduced by any number of competing techniques. Naturally, however, Ernst, García-Díaz and Hauser preferred to use the so-called Hauser-Ernst homogeneous Hilbert problem approach (see also Ernst 1988). Finally, it may be mentioned that Hassan, Feinstein and Manko (1990) have recently obtained another particular solution describing the non-colinear case using the generating technique of Gutsunaev and Manko (1988) as described here in (12.56) and (15.57). Further solutions could easily be obtained using this method."
ACA ACA-B17-001 10.39 "PART 1 Introduction and overview Introduction Crime and criminals are topics of endless fascination. A glance at the newspapers or at the television programme schedules provides a clear indication of this enormous interest in crime, both ‘real life’ crime and fictional crime. Yesterday's public enemies and villains have a habit of becoming present-day cult figures. Stories of the Great Train Robber Ronnie Biggs and his life in Brazil arouse feelings close to affection, for example. There are a variety or possible reasons for this interest. It may demonstrate a sense of outrage toward the criminal and the enjoyment of seeing the wrongdoer punished and justice being done, given that in the majority of crime stories and programmes the criminals come off worse. It may be that we secretly admire those who attempt to ‘beat the system’, and that we sympathise with the underdog. Alternately , this interest might demonstrate the excitement and enjoyment gained from reading about and watching that which we ourselves could not or would not do; a sort of substituted excitement. Whatever the reasons, murder, rape, robbery, large-scale fraud and embezzlement, drug smuggling, gang warfare, delinquency and so on make good subjects for conversation and exciting and profitable stories and films. The number of box-office successes at the cinema which have had crime as their central theme illustrates this vast interest — films such as The Godfather ,The French Connection ,The Sting ,Butch Cassidy ,Warriors ,Scarface and many more you could name. Someone from a different culture, or world, visiting our society could be excused for thinking that crime was a basic, ever-present feature of our everyday lives. In reality the majority of people are not involved in such  spectacular criminality. However, we do not need to look far to see how the influence and effects of crime have imprinted themselves on our social environment. Locks, security staff, police, prisons, the mass media, insurance cover, safes and so on reflect the extent of crime. There would be little need to employ security guards or insure against theft if crime did not occur. Before we look at sociological research and theory on crime, it is necessary to define and make clear what our subject matter is. Crime is often equated with the term deviance, but there are problems in using the two terms interchangeably, as substitutes for one another. While crime is frequently a major area of the study of deviance the relationship between the two needs to be made clear. What is crime? The definition of crime is fairly clear cut. It is generally accepted that a crime is an act which breaks the criminal law. In addition to breaking the criminal law, a crime can be followed by criminal proceedings, including punishment. The phrase ‘can be followed by’ indicates that not all crime does actually result in police action and prosecution, an issue we will examine in more detail in a discussion of criminal statistics (Chapter 4). However, the criminal law is not fixed and static, it varies over time and from area to area. Therefore, the actions which are defined as criminal will vary with different social settings — in different societies and different periods of time. In other words, crime is a relative concept ; it can only be defined in relation to particular criminal laws which are effective at particular times and in particular societies. Such laws, and the criminal proceedings or punishments that follow the breaking of them, are not constant, they are always liable to change. No doubt you can think of various acts which are crimes in this country but not in other countries; and of behaviour which is against the criminal law of other societies but which is not criminal in Britain. The clearest illustrations of the relative nature of crime can be seen by comparing distinct and different cultures. Bigamy, for example, is a serious crime in Britain yet it is normal and accepted practice in other countries. Similarly, alcohol drinking is accepted and legal in some countries yet  illegal and severely punished in certain Moslem countries. Even countries with broadly similar cultures can differ in what they define as criminal. In certain states of the USA the possession of small quantities of marijuana is not a criminal offence, although it is in Britain. As well as differing from place to place, what is defined as crime changes over time. In Britain today we have different criminal laws and hence a different range of crime from those which once existed. Homosexuality between consenting adults aged 21 or over, and abortion during a certain period of pregnancy, are not criminal offences at present, although they have been in the past. It is worth bearing in mind, however, that the de-criminalising of an activity (the removing of an activity from the scope of criminal law) does not mean that it necessarily becomes generally accepted. Although homosexuality is no longer against the law, homosexuals still face a good deal of criticism and stigma. The fact that what is seen as crime varies with different societies does not affect the definition of crime — as an act which breaks the criminal law of the particular society. Thus, our definition of crime is based on criminal laws which are made by particular governments and enforced by established criminal procedure. Crime, then, has to be seen as a socially variable phenomenon: it reflects what particular societies and governments, at particular times, include within their criminal laws and practices. Deviance Deviance is a much wider and more vague concept than is crime, and is therefore less easy to define. The term itself is based on the verb ‘to deviate’, meaning to stray from, to digress. In one sense, deviance could be taken to mean any behaviour that differs from the normal, any uncommon or unusual behaviour. From such a position, deviant behaviour could be extremely good or heroic behaviour, such as risking one's life to help others or showing courage over and above the line of duty. It could be behaviour that is different or unusual in a way that is disapproved of, such as stealing or children-battering. Or, it could be behaviour which is seen as eccentric or bizarre, such as not wearing shoes and socks  in conventional situations or carrying on prolonged conversations with the plants in one's garden. However, in sociology and in everyday use, the term deviance is generally applied to situations where the behaviour is disapproved of and subject to some form of punishment. Deviance is thus used to describe behaviour that is outside the rules of society; and these rules can be legal rules or social and moral rules, rules about the conventional way to dress or to speak to other people, for example. Also, deviant behaviour is behaviour that can result in some form of punishment; and this punishment can be either a formal, legal punishment or take the form of social and moral disapproval. Deviance is behaviour which does not follow the expectations or norms of the majority in society, and it leads to a hostile and critical reaction from the majority. It is this social reaction which generates and defines deviance. In other words, for an action to be deviant it has to cause some form of critical reaction and disapproval from others in the particular society. No action is deviant in itself: it has to excite some reaction from others. In defining and distinguishing crime and deviance we have referred to rules, laws and norms, and to behaviour which does not follow them. They are terms which you will encounter in the study of crime and deviance and it might be helpful to define and discuss each at this stage. Rules, laws and norms A rule is a common and widely used term. Rules can be formal and written or they can be unwritten. The rules of a factory may be written down and serve as strict regulators of behaviour. In contrast, the rules of dress or of how we eat are unwritten guides to behaviour. In all cases, however, a rule is something that is held and accepted as right and legitimate by the members of a group or society. Laws are perhaps the best example of written, formal rules. There are specific penalties drawn up to punish those who break laws. Generally speaking, the most important rules in society are those that make up the law, with laws decided upon by powerful and influential groups in society. In order to ensure that everyone keeps to the laws there are specific penalties, such as fines or  imprisonment, for those found guilty of breaking the law. Unlike other rules, such as rules of dress or of grammar, laws can always be enforced by law enforcement agencies such as the police and the courts in the last resort. We have defined crime as behaviour which breaks the criminal law. However, there are different categories of law, with criminal law being one such category. There is a basic distinction in the laws of this country between the criminal and the civil law. Broadly, civil law refers to the resolving of disputes between individuals, and the breaking of civil law results in less severe penalties, often the paying of compensation or ‘damages’. A norm is very much a general term, it is an expected standard of behaviour shared by members of a social group. Norms can be thought of as unwritten rules. Any group of people will, over time, develop common rules governing their behaviour, and these rules are often described as norms. Examples of these unwritten rules are that parents should play with their children, or that one should respond in the appropriate manner to a ‘good morning’ greeting. Norms are, therefore, ideal standards of behaviour. They are part of the culture of society and are passed on from one generation to the next. Although many norms are shared by the majority in society, there are also intra-group norms which govern the behaviour of particular groups of people but which may not be accepted by the majority. In a school, teachers may share different norms to students, and different groups of students (and teachers) may share different norms. The relationship between crime and deviance We have defined crime as an act which breaks the criminal law and deviance as behaviour which breaks or departs from the norms or standards of the majority in society. From these definitions you will see that crime and delinquency are one form of deviance (strictly speaking, delinquency refers to anti-social and illegal behaviour, but in sociology it is usually linked with ‘juvenile’ and used to refer to the criminality and misconduct of youths). They are perhaps the most obvious form of deviance, in that crime is clearly behaviour which breaks the standards of society and which can result in some punishment. It should also  be apparent, though, that there is a variety of other behaviour which is outside the rules and standards of society but which does not break the criminal law. Being an alcoholic is not against the law, and not criminal, although it is deviant. Similarly, becoming a hermit and avoiding contact with other people would be considered deviant behaviour but it is not criminal. Without labouring the point, it is clear that not all deviant behaviour is criminal, and it is important to be aware of the distinction between the two concepts. Thus, deviance is a broader concept than crime. However, and to complicate the issue, it does not necessarily follow that all crime is always viewed as deviant. You might be able to think of crimes that are not generally regarded as deviant — crime committed in self-defence, for example. Although theft is illegal it is often regarded as normal and acceptable practice when an individual ‘borrows’ materials from his or her place of work for personal use — such as stationery, or makes 'phone calls on an office telephone. Thus the distinction between crime and deviance is by no means straightforward and the relationship between the two has often been poorly understood. In this study we shall be examining crime, and while deviance does overlap with crime it is important not to simply identify crime with deviance. The study of crime In the sociological study of crime, as with other areas of sociological study, the student is faced with an ever growing body of research and argument. But there is a general agreement on the major works which form the bases of the different perspectives or theories; as with other subjects, sociology has its ‘classics’. Chapter 2 of this book covers the major theoretical approaches. It includes much that is central to the accepted body of the sociology of crime and deviance, but aims to introduce this material in an easily accessible form. In Chapter 3 we will look at specific examples of criminal behaviour, and will discuss and criticise some of the common assumptions about the nature and extent of crime in contemporary society. We will examine the history of delinquency in an attempt to correct the notion, or perhaps myth, that such behaviour is a uniquely modern  phenomenon that indicates a degeneration of standards of behaviour in present-day society. We will investigate the widely held belief that crime is a working-class phenomenon through an examination of some predominantly middle-class crimes, in particular business or corporate crime. Similarly, we will look at female crime and the reasons why this makes up such a small proportion of known criminality. Part Three is divided into two chapters. The first, Chapter 4, deals with the measurements of crime, the extent and character of recorded crime and the dangers of assuming that the criminal statistics accurately reflect the amount and character of crime that does occur. Chapter 5  includes extended readings from a range of studies in the sociology of crime. Most of the readings will be from studies cited in the previous chapters, although some will be from studies not cited in the main text. This chapter will enable students to read and appreciate original sociological writing and research, rather then rely on reviews provided in textbooks. Before we commence with these main themes, some general comments on the sociology of crime as it is, and has been, studied might help students to appreciate the theories and research discussed in what follows. Sociology is a relatively new discipline or subject, although the issues examined by sociologists and the explanations put forward have a much longer history. Crime has persistently interested and worried people, and attempts to make sense of crime and criminal behaviour have appeared in literary and intellectual writings throughout the ages. The world of crime and, therefore, the sociological study of crime is vast and uncertain. There is a massive amount of crime which is never recognised. The need for criminals to be secretive and not to advertise themselves adds to this uncertainty, and makes the study of crime more problematic than many other areas of sociological study. Naturally enough, those who commit crimes will tend to conceal their actions and protect themselves. The usual aim of the criminal is to remain anonymous, particularly if he or she wishes to continue to engage in criminal actions. The secretive nature of crime raises a number of problems for the study of crime. In the first instance, there is a need to be alert to the potential for, and presence of, crime in conventional and  ordinary settings. Widespread and systematic crime occurs in normal, everyday situations. A study of a bakery in south-east England uncovered a highly organised system of stealing from work and of fiddling of customers by the bread salesmen (Ditton, 1977). In a similar manner, various other studies have indicated that a wide and diverse range of crime occurs at the workplace. Clearly, crime is not a rare occurrence, but it is hidden methodically, and this raises problems for research. Initially it is necessary to find the subjects for study. How does one locate a fraud expert, for example? Then, once located, the subjects have to be convinced that they can safely discuss their criminal behaviour. The process of gaining the confidence of criminals is liable to be time-consuming and thus expensive. Research into crime is likely to take comparatively longer than into other areas of social behaviour. Months or years may pass before intimacy and trust develop, and before a reasonable range of criminal actions can be observed closely. Research and study problems are not limited to the area of crime and criminals. However, the effective study of crime requires the development of intimate associations with people who are by nature suspicious and unwilling to talk to outsiders. Bearing these problems and points in mind, the participant observation method of research has been particularly effective in the study of crime. Participant observations involves the observing of a phenomenon as an ‘insider’, through contacting and gaining acceptance from the people or groups being studied. While other research methods, such as interviews or questionnaires, can be effectively used to gain a wider picture, participant observation enables the investigator to understand behaviour through direct, personal experience. This is not to suggest that such observation is itself a straightforward method of investigation. The researcher has to remain an objective and outside recorder of events at the same time as being closely involved with the people and events that are being studied. Furthermore, it is difficult for the participant observer not to exert some influence on the events that are being observed. Some of the problems inherent in the sociological study of crime are illustrated in the first reading in Chapter 5 (pages 76–77). In what follows we will introduce various aspects of the sociological study of crime, and examine theories and measurement of crime, and illustrations of specific criminal behaviour. However, it is important to bear in mind that while most people break some, if not many, of the laws of their society, few people are found guilty of criminal offences. It is useful, therefore, to ask initially why so many people do not become recognised as criminals: to look at why so many conform, or at least do not become regular or serious offenders against the criminal law. In exploring this problem, it is common to point to two basic types of social control or restraint. The informal mechanisms of control, which centre around the socialisation process — people learn that stealing, cheating and the like are wrong; and the formal mechanics , which involve formal, legally established penalties. In analysing and explaining crime we will need to examine why these control mechanisms do not exert the same influence on all individuals and social groups. Discussion exercise To elaborate on this division and to gain a clearer understanding of the different types of social control, it would be useful for you to try a brief exercise, answering and discussing the following questions. These questions could be looked at within small groups of students. 1 Ask yourself and your colleagues why you follow the laws of society. Do the answers given suggest that laws are followed because they are agreed with and felt to be right — indicating the influence of informal control mechanisms? Or do they suggest that laws are followed because of the fear of being caught and punished — indicating the influence of formal control mechanisms? 2 Why do you not steal from shops? (Assuming that you don't!) Is it because you believe it wrong to do so, or because you are afraid of being caught and of the consequences if you are? In other words, are formal or informal mechanisms of control the major influence? Alternatively, if you do steal from shops what would stop you doing so? Better security and greater risk? Or, becoming convinced that such actions are wrong? 3 Would you steal from shops if it could be guaranteed that you would not get caught? ‘Yes’ answers to this question would suggest that formal social control mechanisms are the major influence with regard to shoplifting. 4 Would you distinguish between different types of shop? Between a small, local shop where there is likely to be less security, and a large supermarket or department store? Of course, it is not always easy to pinpoint exactly why we do or do not engage in a particular action. Often the reasons will reflect a mixture of informal and formal social controls, while the importance of either will vary with different circumstances. Although it might be very easy to steal from a friend or colleague and not get caught most people would feel this to be ‘wrong’, yet such feelings may not exert such a strong influence over decisions as to whether to steal from a larger and less personal victim."
ACA ACA-CLW-001 10.04 "The School Framework A Model to Link Personality Characteristics to a Preference for Science John Head Introduction In recent years there has been a steady accumulation of evidence that personality and allied affective factors play a crucial role in determining subject choice and student success. Unfortunately, this evidence has tended to be fragmentary, a collection of separate, discrete pieces of information lacking a synthesizing theory to provide cohesion and predictive power. The few models which have been developed to date may have been correct as far as they go but are clearly incomplete. For example Roe (1952), Eiduson (1962) and McClelland (1962) suggested that male scientists often experienced a lonely childhood, perhaps suffering social isolation through illness or family circumstances, so that they developed a strong interest in their surrounding material world and a below average interest in other people and relationships. Maslow (1966) and Hudson (1966 and 1968) saw science as providing an emotionally undemanding activity appealing to boys moving from the calm of latency to the turbulence of adolescence. Even if these descriptions are valid they still leave open a number of questions, particularly why the same mechanisms do not operate with girls. Arising from the evidence in the literature and from our empirical studies at Chelsea College it is now possible to offer a model which is compatible with all the evidence and which also has considerable predictive potential. What we know about persons choosing science The evidence for an association between personality characteristics and an interest in science has been more fully reviewed by Head (1979). We need now only take note of the most salient features. The most obvious one is that of sex differences. The predominance of males, particularly in the physical sciences and engineering, throughout the Western world can no longer be satisfactorily attributed to cognitive differences, which are too small, nor to institutional factors. Equal opportunity in education and employment has not made science any more popular with women. Furthermore, the characteristics of those students who do opt for science show clear sex differences. Male scientists, both science students and mature, professional scientists, tend to be emotionally reticent, disliking overt emotional expression in others and themselves, and depending upon their partners in personal relationships to take the emotional initiatives. They will also tend to be authoritarian, conservative and controlled in their thinking. These differences can be seen quite early on; we have found boys aged 14 years who were opting for science to be significantly more authoritarian than their peers. Girls choosing science are not particularly emotionally reticent or rigid in their thinking, although they do seem to have low self-esteem in terms of being socially and sexually attractive. We also know that at about the age of 13 a very high proportion of boys are attracted to science and scientific careers. Thereafter, there is a steady decline of interest in science and this disillusionment extends right through the secondary-school years and into the undergraduate period. In contrast, only a minority of girls express an interest in science at any age but there is no obvious swing from science in the middle and late teens. Some further evidence has come from our use of sentence completion tests with secondary-school pupils as part of our research programme at Chelsea. Analysis of these responses provides further information on sex differences and between those opting for different subjects. For example, girls at the age of 12 and 14 years seem to take a more mature attitude to personal relationships, seeing their complexity and reciprocal nature, while boys are more exploitative. In relation to the sentence stem ‘A girl and her mother…’, girls often produce responses like ‘often go through a bad patch for a year but once they learn to understand each other, become the best of friends’ or ‘can help each other with their problems’. Similar questions, when asked of boys, tend to produce banal responses or exploitative ones, for example the parent is seen as the source of money. In contrast, boys seem to have a firmer self-identity and a clearer ambition showing more insight in response to sentence stems such as‘My main problem is…’ and ‘He/she felt proud that…’. Such findings give us some clues about the characteristics of boys and girls of these ages. If we compare boys of 14 years of age who opt for science with other boys, we find that the former have very cut-and-dried views on many issues. For example, they take the view that ‘criminals should be severely punished’ or that ‘anyone who is unpopular deserves his fate’. To the sentence stem ‘When a child will not join in group activities…’, these boys gave responses like ‘he is selfish’, ‘he must be stupid’, ‘he deserves to be unpopular’. In contrast, other boys and most girls pondered the possible causes and ways of integrating the child into the group. The science boys seemed to possess few doubts or uncertainties, they offered clear-cut answers. It was this evidence which suggested the possible model for subject choice in terms of ego-identity achievement. Ego-identity in adolescence This model was originally postulated by Erikson (1965) and then developed by Marcia (1966 and 1976). Erikson suggests that at different phases of life an individual faces a particular psycho-social problem which needs to be resolved before moving on to the next phase. For adolescents the acquisition of a clear ego-identity is the crucial task. At the beginning of adolescence, the individual is a dependant within the family and the school. By the end of adolescence he [or she]needs to make choices about career, life-style, personal relationships and ideologies. The ego-identity of that person is shaped by these choices. Erikson does not suggest that the development of an ego-identity is a once-and-for-all issue. Some problems about identity arise with the young child in the context of home and school, and others occur in later life, for example on retirement. Nevertheless, adolescence is the time when ego-identity development inevitably dominates the personal development of the individual for a while. The adolescent does not, however, need to achieve a clear ego-identity on all topics at one time. He [or she]may have a clear identity in respect to his [or her]career but still be unresolved in regard to personal relationships and ideology. In this article we are concerned with ego-identity achievement in respect to career. Marcia has put more detail onto the Erikson model and suggests that in going from the initial ego-diffusion condition to that of having achieved ego-identity, two processes are involved:crisis and commitment . Crisis in this context describes a period of intensive self-examination in which one's beliefs and values are re-examined. Commitment means that the individual has acquired clear and firm beliefs both about himself [or herself]and the world. Figure 16.1 indicates a number of possible routes to ego-identity achievements. A person may undergo crisis and commitment simultaneously and progress by route A. An alternative is to undergo a period of considerable self-doubt and self-examination in which all one's beliefs tend to be very fluid, a period known as moratorium, before acquiring beliefs for oneself and ego-identity is achieved (route B). A further possibility is that the individual may, at least for a time, hold onto beliefs and values taken without question from others, for example parents, teachers, peers. This condition is known as   foreclosure. Eventually these persons might have to face up to a period of crisis, of self-examination, and so achieve ego-identity by route C. However, foreclosure does offer an escape route and an individual might postpone indefinitely any real self-examination by clinging rigidly to his [or her]beliefs and values (route D). Ego-identity and Choosing Science We can now make the link between this model of adolescent development and subject choice in schools. For boys at the foreclosure stage, science is likely to be appealing. The physical sciences in particular, offer a conventional career choice which is likely to win approval from parents, teachers and peers. They will tend to regard the overt expression of emotions, including much such expression in the arts, as being soft and feminine. Science, with its masculine image, makes little emotional demand on an individual and seems to offer clear, precise answers to problems. Opting for science will permit and possibly reinforce emotional reticence. For a girl at the foreclosure stage the situation is very different. There is evidence that girls tend to be socialized into adult roles more through their potential of becoming a mother and housewife than through their career (Douvan and Adelson, 1966). Furthermore, these girls will tend to go into a career with a feminine image, one which already attracts many girls. Consequently, very few girls at the foreclosure stage will enter science unless they receive considerable encouragement and a model to do so from their parents and their school. Neither boys nor girls at the moratorium stage are likely to be attracted to the science that is usually presented in our schools. They are at a stage when they are likely to be concerned with a variety of complex issues; the meaning of life, the existence of God, ideologies, their emerging sexuality, their future career and life-style — too often science is seen as being purely instrumental with nothing to contribute to these debates. Science, somehow, seems to be scarcely relevant to the most important issues in our life. A proportion of both boys and girls at ego-identity achievement stage will choose science. In fact, most girls entering science are probably at this stage as they will need some self-examination and sense of commitment to make this unconventional choice. However, only a minority of adolescents will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage at the age when most pupils have to make crucial decisions about subject choice at school. This model seems to explain our observations. A large number of boys, particularly at the foreclosure stage, are initially attracted to science but there is a drift away throughout later adolescence as they undergo some crisis. The preponderance of boys at the foreclosure stage will yield the rigid, authoritarian attitudes often associated with scientists. The few girls who enter science will not usually show these foreclosure characteristics. Effects of Curriculum Changes The real use of this model linking personality development to subject choice is that it allows us to make predictions about how pupils might react to changes in school science curriculum and school organization. We can consider three possible changes: 1 Delaying subject choice : Britain is unusual in asking pupils to make crucial choices about subject options in the 13–16 age range. These decisions can only be reversed with great difficulty. What effect would delaying the choice make? In the development through the years of adolescence the number of foreclosure pupils will diminish, hence the recruitment of boys into science would be cut. More boys and girls will have reached the ego-identity achievement stage and a proportion of these will go into science. Overall there would be a reduction in the number of students choosing science, but those who do so choose will be more likely to stay happily in the subject and to possess more flexible minds. The quantitative loss would be met by a qualitative improvement. 2 Giving science a more feminine image : It is sometimes argued that science textbooks are sexist in showing illustrations of boys, rather than girls, doing practical work in the laboratory, and so forth. What effect would a  deliberate attempt to change this image have? It might make it easier for girls at the foreclosure stage to accept science so recruitment might increase. Some of these girls might, however, drift away again when they reach their crisis period. Unless the change in image was immense, boys would probably not be affected, science would still be an obvious, acceptable choice for a boy. Overall there would be some increase in the recruitment of girls, but no qualitative improvement. 3 Emphasizing the applications and relevance of science : To obtain a major qualitative improvement to recruitment in science with more girls and with students possessing imaginative, flexible minds it would be necessary to make science appealing to boys and girls at the moratorium stage. In that event science must be seen to be relevant to the issues which concern them. The probable implication is that science would need to be presented in the context of the needs of society and individuals. Probably a case-study approach involving the application of science, and the interaction with other disciplines, would be needed. Our knowledge about the girls' concern with personal relationships suggests that the introduction of some elements of the social sciences into the case studies might prove attractive. Is it possible to change school science in this fashion and still preserve the essential character of science itself? Clearly there would need to be some drastic pruning of content. Perhaps science teachers should not attempt to cover their subjects so comprehensively. A history teacher is content to cover the history of one country or continent over a few decades. Perhaps we must make similar choices. It is interesting to notice that the Association for Science Education (1979) policy statement in Britain and the proposals on school physics coming from the Institute for Science Education (IPN) in Kiel are advocating such changes. The difference is that we are now offering a formal psychological model to suggest that if we want to reduce the current encapsulation of science, if we want to recruit a different sort of student, then certain curriculum changes are needed. Girl Friendly Science and the Girl Friendly School Judith Whyte Approximately three times as many boys as girls take O level physics and approximately four times as many take CSE physics. Over 90 per cent of entries in all technical subjects are from boys. This means that schoolgirls are ineligible for a wide range of courses in further and higher education and for entry to occupations requiring a scientific or technical base. Female exclusion from science and technology, even if it is apparently by girls' own choice, also means that as citizens their ability to understand and control their environment is limited. Nevertheless, most schools consider they are already providing equal opportunities by neutral treatment of the two sexes (Bloomfield, 1984). In effect, ignoring the effects of gender in this way merely reinforces stereotyping because it does nothing to challenge the definition of certain aspects of the curriculum as masculine or feminine. Girls Into Science and Technology (GIST) was the first major schools-based project addressing problems of sex stereotyping at school, and was an example of ‘action research’ in education; the project simultaneously took action to improve girls' achievement in science and technology and investigated the reasons for their under-achievement. The project team collaborated with teachers in eight co-educational comprehensive schools in the Greater Manchester area to devise and implement intervention strategies designed to improve girls' attitudes to the physical sciences and technical subjects. Two other schools were involved as controls where attitude testing but no interventions took place.[…] The approach was collaborative: teachers were invited to work with the team as equal partners in the attempts both to investigate and find solutions to the GIST problem. However, very few of the teachers even recognized the issue as one of professional concern at the start of the project, and most of the first  two years was spent in establishing the educational importance of the issue and working towards the development of feasible intervention strategies. The project and its outcomes have been fully described elsewhere (Smail et al ., 1982; Kelly, Whyte and Smail, 1984; Whyte in press). GIST had more success in altering children's attitudes than their subject choices, suggesting that it is easier to change attitudes and beliefs than actual behaviour. Pupils in action schools became markedly less stereotyped than pupils in control schools. They also had slightly more positive attitudes towards science and scientists and were less likely to define them as exclusively masculine. Despite some evidence of change in teachers' attitudes and behaviour, they themselves were reluctant to admit that the project had influenced them. According to an evaluation report this may reflect an unwillingness to admit that in the past schools have been sex biased (Payne, Cuff and Hustler, 1984). The GIST hypothesis was that female under-achievement in science and technology is at least partly socially constructed by the school, an hypothesis based on research evidence as well as critical feminist analysis (see, for example, Kelly, 1981). During the project there was a shift away from locating the issue as one of girls' motivation towards attempts to change the nature of school science. One of the main gains from the GIST project has been the clarification of what is meant by a ‘girl friendly’, science, that is a science which will appeal equally to the interests and concerns of girls as well as boys.[…] Making Science More Girl Friendly Several interventions were designed to make science more girl friendly. Schools and teachers tried curriculum development to build on girls' science interests, changing patterns of classroom interaction, single sex groups and classes. The largest scale intervention was the VISTA programme, which consisted of women scientists and technologists visiting schools to talk to children about an aspect of their jobs already being covered in the school science syllabus. VISTA made science more girl friendly in two ways: both boys and girls were offered an attractive image of a competent woman scientist, and talks concentrated on social and industrial applications of science, an element too often missing from science at school. One school was so impressed by the children's positive reactions that they completely revamped the science work in the first two years to include more social and human applications of science. The survey of children's attitudes helped here: research such as Ormerod's (1971; Ormerod and Duckworth, 1975) had shown that girls were interested in the social implications of science, but did not tell teachers what the desirable teaching approach might be in practice. Would science in the home be a starter? A question from our survey asked children whether they would like to know more about how a vacuum cleaner works; hardly anyone did, and girls were even less curious than boys. This told us that any simplistic assumptions about featuring ‘female’ domestic interests in science would  probably meet with failure. The rest of the questionnaire about science curiosity showed that all the children were enthusiastic about learning science, and that girls were keen to know more about nature, the environment and medical science. Over 50 per cent, and in some cases over 60 per cent said they would like to learn about the human heart, germs and illnesses, how our muscles work, what food is good for you, life in the sea, what makes a rainbow appear and how a record is made. It was helpful that these topics also interested boys. At present the science curriculum is structured around physical science interests, on which boys are keener (how motor cars work, atoms and molecules); we were able to recommend that teaching build on the overlapping interests of the two sexes, because girls as well as boys want to know more about human biology and spectacular features of the environment (animals in the jungle, volcanoes and earthquakes, acids and chemicals). The less immediately attractive parts of science could be approached through these interests, for instance teaching ‘forces’ by beginning with the action of muscles in the human arm, and ‘light’via the dissection of a bull's eye. When women scientists employ such approaches, and describe their own work, as happened during the VISTA programme, girls are receiving double encouragement. These examples indicate some of the features of girl friendly science: it builds on girls' interests, not just boys'; it explicitly encourages girls to see themselves as potential scientists, and it includes some of the social and human implications and applications of science. Other GIST Interventions All the GIST schools were mixed comprehensives, and at first teachers were most unwilling to separate boys and girls at all, on the grounds that it ran counter to their co-educational comprehensive philosophy. Then certain teachers were particularly struck by the evidence of large differences in the interests and experience children brought with them to school. Girls had far less ‘tinkering’ experience than boys and the connection with their lesser interest in topics like ‘how electricity is produced’seemed obvious. Several special science or craft clubs were organized in the lunch hour for girls only and in two schools teachers planned single-sex teaching. As we shall see, it was in these two schools that the largest measurable changes of attitude and option choice occurred. For a more girl friendly science, it seems vital that teachers should come to see that when all the masculine packaging, evident in textbooks and resources as well as teachers' and boys' behaviour in the classroom, is removed, girls can be very enthusiastic about science.[…] Alison Kelly sees at least four distinct senses in which it can be argued that science is masculine. First, the pupils, teachers and practitioners of science are overwhelmingly male in terms of numbers; second, school science is packaged and presented to appeal to boys, not girls; third, classroom behaviours and interaction operate to reconstruct science as a male activity, and  finally it has been suggested that ‘scientific’ thinking embodies an intrinsically masculine world view. The GIST interventions described above relate to three of these: VISTA women, albeit briefly and temporarily, redressed the numerical balance by offering female role models of practising scientists; VISTA and the curriculum development which followed involved a limited ‘repackaging’ of science to remove its exclusively masculine appeal, and the single-sex classes and classroom observation showed how science comes to be defined as ‘masculine’in the mixed school. The fourth point, the idea that science is intrinsically masculine, can be sustained only by clinging to an irredeemably narrow conception of science and scientific thinking. The industrial and social impact of science on health, on people, on the environment, a focus on the beauty and complexity of the natural world, are notable omissions from the school science syllabus. Girls are not uninterested in science, they are bored by the limited version of it they meet in school. One of the purposes of an extended period of single-sex science teaching might be to let teachers see how girls approach scientific matters, and to discover, what may well be the case, that girls are just as capable of ‘scientific thinking’ as boys. Margaret Spear, in a different study from the one reported in this volume, found that for identical work boys were marked higher than girls for supposed understanding of principles, aptitude for science and O level suitability (Spear, 1984). Outcomes Children enjoyed the VISTA visits according to the questionnaire returns in the third year; they liked meeting scientists and learning about a range of jobs. Girls were slightly more positive than boys. Overall, the attitudes of children in the action schools where all the interventions took place became noticeably more liberal, especially on sex role and occupational stereotypes and the ‘masculinity’ of science. In general, attitudes to science itself became more negative. This is a universal phenomenon (Gardner, 1984). Children begin secondary school with high expectations of science, but become disillusioned and uninterested, especially in physics. However, the decline in science interest was less marked in GIST action than in control schools, indicating a possible causal effect of the VISTA visits and other interventions, and on boys as much as girls. It appears that if girls' interests are catered for, if teachers become aware of the need for careful classroom management to ensure girls' participation, if the social and human implications of science and technology are stressed, girls will respond positively. There will continue to be problems if science teachers are personally doubtful about girls' ability to do science well; even if their doubts are not voiced (and anecdotal evidence suggests they sometimes are), girls are unlikely to respond unless teachers show they believe that girls have something to offer science as well as the reverse. The significant difference between action and control schools concerning attitudes was not matched by an action/control difference in option choices. In most schools the percentage of girls choosing physics in the GIST cohort increased in comparison with previous years. However, the increase in control schools was as large as in the action schools! The girl friendly school Unfortunately the pattern of option choice and attitude differences is not perfectly matched within each school. That is to say, certain action schools were successful in changing attitudes, while others were successful in shifting option choices. Only one school was successful on both counts. The implication is that pupil attitude change is not sufficient on its own to ensure that pupils will actually make non-traditional option choices. Presumably the major mediating factors are the teachers, and the school, concerned. Teacher Attitudes […] The most interesting aspect of the teachers' response is their unwillingness to admit to any change of attitude or practice as a result of GIST. Yet both the field notes and the evaluation report provide clear evidence that the staff had become much more aware of, and informed about, girls' under-achievement in science and technology and the possible actions which schools could take. Many mentioned the practical steps they had already devised: altering curriculum materials, deliberately avoiding the use of stereotyped language, studying patterns of classroom interaction and thinking of ways to increase girls' participation. The evaluators noted the grudgingness of teachers to admit to changes in their own beliefs or practices and ascribed it to an unwillingness to accept the implied criticism that previous practice had, even unintentionally, discouraged girls. A national survey of teachers' attitudes to equal opportunities found that men were more likely to be opposed to promoting equal opportunities than women, but that differences in subject taught were more important than the sex of the teacher in determining his or her attitude. Teachers of maths, physical science and crafts were the least in favour of greater equality (Pratt, Bloomfield and Seale, 1984). Spear also found in a study of teachers' attitudes to girls and technology that the most sex-differentiated replies came from science teachers (Spear in this volume). On both counts, of sex and subjects taught, the GIST teachers were the least promising group which could have been chosen to promote sex equality. Alison Kelly worked with some of her students to carry out a minor evaluation of changes in GIST teachers' attitudes in comparison with a national sample (Kelly et al ., 1984). Women again proved to be more emphatic about  sex equality than men, and London teachers were more feminist than others. GIST teachers were slightly less traditional and more in favour of equality of the sexes than other teachers. Teachers in GIST schools were also slightly more likely to agree with statements suggesting that girls ‘lose out’ in classroom interactions and receive less encouragement in science than boys. This is likely to be an effect of the classroom observation work carried out with GIST teachers (for a full account see Whyte, 1984). However, the GIST teachers of physical science were less convinced than their colleagues elsewhere of the importance of finding ways to encourage girls in their subject. It may be that their experience of GIST has given them a better idea of the amount of work and energy involved in trying to change things (Kelly et al ., 1984). School atmosphere Whatever may be the attitude of any individual teacher, if s/he does not receive adequate support from the school in implementing change, s/he is likely to give up, or decide that the innovation is not worth the extra time and energy required. [… ]The extent to which GIST was successful in particular schools appears to have been less dependent on the team's efforts than on the existing school ethos and whether it was consistent with responding to the demand for genuine equality of opportunity. In other words, the project probably did not change schools, but change may have been most likely to occur in schools which were open to the innovation and to the ideas of equality presented by the project. Closer study of between-school differences (see Kelly et al ., 1984; Whyte in press) shows that attitude change was most marked in three action schools. In one, Moss Green, there had also been an increase in the percentage of girls opting for chemistry, physics and technical crafts. In the other two, Edgehill and Meadowvale, there had been an increase in at least two of these. These schools appeared to have several things in common: first, each could be characterized as an ‘innovative’ school in some sense. Moss Green was a custom-built community school, with a commitment to multicultural education and a staff who were used to implementing innovations such as open-plan classrooms, and, more recently, an alternative curriculum for fourth and fifth years. At Edgehill, the science department was divided into biological and environmental sciences, instead of the traditional biology, physics and chemistry; the head teacher was a conscious advocate of innovation in comprehensive schooling; in the third school, Meadowvale, the science department had decided to redraft its entire first and second year science curriculum, in part because of the children's response to the VISTA visits organized by GIST. The least successful schools were those which implemented the minimum programme asked for by GIST: administration of questionnaires to children, allowing women visitors into the school and piloting, more or less reluctantly, teaching materials devised by the team. The successful schools, in contrast, took up more GIST suggestions more enthusiastically, or even developed their own ideas for interventions. For example at Edgehill, a GIST pack for discussion of sex roles —Gender in Our Lives — was used in the personal and social education lessons, with teachers talking honestly and openly about their personal experience; as it happened they found themselves in the middle of a discussion about fathers being present at childbirth, and the children were obviously fascinated by this new view of their teachers as emotional beings.[…] Willingness to talk directly to pupils about the aims of GIST was another feature of the more successful schools. Despite requests from the team to discuss the issue with children, few teachers revealed the purpose of the project to their classes. Some teachers told the evaluators that they did not feel justified in talking to pupils about the girls and science problem, and gave the impression that they felt to do so would be tantamount to propaganda. At Moss Green, GIST was called in to address the second-year class before they made craft mini-options, to stress how important it was for girls to consider getting a grounding in technology. Far greater numbers of girls opted for technical subjects than had ever done so before. The school also ran single-sex clubs. In comparison, there was no visible explicit discussion of sex roles at either of the two least successful schools. The GIST workpack,Gender in Our Lives , was used at another school, but a senior member of management had effectively insisted they use it, and some teachers did so with considerable reservations, afterwards reporting almost complete failure to alter children's prejudices. We had looked for some impact from the presence of women in senior positions in school, but the highest percentage of women at Scale 4 or above in any school was 35 per cent. In the more successful schools, women held relatively more senior posts in the science department or in the school. In the two least successful schools it is notable that the proportion of senior women was lowest, in one case despite the fact that the head teacher was a woman. In summary, the most successful schools appeared to have the following characteristics: teachers who planned and implemented their own interventions; teachers who were prepared to discuss the GIST problem with children, rather than simply accepting VISTA and other interventions and hoping that an implicit message would get through; staff, especially at a senior level, who had a positive commitment to the aims of the project; a progressive ethos which fitted comfortably with the equal-opportunity aims of GIST; a relatively higher proportion of women staff at senior levels. […] The third element, the innovative practice advocated, became refined during rather than before the project. The use of questionnaires fed back to teachers revealed the base of interest and enthusiasm for science too often missed by schools concerned to promote a curriculum informally based on male interests. Observation in labs and workshops highlighted the depressing effect on girls' performance of the boys' claim to science as their subject. We are much clearer now than at the beginning about how to approach science in a more girl friendly way (see Smail, 1983, 1984), and the clarity is due in part to the way we have worked with teachers. The conditions for a girl friendly school may be more difficult to bring about, for it would seem that teachers must be openly and visibly concerned about equality before pupils will change their choices; schools with traditional norms, limited or formal communication channels, and with few women in senior positions will be much slower to adapt to changed female expectations. Conclusion […] Teachers were always busy, and many schools put GIST on a rather lower priority than dealing with the impact of unemployment, school reorganization, discipline or curricular problems. It was often difficult to get schools to provide even basic information such as the breakdown of subject choice by sex, and members of the team frequently had to extract the information themselves from school data. Oddly enough, the control schools, where no interventions took place, were more co-operative and efficient in returning questionnaires than action schools. Similarly, the impact of GIST may have been as great in schools which had no contact with the project at all, because of the changing climate of opinion in which girls' under-achievement in science and technology came to be seen as a serious educational issue.

The Social Nature of the Curriculum (a) Three Curricular Traditions and their Implications, Ivor Goodson Since the nineteenth century ‘academic subjects’ and written examinations have become closely interconnected. The alliance, whether viewed as divine or malign, was formally enshrined in the School Certificate examination defined in 1917. Since that date certain material implications have followed for those subgroups and school subjects promoting or representing the academic tradition. Questions of theoretical base or methodological perspective have often been subsumed by or channelled into the construction of acceptable written examinations. For the groups and associations promoting themselves as school subjects, and irresistibly drawn to claiming ‘academic status’, a central criterion has been whether the subjects' content could be tested by written examinations for an ‘able’ clientele. Acceptance of the criterion of examinability affects both the content and form of the knowledge presented but carries with it the guarantee of high status. The academic tradition is content-focused and typically stresses abstract and theoretical knowledge for examination. The utilitarian tradition is conversely of low status, dealing with practical knowledge sometimes not amenable to the current A level mode of written examination. Utilitarian knowledge is related to those non-professional vocations in which the majority of people work for most of their adult life. The low status of utilitarian knowledge also applies to the personal, social and commonsense knowledge stressed by those pursuing the pedagogic tradition. Whilst all school knowledge has at least an implicit pedagogy this tradition places the ‘way the child learns’ as the central concern in devising subject content. These traditions are viewed as three ‘centres of gravity’, in the arguments about styles of curriculum. They do not represent a complete list of the ‘traditions’ in English curricula nor are they timeless entities; they simply represent three clear constellations of curriculum styles which recur in the  history of the school subjects under study. In this sense they are perhaps best viewed as strategic clusters employed to help in the scrutiny of curriculum changes and conflicts.[…] The existence of academic, pedagogic and utilitarian traditions in school curricula has its origins in the separate sectors of the educational system which preceded the comprehensive era. The continuance of these traditions and the continuing dominance of the academic tradition bear testimony that the fundamental structures of curriculum have withstood comprehensive reorganization. As in the tripartite system so in the comprehensive system, academic subjects for able pupils are accorded the highest status and resources. The triple alliance between academic subjects, academic examinations and able pupils ensures that comprehensive schools provide similar patterns of curriculum differentiation to previous school systems. For the teachers who have to cater for all kinds of pupils this concentration on a particular kind of pupil and a particular kind of educational success poses the same dilemma voiced by the rural studies teacher in response to the promotion of academic examinations in his subject; ‘Once again we can see the unwanted children of lower intelligence being made servants of the juggernaut of documented evidence, the inflated examination.’ This conclusion summarizes the continuing choice: True education is not for every man the scrap of paper he leaves school with. Dare we as teachers admit this? Dare we risk our existence by forcibly expressing our views on this? While we pause after the first phase of our acceptance are we to rely on exams for all to prove ourselves worthy of the kindly eye of the state? The deep structures of curriculum differentiation are historically linked to different educational sectors, to different social class clienteles and occupational destinations, to different status hierarchies. Differentiated curricula and the social structure are matched on very firm foundations: by building on these foundations comprehensive reorganization has had to accept the antecedent structures which contradict its stated ideal.[…] The legacy of differentiated status for the academic, utilitarian and pedagogic traditions draws on tripartite patterns of educational organization. In considering curriculum change it is vital to understand that this tripartite hierarchy of status has been reproduced not only in the respective parity of esteem between different categories of subject but also to kinds of knowledge within subjects. At the later level, scrutiny of ‘what counts as education’ is necessary. For instance, much of the debate about teaching craft and technology as a way of reinstating practical curricula has missed this point. Given the status patterns discerned one might expect that even if technology were to achieve high status and acceptance the version which would ‘count as education’ would be academic and theoretical and therefore stand in contradiction to more practical objectives. The differentiated status of academic, utilitarian and pedagogic traditions pervades both the type of subject and the  internal form of each subject. Curriculum reform needs to address both of these levels of differentiation. The differentiated status of the three curriculum traditions discerned and their link with the way finance and resources are allocated and pursued is confirmed by a number of studies already undertaken. Banks' study of parity and prestige in the English secondary system ends by stressing ‘the persistence of the academic tradition’ throughout that period of the system's existence.’ Hanson's study of art education and Dodd's work on technology offer similar evidence.a The latter speaking of the Crowther Report noted that they had shown how ‘an alternative route to knowledge’ lay through practical subjects which did not destroy the intellectual curiosity of the pupil in the way associated with the ‘academic’ones. Dodd notes that ‘the problems lay in the status of practical subjects by tradition second class…. Discussion on its own is insufficient and it requires legitimization by those institutions who hold this facility (universities, examination boards, employers and society at large).’ As we have seen, the legitimizing institutions together with established and indeed aspiring subject groups share the vested interest in the belief that ‘a scholarly discipline’ is needed if a school subject is to be granted high status. The stranglehold of the academic tradition has seldom been seriously threatened by its overwhelming need to shun ‘practical utility’. The theme which Dodd points to was just as common when the 1904 regulations were established. A contemporary noted that the school curriculum was ‘subordinated to that literary instruction which makes for academic culture, but is of no practical utility, to the classes for whom the local authorities should principally cater’. The dominance of the academic tradition is patently supported by the major vested interest groups within education and the broader society. Yet the very need for academic subjects to escape from allegations of ‘practical utility’ may yet lead to irresistible pressure for change in the period of economic malaise which we currently confront. (b) The Schooling of Science, Michael F. D. Young Science emerged later as a branch of education and its assimilation into the existing institutions and structures was not achieved without some noticeable exercises of accommodation. This view of the incorporation of natural science into the school curriculum is taken by David Layton, who offers us a valuable account of this process of ‘accommodation’ in the late nineteenth century, complementary to his earlier study of the demise of ‘the science of common things’. In particular he describes how one conception of ‘pure’ laboratory science was established which enabled school science to be justified in terms of the prevailing tradition of liberal education and its devotion to ‘the discipline of the mind, the attainment of habits of controlled attention and the exercise of reasoning powers and memory’. Thus Chemistry and Physics could comfortably claim a place alongside the Classics and Mathematics. Likewise, the purpose of introducing science into the secondary schools was never in doubt to such leading advocates as H. E. Roscoe, the first President of the Association of Public School Science Masters (the precursor of our Association for Science Education); school science was, for Roscoe, as Layton quotes him, to be ‘the means of sifting out from the great mass of the people those golden grains of genius which now are too often lost amongst the sands of mediocrity’. A consequence of this accommodation was, as Layton puts it, that ‘the application of science to everyday life had (by the 1870s) disappeared…the learner [of course only those learners who experienced any science teaching at all— M.Y.] was slowly inducted into the ways of the scientist — a particular type of scientist also — the ‘pure’’ researcher’. Largely through the method of government recognition and financing of laboratories, the separation of school science into separate ‘subjects’, physics, chemistry, and biology, became firmly established before the end of the century, as did for quite other reasons the exclusion of geology. Furthermore, the models of ‘subject’ teaching which dominated (and in many ways still do) experimental work were part of this process. As Layton describes it, school chemistry became the ‘easily organized and easily examined exercises in qualitative analysis…[in which]packets of powder were sent out [to the schools]and packets of paper were returned when the pupils had completed the routine of taking the solution through the charts’; if anyone asked ‘why?’, ‘training of the faculties of observation and reasoning’ would doubtless have been the reply. Likewise in physics pupils were offered ‘a starvation course on the precise measurement of physical quantities…[for, as an influential text of the time began]‘Physics is essentially the science of measurements’’. Of course, many things have changed, but even in the Nuffield era ‘the emphasis has remained on abstract…‘technically sweet’ science, dissociated from its applications and implications’. Before turning to the attempts to revitalize science teaching which have emerged since the early 1960s, it is important to ask the question ‘Why did school science emerge in the way it did?’ Is it adequate to see it as an accommodation to existing educational structures, as Layton does? I suggest we need to try and grasp both the innovations Layton describes and the structures they confronted in terms of their wider political and economic significance. Alternative traditions of science education in which scientific knowledge was conceived, among other things ‘as an instrument in the pursuit of political independence and social emancipation’, had, Layton writes, become ‘casualties in a process of natural selection as the educational environment had become progressively more sharply defined’. The problem with this kind of social Darwinist view is that it treats a social process, selection, as natural , rather than as an outcome of certain activities and interests in particular historical contexts. This is indicated in Layton's references to the views of science on the one hand in terms of‘the disinterested pursuit of truth’, and on the other, particularly by those involved in the Great Exhibition, as ‘the producer for the industrial market place (so that science was to be studied for the economic benefits it would yield)’. The question of economic benefits of science points to a concern with the character of the economy at the time and to the importance of considering the demise of the attempts to implement a science curriculum ‘as practice’ and the success of the science curriculum ‘as fact’in the context of changes in Victorian capitalism.[…] Science education was envisaged, as David Layton tells us, by some early nineteenth century radicals like Richard Carlile as undermining dogma and leading to social emancipation. The process and practice of the schooling of science, for all its changes, has become almost the opposite —‘necessarily dogmatic’ according to Jevons and many others, and producing technological domination rather than emancipation. This paper has largely been limited to the processes within education — the ways they have been part of a wider process of economic and political domination have been little more than hinted at. Inevitably oversimplifying, I would summarize what I have tried to say by suggesting that the schooling of science has produced three kinds of people, whose interrelations have up till now led to opposition to any attempts to realize the emancipatory potential Carlile saw. They are: (a) ‘Pure scientists’, whose relations with nature are at best those of abstracted understanding. This is not to deny the discoveries that have been made, but to state that the purposes that have given meaning to the scientists' pursuit of truth have been success in and the sustaining of the scientific establishment. (b) The ‘applied scientist’ whose identity is fundamentally pragmatic — given something to be done, he [or she]will work out how to do it. Ends are given, but no one asks by or for whom. Just as the pure scientist, from his [or her]early training, absolves himself [or herself]from the uses to which  his [or her]discoveries are put, rather than seeing that the discoveries themselves are inescapably linked to an economy on which he [or she]depends for support, so the applied scientist accepts that others define the goals that he [or she]has to achieve rather than seeing that his [or her]own means or technology itself presupposes a social order, set of priorities or goals. (c) The identifiable failures of school science — the anti-science anti-technologists who can see science only as domination rather than that science as domination is itself a historical product, and the mass of people whose schooling teaches them that science is a specialized activity over which they neither have nor could have any control. (c) The Curriculum and National Identity, Chris Brown It is no coincidence that mass schooling was invented at roughly the time when nation states had come into existence and the need arose to instil in their citizens the idea that the new entity had first claim on their loyalties. The more social cohesion was rendered problematic by the existence of cleavages in relation to ethnicity, language etc. the more important was an efficient schooling system. The example of the United States is well known: …each American school has a national flag flying outside the school and usually a flag in each classroom. Also, the national anthem is regularly used in school assemblies and sporting events: and paintings of George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and other historic American figures are prominent in schools. (Nelson, 1978, pp. 145–6)[…] In Britain it is the curriculum which bears the main burden of transmitting the national idea. History may be cited as an example, not least because in the post-Falklands era several leading figures, including Sir Keith Joseph and Professor Hugh Thomas, have singled it out for special mention in connection with‘understanding the shared values which are a distinctive feature of British Society’. Despite developments such as Schools Council history and a growing interest in African, Caribbean and Indian history, school history is unlikely ever to escape the grip of nationalism.[…] Could one envisage a curriculum without history? Many people would feel that if children grew up to know nothing of their ‘heritage’ this would be a serious threat to national identity. People may not remember whatever detailed analysis was developed for them as schoolchildren, but certain models or ‘general sketches’…do remain, and they inform everyday thinking closely, especially as they are exercised over and again by politicians and the media seeking to make public sense of current events. If an example is needed to make this clearer one can be found in the special place occupied by the Second World War in public consciousness in Britain and, more particularly, in Margaret Thatcher's increasingly deliberate manipulation of Churchillian sketches over the period of the Falklands crisis. (Wright, 1984, pp. 49–50) Unlike history, the ‘new’ geography would appear to have rid itself of imperialist associations. However, quite apart from the persistence of a great deal of ‘geography of the British Isles’ syllabuses, the new scientific and conceptual geography has not appeared in schools because of some intrinsic merit. On the contrary, its growth coincided with the collapse of empire. So long as the world was politically, and militarily, if not economically, permeated with British influence, school geography could safely and fruitfully explore even the most unlikely regions. In a world where British influence is conspicuously waning it might not be in the interests of a secure national identity to throw it open for young Britons to gaze on. History, on the other hand, can be continually re-written to buttress the national ideal. There is little point in reviewing every curriculum subject. Historical and sociological studies of the curriculum have shown us that school subjects are not simply rationally selected for explicit educational aims but are reflections of larger social and political forces. Not all subjects contribute equally to fostering national identity. Nor do they all function in the same way. Science for instance makes its contribution by studiously avoiding social and political comment: it thus misses the way that it is inextricably bound up with dominant values, amongst them attitudes which assume ethnocentric and nationalistic positions. Even modern languages may be detached from their respective cultures and contribute to the unspoken notion that other societies are slightly queer. The point is that in nation-states, education systems are provided by the state authorities and will thus inevitably have the net effect of focusing positive views of the nation they serve. Britain may not need to flaunt nationalism in the way characteristic of the United States but its education system can no more ignore the task of sustaining the national identity than education systems in any other nation-state. (d) Contrasting Models in School Geography, Rob Gilbert Differences between explaining physical processes and human action make impossible a unified society-environment study based on a single explanatory paradigm. Explanatory models which serve for one cannot serve for the other. The dominance of the traditions of environmental and economic determinism are a handicap to further profitable application of geographical knowledge to human affairs. As one geographer has pointed out: …until subject matter theories with different epistemological characteristics have been formulated, the focus of our spatial planning must continue to be on supermarkets, roads and airports, and not on the needs and desires of those individual human beings that the facilities allegedly are constructed to serve. This tradition and its inherent contradictions have been noted before, as when an historian of the discipline wrote almost twenty years ago: Many geographers have never been deeply concerned with ultimate objectives of social character, and some would sincerely regard efforts to provide directives for human action as presumptuous and arrogant. But sooner or later writers ask whether geography really is a human study at all, possibly because some writers on human geography appear to have studied almost everything except the people. That environmentalism may be superseded in schools, as it appears largely to have been in universities, by the locational analysis school is no guarantee of a more appropriate form of explanation. For, as has been suggested in the texts reviewed, the old paradigms may merely be replaced by a new form of determinism, this time based on space. Here again the results of human activity are explained without recourse to conscious human agents or social contexts. The locational analysis school can be said to have reified ‘the spatial’ as the basis of the subject matter of the discipline. At the same time it diverted attention away from the underlying structural explanations of society and economy, as part of a general process of ‘mystification’ whereby surface manifestations are confused for root causes. Thus statements in the text material which attribute spatial differences to ‘different kinds of people’, or government planning, or factors of location such as the availability and stability of a labour market, have arbitrarily stopped the causal chain at a point which omits social, economic and political  considerations. To claim that explanation in geography can go no further is only to say that it is inadequate to its task, and ignores the fact that many geographers are going further: Geographical differentiation is a detail — albeit an important detail — and a result of the operation of social systems. It is not a fundamental property of such systems. The space-economy for example is simply the spatial pattern of organization created by the industrial economy; it is not an independent variable. This point has been clearly demonstrated by recent reconsiderations of, for example, the nature of uneven regional development and economic under-development which show that both processes, whilst creating spatial patterns are, more fundamentally, outcomes of the operation of the economy rather than the result of autonomous geographical factors. To concentrate on the latter is not only superficial, it is also incorrect. The images of human nature and society built into the explanatory paradigms which dominate school curricula and texts are inadequate. They restrict the extent to which human action can be understood, substituting explanations based on a plastic model of the individual and a narrow and amorphous model of social relations and structure. In focusing on concrete outcomes of social activity, and explaining them through natural causal models, geographers have disguised the social origins of these outcomes and the political assumptions and implications of their theories. Olsson, in his analysis of urban geographical theories and their usefulness, concludes that: the explanatory power and potential planning applicability of geographic theory does not depend on the employed and usually specified spatial axioms but rather on the unspecified axioms about individual and group behaviour. Until these underlying images of individual and society are recognized, and their study given the explicit attention it deserves, the significance of geographical knowledge for social practice will not be realized, nor the constraints it currently imposes overcome. (e)‘Political’ Differences in English Teaching, Margaret Mathieson As it has been seen to touch upon every aspect of pupils' lives, most particularly the emotional, English has become increasingly diffuse. Moreover, there are within it, more than most other subjects, marked political differences between the leading figures in the field. As they relate to decision-making about priorities and responsibilities in the classroom, these differences must affect many English teachers' sense of purpose and professional confidence.[…] Before examining conflicting views about priorities within the four main activities within English — literature, creativity, discrimination, and classroom talk — it is useful to consider the term ‘political’ in reference to definitions currently being made by leading figures concerned with English in schools. Within the last ten years, during which time interest had shifted to the curriculum of the average and below-average child, widespread dissatisfaction has been expressed with the traditional grammar school education. Its specialist, academic, authoritarian elements have been persistently criticized, partly because they ignored progressives' demands for children's activity, participation and development through discovery, and partly because of the perceived irrelevance of this education to the lives of working-class children, the majority of whom have failed to benefit from it. Progressives, and radicals supporting reorganization of the schools and the introduction of non-streaming, are carrying their attack upon the grammar schools' élitism into the curriculum, dismantling the traditional subjects by rearranging them through interdisciplinary work, projects and themes. As this relates to English, the central concern of which has been the dissemination of liberal culture throughout society, it has undergone considerable revision. Literature, usually the major part of English in the grammar schools, has received the most severe overhauling, but because of the current unacceptability to many educators of a ‘middle-class’ curriculum for all our pupils, every activity in English has been given a different set of emphases.[…] Recent anxiety about the grammar schools' perceived responsibility for reinforcing divisions between the middle and working classes, and about the wastage of talent which their continued existence perpetuated, has brought their traditional curriculum under severe attack. In addition, as far as English has been concerned, others besides progressives and radicals have questioned the value of academic approaches for working-class pupils. G. H. Bantock and David Holbrook, who are very concerned about exploitation by commercial culture of working-class pupils, have argued that the watered-down grammar school curriculum has failed to affect the lives of the great majority. Although not wishing to disturb the present social system in any fundamental way, they, like the radical educators, have proposed the revival of popular culture. Instead of set books, periods of literature and preparation for examinations, they propose more mime, dance, poetry reading and writing, an affective  education for pupils unreceptive to the academic, and susceptible to the commercial. Thus, both radicals and élitists have severely shaken the early certainty about the worthwhileness of attempts to disseminate liberal culture as widely as teachers' skills and school conditions permitted. And within recent years, the question of which culture is for whom is being raised in connection with every one of their activities. If literature and its related activities are tainted with ‘middle-class’ exclusiveness and, it appears, that teachers engaging pupils in these are ‘imposing’alien values upon working-class pupils, it follows that they must move into the lives of working-class pupils to encourage that culture which, up till now, the largely irrelevant curriculum has ‘stifled’[…] After surveying the general scene it is useful to look at existing differences between educators about each of the four main activities. The teaching of literature has been the activity most profoundly affected by these conflicting views. Pupils of Leavis continue to support his concept of the centrality of the literary experience, denying its identification with middle-class culture and the charge of imposing alien values upon working-class children. Although G. H. Bantock and David Holbrook attack the ‘watered-down’ curriculum for secondary modern children, they insist upon the value of literature in the school experience of all pupils. They suggest approaching the average and below-average children through mime, dance and personal composition. Nevertheless, the proposed stimuli are myth and folk song and, hopefully, these are meant to lead on to the poetry of Blake and Shakespeare. Like Arnold and Leavis these writers, concerned above all with what Holbrook calls the children's ‘humanity’, believe that this can be touched and sensitized by engagement with great works of art. Today, Holbrook and his supporters, opposing the shift of emphasis to ‘relevant’ social or environmental studies, simply disclaim the accusation of endorsing middle-class values; they insist upon the universality of the literary experience which, if neglected, will mean severe imaginative deprivation for children continually exposed to what, they argue, are the banalities of the mass media.[…] The unwillingness of some English teachers to teach literature stems from their convictions about the neglected richness of working-class culture. While the Language in Use team wish to order priorities differently and the Humanities Project's teachers wish to rearrange literature to illustrate relevant social issues, there is an extreme form of resistance to literature on the grounds that it is part of the ‘syllabus of established middle-class culture’. In This New Season , a book about English teaching in Stepney, Chris Searle expresses his belief in the validity of working-class culture and the English teacher's responsibility to encourage children's pride in their own identity. Literature, apart from a reference to the Liverpool poets, is excluded from his working-class pupils' experience of English in school. Instead, Searle proposes stimulation of pupil's personal writing about their feelings and environment. Having identified the academic curriculum with competitive  examinations and the status-seeking of the middle classes , Searle excludes all works of art from the classroom except the pupils' own creations and those which reflect their lives. Although their reasons differ and their perspectives on literature conflict, the élitists like Bantock and Holbrook and a radical like Searle face English teachers with proposals based on similar assumptions. Arguing that the curriculum of the working-class pupils should be specially chosen to suit their environment, experiences and abilities, they indicate their lack of interest in the question of academic achievement with its possibility of pupils' upward social mobility. Bantock and Holbrook seek no reorganization of the social structure, investing their hopes for greater happiness in the power of creativity and great art to bring self-awareness and fulfilment. Searle, and teachers with his views, reject the present social system, recommending that ways be found to give working-class pupils confidence and pride in their cultural identity. They do not propose to enter into work in school which makes achievement in competitive examinations possible, having judged this to be highly undesirable. Turning to the field of children's creativity we find that the area of agreement is far larger than that about literature. So strong have been the influences here — of progressivism with its romantic view of childhood's vision, of anti-industrialism, of egalitarianism which has democratized art in every form, of therapy — that the great majority of educators wish to encourage pupils' growth through creativity. Disagreement is mainly about whether great literature or the children's own environment and experiences should provide the stimuli for this work. It is a debate which reflects the overall political dispute about the role of high art in the classroom. While Bantock, Holbrook, Inglis and those English teachers who support the ‘élitists’, recommend the employment of stimuli drawn exclusively from the music, painting and literature of high art, and make it clear that they view creativity partly as a way back into appreciation, a radical teacher like Searle rejects this culture completely. Unlike the élitists, many of whom wish to compensate for working-class children's loss of traditional agricultural satisfactions through a mainly affective curriculum, Searle recommends creativity to strengthen working-class children's confidence and pride in their own identity. The severest critics of exclusively personal, creative writing are the Language in Use team, who argue that such work does not help pupils achieve social competence. […]. The charge is that exclusive concentration upon the personal can, in its effects, be socially divisive. Unless working-class children are given linguistic means of control over the disciplines of the curriculum, and situations in the outside world, they are unlikely to stand much chance of being upwardly mobile. What this criticism draws attention to is the bitter truth about teachers' exclusive concentration upon creativity with working-class pupils. Whether this is stimulated by the myths and ballads proposed by David Holbrook, or is a reflection upon the living conditions of society's victims suggested by Searle, teachers' limitation of the pupils' work in English  to ‘personal’ writing can be interpreted as giving their support to the status quo of the social system. Since this decision relates, in English, to what has come to be accepted as a key element in children's potential to achieve at school, that is their linguistic competence, the English teacher has a heavier responsibility when he [or she]attempts to resolve it than staff concerned with other parts of the curriculum. He [or she]has to decide whether it is more in his pupils' interests for him to accept the existence of the present social structure and to give them help to advance within it, or for him to have rejected it, on their behalf, as stifling, competitive and exploitative and to encourage them to find fulfilment within themselves and their environment. It will be appreciated that these decisions within English teaching, as they are seen as likely to affect pupils' future working and leisure conditions, might be poignantly uncomfortable to resolve for working-class teachers. Having achieved professional status by means of success in competitive examinations, they are likely to feel a sense of obligation to working-class pupils to equip them in a similar way. It is unlikely to be easy for them to decide, on their working-class pupils' behalf, that personal fulfilment derives solely from their inner selves and their environment, unrelated to questions of higher social status and improved working and leisure conditions. What is certain, however, is that currently English teachers are being urged by the majority of voices in their midst to concentrate upon encouragement of their pupils' creativity. And as discussion moves on to include the other major activities within English — critical discrimination and classroom talk — it becomes clear that the central difficulties remain. […]There are firmly held opposite views on where the main emphases should be placed. The crucial question of ‘standards’, of teachers' commitment to what have traditionally been accepted as cultivated or educated taste and speech, recurs in connection with both these activities with disturbing persistence. (f) Changes in School Mathematics, Barry Cooper [… ]In the 1950s, secondary school mathematics was clearly differentiated by ‘ability’ and, to a lesser extent, by sex. The main boundary was between what I have termed selective and non-selective school mathematics but there was also differentiation within these, especially the latter. There was not, however, a one-to-one correspondence between these two subject subcultures and the selective and non-selective school sectors. As the 1950s passed, more and more pupils were being entered by the secondary modern schools for the GCE and, as a consequence, the most ‘able’ pupils within these schools were being brought into contact with the selective mathematics tradition. Broadly speaking then, at this time, two versions of mathematics were being taught to two  different categories of pupil, largely in different types of school, by teachers who, again broadly speaking, had been educated in two different types of post-school institution: the university and the teacher training college. The latter teachers were more likely to be non-specialists. On this basis, it can be suggested that the two mathematical educational subcultures existed both at the level of ideas and at the level of social relations. The first, the selective, was a part of [the]‘public school tradition’; the second, the non-selective, of [the]‘elementary tradition’. It was also shown that the pedagogical perspectives held by mainstream mathematical educators, broadly ‘psychometric’, were such as to legitimate the broad outlines of a curriculum differentiated by ‘ability’(but not so clearly its differentiation by sex). A discontinuity of both content and approach existed between selective school mathematics and some currents within university mathematics, especially pure mathematics.[…] In the case of the Mathematical Association, many of the older school-based members will have constructed their careers in terms of existing definitions of school mathematics and […]will have had an interest, all other things being equal, in resisting changes which might be seen as leading to the relative devaluation of their ‘knowledge’. Some university mathematicians, on the other hand, especially those pure mathematicians teaching the post-1800 algebras, were beginning to express some concern over the nature of school mathematics. […]This might be seen as an expression of concern by university mathematicians about the subject socialization of their potential students. For several reasons, it might also have been expected, and will be seen later to have been the case, that some of the younger teachers in the higher status selective schools might become allies of those in the universities beginning to press for change. This would be expected because, first, they would have been socialized into a version of mathematics nearer to that of the university ‘modern’ pure mathematicians than that of their elders and because, secondly, they would have had a potential interest in changes that could, within schools, challenge the seniority of their elder colleagues or, at least, they would have had less of a vested interest in current practice. […]By mid-1959, other pressure groups external to the schools, in the form of an alliance of university mathematicians, representing mainly the applied segment of the subject, and employers of graduate labour had also invested some of their considerable resources of time, money and status into conveying to teachers from the selective sector (who prepared their students and employees) their ‘requirements’ of the school curriculum. They legitimized these by reference to the nation's ‘needs’ for scientific and technological manpower.[…] More generally, it is important to stress that the active interest developed by major companies in the 1950s in mathematical and scientific education […]represented a major shift in the resources potentially available to those promoting various missions within mathematics. Not only was money now  possibly available, but, as a result of the conferences, ‘authoritative’ statements supporting curriculum reform had become available from an influential source.[…] During the same period, however, a group within the leadership of the ATAM was beginning, partly under the influence of the ICSITM, and using resources generated by developing the Association's membership in arenas relatively untapped by the Mathematical Association, to argue for the introduction of post-1800 algebraic ideas […]into school syllabuses. The leadership also continued to campaign for pedagogic changes, partially legitimizing both elements of its mission in terms of improving the child's ‘understanding’ of mathematics.[…] By mid-1959, therefore, there existed, scattered throughout the selective schools,[…]a number of teachers, partly in contact with one another through the associations and conferences, interested in the possibility of changing the nature of school mathematics and aware of possible sources of support for this mission. Others, less directly committed to change or worried as to how their institutions would cope with its demands, would, nevertheless, have been finding it increasingly difficult to regard school mathematics as fixed and unchangeable.[…] While there clearly was an ‘objective’ discontinuity of subject perspective between selective school mathematics and the practice of some segments, increasingly dominant within some countries, of university mathematics, and had been for some years, it again required interested actors, utilizing the climate of ‘crisis’resulting from the campaign on teacher supply as a major resource, to enter various arenas in order to persuade others of the ‘need’for change. Such actors, especially the university pure mathematicians, with their followers in the ATAM, and the applied mathematicians, with their industrial allies, did have considerable success in convincing school teachers of the ‘need’ for change in school practice, while fending off attacks ‘from below’on their own curricular practices. In both cases the success of the university sub-disciplinary segments can be seen as having partly resulted from their having found allies outside of their own organizations. The supporters of modern algebra within the ATAM, who had come into contact with the pure mathematicians in various European-wide meetings, such as Royaumont and the ICSlTM conferences, gradually made ‘modern mathematics’ more acceptable to many school teachers by combining it with those elements of their original mission concerned with Piagetian ideas, and proposing ‘intuitive’and ‘experiental’approaches to its study. The applied mathematicians found themselves able to claim that ‘industry’ also approved of ‘modelling’, numerical methods and so on, as well as being able to derive resources of personnel and money from companies with which to further the promotion of their version of ‘mathematics’.[…] By late 1961, therefore, the ‘need’ to reform school mathematics was seen as legitimate by actors in a number of arenas, including the industrial and  political. In this climate, various groups of individuals who had been involved in the conferences and activities of the preceding few years were to move into the drawing up of detailed proposals for curriculum development and the search for funds with which to implement these.[…] Both SMP [originating in the boys' public schools]and MME [originating in state secondary schools]produced proposals for the redefinition of school mathematics that were clearly orientated to the demands of various powerful, i.e. resource-controlling, extra-school groups. Hence, they might both have expected to receive considerable support from such sources. In fact, initially, SMP received major, and MME only minor, financial backing. Accounts of SMP's ‘success’ from within the subject have tended to underplay this difference, stressing instead individual and organizational factors.[…] SMP's ‘success’ relative to such projects as MME must be understood, at least partially, in terms of the differential availability of such resources as status, academic legitimacy and finance, and not merely in terms of such factors as ‘flair’, something SMP members themselves seem to have well understood.[…] The very success of SMP, in ensuring its diffusion ‘downwards’, brought a curricular selection originally developed within the prestigious independent sector of the selective subculture, and only modified by teacher-writers experienced with ‘less able’ children, into contact with many teachers whose subject and pedagogical perspectives derived from within the non-selective subculture in which criteria for selecting mathematical content differed considerably. This, together with the dissatisfaction of members of various university disciplines and sub-disciplines ensured that SMP would be continuously subject to criticism. Glossary of terms ATAM Association for Teaching Aids in Mathematics ICSITM International Commission for the Study and Improvement of Teaching Mathematics SMP School Mathematics Project MME Midlands Mathematical Experiment (g) Patriarchy in School Textbooks, Marion Scott I examined numerous texts (English, social studies, history, geography, maths and science) which were used mostly with the fourteen plus age group to locate some of the sexist trends in curriculum materials.[…] Social studies teachers and departments have been placed in the vanguard of progressive teaching, ostensibly because social studies is seen as a context in which individuals can develop their consciousness and understanding of society. Their curriculum materials, however, stand in sharp contrast to this rationale, and their texts are no less open to criticism than those of other  subjects. There are some issues within social studies itself which are interesting. There is a continual debate as to whether the role of the social studies curriculum is to describe things as they are (in this case, to show a sexist world without necessarily singling, out that sexism for comment or criticism) or whether it should adopt a critical perspective. To my mind the answer is simple: when a critical approach is accepted as a legitimate element of social studies teaching (and surely a critical approach is not one which is to be avoided) then textbooks will be obliged to present alternatives , rather than just describing the sexist norm and failing to evaluate it. Social studies texts (or sections of them) fall into three categories which are crudely sexist. 1 The derogation of women In these texts women are relegated to a subordinate role or else portrayed through grotesque cartoons. They also present women serving primarily a ‘decorative’ function. 2 The invisible woman These books do not focus on women at all. 3 The insignificance of women These books treat women inadequately and are the most common genre. It should be stressed that since the subject of social studies is society, and particularly individuals and social groups within society, it is difficult to accept that women as a group can be of little concern to its practitioners. Surprisingly perhaps, while blatantly sexist material in the form of caricatures is not common, and usually used with critical intention, it is fair to say that many social studies texts produced for examination classes frequently neglected women, though there were some exceptions. (There are, it must be said, changes taking place at the level of examination syllabuses and question papers where the role of women appears with increasing frequency.) In both general texts and volumes dealing with special topics, I found that women were often invisible. Books about leisure, crime, courtship, education, advertising, general introductions to social studies and sociology, all showed weaknesses here. […]Where books were inadequate it was usually a result of their sketchy approach to a subject. Many books deal with women at work, perhaps focusing briefly on their dual role at work and home, or looking at housework, but not exploring the extent to which women work and contribute to the work process. I am not arguing that the lack of feminist analysis makes the accounts unsatisfactory, but rather that indisputable facts are actually withheld and half of society is virtually ignored. I need to emphasize two points here: firstly, most textbooks represent a misleading view of reality in which women are neglected or treated in a cursory manner and this is their ideological function. Secondly (and this is a more subtle and complex point), I would suggest that while some writers may believe that they are presenting reality, they are, in effect, reinforcing stereotypes and patriarchal relations. While we know that more men at present work in certain jobs, as engineers, in factories and so on, we still need  to see and read that women can also do these jobs . As with so many books, social studies texts are often more reactionary and stereotyped than life itself. […]So much of the curriculum is weighted in favour of males, and if such inequality is to be redressed, then curriculum materials must move towards ‘positive discrimination’ in favour of women. Geography, as a subject, tends to concern itself with what is done, in what manner and where, especially when it looks at industry and resources. Its focus is not so much on the individuals who work and produce as on the production process, and this rather impersonal and abstract approach makes it difficult or even unnecessary to look for any exclusion of women, although this occurs. For example, a text which adopts a general, objective style can often create the wrong impression through its use of the pseudo-generic ‘man’. Although the written text may be very general and refrain from referring either to men or women, the illustrations make a definite point for the majority contain male figures. Where women are illustrated the results are often less than desirable for they frequently seem to be included for their decorative or ‘selling’ power. Among the geography texts I examined there were two particular sexist tendencies. The first was in terms of the invisibility of women who were ignored, or under-represented. For example, in Third World countries women play a crucial role in farming but this was certainly not the impression which would be gained from the books. The second tendency is the desire to simplify (or avoid) any analysis (a rather ironical position) which of course makes distortion almost unavoidable. Examples of this were discussions of population growth which made no mention of birth control and figures on the distribution of the sexes through occupations which were offered without explanation or analysis.[…] History textbooks also provide interesting documentation for even among highly qualified history scholars the centrality of women in history is not yet accepted. Since school texts so frequently seem to depend upon the received knowledge of at least one intellectual generation before them, children will be condemned for some time to reading about the exploits of men. History as an intellectual discipline now includes social history which looks at how people actually lived within the limitations of the economic and political events. Labour history too has developed into a recognizable historical research area and women's history is following suit. These approaches have a preoccupation with the activities of ordinary people rather than with important figures and are concerned with providing an alternative perspective on our past. Women's history has yet to take root within our universities and so must wait even longer before it makes an impact in the classroom despite the availability of many histories of women produced in the last decade or so, which could provide starting points for a better balanced approach to history. More social history is being taught but examination syllabuses still focus on political and economic history which conventionally excludes women. I looked at several texts directed at the upper half of secondary schools and  roughly the same categories emerged as for social studies. Typical was a view of the past which left women invisible. A book on the First World War made no mention of women's contribution to the war effort at home or abroad. A book on Britain since 1700 ignored the nineteenth-century feminists and the birth control movement; books on political and economic history were almost exclusively about men. There was even a chapter in one book entitled ‘The Home’ in which the focus was on the man, portrayed relaxing after some ‘Do-it-Yourself work. There are modern history books which ostensibly focus on periods of great social change but the reader could be forgiven for reaching the conclusion that there have been no social changes which have involved/ affected women. There are, of course, history books, or rather sections and chapters in books, which do focus on women. Generally these are inadequate, non-analytical and sometimes almost caricatured. Historians’ treatments of the suffrage movement are a case in point: the coverage is frequently brief and uninformative. Sometimes discussion which starts well descends into trivia, such as a discussion of women's part in the labour market in the twentieth century which ends in an uninspired discussion of fashion. I also noticed a tendency to assume that by the twentieth century women had overcome most of the problems of inequality. Mention is made of the Equal Pay and Sex Discrimination Acts but there is no attempt to question their ultimate effectiveness. One book included a comment that Hitler had a ‘mystical appeal’ to women, but fails to discuss why or how, and suggests that Hitler's views on the home as women's place seem old-fashioned to us today, something unfortunately far from the case. Another book claimed that by the end of the First World War much of the old prejudice against women having an equal place with men in society had gone. I found, too, an assertion that fashion today is a sign that women's emancipation is well underway — a claim that cannot go unchallenged. The lack of feminist perspective is emphasized by statements such as: ‘There can be no doubt that women and girls have failed to make full use of the opportunity now open to them’, which implies an ideologically and materially unfettered equality of opportunity. Another historian notes that women have not come to rival men, despite the equality established through legislation (!), but needs to add a critique of such legislation and society if he is to understand its failures. What is required in history, if girls are to have equal opportunity with boys in school, is both a full investigation and exposure of women's past — recorded and documented in special women's history books —plus an integration of women and their contribution to history within existing accounts. This means studying the women who were great and important (‘heroine history’) as well as the ordinary women. The two sexes are not experiencing equal educational opportunity while the only version of the past they are presented with looks almost exclusively at males and has been recorded almost exclusively by males. Science and mathematics, because of their subject matter, necessitate the  adoption of a different approach. This is not the place to explore arguments which characterize the scientific mode of thought as in some sense masculine (though this may have a vital role to play in our understanding of the science of our culture if it is so: see Kelly et al ., 1979). I intend to analyse the sexism in such texts on a more immediate, if mundane, level. Questions which can be posed include: what impression do we get of the ‘mathematical world’ and way of thinking; what does maths connect with; who might it concern; who are these books directed at? (The same questions could also apply to chemistry and physics.) Sensible of the fact that maths is not a popular subject among children in general there is often an attempt to show how the ‘everyday’ can be viewed mathematically. However, the ‘everyday’, according to these texts, is a world of football, cricket, men driving cars and traditional boys' hobbies whether the topic is statistics, measurement or velocity. The world of maths is male and this is reinforced in several books by the number of questions which revolve around men and boys doing things susceptible to mathematical calculation. Occasional gestures towards the girls being included in maths are made, typically, via a girl sipping tea or standing decoratively posed in a mini skirt in a phone booth. The School Mathematics Project books are more abstract than many, depending less on pictures. But even in these boys feature more through their visibility in the questions and examples. A supreme example of sexist attitude can be found in the early pages of one SMP volume demonstrating the use of flow diagrams (Book F; 4–5). A flow diagram discriminates between girls and boys, directing the girls to consider a flow chart dealing with a knitting process, while the boys are to examine a flow chart of a cement mixing operation. The two sexes are told exactly what they should be interested in, and all in the name of mathematics. It would be a short sighted solution to try to remedy this bias by showing mathematics operating in the domestic realm to the same extent as it operates outside it, just to draw girls' interest. The main point is that even when examples could be non-sex specific , these books make them sex specific . No attempt is made in any of the books I looked at to integrate girls into the world of engineering or technology. Chemistry and physics books revealed the same patterns. The male predominates in the pictures, examples and the questions. One very lively looking book provides typical examples of the features I would criticize: a focus on the history of the science dealing with the main discoverers who all seem to be men; a use of the pseudo-generic ‘man’ and ‘he’when the reference is to men and women; more pictures of men than women; a series of cartoons in the margins which portray boys more frequently than girls to illustrate some concept or show active participation in scientific experiment. But we should note that the process of deterring girls from science begins well before they enter secondary school. It takes the form partly of encouraging them to relate to the personal and subjective while boys begin to grapple with the impersonal and objective. Our school textbooks present a biased, distorted and sometimes explicitly sexist view of the world and there is no doubt that they could be improved."
ACA ACA-ECV-001 10.57 "1 Introduction Morwenna Griffiths and Margaret Whitford Philosophy is in urgent need of a feminist perspective. For centuries the practice of philosophy has been overwhelmingly the prerogative of men but it is only recently that feminist analysis has made it possible to see the distorting effect of this historical fact. The articles in this book demonstrate in a variety of ways where the bias occurs and how it might be redressed. They also show that redressing it is a matter of importance to feminists as well as to philosophers. Feminist ideas are interrelated with philosophical ideas, but most feminist writing would not be recognised as ‘philosophy’. Unlike most academic philosophy much of it is personal, polemical, poetical or allusive. Yet part of the practice of feminism is concerned with the essentially philosophical activities of redrawing concepts, reclaiming language, redefining what counts as significant or important, and, as Daly (1984) calls it, ‘naming’. The reconceptualisation which feminism is attempting has a direct and vital bearing on central philosophical issues, not only in political philosophy where it might have been expected, but also in epistemology, ontology, philosophy of mind, and ethics. At the same time, in their attempts to rearticulate these basic issues, feminists necessarily take over and use philosophical concepts already available — and in so doing they may import, entailed or entangled in apparently neutral concepts, implications which reiterate and reinforce the assumptions that are being challenged. This point is made explicitly by several of the contributors to this volume (see Mary Midgley, Jean Grimshaw, Joanna Hodge and Anne Seller). Philosophy from a feminist perspective has practical implications for both philosophers and feminists. The practice and content of Western philosophy are male-dominated and male-biased. This statement is not directed at any one set of philosophers. It is true in general, in spite of the fact that philosophers by no means speak with a single voice, and do not even agree among themselves about what they understand philosophy to  be, since the nature of the subject, its preoccupations and methods, is itself a matter of philosophical disagreement. How then could philosophy in general be said to have a male bias? To see this one needs to take a closer look at some of the ways in which philosophy has been conceptualised. Western philosophy has a long tradition so it is not surprising that it has changed over the centuries both in content and in method. Schools and traditions, with their prescriptions about content, method or both, have risen and fallen, sometimes to rise up again in a new guise. Philosophers of all kinds continually look to thinkers from previous times for inspiration and argument, and schools can often be distinguished by which predecessors they read and discuss. Conversely, bitterly opposed schools can sometimes look to a common ancestor. The result of all this is a web of overlapping — but different — ways of conceiving of the nature of philosophy. The tradition that is presently characteristic of the Englishspeaking world, including the United Kingdom, is often called ‘analytic’. From about 1955 to 1975 it had a particularly strong hold here in the form of ‘conceptual analysis’ or ‘linguistic philosophy’, in which it was axiomatic that any ‘empirical’question was not philosophical. Philosophy was held to be a ‘second-order subject’ concerned only with reason, logic and the clarification of thought. It could be of use to ‘first-order’, empirically based subjects, but it could learn nothing from them. Plainly, any questions about sex or gender are necessarily non-philosophical, if philosophy is taken to be conceptual analysis in this narrow sense. Any attempt to introduce them into the discourse is immediately blocked by the slogan posing as question —‘but is it philosophy?’ Philosophy that limits itself to conceptual analysis can discuss the discourses of those who talk about sex and gender, looking for conceptual coherence and the presence or absence of rational argument. But it cannot treat gender as a theoretical or methodological category, that might structure its own tools and methods of inquiry, and so it cannot examine its own discourse for masculine bias. Unless the category of gender is explicitly seen as of methodological importance, the question cannot even be raised. Alternative traditions to the analytic one are mostly to be found in Continental Europe (and in some North American universities). Montefiore and Ishiguro (1979) point out: The universities of Europe which have not been influenced by the  analytical tradition…have by no means represented any unitary tradition. The disagreements, or even lack of communication, between, for instance, Hegelians, Marxists, phenomenologists and Thomists have often been deep. But these disagreements are ‘small’ in comparison with the barriers of mutual ignorance and distrust between the main representatives of the analytical tradition on the one hand and the main philosophical schools of the European continent on the other. (pp. viii–ix) These barriers have reached towering heights in the twentieth century, although information does slowly trickle through them. It is still true to say that many Continental philosophers would hardly be recognised as such by their English-speaking contemporaries. Montefiore and Ishiguro again: How unfortunate…that they have refused to read or respect one another, the one convinced that the other survives on undisciplined rhetoric and an irresponsible lack of rigour, the other suspecting the former of aridity, superficiality and over-subtle trivialization (Ibid., p. ix) Partly as a result of a slow trickle through the barriers, and partly as a result of internal inconsistencies, the analytic tradition has recently shown signs of moving from the strictly aloof position it adopted in the heyday of conceptual analysis. It is now possible, even in respectable academic circles in this country, to recognise that the concepts people use are related to the (changing) circumstances in which they live. The question ‘but is it philosophy?’ is losing its power to block further discussion. It remains true, however, that it is still deeply contentious to suggest the possibility of points of view in philosophy, let alone that substantial conclusions might be drawn from them. In this volume, the possibility of a women's point of view in philosophy is discussed directly by Paula Boddington from within the analytic tradition. Other contributors who are working within this tradition (Brenda Almond, Morwenna Griffiths, Mary Midgley and Anne Seller) also consider in what ways central philosophical issues might look different from a women's (or feminist) points of view. Other contributors, like Alison Assiter, Joanna Hodge and Margaret Whitford, have been influenced by the non-analytic  traditions of Continental Europe. In some ways these traditions are of especial interest to feminists since part of their history is an opposition to seventeenth- and eighteenth-century versions of the Enlightenment and the mechanistic, scientific, atomistic picture of the universe. These are concerns shared by substantial numbers of feminists. However, it is clear from these three papers that the Continental traditions themselves need to be subjected to feminist scrutiny. These traditions are, in theory, more hospitable than the analytic one to the idea of different points of view, but in practice their point of view has been overwhelmingly male. The feminist criticism of this volume is the more powerful because its contributors come from a variety of philosophical traditions. No doubt it will very quickly become apparent to the reader that there are differences in their philosophical assumptions that may not be reconcilable. Nor do they share any body of feminist dogma. It would be odd if they did, since feminists, like philosophers, do not speak with a single voice. We think it would be a mistake to try and establish any ‘consensual’ version of feminism or of feminist philosophy because we are committed to exploration of the beliefs and views we hold, even the ones which at present seem indisputable. At this point the question may well arise: since there are such profound differences among the contributors, how could these different views be said to constitute a perspective? And given the diversity both of contemporary philosophy and of contemporary feminism (Delmar, 1986), how could a feminist perspective in philosophy be recognised? One suggestion is that feminist philosophy could be identified by its content. This is not a suggestion we agree with, but it is a popular one, especially in North America where a number of closely related discussions have emerged recently about the content of feminist philosophy, or the form a feminist critique of philosophy should take (Flax, 1983; Hartsock, 1983; Jaggar, 1983; and see also Ruth, 1981). They include substantive conclusions about what would be different in philosophy if it were influenced by feminine rather than by masculine assumptions. For instance, Flax argues that certain preoccupations are typical of masculine philosophy, and arise out of dilemmas deeply rooted in the masculine unconscious, resulting from childrearing practices: Apparently insoluble dilemmas within philosophy are not the  product of the immanent structure of the human mind and/or nature but rather reflect distorted or frozen social relations. (p. 248) Philosophy reflects the fundamental division of the world according to gender and a fear and devaluation of women characteristic of patriarchal attitudes. (p. 268) The apparently irresolvable dualisms of subject-object, mind-body, inner-outer, reason-sense, reflect this dilemma. (pp. 269–70) Hartsock (1983) argues that for men but not for women: The core experience to be understood is that of discontinuity and its consequences. As a consequence of this experience of discontinuity and aloneness, penetration of ego-boundaries, or fusion with another is experienced as violent. Thus, the desire for fusion with another can take the form of domination of the other. (pp. 299–300) She argues that this perception of discontinuity and dominance has consequences for the way experience finds expression in the work of male philosophers. For women, in contrast, discontinuity is not the core experience, and relationships are not perceived as violent. Jaggar (1983) sums up the position as follows: ‘The standpoint of women generates an ontology of relations and of continual process’(p. 376). There are serious problems with this kind of content-based assertion, as Grimshaw (1986) points out in her discussion of ‘the maleness of philosophy’. Firstly, it ignores those male, often misogynist, philosophers who have emphasised relations and continual processes. She cites Hegel and Bradley as examples. We would also point out that prior to the seventeenth-century scientific revolution the universe was seen, by European men, as a great chain of being, connected rather than atomistic, necessarily related to humanity, rather than being a ‘neutral domain of facts, of contingently correlated elements, the tracing of whose correlations will enable greater and greater manipulation and control of the world’(Taylor, 1985, p. 134). Secondly, it distorts the history of philosophy by assuming that it has been unchanging in its  preoccupations and conceptualisations, which it clearly has not. However, as Lloyd (1984) shows in her tracing of changing ideas of reason, while ideas may change, their gender inflection may remain. Throughout the history of Western philosophy women have been thought inferior or less than fully human, though some philosophers, like Kant and Rousseau, have found them charming and necessary to men's well-being, as long as they keep in their place. Thirdly, it has a tendency to a rather static and essentialist picture of both ‘men’ and ‘women’, in this way ignoring the important and real differences between women themselves. We do not think that any particular content in philosophy can be identified as female. Where we agree with the suggestions of the feminist philosophers we have just quoted is in their insistence that philosophical theory comes out of experience, so that philosophy formulated exclusively by men will reflect the experience of men. But we also want to emphasise that neither the experiences men have nor their ideas about masculinity have remained constant. They have varied over history and they still vary today with race, culture and class. But however much they vary, the symbolic division of the world by gender appears to be a constant and fundamental way of articulating experience. Therefore, the experience of women will vary systematically over time, place and circumstance, in step with, but different from, the experience of men. As several of the contributors point out, one should be wary of reducing women's experiences (plural) to women's experience (singular). But the division of the world by gender continues to underlie these changes. Gender is defined by opposition. To be masculine is not to be feminine. Feminine is what is not masculine. What appears on either side of the male-female divide is extremely variable. For instance, whether males tend to be warlike, bookish, competitive, cooperative, individualist or role-oriented is specific to time and place. But where masculinity is associated with any one of these, femininity will be associated with the opposite, and, where women are oppressed, taken to be inferior. Philosophy, in so far as it is the articulation of the concepts, dilemmas, explanations and abstractions of a culture, will only be half the story unless both genders contribute equally. As far as our own history is concerned, feminist criticism shows that Western philosophy has been consistently masculine in orientation even while it has changed its  preoccupations and methods. But the other half of the story cannot be simply added on. Grimshaw (1986) suggests: The trouble with [a view that what is needed is a re-evaluation of the feminine]is that it still leaves uncriticised the whole association of particular qualities with the masculine and others with the feminine… A response to the gender inflection or masculinism of philosophical theories should involve, I think, neither merely the assertion that women too should be seen as included under or capable of whatever norms are suggested by the theory, nor merely the assertion that what is seen as feminine should be valued too, or given equal status with what is male. Rather, what is needed is a critique of the polarisation of masculine and feminine qualities, and in particular a critique of the way in which such qualities may be interpreted or clustered. (pp. 47–8) Grimshaw emphasises that femininity or masculinity are not fixed, nor are they independent of each other. We would add that to suggest giving equal status to what is currently thought to be feminine or masculine is to ignore the way in which one is defined by the other. In our culture to give equal status is a contradiction in terms, so long as gender is an expression of power relations and the male continues to be the superior term. We are saying, in short, that a feminist perspective in philosophy is necessarily critical. Like any other philosophy it is specific to its circumstances. It will depend on the characteristic experiences of women and men at the time of its formulation, and on the way they have entered into philosophical discourse. Feminist criticisms and contributions need to expose and redress distortions where they are found. Thus, if maleness is especially associated with individualism, feminists may need to point to connectedness, but if connectedness is part of the male view, emphasising it won't be feminist. Intuition is now said to be ‘feminine’, and is opposed to logic (which is thereby ‘masculine’). But intuition used to be the favoured type of knowledge, and St Thomas Aquinas, for example, would never have allowed intuition to constitute a specifically feminine attribute, because it would have meant admitting that women were nearer God. Since the feminist perspective is necessarily critical, feminist  philosophy is not a way of articulating women's experience in parallel with men's: it is not a form of relativism. This is a particularly important point. That which a feminist perspective enables us to perceive is valid for everyone. However, since we have argued that content is not the defining criterion of feminist perspectives, we are not claiming a new objectivity or neutrality. We are not claiming that women on their own (or feminists on their own) have the truth, but rather that men on their own do not. Therefore, here again we have reservations about the position articulated by Alison Jaggar (1983) at the end of an excellent discussion of political philosophy from a feminist perspective: Women's subordinate status means that, unlike men, women do not have an interest in mystifying reality and so are likely to develop a clearer and more trustworthy understanding of the world. A representation of reality from the standpoint of women is more objective and unbiased than the prevailing representations that reflect the standpoint of men. The concept of women's standpoint also provides an interpretation of what it is for a theory to be comprehensive. It asserts that women's social position offers them access to aspects or areas of reality that are not easily accessible to men… The standpoint of women reveals more of the universe, human or non-human, than the standpoint of men. (pp. 384–5) Though appealing and heroic, such a vision seems to claim too much. But although we are not arguing that women or feminists have privileged access to the truth about reality, we agree with Jaggar that the standpoint of women offers an opportunity to see what is wrong with current male-defined theories and to correct them. It could be objected at this point that all philosophy is critical, that all philosophical theory attempts to question, correct or overturn current orthodoxy and so that feminist philosophy is just philosophy, and there is nothing specifically feminist about it. The difference is, of course, that feminist criticism arises from the experience of feminism and from taking feminist theories seriously. This would be true whatever the particular circumstances which produced the feminist response. The experience of becoming feminist inevitably leads to changes in one's view of oneself, and in one's view of the rest of the world. It  is never an intellectual exercise which leaves everything the same. It is a discovery that changing concepts is a political activity: that it is not value-free, but is tied to the adoption of a particular interpretation of the world. The result is a re-evaluation of one's personal life, a re-evaluation which is often surprising and usually difficult. Things which were previously seen as obviously true come to be seen as obviously false. The tensions generated by this process (and by the kinds of activity, personal and political, which accompany it) have philosophical consequences, both concerning which concepts seem problematic, and also what is problematic about them. The articles in this book explore some of these consequences. A preoccupation common to all the papers in the book springs directly from the difficulties involved in reassessing how the ‘facts’ of one's experience correspond to the descriptions of them offered by others. It could be summarised by the feminist slogans, ‘the personal is political’ or ‘the politics of experience’. Whatever the problems with these rather global and unanalytic formulations, none the less they do encapsulate one indispensable and basic argument of feminism, the argument that women's experience has been left out: one of the central themes of feminism has been the importance of women's experience, and one of its central enterprises has been to show how a great deal of male theorising about women has tended to deny, invalidate, or be unable to account for this experience. This is not to say that women's experience, perceptions, feelings and emotions are self-validating and constitute in themselves an epistemological standpoint, or even to say that they are always correctly identified and described, but it is to suggest that philosophy would look rather different if women's experience had the same rights of entry as that of men. Most of the contributors draw attention to this point in one way or another. For example, Morwenna Griffiths refers to the feminist emphasis on generating abstractions on the basis of concrete, personal experience (rather than assuming that inherited abstractions adequately explain experience). One of the strengths of this approach is that it becomes much more immediately apparent why certain issues are felt to be important. The experience of trying to force one's perceptions into preconceived categories, and the pain and distortion that this has often led to, is now used as a basis by feminist theorists for the argument that to see feeling as ‘contaminating’ objective, scientific knowledge points to a distortion of conceptualisation. As Jaggar (1983) points out, this is  not a simple process of incorporating the neglected experience: ‘a theory may require that we revise even the description of the world on which the theory itself is based’(p. 381). The contributors are not making the easy assumption that to validate their experience women do not have to put themselves into question; on the contrary, it must be recognised that to be a feminist theorist may involve some painful and hard-won putting into question of the beliefs and commitments that are the point of departure. But the contributors all agree on the importance of that experience. In these papers, all kinds of non- and extra-philosophical activities become the basis for philosophical reflection, for instance menstruation and childbirth (Brenda Almond's paper); a gut reaction to pornography (Alison Assiter's paper); the fantasies that disturb because of their apparently unfeminist nature Jean Grimshaw's paper); and nonviolent demonstrations against missile bases (Anne Seller's paper); the point in each case being that these experiences are the starting point, because their importance did not seem to be recognised within the theoretical categories already provided, and so urgently impel the theorist to work out categories that are more adequate. A second preoccupation evident in these papers is responsibility, and what could roughly be described as the ethical dimension of conceptualisation. Several contributors explicitly criticise the social atomist conception of human beings, defined by Mary Midgley in this volume as follows: This is the idea, implied by all Social Contract myths, that an individual is essentially a solitary unit, a free chooser, a being intrinsically without social ties. As she goes on to argue, ‘The pronoun ‘he’ is an essential part of this description.’ Because the life-experience of women is normally so different from that of men, they are likely to conceptualise freedom, equality, rights, responsibility and autonomy, to give but a few examples, in a rather different way from men. Thus Brenda Almond suggests that the ways in which women's lives differ from those of men are morally significant. In our culture women typically conceptualise themselves in relation to others; discussion of the implications of this can be found in several of the papers (Alison Assiter, Lorraine Code, Jean Grimshaw and Judith Hughes). The result of seeing the difference in women's experiences in positive rather than negative terms — seeing women as having something to  offer philosophy rather than seeing them as inferior or aberrant versions of a male norm — is that the contours of familiar conceptual landscapes begin to change. Judith Hughes, for example, puts forward a way of seeing autonomy (and adulthood) based primarily on the notion of responsibility rather than that of rationality, thus giving an ethical dimension to autonomy. Lorraine Code argues that epistemology should not be divorced from ethics; one should be a responsible knower. Alison Assiter extends the notion of autonomy into the private realm where the tradition cautiously refrains from setting foot, and suggests that how we treat and are treated by other people in private has a direct bearing on our autonomy in the public sphere. The ideal of an unrelated self is shown to be an ideal developed by people who have never been in the position of having primary responsibility for the care of children or the old. This position, actual or potential for all women, leads to a version of the self which is more likely to be defined in relationship and which therefore implies certain commitments or responsibilities which can hardly be denied. Where standard discussions of autonomy place it in the context of rights, freedom and equality, paternalism and rationality, here it is discussed in conjunction with questions of fantasy, how we treat others, social and personal relations, and responsibilities. Where standard discussions of the self talk about memory and unity, brain transplants, the rational agent acting on his beliefs and desires, or the self in its public aspect as citizen, here the self is looked at in the context of the past history of a person, unconscious or fantasy relationships with others, the importance of feelings, or the body. This is not simply an alternative or complementary perspective, since it raises directly the issue that what counts as a philosophical problem is itself an issue for critical inquiry. We have been arguing that changing concepts is a political activity; that it is not value-free, but arises out of a particular ethical or political interpretation of the word, and that one of the aims of the dialogue between feminism and philosophy should precisely be to reconceptualise the world that is offered by philosophy as it is at present. Some feminists would expand this argument to suggest that the political and/or ethical discussion should be made an explicit part of the methodology of philosophy. Harding (1986) argues that since scientific knowledge (the epistemological paradigm) is in any case used for social ends, social aims should determine the formulation of scientific or epistemological problems. Along the same lines, Anne Seller in this volume argues for a more democratic epistemology. From this perspective, ethics in the broad sense (the question of relations with and responsibilities towards other people or a community) is not just a branch of philosophy but informs the conception of what philosophy is or might be. Contributors to this volume were given no more precise brief than the provisional subtitle ‘explorations in philosophy from a feminist perspective’, and they are working within quite different philosophical traditions and on different sorts of issues. However, the papers are unified by a common factor: they all draw on a body of writing and thinking — with admittedly elastic boundaries — which is not taken seriously by the mainstream as having anything to offer philosophy. Providing an outline of each paper in the second part of the introduction, below, we draw attention to the feminist debates which are the source for each contributor's point of departure. In the third and final section we give a brief survey of the most well-known publications in the area of philosophy from a feminist perspective. We hope this will be of value to both feminists and philosophers approaching these questions for the first time. The opening paper, by Mary Midgley, discusses the central issue of the possibility and necessity of a women's point of view. She addresses the tensions generated by two related dilemmas in feminist thinking, and points out why they have a wider relevance in philosophical and political thought. The first of these tensions is about the degree of attention that needs to be paid to natural (i.e. genetically given) sex differences and similarities. The second, related one is about the reasons for treating all people as if they were the same, regardless of their individual peculiarities of sex and gender. She relates these concerns to the philosophical projects of finding universals of human nature, of morality and of political being, and in particular, to the project of achieving equality between individuals of varying class, race, age and cultural background. The questions are both political and controversial. As Midgley makes clear, discussions of natural sex differences can never be simply a neutral issue, even if it is an empirical one, since one still has to consider what consequences should follow from the differences one has discovered. Feminists began by arguing that sex differences are artificial and insignificant, for the very good reason that the idea of natural differences had so often been used to justify discriminatory treatment against women. Midgley argues that it is time to move on  from this position. She sees natural sex differences as providing the basis for a critique of certain philosophical conceptions which exclude women, and in that way is enlisting them on the side of feminism. The view that philosophical conceptions may be not so much ‘universal’ as ‘male’is discussed further in the next paper. Brenda Almond draws on recent feminist arguments that women's distinctive perspective and experience lead them to view morality in a different light from men. This distinctive perspective is derived from a focus on the concrete, as opposed to the abstract, and is characterised by an emphasis on responsibility rather than on rights. Almond suggests a number of ways in which the ancient idea that the two sexes have — or should have — different moral outlooks can be given new life in the context of modern feminism. She considers whether it is true to claim that there is a sex-related divergence of views, and the possible reasons for any such divergence, and goes on to suggest that there are areas in which women's views may typically differ from those of men. In particular, Almond questions the notion of autonomy as it has been developed since Kant, arguing that this notion is of limited value to women, since ‘the ‘masculine’ goal of moral autonomy has in practice almost always been outside a woman's grasp'. She suggests that women's distinctive experience leads them to form a moral sensibility that is closer to aesthetic response than to the legalism implicit in much principle-based morality. Almond argues, like Midgley, that women's experience adds a positive and complementary contribution to our ethical conceptions. An ethical perspective is also present in Alison Assiter's paper, in which she argues that the Kantian or Hegelian notion of autonomy should apply to sexual relations as much as to the public world of social contract. She suggests that persons and their autonomy should be respected in all private and personal activities, including erotic fantasy. The argument should be seen in the context of feminist debates about pornography and its significance. One of the clearest discussions of these debates can be found in Elizabeth Wilson's book What Is to Be Done about Violence against Women?(1983). She points out that what feminist thought has done is to take pornography out of its usual position in the argument between conservatives and liberals over censorship, and to put it into a completely different framework (p. 137). For feminists, there is another context which gives the phenomenon of pornography a different meaning: the social context of violence against women. Pornography is seen as one manifestation among others of the way in which women are controlled by male power or violence (other manifestations are rape, or the fear of rape, wife-battering, prostitution, child-abuse, etc. ).(For further discussion see Brownmiller, 1975; Lederer, 1980; Dworkin, 1981; Griffin, 1981; and Kappeler, 1986 which are directly concerned with pornography, and Snitow et al ., 1984; and Vance, 1984 on sexuality.) Like these writers, Assiter makes a consideration of pornography central to a consideration of women's social situation. She enters the feminist debate here, arguing that some feminists have misunderstood the significance of pornography, taking it to be a major cause of the oppression of women, rather than a symptom of it, albeit a symptom which itself then contributes to that oppression. It is now beginning to be argued by feminists that in order to deal with pornography and what the phenomenon reveals, we have first to understand it, understand, that is, the meaning and function of fantasy for both men and women, and what effects it has on the rest of one's life (see Wilson, 1983 for a summary of this discussion, and also Carter, 1979; Linden et al.,1982; Midgley and Hughes, 1983). For Assiter, fantasy is not just a harmless and essentially solitary activity in which everyone engages to a greater or lesser extent, but is something which also has an effect on the way people behave towards others, and on the way they may feel they can justifiably treat each other, particularly women. There is thus a connection between people's private fantasies and their status as autonomous individuals. Drawing on a notion of autonomy which originates with Kant, and which is developed in the writings of Hegel and Marx, Assiter extends this notion and criticises the way in which it has been confined to the public sphere. In arguing for the relevance of the notion of autonomy in private life, she brings into question the demarcation point between private and public life which is assumed by most of the philosophical tradition she is working in. It has been pointed out by feminists that the tradition which depends upon this demarcation line fails to give a satisfactory account of conflicts that arise in the private sphere. Thus two apparently unrelated discussions: the notion of autonomy in relation to the public-private distinction, and pornography, are shown here to be intimately related .4 The notion of autonomy is discussed in a different context by Judith Hughes in the next paper which, like Assiter's, illuminates  the concept from a new angle and, like Almond's, emphasises the importance of responsibility. Underlying Hughes's paper are questions about how children figure in political debate, what problems the considerations about children bring to light, whether these problems have any special significance for women, and whether women's new awareness of their own political situation can be used effectively in thinking about children. Thinking about these questions produces the conclusions that are the starting point for Hughes's paper: that the philosopher's child invariably turns out to be male and that autonomy seems to be for men only. These conclusions lead her to argue that rationality has been falsely assumed to be the criterion of political adulthood, and that rationality does not entail autonomy. Thus, analysing the attempt by political philosophers to justify the exclusion of women from public life on the grounds of their defective capacities (either rational, moral or cognitive), she suggests that there is a hidden argument which takes the exclusion of women to be unquestionable and attempts to justify the status quo by seeking an explanation in the defective capacities that women must then be assumed to have. She argues that autonomy should not be seen as a psychological capacity, but as a social one, depending on public acknowledgement, and that this acknowledgement arises from the recognition of responsibility rather than of rationality. A fourth paper discussing the notion of autonomy indicates the importance of the concept for women, for whom the experience of dependence and powerlessness is often a central feature of their lives. Jean Grimshaw looks at some of the ways in which feminists have tried to conceptualise what it is for a woman to be autonomous, and the relationship between these conceptions and philosophical ways of thinking about the human self. She locates her argument within both feminism and philosophical thought. She considers the idea, implicit in much feminist theory, of an authentic self which is said to be socially conditioned by patriarchal power, and argues that this idea owes much to a tradition in Western philosophy which dates back to the Aristotelian distinction between actions that are voluntary and actions which are coerced, a tradition that can be traced through Descartes to the present time. Grimshaw argues that feminists' appeal to this humanistic conception of the self as a unitary, atomistic, conscious and rational core is quite inadequate to conceptualise experiences such as self-deception or obsessional delusions, or the contradictions which feminists have described  between their rationally held views and political convictions on the one hand, and their emotions and desires on the other. In order to account for women's lack of autonomy it is not sufficient to think merely in terms of removing a veil, or stripping away the outer layers. The concrete experiences of women (and men) are here used as the basis for a critique of a particular conception of the Grimshaw suggests that Freud and psychoanalysis might offer an explanatory account of the self of considerable value. Both feminists and contemporary philosophers in England and America have had an uneasy relationship with psychoanalytic theory. Philosophers have been primarily preoccupied with the scientific status of psychoanalysis and whether its therapeutic claims can be substantiated. They have, on the whole, ignored it as a theory of mind, though a few (such as Richard Wollheim) have been deeply influenced. Feminists have been antagonistic to psychoanalysis, seeing it as a means for the social control of women, although over the last few years, the mood has shifted, and psychoanalysis is being re-examined for its possible value to feminists (see Sayers (1986) for an overview). In France, psychoanalysis has been taken more seriously by both feminists and philosophers, and the psychoanalytic model used as a basis for the reconceptualisation of a number of philosophical issues. The paper by Margaret Whitford shows how the feminist philosopher and psychoanalyst, Luce Irigaray, uses psychoanalytic theory to provide a critique of Western rationality and the traditional symbolism, which symbolises rationality as ‘male’(see Lloyd, 1984). Foregrounding the theme of sexual difference, Irigaray locates male-female symbolism as one of the fundamental underlying polarities of Western thought. Placing Irigaray's work in the context of Freudian and post-Freudian theory, Whitford suggests that Irigaray's apparently very traditional and essentialist use of symbolism has a strategic function, like that of Derrida's analyses, designed to draw attention to the underpinnings of Western metaphysics, in order to undermine them. Feminists have approached the work of Irigaray eagerly, looking for a theory which would help to understand and change the situation of women, but have been divided in their interpretations of her writing. Some see a romantic celebration of difference, a static, essentialising, ahistorical view of women, others find her work politically equivocal. Whitford's view is that Irigaray's work has been read out of context, and that we need to give much more careful attention to the  psychoanalytic dimension of her thought. Her argument is that Irigaray, as a psychoanalyst, sees psychoanalysis as a process of change rather than as a scientific theory: Irigaray's work suggests ways in which psychoanalysis could be seen as a model for feminists seeking fundamental social change, in particular by proposing an alternative model for the relation between the rational and the non-rational which would be more satisfactory than the dominant paradigm. In the next paper Morwenna Griffiths also addresses the question of the relation between the rational and the non-rational. Drawing on the re-evaluation of emotion characteristic of contemporary feminist theory and practice, she argues that feminist conceptions of emotion constitute a critique of dualist conceptions of mind found in much Western philosophy in the English-speaking world and elsewhere. She refers, in particular, to radical feminists who turn on its head the criticism that women are more emotional than men, and claim that not only are women more emotional, but that this is their strength, and that in comparison, men are enfeebled, deadened and impoverished creatures. As Griffiths points out, there are problems with this position, but she argues that, despite its flaws, its passionate impetus to reconceptualisation is invaluable. Griffiths suggests that the legacy of Descartes to the philosophical understanding of emotions has been to subsume them into one of two categories, mind or body, and to make them rational or non-rational. She proposes an alternative model of mind in which feelings are paid sufficient attention, and in which, through language, they are seen to be intelligent rather than rational, non-rational or irrational. She argues that one's feelings are a source of knowledge as well as being a result of understanding, and that for both social and biological reasons they are gender-related. Thus she concludes that being male or female gives one a distinctive viewpoint which should be included in any theory of human beings. She also endorses the radical feminist view that the well-being of private and public life depends on a better understanding of feeling. The legacy of Descartes comes in for further scrutiny in Joanna Hodge's paper, which examines the concept of ‘the subject’ which philosophy has inherited from Descartes. This concept, she suggests, has been both valuable and limiting for women. Valuable, in that, by providing a conception of an autonomous, rational and apparently neutral subject, it made it possible for Enlightenment liberalism (in particular Mary Wollstonecraft) to question the  exclusion of women from public life. Limiting, in that it conceals a covert gender specificity which operates to justify women's continued exclusion — whether from public life or philosophy. Now, however, contemporary critiques of the notion of the subject (see, for example, Heideggerian phenomenology, structuralism, psychoanalysis or Derrida's deconstruction) have begun to dismantle the assumptions concealed in the notion of subjectivity. In her densely argued and complex paper, Hodge points out that one can distinguish between the subject , a notion with ontological and metaphysical commitments, and subjectivity , an empiricist notion (developed, for example, by Hume) which retains its epistemological function while abandoning its ontological links. Descartes, effecting a split between rational consciousness and sensual embodiment, offered an account of the mind-body relationship which accepted the traditional hierarchy according to which reason governs the body or the senses. He saw the body in functionalist terms, but failed to make a distinction between the different functions of the male and female bodies. Subsequent empiricist versions avoid the Cartesian problem of the relation between mind and body by focusing instead on the epistemological processes of subjectivity , but in this way obscure even further the nature of the body attached to these processes. However, feminism brings back to the centre of the debate the ontological issue of the different kinds of body to which the rational processes may be ‘attached’. Feminist analysis has shown in detail that women's bodies bear cultural meanings that are quite different from those ascribed to men's bodies. This difference is particularly visible in the phenomenon of pornography which serves to foreground the issue of the nature of the body, an issue not discussed by Descartes and completely absent from subsequent post-Cartesian philosophy. Hodge argues therefore that women's epistemological position cannot be exactly the same as men's. Like Assiter, then, Hodge suggests a link between the issue of pornography and the notion of an autonomous and rational subject. Her paper argues for the importance of standpoint to be taken into account in discussion of fundamentals such as epistemology and ontology, but also suggests that feminist political theories which assume that a conception of the subject is already available need to be complemented by more radical feminist theories (such as those of Daly or Irigaray) which criticise and take apart the metaphysical implications inherent in philosophical conceptions of the subject. The epistemological issue is discussed in more detail in the following two papers. Firstly, Anne Seller's paper argues that the view of knowledge as a correct description of the world has only limited application. The epistemological model of truth and falsity which applies to formal statements of propositions turns out to be difficult to apply in the context of social and political life. Like Hodge, Seller takes the view that women who uncritically adopt philosophical conceptions of knowledge may find themselves saddled with consequences that are at odds with their perceptions of the world and their politics. She discusses this in relation to epistemological stances of realism and relativism. ‘Realism’ and ‘relativism’are not exact terms. They are each used here to gesture at a range of philosophical positions. Realists are impressed by the constraints imposed by the ‘external world’ on what we know and can know. Seller takes realism as the view that ‘there is an objective order of reality which can be known by the human observer’. She discusses this in relation to the view held by some feminists that ‘every woman's experience of the world is valid, not false, illusory or mistaken, and that all views of the world are equally valid’. She considers the strengths and weaknesses of both positions and shows how the epistemological and political questions are intertwined with each other. She argues that the main task is that of deciding what to do, and that the best way of deciding is through a genuinely democratic epistemology. Once this is achieved, she suggests, the dichotomy between realism and relativism becomes irrelevant; both will proceed in the same way in trying to sort out what is going on and what to do. Lorraine Code's paper arises out of a concern on the one hand with the epistemological status of experiences, and on the other, with the importance of recognising the ethical dimensions of knowing: what she terms ‘knowing well’ or ‘taking epistemic responsibility’. She elucidates her concept of epistemic responsibility by focusing on the practice of stereotyping, and in particular, the stereotyping of women by men. The philosophical tradition she is working within is Kantian: she emphasises that human cognition is an ‘active process of taking and structuring experience’, and therefore, she argues, a process that entails freedom and responsibility and the associated ethical virtues of honesty, humility and courage. This active process is hindered for everyone if they use stereotypes. It is rendered particularly difficult for women who have been stereotyped, because the stereotype of  women is one which precludes the exercise of active responsibility. The other central theme of Code's paper is the relation between experience and knowledge. She argues against the Kantian tradition of seeking a pure, clear objectivity in knowledge which will leave personal experience behind. A concept of knowing well which rejects stereotyping cannot move very far from the experience which generates the knowledge. She defines the area of feminist epistemology as that of developing theoretical accounts of knowledge which retain continuity with women's experiences. In a critical discussion of Carol Gilligan's work in moral development (Gilligan, 1982), she notes that Gilligan's methodological principles, in particular the aim of listening responsively with receptiveness and humility, supply an example of the kind of approach that might fulfil this aim. The concluding paper, by Paula Boddington, returns to the issue of a women's point of view and what difference this might make to philosophy, leaving the reader with a kind of map of the basic issues to be explored: ‘an opening up of complexities’. Situating herself within the Anglo-Saxon analytic tradition, she looks at different conceptions of philosophy, its content and methods. Readers unfamiliar with philosophy will find her discussion of the nature of philosophy illuminating; they should be warned, though, that philosophers are likely to find it contentious. Including a review of material already published about women and philosophy, she distinguishes between female, feminine and feminist points of view, and then, focusing on the first of these, she considers how philosophy could or would be affected by the inclusion of more women in its institutional structures. She looks first at how the present conceptions and practices of philosophy might admit of different points of view at all. She then goes on to consider what might be changed by the inclusion of more women. Finally she returns to her original distinction between female, feminine and feminist, and suggests how the relation between them might have implications for possible developments in the practice of philosophy. She concludes that women's views need to be considered and then synthesised with men's to ‘find a human whole’. What is now known as ‘second-wave’ feminism emerged in the late sixties and seventies. By the early seventies, articles that saw themselves as explicitly feminist were beginning to appear in  philosophy journals (e.g. The Monist , special issue, 1973). As women began to cast a critical eye over the discipline of philosophy, a number of different types of work appeared. These can be divided, very broadly, into the following categories (although the categories clearly overlap both chronologically and conceptually). Firstly, there were discussions of issues thought to be of particular interest or relevance to women, such as abortion or equality. Many of these discussions are to be found in the early collections (see, for example, Gould and Wartofsky, 1976; English, 1977; Vetterling-Braggin, Elliston and English, 1977). An extended discussion of this kind can be found in The Sceptical Feminist by Janet Radcliffe Richards (1980). These discussions are characterised by an increasing scope and depth as the issues are accorded greater philosophical seriousness. Thematic collections on issues of particular concern to women continue to appear, for example The Family in Political Thought (Elshtain, ed., 1982) or Mothering (Trebilcot, ed., 1984). A couple of recent collections which bring together a range of articles on a variety of topics are 'Femininity', ‘Masculinity’ and ‘Androgyny ’: A Modern Philosophical Analysis , edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin (1982b) and the special issue of Radical Philosophy (1983) on ‘Women, Gender and Philosophy’. Secondly there was the re-examination and reinterpretation of the history of philosophy, looking at philosophers through ‘the prism of sex’ to see what they had to say about women. In practice, since philosophy often proceeds by paying attention to past philosophers and their ideas, the two categories overlapped to some extent with each other, and with a third category, political philosophy, which looks at the political philosophers in the light of the practice and experiences of feminist politics (see Okin, 1980; Elshtain, 1981; O'Brien, 1981). As the often misogynistic views of philosophers were exposed, two lines of approach were adopted. Either one could discard what the philosopher had said about women and keep the rest — which in fact often meant accepting conceptions of human nature that took the male as paradigm, and trying to demonstrate that women were as fully human as men, or one could argue that the philosopher's thought formed a system within which the attitude towards women formed an inseparable part (see Elshtain's (1981) discussion of the private-public distinction or Grimshaw (1986) for the examples of Aristotle and Kant), so that it was impossible just to take certain parts and leave the rest. The second of these choices was the one that most feminists adopted, and as a result the next decade  was marked by an increasing self-confidence on the part of feminists about their place in philosophy. This led to a fourth type of work which discussed the nature and limits of philosophy itself and whether there was any place for women in it, and considered whether the basic assumptions of philosophy included or excluded women. Here we would just like to mention briefly some of the studies that came out between 1980 and 1986, which attempt to develop accounts that would be either specifically feminist or draw upon a women's point of view. Under the heading of political philosophy, feminist philosophers begin by arguing with the tradition, trying to reconcile feminist insights with already existing systems of thought such as liberalism or Marxism, and go on to attempt to define a new perspective in philosophy. In The Politics of Reproduction (1981), Mary O'Brien rereads traditional political theory's preoccupation with the family and reproduction, and uses a revised version of dialectical materialism with a view to developing a feminist theory. She argues for the view that there is such a thing as a ‘feminist perspective’ and criticises feminist theorists (de Beauvoir, Millett, Firestone and Reed) who depend too heavily on existing (male) theories. Jean Bethke Elshtain, in Public Man, Private Woman. Women in Social and Political Thought (1981), looks at the way political thought has conceptualised the public-private distinction and its bearing on attitudes towards women, and critically examines contemporary feminist versions of that same distinction. Alison Jaggar, in Feminist Politics and Human Nature (1983), looks at the relation between feminist theory and political philosophy, arguing that different feminist theories — liberal feminism, radical feminism, Marxist feminism and socialist feminism — imply different conceptions of human nature and have different implications for practice. A collection of essays edited by Ellen Kennedy and Susan Mendus,Women in Western Political Philosophy (1987), presents a feminist perspective on questions that have been central to political philosophy and raises questions about the philosophical underpinning of political theory. In ethics, there have been attempts to incorporate or develop a women's point of view, perceived as missing from mainstream theory. Carol Gilligan, in In a Different Voice: Psychological Theory and Women's Development (1982), examines psychological theories concerning human moral development, and suggests that a male model has been developed which does not fit the experiences of  most women's lives. Criticising a rights-based ethics, she suggests that an alternative view of morality is needed which would include a typically feminine way of conceptualising the relationship between self and other. Nel Noddings describes her book,Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education (1984), as ‘an essay in practical ethics from the feminine view’ and attempts to evolve a specifically feminine form of ethics. A recent collection,Women and Morality , edited by Eva Kittay and Diana Meyers (1986) widens the discussion by bringing together different viewpoints on the issues raised by Gilligan. A variety of work has appeared addressing issues relating to reason, rationality and emotion. Carol McMillan, in Women, Reason and Nature (1982), argues that feminism makes the same mistake as anti-feminism in its excessive belief in rationality and empiricism, and consequently undervalues emotion, intuition and the private sphere. Genevieve Lloyd, in The Man of Reason: ‘Male’ and ‘Female’in Western Philosophy (1984), looks at the way in which Western philosophy has conceptualised reason, and shows that throughout its history ideals of reason have incorporated an exclusion of the feminine, which creates both practical and conceptual problems for women who may experience conflicts between reason and femininity. (This study contains a useful bibliographical essay on women and philosophy, going up to 1983.) Mary Daly, in Pure Lust (1984), a polemical book subtitled ‘Elemental Feminist Philosophy’ which explicitly and insistently refuses to fit the usual categories of what philosophy is supposed to consist of, argues that the passions and their relation to reason must be renamed, and thus reunderstood by women if they wish to free themselves from the constrictions inherent in the male naming of them. In the areas of language and epistemology, there is a collection of essays edited by Mary Vetterling-Braggin,Sexist Language: A Modern Philosophical Analysis (1982a), which usefully brings together a wide range of articles by a variety of contributors. Another collection, edited by Sandra Harding and Merrill Hintikka,Discovering Reality (1983), a wide-ranging and challenging selection of essays in epistemology, metaphysics, methodology and philosophy of science, argues that it is not just content but also methodological assumptions and epistemology which show male bias. This book draws extensively on the work of Nancy Chodorow (1978) and object-relations theory in psychoanalysis concerning the construction of male and female personality. A recent book by  Sandra Harding,The Science Question in Feminism (1986), develops the work in epistemology and philosophy of science, and examines the work of feminist theorists in this area. Harding shows the obstacles to, and the far-reaching consequences of, trying to construct a theory of gender as an analytic category that is relevant to the natural sciences. Most recent work is often concerned with philosophical issues within feminism itself. Mary Midgely and Judith Hughes, in Women's Choices (1983), discuss the philosophical issues facing feminism. They locate the various strands in feminist thinking, and show the conceptual problems involved in combining them. The collection edited by Carol Gould,Beyond Domination: New Perspectives on Women and Philosophy (1983), discusses some of the philosophical problems raised by feminism. Jean Grimshaw, in Feminist Philosophers: New Perspectives on Philosophical Traditions (1986), explores tensions in feminist thought and examines some of the philosophical problems underlying them. The work of French women theorists is also beginning to be translated and discussed in this country, although for French theorists, the boundaries between philosophy, literary theory and psychoanalytic theory are often fluid, so that their work does not always fall clearly into the familiar categories of philosophy. However, the work of Christine Delphy, Luce Irigaray, Julia Kristeva and Michele Le Doeuff (to name the most well known) is currently being discussed by feminists working in the area of philosophy or feminist theory. An impressive overview of the context in which contemporary French theory is being thought is offered by Alice Jardine in Gynesis: Configurations of Women and Modernity (1985). Jane Gallop's book,Feminism and Psychoanalysis (1982), is an excellent introduction to the range and implications of French feminist theory. A more accessible introduction can be found in Claire Duchen, whose book Feminism in France: From May ‘68 to Mitterrand (1986) contains a couple of chapters discussing the central theoretical issues."
ACA ACA-EWW-004 1.52 "SOME NUMERICAL METHODS 2.1 INTRODUCTION In this chapter we shall discuss some numerical methods for solving problems formulated in terms of matrices. However, it must be stressed at the outset that we can do no more here than to indicate the basic principles involved, and give illustrations of a few of the almost innumerable variants of basic methods that exist. Quot homines, tot sententiae: almost every worker in the field has his pet variation, which suits him ad his computer better than any other. For a wider discussion, readers are referred to texts such as Bodewig (5) and Wilkinson (6). Most of the numerical problems which arise in matrix studies (particularly those which derive from dynamical systems) lead ultimately to one or both of two basic processes:(a) the inversion of a numerical matrix;(b) the evaluation of its eigenvalues and vectors. It will be convenient to deal with these under separate headings. The methods themselves also divide into two broad categories:(a) direct methods, in which the solution requires is reached in a finite, predictable number of operations;(b) indirect methods, in which the solution is usually obtained by successive approximation procedures, when the number of operations is determined by the rate of convergence. I: RECIPROCATION; LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS 2.2 DIRECT METHOD FOR MATRIX INVERSION Under this heading we give three methods which are all very different in principle. Each has variants; for each there are circumstances which favour its use. 2.2.1. Pivotal condensation This method is the simplest, and probably the most universally used. Suppose we have a square matrix A =  of order n for which we require to find the reciprocal R: then AR = I. Now it is possible to write down a sequence of matrices  Mr (r is usually n or n + 1, depending on the variant employed) which when used as a chain to premultiply A, condense it to the unit matrix, so that  which evidently implies  The numerical procedure is to operate successively on 91); given A we can write down M1 and we evaluate  so that(1) becomes  Knowing B we can now write down  and form  and so on , until R is obtained. As we shall see, in practice it is not necessary to write down the matrices  merely perform simple operations with the rows of A and I in (1), which is all the matrices  do. For ease of exposition, let us suppose n = 4. Consider the matrix product, corresponding to (3)  In writing down  we have first arbitrarily selected a non-zero element  of A as a pivot (underlined) for this first step in the operation.  is then obtained from the unit matrix by replacing its second column (corresponding to the subscript 2 of  by the third column of A divided through by  with negative signs for the off-diagonal elements. The third column of B is then null except for a unit in the position corresponding to  The product makes it clear that all we are doing, in fact, is to operate with the rows of A in a manner similar to that often used in the condensation of determinants. Thus row 1 of B is now 1 of A minus  times row 2 of A; row 2 of B is row 2 of A divided throughout by 3; row 3 of B is row 3 of A minus  times row 2 of A; and so on. Having obtained B, we now select a pivotal element in it for the next step; the selection is arbitrary except that the element must be nonzero and must not be in the second row, which contains the unit. For example  in which  has been chosen as the pivotal element. We now choose a pivotal element in C, excluding rows 2 and 3 containing the units. Note that  and  cannot both be zero, or A would be singular and R would not exist; similarly for  We choose a nonzero element from these  four -say  and then  The last step is not arbitrary: we must exclude the first three rows (containing units), so that the only choice for pivot in the next step is D44, which cannot be zero. We write down , evaluate E =  obtaining a matrix which if the rows are rearranged by premultiplication by an obvious matrix , becomes the unit matrix. As we have said, in practice we do not need to write down M1 etc. When we use  as a premultiplier of (1) we combine the rows of I in exactly the same ways as those of A. We can therefore write the two arrays side by side and operate on rows of 2n elements. For example, to summarise what has been done above (we refer to row i as ) we use Table 1.  When the left-hand array has been condensed to I, the right hand array is R.  This method has a number of variants. First, it is possible to operate with columns, using postmultiplying matrices Mi; but this is really only transposition of operations on rows. The variants derive mainly from the choice of pivot. In the so-called optimal pivoting method, one chooses the element of largest modulus from among those available. In a second variant, one chooses the element of largest modulus in each column in turn; in a third, the diagonal elements are chosen in order; and in a fourth, the diagonal elements of largest modulus are chosen in turn. The third has the advantage that no final rearrangement of rows is required; on the other hand, it fails if a pivot becomes zero, or even very small. The third variant is usually described as ""diagonal pivoting without row interchange"" , the fourth as ""diagonal pivoting with pivotal strategy"" . It is to be observed that the determinant of A is readily found from the condensation procedure. The determinant of  is , etc. It follows that the determinant of A is , i.e. the product of the pivotal elements chosen, multiplied by the determinant of , which rearranges the rows, and so has the value , according as to whether the number of interchanges is even or odd. Example 1 We exemplify these procedures using the matrix  This matrix, in fact, has the determinant 100; since its elements are integers, the elements of the reciprocal will be terminating decimals. In the intermediate steps, however, the numbers are incommensurable: for brevity of exposition we give four decimal places only, though of course a computer will normally employ a much greater number. (i) Optimal pivoting In Table 2, the last array on the right is the required reciprocal. Note that, in the rearrangement of the last step, we crossed three rows in bringing  to the top; then the new second row  crossed two rows in going to the bottom. Since the total number of crossings, 5 is odd,  has the determinant -1; accordingly       Coincidentally, this example also illustrates he second variant: it is adventitious that the largest element among those available occurs in the first, second, third and fourth column in succession. There is thus no difference in the working. However, in the optimum method a computer is required to scan all elements available, i.e.  in successive steps, while in the second variant only m,(n — 1),…, 1 need scanning. In this example, therefore, the second variant has the advantage; in a matrix of large order, the scanning process can take considerable computer time. No scanning is needed in the third variant, where the diagonal elements are prescribed. (ii) Diagonal pivoting We now treat the same matrix by the third variant (see Table 3). For this example, this variant presents no difficulty. Also  as before. The student is invited to effect this reciprocation by means of the fourth variant, in which the largest diagonal element available is chosen as the pivot at each stage; it begins with the bottom right-hand element. 2.2.2 The method of submatrices This method has nothing in common with the pivotal method, but has great advantages in certain circumstances. (a) Suppose we have a computer which will accommodate a matrix of order m, but we require to reciprocate a larger matrix A of order n where . (b) Suppose we have a matrix B of which we know the reciprocal ; B is now bordered, so that it becomes a submatrix of a larger matrix A, and we require A-1. The method of submatrices is particularly useful in solving both these problems. Let A be partitioned in the form  Here A is of order n, B of order m, E of order n — m; C and D are in general rectangular. Let the reciprocal of A be similarly partitioned:   Then the equations  provide relations from which, in general,  , may be explicitly found. Various formulae are possible, but the most advantageous from the computational standpoint appear to be the following. Write  Then  as may be checked by evaluating  It is to be noted that, although these formulae involve a number of multiplications, only two reciprocations, B-1 (of order m) and  (of order n — m) are involved. Problem (a) It is clear that the formulae just established provide a method of solution for problem (a) since  and the computer can reciprocate both B and  and perform the required multiplications. Example 1 Although it is very small, we may use the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4) to illustrate the principles involved. We shall here partition it into four square submatrices, each of order 2. In this simple illustrative case we avoid decimals. Thus    We are now able to evaluate the remaining submatrices of the reciprocal as  Accordingly, the reciprocal is  in agreement with the result found earlier. Problem (b) It is also clear that Equations (3) and (4) provide a solution for this problem. We are given  and we border B as in (1) and apply our solution to obtain  The working is then exactly as in the example just given. The formulae are, however, rendered much simpler if we have only line bordering, i.e. C is a column, D a row, and E a scalar. Then X is a column, Y a raw, and  a scalar. It follows that we can provide the answer to a third problem,(c): the successive evaluation of the reciprocals of the leading minors of a matrix A until  is achieved. Example 2 Again, we choose the matrix A of Equation (2.2.1.4):(i) The leading minor of order 1, b1, is the element 6: reciprocal 1/6. (ii) Using (i), we apply the formulae (3),(4) to find the reciprocal of the leading minor of order 2, viz:  Here   and we deduce  (iii) We now use this result to examine the third order minor  Then  similarly,  Also  Note that, in Equations (4) which we now evaluate,  is a matrix of rank 1. We find  (iv) Using , we proceed to obtain the reciprocal of . We leave this step to the reader, but observe that  Since an element in the reciprocal of a matrix M is defined as the ratio of the cofactor of the corresponding element in M to the determinant , it follows that, for example,  and hence   In this example, therefore,  2.2.3 Column (or row) building This method makes use of Theorem IX of  which states that if we have a square matrix Ao of order n, and know , then by a simple calculation we can find the reciprocal  of a new matrix , where  is a unit rank matrix, also of order n,  being an arbitrary column and row respectively. A second application of the theorem enables us to find , where  and so on, until we find , where  In this present context, suppose we have a matrix A of order n and require to find its reciprocal. Then it is possible, using (1), so to choose, , etc. that Ao is transformed into A, when a last simple calculation gives  The method has many variants: we can build A column by column, or row by row, or column and row simultaneously. We give here what seems to be the simplest approach. We choose  (or possibly a scalar matrix ). Then, if  is the isolating row vector, we form  Here  is the first column of A except that the leading element  is diminished by 1; thus the first column of  is identical with that of A, while the (n — 1) remaining columns are those of I. By Theorem IX of 1.22  Next we evaluate (this step is not quite so simple)  so that  Here  is the second column of A but with the second element reduced by 1;  and  is the second element of  Further steps follow this  pattern and are obvious. We may, however, observe that (4) may be written  i.e. as the sum of  and a rank 1 matrix of which the rows are proportional to the second row of . Example 1 We choose the same numerical matrix as before (Equation (2.2.1.4)), viz:  so that    2.2.4 Triangulation We have already seen, in  that reciprocation of a triangular matrix can be achieved by a simple process of back-substitution. Accordingly, if we first reduce a matrix A to triangular form we can then proceed to determine its reciprocal. The usual reduction to triangular form is by a pivotal condensation similar to that described in 2.2.1, except that we only remove elements below the diagonal. We may best illustrate this with out usual example (see Table 1). What we have done is to keep  but use it to eliminate the leading elements of  and so on, reducing the number of rows by 1 at each step. We have now, in effect, achieved the equation    This has been obtained by triangulation without row interchange. If we now proceed to the process of back-substitution, this is in effect operating again with rows, and all it does is to compete the process which was done continuously in the pivotal condensation of 2.2.1. There is thus no advantage at all in he intermediate triangulation step. However, much attention has been given in the literature to inversion of triangular matrices by methods other than back-substitution, particularly iterative methods. We illustrate below one direct method. Triangulation has many important uses. When we reduce a matrix A to triangular form, we write it as . We may first note that the product of the diagonal elements of the leading matrix in (1) is evidently . If we divide each row through by its diagonal element,(1) becomes  The leading matrix here is of the form I + C, where C is null except for the elements above the diagonal. Now, provided  as r increases,  as may be checked by premultiplication by I + C. In this example   and on use of (3) we obtain from a single multiplication  Premultiplication of(2) by (4) yields finally  in agreement with results given earlier. 2.3 ITERATIVE METHODS These methods are well suited to computers and often have the advantage that, should an error occur, at worst it lengthens the computations a little. 2.3.1 Improvement of an approximate reciprocal This is an important topic; it often happens that an approximate reciprocal of a matrix A is known: perhaps from a rough calculation, or one in which an error has been made, or even that belonging to a neighbour matrix of A. Refinement of this approximate reciprocal is then required. The usual procedure is as follows. Let R be the exact reciprocal and  the approximation. Write  Then  Premultiply by  then since   Thus  is a new approximation to R, and we may repeat the cycle as required to obtain R, subject to convergence of the method. The conditions for this are readily established. From (2) we find.  and further steps give   and so on. Thus, provided  as r increases, the method will converge very rapidly. This will normally be the case of R1 is a reasonably good approximation, when the elements of  will be small. At each step the method requires the multiplication of two matrices such as AR1, the subtraction of the result from 2I, and then the second multiplication, e.g.  to obtain the next approximation. An alternative procedure which achieves the same result but is more convenient computationally is the following. Write  Then  Inversion of this and premultiplication of the result by R1 gives, provided  as r increases.  It is readily checked, in view of(3) et seq., that he product of the first two terms in (5) is R2, of the first three is R3, and so on . The number of matrix multiplications in this procedure is the same as before; but the squaring of  etc. is usually relatively easy since they become rapidly smaller in practice. Indeed, if, for example in (5),  and higher powers are sensibly null to the order of accuracy required, we can write  saving one multiplication. In practice, since the numbers in  and I become progressively and rapidly more disparate, it is better to deal with them separately; i.e. the operations in (5) are carried on as follows; we are given A and R1:(i) evaluate  (ii) evaluation …until to the order of accuracy required a power of E1 is sensibly null. (ii) evaluate  and add R 1 to get R 2 ,(iv) evaluate  and add  to get ,(v) evaluate  and add  to get , and so on. Normally, very few steps are needed. Example 1 Suppose we are given  Then A is the matrix of our previous examples, and R1 an approximate reciprocal, given to three places of decimals. It is required to find the reciprocal R of A, correct to six places of decimals. Then  where the figures are exact.  is thus exact to six decimal places, viz:  but  would require 12 decimal places. We retain only eight:  an to this order of accuracy  is null. Hence   Since  is null, we can apply (6), when  where we have retained eight decimal places. Finally, to six decimal places   2.3.1 General Iteration The most general iteration procedure appears to be the following. We require to solve RA = I for R. Write the known matrix A as A = B — C, where B is a matrix having a known (or easily found) reciprocal. Then the problem can be written  where we have written  There are various iterative methods for solving (2). For example, we may write it as  and use the regression formula  so that , for example , if Ro = 0, we should obtain  and so on . Evidently, these are successive steps in the solution of (2), which is valid of  as r increases.  A rather more rapid method is to write (5) as  For the simple reciprocation of a matrix A these methods hardly compete with pivotal condensation; however, they do have a place in the parallel problem of solution of linear algebraic equations. It must be stressed, however, that the choice of B must be such at  has eigenvalues with moduli all less than unity; Sylvester's expansion then shows that  as r increases. There are certain physical problems yielding matrices for which this can be guaranteed; but in general some trial and error is involved. It should be noted that (2) can be written alternatively as   leading to  It is important to observe that this general iteration procedure is really exactly the same as the method given in 2.3.1 for improvement of an approximate reciprocal. The first of Equations (4) shows that  is an approximate reciprocal, and then Equations (2.3.1.5) and (6) are the same, provided E1 and E are the same. Now, if B-1 is the same as R1,  so that the methods are effectively the same. This result shows that, although in (1) no restriction is placed on B, it must in practice be a reasonable approximation to  if the method is to converge. Example 1 We illustrate Equation (6) here. Let  Here we have chosen B as the lower triangular portion of A, and C is of course B — A. We are given that   To four places of decimals we now find  and to this order of accuracy,  is null. Then, successively (note that these are not the steps of (4)).  and  is in fact the exact reciprocal of A.  2.3.3 Special iteration procedures In Equation (2.3.2.1) the only restriction placed on B was that it should have a known or easily-found reciprocal. We now discuss two particular choices for B. (a) Seidel iteration. Here B is chosen to be the lower triangular part of A, including the diagonal, with all superdiagonal elements null. B is then reciprocated as in 1.9(8) an the methods of the last paragraph applied. The example given there is in fact an illustration of Seidel iteration. (b) Simple or diagonal iteration. Here B is chosen to be the diagonal matrix of the diagonal elements of A. Its reciprocal can therefore be written down. It is mostly used when A is a ""sparse"" matrix, with elements dominated by the diagonal; B-1 is then a reasonable approximation to R. If this is not the case, the method may not converge, or do so very slowly. For example, if we take the matrix A of the last example, an choose  then  This matrix has two real eigenvalues, 0.319 and 0.597, and a pair of complex eigenvalues of modulus 0.999. The powers of E therefore converge very slowly indeed. A better illustration follows. Example 1 Let   Then, if we retain eight decimal places  Hence, if  and so on, we find as successive approximations to  correct to six decimal places,  2.4. SPECIAL TYPES OF MATRIX Certain matrices have properties which make reciprocation rather easier than would otherwise be the case. We give a few examples. 2.4.1 Symmetric matrices The reciprocal R of a symmetric matrix is itself symmetric. For if A is symmetric and we transpose AR = I to get  then evidently  (see also 1.22, Theorem I, Corollary).   It follows that we do not need to compute all the  elements of R; n (n + 1) /2 elements, comprised in the diagonal and below, are all that are required. Example 1 We give in Table 1 a scheme for pivotal condensation of the matrix just examined in Example 2.3.3.1. For convenience, the reciprocal has been multiplied by 103; we work to six decimal places on the left, three on the right. If the last four rows of Table 1 are taken in reverse order, the required reciprocal is obtained. It is to be noted that the starred numbers in Table 1 do not need to be calculated, though it is convenient to write them down. Provided that appropriate proportions of  are subtracted from  as they stand to give zeros in the first column, the array of numbers on the left in  can be written down; when the rest of  is found, the third element of  can be inserted, and so on. Also, when  is reached, this gives the last row of R and hence also the last column, so that the eighth elements in  can be written down, and so on. However, in practice, the programming required to avoid these calculations could be more time-consuming than the straight pivotal condensation, when the symmetry of the final result gives a check on the calculations. The procedure in Table 1 also exemplifies triangulation without row interchange. The product of the underlines elements in the table gives . 2.4.2 Positive definite (symmetric) matrix The method to be described is usually attributed to Choleski. It is a simple matter, which we leave to the reader, to show that if A is real, symmetric and positive definite, then it can be written as the product BTB where B is real and triangular. Then if  and since B is triangular,  is readily found. We give a simple example. Example 1 Let  The leading element gives  (use of — 10 makes no difference). Then ab = 30, b = 3; ac = 10, c = 1; ad = -10, d = -1. Next  and so on. In this way it is quickly established that  Inversion of B as in 1.9(8) then yields  and then  It may be of interest to note that if x ={p, q, r, s}is any vector of real numbers, not all zero, then the quadratic form  may be written (see also 1.22, Theorem XIII)  where  so that, where the second term does not involve p, the third p, q, and the fourth p, q, r,  and is always positive under the conditions given. If A is not pos. def., the elements of B are in general complex. 2.4.3 Persymmetric matrix The reciprocal of a persymmetric matrix is not in general also persymmetric; e.g.   A persymmetric matrix can be treated as symmetric for the purpose of reciprocation, but otherwise it is not special. 2.4.4 Centrosymmetric matrix We shall consider here only matrices of even order; the odd-order case is quite straightforward, but is algebraically more complicated. A centrosymmetric matrix A is characterise by A = JAJ, where J is the reversing matrix. Inversion of this gives  since J2 = I; the reciprocal of A is therefore also centrosymmetric, as are the integral powers of A. If A is of order 2m, it can be partitioned into four submatrices, each of order m, thus  other representations are possible, but this appears to be the most convenient. If (2) is premultiplied and postmultiplied by  the result is A as required. We can write the reciprocal of A as  and then the product of (2) and (3) yields (twice)  These may be solved if either P or Q is non-singular; we assume P-1 exists, and we write R for P-1Q. Then from (4) we obtain  The reciprocation of A may thus be effected through two reciprocations of order m, instead of the much more laborious single reciprocation of order 2m. Example 1 Consider  Then, in the above nomenclature  Accordingly,  A caution must be added: the method is not always viable. Thus, for example,  but this result cannot be obtained by use of (4) since by inspection the submatrices of order 2 are all singular. 2.5 LINEAR ALGEBRAIC EQUATIONS A set of linear algebraic equations (often called simultaneous equations) has the form Ax = p. Here A is, in general, a rectangular matrix of order m × n with given elements, p is a given column of m elements, and x a column of n unknowns; it is required to find x. Suppose first that . Then we have more equations than unknowns. If (1) is soluble, there must be n independent equations; if these are written first, we can partition (1) in the form  where B is square and non-singular. Then  If s does not satisfy (2) the set of equations is inconsistent, and (1) does not have a valid solution. If, however, the equations are consistent, then the solution (2) for x uses only n of them; the remainder are superfluous. Now let. In this case, we have fewer equations than unknowns; we now partition (1) in the form (B, C){y, z}= p, where B is square, of order m, and y is a column of m quantities. We now obtain the partial solution for x  in which we determine m of the unknowns x in terms of B, C, p and the remaining m — n unknowns z. This is the parametric solution of 1.10. Example 1  Consider  as partitioned, the solution is (see (2))  and  so that the equations are consistent; if they are taken any two at a time, the three cases all yield the same answer. However, had the last element in p been other than 4, the three pairs of equations would have given three different answers. Example 2 . Here, a simple example is  which yields  In Examples 1 and 2 the main numerical problem is the solution of BX = r, By = p — Cz, where B is square. We now confine our attention to the case where A is square and non-singular; this is obviously germane to the above solutions. 2.5.1 Direct Method Our problem is to solve Ax = p, for x; here A is a given square and non-singular matrix of order n, p is a given column of n quantities, and x a column of n unknowns. Formally, the solution is obvious: x = A-1p. We can therefore obtain our solution by inverting, using any of the methods of 2.2, 2.3, and postmultiplying the inverse by p. In some problems we require to obtain x for each of a set of values for p; e.g. the elements of p may be functions of an independent variable, and we require x for each of a number of values of the variable. If this number is high — in particular if it exceeds n — then labour is saved by inverting A and using (2). If, on the other hand, the number is small, labour is saved as follows. We use the approach of 2.2.1; but instead of operating on (2.2.1.1) with the matrices Mi, we operate directly on (1). Evidently, we then progressively approach the solution (2). The computations, by simple operations on rows, are effected in exactly the same way. Indeed, reciprocation is really only the solution of a particular set of linear algebraic equations, in which the vectors p are successively  For a single set, in pace of e1 we use the single vector p. Example 1 Suppose we require to solve   The square matrix used here is that employed for the Examples of 2.2; we choose diagonal pivoting without row interchange. The working of the left-hand array is thus identical with that of Example 2.2.2.1. See Table 1. The last four figures in the right-hand array are given correct to three decimal places and are in fact the exact solution. 2.5.2 Iterative methods We exemplify the general iteration procedure of 2.3.2; we write B — C for A, where the reciprocal of B is known or easily obtained. Then Equation (2.5.1.1) can be written  so that, if F is written for B-1C, the solution is given by  say. As before, this may be developed in either of two ways, provided  as r increases: x = q + Fx, suggesting the regression formula  or  Though the computations may be different, these two formulae are equivalent; for if xo = 0 the regression formula gives  and so on. We illustrate (3) below. Example 1 It is required to solve  The square matrix has been used in Example 2.3.2.1. We again choose B to be A except that the elements to the right of the principal diagonal are all zero: then, as before     Note that here F = B-1C: in the previous example, E = CB-1. We now construct the iteration table (see Table 1), beginning with x1 = q and applying (3). Since, in view of the fact that F has two null columns, the first two elements of x are always multiplied by zeros, it is not necessary to compute them until the iterations are complete. At the beginning of the iteration, we have retained only two decimal places: later three, then four, until to this order of accuracy the iteration repeats. Finally, the first two elements are computed, when the last column (here x10) is the solution required. It may be observed that equations of the form x = q + Fx arise naturally in some dynamical or quasi-static problems, e.g. the distortion of a structure under applied load, when the load is varied by the distortion. 2.5.3 Choleski's method for positive definite matrices Let us now suppose that in 2.5.1 A is pos. def. Then as in 2.4.2 we can write A as  where B is triangular. The equations for solution are now  Write y for Bx; then (1) can be solved in two steps:  and then Bx = y for x. It may be noted that a set of equations Ax = p, where A is general, may be cast in the above form by premultiplication by AT:  However, this does not appear to offer any computational advantage. Resolution of  into  implies A = CB where C is an orthogonal matrix, so that . Again, however, this does not appear to offer any worthwhile computational short-cut. Example 1 Suppose we wish to solve  As in 2.4.2, we can quickly resolve the square matrix into  A self-explanatory scheme for computation is shown in Table 1. Here BT, p are written at the head of the left-hand array; by obvious row combinations we find y at the bottom. This and B are inserted at the top of the right-hand array, when again obvious row combinations give the required solution at the bottom right: in summary   2.5.4 Least squares In 2.5 we noted that if we have more equations than unknowns, the equations must be consistent, or a unique solution does not exist. Nevertheless, especially in experimental work, cases often arise where the number of equations exceeds the number of unknowns. For example, suppose we have a measurable quantity f which we have reason to suppose is a polynomial function of an independent variable t:  and we wish to find the m coefficients . Measurement of f at each of m values of t would provide m equations for the m unknowns; however, since f is measured and so is inexact, it may be thought better to measure f at n values of t, where  in order to minimise the effects of experimental error. How do we proceed to find optimum values of the coefficients ? The ""least squares"" solution of this problem is due to Gauss. Let the n equation in m unknowns  be written Ax -p = e, where A is of the order (n × m), x is the column of m unknowns , p is the column of n measures values of f, and e is a column of n errors. We are given A and p; e will vary with x. Gauss' proposition is that x will have its optimum value when the sum of the squares of the errors, ie.e  is a minimum. Now  and for this to be a minimum, its differential with respect to x (see 1.11) must vanish; i.e.  which is our original set of Equations (2) with e = 0, premultiplied by AT; it gives m equations for the m unknowns. Example 1 Suppose we expect the relation (1) to be  and suppose further that we have the following experimental table:   Then in view of(5) our equations for solutions may be written  Before we proceed to the least squares solution, let us see what results would be obtained if we solved these equations three at a time, with e taken to be zero for each set of three. We should get  These are all very different. Moreover, if we adopted the first solution and applied it throughout, e would become (the first three elements have been assumed zero)  which is clearly quite unacceptable for the later measurements. However, if we premultiply (6) by AT as in (4) we get  and the solution, by inspection, is x ={1, -2,1}, i.e.  If we now return to (6) and use this solution, we find  which compares very favourably with the result given earlier.  2.5.5 Least squares: weighted errors In the basic Gaussian method just described, it has been tacitly assumed that  all errors are equally likely. The method is readily adapted, however, to cases where some weighting of errors is desirable: it is merely a case of premultiplying (2.5.4.2) by an appropriate diagonal matrix. Example 1 Suppose we wish to put a straight line  through the following set of experimental points:  Suppose further that, in view of the experimental method, we may expect errors in f to be proportional to t. Let us first examine the straight Gaussian solution. The equations can clearly be written  Premultiplication by AT yields  so that the optimum lime, if all errors are equally likely, is f = 0.57t + 1.80. However, we are given that errors are likely to be proportional to t. To make them equally likely, we must multiply the first of Equations (1), at t = 1, by 6; the second, at t = 2, by 3; the third, at t = 3, by 2, etc; i.e. we premultiply (1) by Diag(6,3,2,1,5,1,2,1). The result is   and premultiplication of this by  yields  to two decimal places. Hence in this case, the optimum line is f = 0.50t + 2.01. For comparison, the errors e in the two solutions (2) and (3) are (the lines intersect at t =3)  and it is clear that in the second case the errors increase markedly with t, as required. II: EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS 2.6 THE CHARACTERISTIC EQUATION The n eigenvalues of a square matrix A = (Aij) of order n are given (see 1.16) by the roots of the characteristic equation  which, in expanded form, can be written  In theory, therefore, the calculation of the eigenvalues of A is straightforward: we form the characteristic determinant in (1), expand it to the form (2), and solve this by any suitable means to obtain . Having obtained the eigenvalues, can readily find the corresponding eigenvectors. If r is a known eigenvalue (which we assume here to be unrepeated) and  the corresponding column and row eigenvectors respectively, then   Since  are each arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we can in each vector make a suitable element unity; then Equations (3) provide in each case n linear algebraic equations for the (n — 1) unknown elements: one equation is superfluous, or can be used as a check. For example, if we make the last element of  unity, and partition () to isolate its last column and row, we can write (3) as  which give  Equations (5) can be solved by any of the methods of 2.5 (the second would be transposed to , and then  Unfortunately, so far as the expansion of (1) to (2) is concerned, theory and practice are at odds. With  general, the labour involved in the expansion is quite prohibitive even for small values of n, and indirect methods are always used in practice. We describe two such methods below; first, however, we observe that, in (2), we can readily obtain the two coefficients p1, pn, since (see 1.22, Theorem II, III)  The evaluation of a numerical determinant, even of high order, is very quickly accomplished on any modern computer by reduction to triangular form; thus we can find p1 and pn without difficulty. It remains, however, to find p2, p3,…, pn-1. 2.6.1 Location method In Equation (2.6.1) we arbitrarily assign (n — 2) different values to  (other than  = 0, which we have in effect used to determine pn) and then evaluate the (numerical) determinant for each of these. We then obtain n — 2 linear algebraic equations for the n — 2 unknowns pi. A caution should be added: most the arbitrary values of  should preferably lie among the zeros of  (; otherwise inordinately high accuracy may be needed. At this stage, the zeros of  () are now known, but their approximate locations may often be inferred from their sum and product as given by (2.6.6) and (2.6.7). Example 1 Let  The sum of the eigenvalues is thus  and their product 3906.25 (=p4). Their arithmetic mean is thus about 11 an the fourth root of  about 8. These suggest that we might use  = 20,  = 10 in (2.6.1); we have already used  = 0 to obtain . It is readily found, by condensing the numerical determinants,  Now we know that  or  Insertion of  = 20,  = 10 in (3) together with the numerical values of  (gl}) from (2) yields the two equations  which give p2 = 606.25, p3 = 2812.5. Hence  on factorisation. The eigenvalues of A are thus 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5. We illustrate the calculation of the eigenvector  corresponding to the eigenvalue 12.5. Then   giving  of which the solution is (any method from 2.5 may be used)  and it is readily checked that these also satisfy the fourth equation. 2.6.2 Iteration method In view of the Cayley-Hamilton theorem, A satisfies its own characteristic equation; i.e.  Postmultiply this by any arbitrary column co and write . Then a computer will rapidly evaluate the successive products  and so on. Accordingly (1) yields  This provided n linear algebraic equations for the n unknowns pi. As before, we can find  independently if we so wish. It must be added, however, that this method is not suitable when n is large. As we shall see later, the columns ci usually tend to proportionality as i increases, so that Equations (2) become increasingly ill-conditioned; also the numbers involved can assume widely different magnitudes. Example 1 We use the matrix A of (2.6.1.1) with co = e4. It is found that successive columns ci are then   Accordingly,(2) can be written  in agreement with (2.6.1.4). With the particular choice of co, p4 enters into the last equation only. Accordingly, if we calculate p1, p4 from the trace and determinant of A, we can discard the last equation and substitute for p1 in the remainder, when (3) reduces to  Any two of these (consistent) equations give p2, p3 their values in (4). 2.7 POWER METHODS The most commonly used device for finding the eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix A is the power method, or one of its many variants, in which A is effectively raised to a high power. We illustrate some aspects of the basic principle. 2.7.1 A dominant eigenvalue Sylvester's expansion for A is (see 1.18), in its simplest form,  and in view of the properties of the constituent matrices ,  Since the order of the terms on the right is immaterial, there is no loss of generality i supposing1 to be the eigenvalue of greatest modulus. If for the moment we assume it to be real and unrepeated, then all other eigenvalues have smaller moduli. Thus if r is increased sufficiently, say to a value s, the first term on the right of (2) dominates the rest, which become relatively insignificant. Then, in the limit,  By use of (3) we thus find both 1 and . We could in theory find them from As only, since , but there is a practical difficulty. Unless the  modulus of 1 is close to unity, the numbers appearing in Ar (r large) are either inordinately large or small; in practice therefore it is usual to find not Ar but a matrix proportional to it: at each stage in the power evaluation, a homologous element is reduced to unity. Example 1 Let A be the matrix in Equation (2.6.1.1). Then, if we reduce the bottom right-hand element to unity, we have  We now evaluate B2 and divide through by the bottom right-hand element to obtain  Evaluation of F2/2.4997 repeats F except for occasional small differences in the fourth decimal place. Now, if we round off to three decimal places, we find that F can be written as the unit rank matrix, proportional to    If we now revert to A and postmultiply by   Thus, 1 = 25. Also, the inner product  is  so that normalising to make  unity: Note that  so that A has been raised fairly rapidly to a high power. An alternative. There is, however, an alternative device which is in practice more commonly used; this is repeated premultiplication by A of an arbitrary column  as in 2.6.2. We successively evaluate  etc. If we postmultiply (2) by co and write  (ki is of course a scalar) we obtain  Accordingly, provided that co is not such that k1 () vanishes, the first term on the right dominates the rest as r increases, until in the limit when r = s  Example 2 We exemplify this using the same matrix A as above; also, we adopt the device of reducing at each stage a homologous element (in this case the bottom element) to unity, beginning with co = e4. The first step is  Proceeding in this way, we find successive columns as in Table 1. Also given are the dividing factors at each step. Since c16 repeats c15, they give x1; also the dividing factor 25 is 1. To complete the solution, we now require to find ; this could be done by repeating the iterative procedure, evaluating , where  is an arbitrary row, or more usually, by the device given in (2.6.4), viz:  giving  We leave it to the reader to show that in this example,(7) leads to  or to a scalar multiple of it. We normalise  in the usual way. We may note in passing that (as they should) the columns  and  of Table 1 agree with the last columns of B, C, D, E, F (subject to rounding-off errors in the last place of decimals). This leads naturally to a comparison of the two methods. There are two reasons why the second method is commonly used. First, if an error (even of rounding-off only) is made during the successive squaring process, it is multiplied by itself   subsequently, an persists through the calculations; in the second method, if an error is made in calculating ci, this only amounts to choosing a new arbitrary column, an at worst may prolong the calculations. But, mainly, the first method usually involves more work than the second. It is difficult to quantify ""work"" exactly, but if the number of individual multiplications is taken as a guide, then, if A is of order n, each of the n2 elements of  involves n multiplications: i.e. n3 in all. If r squaring processes are needed, we perform rn3 multiplications, yielding , r must be an integer. In the column process, each step involves n2 multiplications; hence, to reach the same accuracy, between  and  multiplications are needed. Now, provided the eigenvalues are reasonably separated, column iterations usually number between 15 and 50. Suppose, in a particular case, 25 are required. Then the ""work"" is measured as  From Table 2, r must be 5, with the work measure for squaring 5n3. The ratio is n/5; so if  the work involved in squaring is greater. If, say, n is 100, the work is 20 times greater.  2.7.2 Subdominant eigenvalues: deflation Again, for the moment we assume the eigenvalues of A to be real and unrepeated; and we assume that in (2.7.1.1) they appear in descending order of modulus. If, as in 2.7.1 we have found , then Equation (2.7.1.1) can be written  The known matrix on the left now has all the eigenvalues and vectors of A except the first set, and it can be treated as in 2.7.1. The process of reducing A in this way is known as ""deflation"" . Evidently the eigenvalue 1 has been replaced by zero, so that A1 is singular. Having evaluated A1, we can again apply column iteration. However, we need not begin with an arbitrary column; we can readily find an appropriate column to begin with, which avoids many iteration steps. An example will make this clear. Example 1 We continue Example 2.7.1.1. The iterations have shown that 1 = 25, while x1 is proportional to{ 1,2,3,5}and  to (1,7,5,4). Normalising these, we find   Note that  vanishes when premultiplied by . We now revert to the iterations for 1 an observe that, for example, c9 of Table 2.7.1.1 is mostly composed of x1. The remainder will clearly be mostly . Since x1 is orthogonal to , the part of c9 due to x1 will disappear when it is premultiplied by A1 (see 1))). Thus we find  and dividing by the last element, we find as a starting column co for iteration with A1   The iterations give us successive columns as in Table 1. Column c9 repeats c8, so that 2 = 12.5 and  is proportional to{ -0.5, = -0.5,0,1}. As before, we now find that  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising, we find  We proceed to the third eigenvalue; we further deflate A by subtracting the unit rank matrix (3) from A1:  Note that  = 7.5, while  is in fact doubly degenerate; it vanishes when premultiplied by  or . As before, we choose a column from Table 1 — say c3 ={-0.4978, -0.4992, -0.0015,1}— and apply it as a postmultiplier to . The result is a column proportional to{ 0.981, 0.0095,— 1.0095, 1}. We leave it to the reader to show that this leads rapidly to 3 = 5 with x3 proportional to{ 1,0,— 1,1}an that  is then found to be proportional to (27, -11, -15.8). We normalise this to obtain  an now further deflate A to obtain A3; in this case, as will be seen, no iteration is required to obtain a solution:   In obtaining the last form of(5) we have noted (a) that ; since the other three eigenvalues have been replaced by zeros, 4 = 2.5;(b) A3 is, by inspection, of unit rank an so, with 4 extracted, can be written in the form (5). This completes the solution. With the four terms of the Sylvester expansion now given numerically in (2),(3),(4) and (5), the whole solution can be expressed compendiously as  2.7.3 Subdominant eigenvalues: sweeping Although the delation procedure discussed in 2.7.2 is the most straightforward possible method, other devices are often useful and sometimes preferable. We now discuss ""sweeping"" , which takes two forms. (i) First method Instead of operating with a deflated matrix, we operate on the original matrix A (or a part of it) with a column vector from which all contributions from x1 have been ""swept"" away. This is valuable, for example, when (as is often the case in dynamical problems) A is sparse. Deflation destroys this characteristic; the sweeping method under discussion does not. With r = 0, Equation (2.7.1.5) becomes  Hence if we choose co to make k1 zero, it will contain no contribution from x1, and, as r increases sufficiently to a value s,(2.7.1.5) will tend to  The condition  means that we can express one element of co in terms of the remaining n — 1. In theory, if co is chosen in this way, the iterations will in due course yield (2) without further attention. In practice, rounding-off errors soon produces inaccuracies which re-introduce small  proportions of x1, which tend to grow relatively rapidly. It is therefore best to apply the criterion  at each step; i.e. to calculate one element of cr from this criterion when the others have been found. This means that we can ignore one row of A; we exemplify this below. As before, we need not be completely arbitrary i our choice of co (though it must satisfy ) from (1), a column free of x1 is  with co arbitrary. But we can with advantage choose co to be a column in the previous iteration to find1 etc.: this will contain mostly x1, some , but little else; then  eliminates the contribution from x1. Example 1 We use the same example as before, restating for convenience what we have already found.  Note that  have been normalised to give . Now any postmultiplying column say{ a, b, c, 1}, must satisfy  In performing our iterations, therefore, we may ignore completely the first row of A; we use the last three rows to find the corresponding elements in a column, and then apply(3) to find the top element. For our initial column co, we again choose the column c9 from Table 2.7.1.1, in the iteration to find 1 etc.; thus for our present purpose  Then  and  As it should, this column vanishes when premultiplied by . We divide throughout by the last element to obtain as our new starting column  then the iterations, using (3) at each step, begin   We postmultiply A (ignoring its top row) by the column (4) to get the column of three numbers on the right; divide by the last element to get the bottom three elements in the next column, and find the top element from (3). In this way, we obtain the successive columns and dividing factors in Table 1. Thus we find . As before, knowing 2, we find  is proportional to (-1, -2,0,1). Normalising:  The same principle serves for the third root. If cr ={a, b, c, 1}then  and  must both vanish; we find   If we select c3 from Table 1 as our new co, it already excludes x1, so that  will also exclude . This is  If this is written{ 0.9333,0.0333,— 1.0333,1}, it satisfies (6). We now iterate on A, but ignore the first two rows:  We leave it to the reader to show that this converges quickly to 3 = 5, x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. In the usual way,  is found to be proportional to{ 27, -11, -15.8}. Normalising:  As before, no iteration is needed for the completion of the solution. If we choose the last column above (which excludes x1 and ) as a new co, then a column which also excludes x3 is  Since x1, , x3 are excluded, this column is proportional to x4. Premultiplication by a row of A gives 4 = 2.5; completion of the solution is straightforward. (ii) Second method Instead of sweeping our iterated columns at each step, we can do it one for all with the aid of a ""sweeping matrix"" . In view of(3) we may write  If (8) is used as postmultiplier of A, it is clear that A is deflated by the sweeping matrix in (8) to   (note that A1 here differs from the deflated form A1 of 2.7.2). If A is of simple form (e.g. sparse) this characteristic may be partly or wholly destroyed in forming A1; on the other hand, A1 has a column of zeros, and thus its own simplicity. This means also that the umber of the head of a column iteration is always multiplied by zero, an so need not be calculated till the final step. We are thus effectively operating with the third-order submatrix of A1 when its first row and column are omitted. As before, we may find a suitable initial column such as(4). We then perform the iteration, omitting the first element of (4):  The numbers produced in this way reproduced exactly those of the last three elements in the columns of Table 1, as well as the dividing factors; they are of course exactly the same calculations, but with the matrices associated differently. At the conclusion, the top element of the final column is found by use of the first row of A1. We must emphasise, however, that the row vectors A1 are not , . Hence, when 2 has been found, we revert to A itself to find . For the next root, we use another sweeping matrix based on the second part of (5):   If this square matrix is used to postmultiply A1 we find  We now iterate on the submatrix  to determine the last two elements of x3; we leave the completion of the solution to the reader., 2.7.4 Shifting and inverse iteration Theorem IV of 1.22 noted that, in view of the identity  addition of a quantity{ ge}to each of the diagonal elements of A implies the addition of{ ge}to each of the eigenvalues of A. We note here, additionally, that the constituent matrices zii of A are unaltered by such a change. Sylvester's expansion gives (see 1.18)  whence  The device of adding{ ge}in this way is known as ""shifting"" , and has a variety of uses. For example, with hindsight, we know that the eigenvalues of A in (2.6.1.1) are 25, 12.5, 5 and 2.5. the rapidity of convergence of the initial power solution depends principally on the relative separation of the eigenvalues 25 and 12.5, i.e. 2:1. If we reduce all eigenvalues by 7.5, they become 17.5, 5,— 2.5,— 5 and the relative separation is 31/2:1 which yields much quicker convergence. Note that this is the optimum: the second and fourth eigenvalues now have equal moduli. To select the optimum requires accurate knowledge of the eigenvalues, which at the outset of a calculation is of course not available; but if one has a general idea of the disposition of the eigenvalues, shifting can save much time. The principle use of shifting, however, lies in inverse iteration. Suppose, for example, that the matrix A is the system matrix of a vibrating mechanical system, and suppose further that this system is excited by a  forcing vibration of frequency corresponding to  = . It is desired to determine the eigenvalue (and its vectors) nearest to  in order to study the response. To approach this problem, we first note that Sylvester's expansion for negative powers of a matrix B gives  It follows that the eigenvalue of B with the smallest modulus now becomes the eigenvalue of B-1 with largest modulus. Hence, to solve our problem, we first evaluate B = A — the eigenvalue of A nearest to  now becomes the eigenvalue of B nearest zero, i.e. of smallest modulus. (Note that A, B and B-1 all have the same constituent matrices zii.) We therefore invert B and iterate on B-1 as usual to obtain our solution. Example 1 Once more we choose the matrix A defined in (2.6.1.1) and used in previous examples. We also let  = 5.5. Then  If we invert this, e.g. by the methods of 2.2, we obtain  We postmultiply this by an arbitrary column co: here we choose co = e1 and iterate as usual. The successive columns are given in Table 1. The iterations converge rapidly to x ={1,0,— 1,1}with the eigenvalue of B-1 equal to -2. Hence the eigenvalue of B is — 0.5 an of A is 5.5 — 0.5 = 5, in accordance with results obtained earlier for 3 and x3. Note that, since the eigenvalues of A are in fact 25, 12.5, 5, 2.5, those of B are 19.5, 7,— 0.5,— 8, and of B-1 therefore 0.0513, 0.1429,— 2,— 0.124. The relative separation of the two roots of largest moduli is here 14:1. Clearly, the method is not restricted to mechanical systems: by its means we can study the eigenvalues and vectors of any matrix A which lie near any given value o of .  2.7.5 Confluent eigenvalues So far, we have restricted our attention to unrepeated real roots of the characteristic equation belonging to a matrix A; we now consider the case of two equal real roots. Multiple roots are in practice very rate (except perhaps for mechanical systems moving freely in space, when multiple zero roots can occur: but these have a special simplicity). The treatment for two roots is readily extended to the multiple case if required: even for two roots, however, we require to examine two cases (see 1.21). We assume the roots to have dominant moduli, any roots of greater modulus having been removed by deflation etc. (i) Characteristic matrix doubly degenerate When a repeated eigenvalue 1 makes the characteristic matrix doubly degenerate, we know (see (1.21.14)) that the Sylvester expansion of the system matrix A is  It follows that we can use the power method to find 1; postmultiplication by co gives in the limit, when r is sufficiently large, say s,  We thus find 1 without difficulty; but the determination of z11 + z22 requires further consideration. Now   and  is thus, in general a linear combination of 1, . At this point, the iteration has given no indication that a double root is involved; however, this becomes apparent when we seek the row vector corresponding to cs: for all first minors of 1I — A vanish and we cannot find a unique row vector. To proceed, it is simplest to generalise (2.6.4) by partitioning off the last two rows and columns of 1I — A, thus:  Here  is a square submatrix of order  of order 2;  has two columns and  has two rows. Then  These algebraic equations are solved for ; we now have two independent columns  which annihilate 1I — A when used as postmultipliers; and correspondingly for the rows . We now normalise them; we evaluate  Then m is a square matrix of order 2 and, for example,  are normalised rows and columns. Finally  Note that only the sum  is unique. If they are individually expressed as  and  then their sum can be written  where M is an arbitrary non-singular matrix of order 2. This replaces x1,  with two different linear combinations (x1, ) M of them, with corresponding changes for . It will be observed that in this approach we have not used cs (which we have already found); its introduction would spoil the simplicity of (2). When x1,  have been found, it is possible to check that cs is a linear combination of them., Example 1 Consider the matrix   It is assumed that at this stage we have no knowledge of its eigenvalues. If we choose  and iterate in the usual way, we find quite quickly that  Normally, we would choose  However, if we attempt to use (2.6.4) to find , it at once emerges that all first minors of 1I- A vanish, indicating that 1 = 12.5 is a repeated root. We therefore apply (2) with  This gives for the solution of (2)  Since the columns and rows are arbitrary to a scalar multiplier, we may now write  (for simplicity of exposition we have multiplied the first column on the right by 3). The product of the numerical matrices in (8), in that order, is (see (3))  If we premultiply  we ca finally write  These enable us to choose, if they are required,  but, following (5), we could equally well use any two different linear combinations o x1, , represented by (x1, ) M provided these are associated with ., /div4. (ii) Characteristic matrix simply degenerate This case is rather more difficult: the difficulty derives from the appearance of a unit in the superdiagonal of the spectral matrix of the given matrix A. For simplicity of exposition we assume here that A is of order 4: extension to larger matrices is obvious. We know (see 1.21) that ,  so that  on expansion of the triple product. We know further that, in view of the properties of the constituent matrices zij,  When  is absent, this reverts to the simpler case dealt with under (i). Our task now is, given A, to resolve it numerically into one of the forms (12), i.e. to find 1 etc. Sine, a priori, we do not know the nature of A, we should approach this task as usual by iteration with A on an arbitrary column co. If we write  then postmultiplication of (13) by co yields  When the iterations have proceeded so far, say when r = s, that contributions from 3, 4 are insignificant and may be neglected, then   Previously, with  absent, at this stage  equalled . Now, owing to the last term, this is no longer true and successive columns tend to show a near arithmetical progression in their elements. It is true that, when s is very large  the columns tend ultimately to x1 (last term in cs dominant), but the number of iterations required is very large. However, in place of the simple  we can drive from (15) the relation  In practice, therefore, if convergence seems very slow, we evaluate three successive columns fully, omitting the reduction of a homologous element to unity, and solve the quadratic  for at least two homologous elements. If they have a common root, we test the remaining quadratics to see if they are satisfied by this common root. If they re, then the root is 1 and the iterations have proceeded far enough (r = s) for only terms in 1 to remain. Knowing 1 we use (15) to evaluate  giving us a column proportional to x1. Knowing 1, we now form the matrix 1I — A; if we put r = 0,1 in (13), multiply the first by 1 and then subtract the second:  Premultiplication of this by , or postmultiplication by x1, annihilates it; none of the other vectors does so: the matrix is rendered simply degenerate by the presence of z12. We may, however, use (2.6.4) to find , we then known 1 and  subject to scalar multipliers. To find  we revert to (11), which yield, inter alia,  or  Since 1I — A is simply degenerate, the last equations provide, in general , n — 1 independent linear equations for  (and ). However, one element in each of these vectors may be assigned arbitrarily. For, since (1I — A) x1 vanishes, the equation for  is also satisfied by , where q is arbitrary; so, for example, if we choose a non-zero element in , the homologous element in  may be made zero by appropriate choice of 1. Similar considerations apply for . We are thus able to solve (19) for  and . Having done this, we now require to normalise: we evaluate  and we may then choose our vectors as, for example, ,  and the pair  which we now call . We have now obtained 1 the vectors  and , and the auxiliary vectors  and ; we are therefore in a position to deflate A (see (12)) by removing all contributions from these quantities. The solution is then completed in the usual way. Example 2 We require to find the modal and spectral matrices of  We begin by iterating on co. If we choose co = e4, then after about 18 steps, four successive columns are  These show very slow convergence; indeed, the elements show a near-arithmetical progression. We therefore choose, say, the first of these columns and without reducing the last element to unity, calculate the next two columns:  We choose, say, the first and last elements of these and solve   The common root 12.5 also satisfies the middle two quadratics; hence we find 1 = 12.5. We now use (17) and find{ 2.2875, 4.6875, 7.5, 13.125}— 12.5{ 0.165, 0.355, 0.57,1}={0.125, 0.25, 0.375, 0.625}and hence  may be taken as{ 1,2,3,5}. Using (21) we now evaluate  and it may be checked that postmultiplication by  gives a null product. We use (22) as in (2.6.4) to find , we leave the solution to the reader: it is found that  which when used to premultiply (22), annihilates it. We now proceed to find the auxiliary vectors. If we write  (the first element of  is nonzero, so that of  may be taken as zero) then we solve, using the appropriate submatrices (see(19))  The solution is . A similar calculation yields . We must now normalise these. We evaluate  Note that here, since the second row and first column of the product are necessarily orthogonal, m is triangular; also in this case it happens that m-1 = m. Accordingly, we may choose to retain the columns  and to adopt the rows, orthogonal to , ,   We are now able to evaluate  and  We can now deflate A (see (21)) to  Note that trA1 = 7.5; also A1 is doubly degenerate, being annihilated by postmultiplication by both  and . Iteration with A1 on co = e4 produces quite quickly the simple eigenvalue 3 = 5 and vector x3 ={1,0, -1,1}. We then evaluate 5I — A1 and employ (2.6.4) to obtain . Normalising this with x3, we obtain  and we are now able to deflate A further to   Since  and  is the only remaining eigenvalue,  and  can be written  which completes the solution. The results may be expressed compendiously as  The numbers are not of course unique. We could, for example, divide x4 by any factor f provided we multiply  by f. However, if for example we divide  by 10 and multiply  by 10, we must replace the unit in the superdiagonal of  by 10. 2.7.6 Conjugate complex eigenvalues and vectors of a real matrix So far, we have restricted our studies to real eigenvalues. However, complex eigenvalues and vectors are of frequent occurrence , and require special consideration. First, if the matrix is real, then its characteristic equation must have real coefficients. Hence, if it is satisfied by , then it will also be satisfied by ; complex eigenvalues of a real matrix therefore occur in conjugate pairs. In a similar way, if the eigenvector corresponding to  is , then the relation  implies the conjugate relation; hence p — iq is the eigenvector corresponding to the eigenvalue  Evidently, the vector in (1) is arbitrary to a scalar complex multiplier, say  +  another vector satisfying (1) is thus  Any arbitrary linear combination of p and q may therefore be taken as the real part of the vector, with a corresponding combination for the imaginary part. If we expand (1) we obtain successively  If we eliminate q we find   The same equation is satisfied by q. This suggests that the square matrix in it is doubly degenerate and that p, q can each have two arbitrary elements; but this is not so. When  p are known, q is uniquely related to p by  in which  is not singular. What is said above gives a background to what follows. We assume once more than  have dominant moduli, any eigenvalues of greater moduli having been removed by deflation etc. Again, a priori, we assume nothing is known of the nature of A, so that the process of finding the dominant eigenvalue and its vector is approached as usual by iterating with A on an arbitrary column co. Once again, for simplicity, we assume A to be of order 4. The Sylvester expansion of A gives  Accordingly, if we perform the usual iteration on co and continue until, with r = s, terms in 3 and 4 are negligible.  where  is a complex scalar. Now, as we have seen (p + iq) is arbitrary to a complex scalar multiplier (and p — iq similarly). We are therefore at liberty to choose  and then  Elimination of p, 1 from these three equations yields  Note that, since  this is precisely the same as Equation (3); however, in the iteration case, it is only true when the iterations have proceeded sufficiently far for the terms in 3, 4 to disappear, when cs consists only of p. Now in practice, with a pair of complex eigenvalues, the elements in  tend to change sign periodically: there is no point in reducing a homologous element to unity, since there is no convergence to a settled form. When  behave in this way, conjugate complex eigenvalues must be suspected; and then three consecutive columns must be periodically tested to see whether various pairs of  homologous elements give consistent values for . When this happens, the iteration has gone far enough, and we can take p = cs, when q is determined from the second of equations (6), which is in fact the same as (4). We now know{ gm},{go}p and q. Finding  is not so straightforward. Knowing  we can either(i)Solve  with one element of  arbitrarily assigned. We then have to solve a set of linear algebraic equations with complex coefficients;(ii) Iterate with A postmultiplying an arbitrary row ; this will lead to  (and  again) as for p, q. (iii) Solve the equations which parallel (3) and(4):  Since  are known, this, like (ii), involves only real numbers; on the other hand, it requires , the evaluation of which requires considerable computer time if the order of A is large. On the whole, since most modern computers can work with complex numbers,(i) seems the most straightforward. When we have obtained  we can perform a check, which is in any event needed when the vectors are normalised. For since  belong to different eigenvalues, they are orthogonal, and  so that  For the process of normalisation, we require to evaluate  and m is evidently diagonal; in view of the check equations (9) it can be written  the determinant of which is , so its reciprocal is readily written down and we can obtain normalised forms of . We can now deflate A. Since  a deflated matrix A1 is  We can therefore use A1 to obtain the remaining eigenvalues and vectors of A in the usual way. Example 1 Let  If we use this for iterative premultiplication of an arbitrary column, say the summing vector, successive columns are as show in Table 1.  It is apparent from the first that the vector elements are changing sign; so we do not reduce a homologous element to unity (though in general we might periodically remove a power of 10). If, starting say at c5, we test to see if pairs of homologous elements give consistent values for ,  in (7), we find  this is not so. However,  give nearly consistent values; we therefore begin with  accurately:  If these three columns are used in (7) then any two pairs of homologous elements give . We thus obtain  Also, we may now choose  and using the second of Equations (6) we now find  We now have to find , and for this we use (8). One element of  can be arbitrarily assigned: here we assign the value 1 to the third element and solve  which, if we omit one column (e.g. the last) from the square matrix, gives  We omit the details of solution; the answer is   Note that  Accordingly,  and if we postmultiply p + iq as given by (14) and (15) my m-1 we obtain as our normalised p, q,  We are now able to deflate A. Equation (11) becomes, with A given by (12) and use of (13),(14),(15) and (16),  A1 is, in fact, doubly degenerate; it is annihilated by both the columns immediately above it. iteration with A1 on an arbitrary column quickly leads to the result  Further delation leads at once to  which completes the solution. 2.7.7 Adjacent eigenvalues: Two eigenvalues with nearly-equal moduli When two eigenvalues have nearly-equal moduli, it is obvious that very many iterations will be required for a direct solution. The following device can be helpful in this case. Suppose the iterations have proceeded so far that only contributions from the two nearly-equal eigenvalues remain. Then we can write, when a homologous element is not made unity,  Here a, b, c, d; p, q are the values of a homologous element in the various columns; a, b, c, d are known. Elimination of p, q, yields two equations which may be solved for 1 + 2 and 12:  Hence, ,  are readily found. When they are known, then  which follow from the first two of Equations (1). When 1, 2 are very close, both numerator and denominator in (2) tend to be small differences, so that accurate calculation of a, b, c, d is desirable. In practice, iteration in this case behaves rather like that for a defective matrix (2.7.5), in that convergence is slow and successive columns tend to a quasi-arithmetic progression of the elements. The occurrence of nearly-equal roots is more common than that of a defective matrix; hence tests to see whether homologous elements yield, in (2), consistent results should be applied first when convergence is slow.   Example 1  Iteration on a column, beginning with co = e4, yields successive columns as given in Table 1. At this stage, we make consecutive accurate calculations, to see if we can get consistent values for :  Using the elements of the last line in (2) we obtain  The elements of the first line give  The results are consistent, as indeed are the results from the second and third lines. By inspection (or from the implied quadratic)  We now evaluate the eigenvectors:  so that we may take  I now remains to find the corresponding row vectors and to deflate A for  further study; we leave this to the reader. However, we may note here that  whence . 2.7.8 Applicability of power methods We have seen that the power method can be used to obtain dominant eigenvalues and the associated vectors, and, by deflation, sweeng, shifting and inverse iteration, can also be used to find all non-dominant eigenvalues and their vectors; the results are obtained seriatim. This implies that, if one is interested only in a limited number of eigenvalues, the power method is the obvious choice. For example, suppose we have a mathematical model with n = 100 for study of the vibration characteristics of an aircraft. The aeroelastic engineer will usually be interested only in the fundamental mode of vibration and a few overtones, say 10 in all; in the usual model this implies the dominant and the 9 immediately subdominant eigenvalues and vectors. The vibration engineer will be concerned with a band of frequencies near the engine rotational speed, and so will use shifting and inverse iteration. But in any event, the mathematical model will usually involve the finite element concept which gives accurate values for the lower band of frequencies, but is often quite unrepresentative of the top frequencies. Evaluation of all frequencies and modes is therefore not normally required. For such a model, power methods are the obvious choice. However, if interest attaches to all eigenvalues, and in particular if there is less concern with the associated vectors, other methods may be used. We now begin a brief study of transformation methods. 2.8 TRANSFORMATION METHODS In these methods, we apply a succession of similar transformations to a matrix A:  and so on, until A is transformed into a form giving the eigenvalues directly: it may be a triangular form, or the ultimate canonical form  (or  if A is defective). Since the transformations are similar, all the derived matrices B, C, D,…have the same eigenvalues as A; and if we proceed to the diagonal form, then the chain product X3…gives the modal matrix X. 2.8.1 Jacobi's method for a real symmetric matrix In 1.22, Theorems VIII and X, we have shown that a real symmetric matrix  has real eigenvalues and that it cannot be defective. Moreover, its modal matrix is orthogonal; hence  Jacobi's method is as follows. We begin by searching the off-diagonal elements of A (since A is symmetrical, we usually use the upper half only) to find the element Auv of greatest modulus. We then construct the orthogonal matrix , which is the unit matrix except that the units in the (u, u) and (v, v) positions are each replaced by  and the zeros in the (u, v) and (v, u) positions by  and s respectively. Then  and we may evaluate  of which the relevant submatrix is (omitting all other rows and columns)  which yields  We now choose{ gth}1 such that Buv vanishes; i.e.  This fixed{ gth}1. If than 2{gth}1 is positive, we take 2{gth}1 to lie in the first quadrant; if negative, in the fourth, Then{ gth}1 lies between  = c is positive and  has the sign of tan 2{gth}1. With c, s fixed, we can now evaluate B fully. Elements other than in the uth, vth columns and rows are unaltered from those in A; at the intersections of the uth, vth columns an rows the new elements are given by (3)(with Buv = 0), while the remaining elements Biu, Biv in the uth, vth columns and rows are  We may make two deductions. First, from (3) we have  and since only these diagonal elements have changed, it follows that  as it must in a similar transformation. Next, fro(5), squaring  and adding, we have  and since only the uth, vth columns and rows have changed, we deduce that the sum of the squares of all the off-diagonal elements of B is less than that of A since we have replaced the two elements Auv of A by zeros in B. Thus  Having evaluated B, we repeat the procedure to find C; we select the element Bpq of largest modulus and find  from (see 4))  we then proceed as before to construct  and . C will have Cpq = 0 and may also have cuv = 0 (if ); but this situation will not persist. At some stage, in general, elements formerly made zero will again become nonzero, though usually smaller than before. Thus Jacobi's method does not terminate in a finite, predictable number of steps; indeed, the umber may be very large. Nevertheless, following (6)  and, in an overall sense, the off-diagonal elements therefore become progressively smaller, until eventually we obtain a matrix in which the off-diagonal elements are all vanishingly small: i.e. a diagonal matrix of which the diagonal elements are the eigenvalues. We give below an example, but must enter the caveat that because of its small order (n = 3) it converges radly. At each stage, the sum of the squares of the off-diagonal elements decreases by at least one third. However, if we had a matrix of order 100, it would have 9900 off-diagonal elements, and we can only say that at each stage the sum of the squares of these elements would decrease by 1/4950 at least; convergence to diagonal form is likely to take very much longer than for a small matrix. We may add two observations. The method is viable if Auv is reduced, not to zero, but to some lesser modulus; nevertheless, reduction to zero is obviously best. Also, the method requires only that A is real and symmetric: its state of definiteness is irrelevant. In the example below, A has a negative eigenvalue. Example 1 Let  We select the off-diagonal element of largest modulus (underlined) and evaluate (we record only six decimal places)  Hence  and then  Note that  also  thus we have effected a considerable overall reduction. The second step is to obtain C. For this we select the underlined element in B an evaluate in succession   and then  Note that the zero elements in B have become nonzero in C; however,  is now 2.19132; compare  above. Proceeding in this way, after six transformations, we find to the order of accuracy employed  2.8.2 The LR and QR methods We now describe briefly two methods which are applicable to any square matrix A, whether symmetric or not, real or complex, simple or defective, non-singular or singular. Here, we shall merely state and illustrate the methods; for proofs, readers are referred to Wilkinson (6). We may note, however, that while a complex matrix A = B + iC (B, C real) may be treated as such, using complex arithmetic, it is more usual to treat its real equivalent  which (see Theorem XI, 1.22) yields the eigenvalues and vectors of A and its conjugate. 2.8.3 The LR algorithm It is a straightforward process, readily programmed for a computer, to resolve a matrix A into the product L1R1 where L1 is a lower triangular matrix having units in its diagonal, and R1 is an upper triangular matrix. For a model, we here take n = 4; it is tycal of any order. Let    Apart from the top row of  which by inspection is identical with that of A, we have here 12 equations ad 12 unknowns. From the first column of the product we have  which determine p, q, r. The second column yields  which, with p,. q, r known, determine in succession 2, s, t. The remaining unknowns 3, x33, n and the last column of R1 are found progressively in the same way. Note, however, that A11, 2, x33,…are divisors (vots) in this procedure, so that a voting strategy may be needed. Note also that , so ; hence, if A is non-singular, the diagonal elements of R1 must all be nonzero. Indeed, this program is very suitable for the numerical evaluation of determinants. The  algorithm resolves A into the product  as above, and then multiplies the factors in reverse order to obtain a new matrix B. Since  and then  is a similar transform of A. B is, in general, a fully populated matrix of which the last column is that of R1 (thus A14 reappears in B) and the last row that of L1 multiplied by x44. When B is found, it is in turn resolved into the product L2R2 and  evaluated, and so on. As the succession of similar transforms proceeds, it is found that (a) the elements below the diagonal become progressively smaller,(b) the diagonal elements tend to the eigenvalues, in descending order or modulus down the diagonal. When the process is well established, it is found that (with n = 4 as our model) the element  becomes approximately  in . When this element becomes very small  tends to decrease by the factor  and  by  and so on. Accordingly, if the eigenvalues of A are widely spaced, convergence of the  method is fairly rad; if, however, there is a pair or group of nearly-equal eigenvalues, then very many iterations may be required before the end result is achieved. This is an upper triangular matrix T, of which the diagonal elements are the(real) eigenvalues in descending order of modulus, and which still retains the  element A14 in the top right position. If A has a pair of conjugate complex eigenvalues, then T is not strictly upper triangular: the diagonal includes a block of order 2 such as  with  on the diagonal of T and  below it. In this case, the solution of  yields the complex eigenvalues. the numbers,  not in general constant under transformation; but if the iterations have proceeded so far that I is in the quasi-triangular form, the trace and determinant of (3) are invariant, so that the complex roots are fixed. As the LR transformations proceed, the most rad convergence is to the smallest eigenvalue in the bottom right-hand corner. Indeed, if there is a zero eigenvalue, it appears in the first transformation, i.e. in B. It follows that shifting (see 2.7.4) can be used with great advantage to accelerate convergence. When the element in the bottom right-hand corner has reached a settled value (i.e. the eigenvalue), we can deflate the transform, by omission of its last row and column, before continuing the iterations with a matrix of reduced order., /div4. Example 1 We choose the deflated matrix i (2.7.2.2) as A:  Since , the bottom right-hand element of  vanishes, as it should. We now evaluate the product in reverse order:  The reader is invited to check that, if B is resolved as it stands into  then C =  will also have its last row null, the zero eigenvalue thus repeating. We may therefore deflate B, omitting its last row and column and continue the iterations with the leading first minor of B. It is found that, after 22 more iterations, working to six decimal places,  Thus, the eigenvalues of A are, in descending order of modulus, 12.5, 5.0, 2.5, 0. The whole operation may in fact be summarised as LT = AL:  Recovery of the eigenvectors in the LR procedure is not straightforward, especially if deflation has been used. Since the eigenvalues are known, probably the simplest method is to use (2.6.4). However, if we have not deflated, then clearly  leads to (see (5) above)   We now require to transform T to . If TP = PA, then tycally  where PA has been multiplied out. Identification of the elements on each side, beginning with the superdiagonal, leads to  giving a, d, f. The remaining unknowns, b, e, c are found progressively. With P determined in this way, we have  so that the modal matrix of A is the product LP. The reader is invited to evaluate LP, using the numerical values of (5) in (6), and in particular to note that the eigenvector belonging to the zero root is that originally associated with the eigenvalues 25 in (2.7.2.6) The LR procedure is thus simple and easily programmed. However, in practice, it normally requires very many iterations before convergence is achieved; moreover, the process of recovering eigenvectors outlined above is apt to be ill-conditioned, and some other procedure is usually to be preferred. 2.8.4 Pre-reduction to upper Hessenberg form As we have seen, the LR procedure (and the QR method, to be discussed shortly) annihilates the elements of A below the diagonal. This is, however, usually a very long process; and while it can be accelerated by shifting and deflation, it is in fact better to depopulate A below the diagonal, as far as possible, as an initial step. An upper Hessenberg matrix has only zeros below its infradiagonal; and it is possible to transform any matrix A to this form by a similar transformation. This is the best that can be done to depopulate a matrix below its diagonal; if one could remove infradiagonal elements as well, there would be no problem in finding eigenvalues and vectors of a matrix. We illustrate reduction to upper Hessenberg form with a general matrix of order 4; it is clear that the procedure applies to matrices of any order greater than 2. We  write AK = KH as  Just as we have done earlier, we can evaluate the n2 unknowns progressively. The first column of the product gives  which determine h11, h21, p, q (note that here, also, a voting strategy may be needed). From the second column  which yield in succession  and so on. Thus, by progressive substitution, we arrive at the Hessenberg matrix ; it possesses the same eigenvalues as A. If we apply the LR or QR algorithms to H, the Hessenberg form is retained at each step; thus, instead of removing all the elements below the diagonal, we have to remove only those in the infradiagonal. Much computer arithmetic and time is thus saved. Transformation of A to H therefore greatly improves the LR algorithm; we have introduced it here, however, because for the QR method it is a sine qua non. We may add here, in passing, that it is possible by simple substitutions to reduce any matrix A to tridiagonal form — populated only in the superdiagonal, diagonal and infradiagonal. However, for our present purposes this is unnecessary; and in any event it often involves ill-conditioned equations and so lacks accuracy. Example 1 We again choose the matrix A of (2.8.3.4). The reader is invited to check that, if A is transformed as in (1), then  If we now treat H as our basic starting matrix A and resolve it into L1R1 then  As will be seen from , resolution of an upper Hessenberg matrix requires an upper Hessenberg L1, i.e. a matrix with zero elements everywhere except in the diagonal and infradiagonal. Both the resolution of A into L1R1 and the subsequent evaluation of  (B is also of upper Hessenberg form) are thus much simpler than when A is fully populated. 2.8.5 The QR algorithm We assume that the matrix A is already in upper Hessenberg form. Then, in parallel with the LR algorithm, we write  where , as before, is upper triangular. However, here we do not resolve A into  instead, we require that  shall be a orthogonal matrix:  Thus  is our similar transformation of A into B. We then transform B into C:  and so on, until the transform is eventually an upper triangular matrix having the eigenvalues of A in its diagonal. It remains to explain how Qi is chosen. There are various possibilities; the most popular methods are those of Givens and Householder (6). Here we describe Givens' method; and as before, for simplicity of exposition, we choose n = 4. Let the matrix, pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form, be  Also, let  where . Then if we evaluate  as a chain, beginning by premultiplying A by the last of the three matrices in (4), and if also we take  then A is first replaced by a matrix in which the leading element of the infradiagonal vanishes. The top two rows of A are altered; in particular, 2 is replaced by . In the next multiplication we take  and then the second element in the infradiagonal vanishes. Finally, with A33 now altered to  we put  and complete the chain. The result is the upper triangular matrix R1. We now have to complete the similar transformation by postmultiplying by Q1; the result,  is again of upper Hessenberg form. We now repeat the cycle to obtain  and so on. As before, it is found that the infradiagonal elements become smaller at each step until the similar transform of A is ultimately upper triangular (or quasi-triangular if A has complex eigenvalues); i.e. a matrix T given by  The following point is important. In our treatment above, B is the product of a chain of seven matrices. When the multiplications are carried out in the order indicated, the upper Hessenberg form is maintained throughout, If, however, we begin by multiplying the central three matrices, the upper Hessenberg form is lost, with a accompanying loss of simplicity. It is now apparent why A must be pre-reduced to upper Hessenberg form. Equation (4) employs one matrix for each nonzero element below the diagonal — three in this case; n — 1 in general. There are thus 2n — 2 multiplications in each iteration. But if A were fully populated, the number of multiplications would be n (n — 1). Example 1 The reader is invited to work through this example; we avoid repetitive labour by the use of hindsight. Consider the matrix defined in (2.7.6.12) and reduce it, as in (2.8.4.1), to upper Hessenberg form. The result is a new matrix  We now, with hindsight, use a shift of 0.2; i.e. we work with the matrix A — 0.2I. Shifts are always used to improve convergence: this particular shift requires only one step. The matrix is now  and after the six multiplications implied (see (4)) in  it becomes   Thus A — 0.2I has a zero eigenvalue; we recover B by adding 0.2I and can then deflate and consider the reduced matrix  Once again, to avoid repetitive labour in the example, we use hindsight: we now apply a shift of 0.4 and consider  We require only one step (four multiplications) to reduce this to  We now recover  by adding 0.4I and deflate by omission of the last row and column:  In any similar transform of  the trace and determinant are unaltered. The two eigenvalues of  are thus determined by  The required eigenvalues are thus 0.2 (bottom right-hand element of B), 0.4 (bottom right-hand element of ) and . The convergence properties of the QR algorithm are superior to those of LR, particularly when shifts are used and deflation is performed whenever possible. If complex eigenvalues exist,""double shifts' (see Wilkinson (6)) may be made and two QR steps performed simultaneously to give rapid convergence while all arithmetic is kept real. The QR method is thus very powerful and of quite general applicability; it is probably the most popular technique on modern main-frame computers for the evaluation of  eigenvalues of non-symmetric matrices. On the other hand, recovery of eigenvectors, though possible, is very difficult and often inaccurate, and some quite different routine (e.g. (2.6.4), when the eigenvalues have been found by QR) is recommended., 2.9 MATRIX PENCILS Our discussion of this toc is very limited, though we look again at the subject, also briefly, in 2.10. 2.9.1 Eigenvalues and vectors of matrix pencils Any lambda-matrix of the form C — B, which can in general be rectangular, *is described as a matrix pencil (see 1.15). If C is square, of order n, and non-singular, the pencil is described as regular, since in the polynomial equation obtained by expansion of  the coefficient  which does not vanish, so that there are n eigenvalues i which satisfy (1). It is clear that these eigenvalues belong also to the matrix . For each root i there will be at least one linear relation between the columns of the pencil, so that we may write  and  is an eigenvector of the pencil. The pencil is described as simple if there are n independent vectors  so that we may write the set compendiously as  where  is of simple diagonal form, even through it may include multiple roots. If, on the other hand, one or more auxiliary vectors are required, so that the spectral matrix takes the form , then the pencil is defective. In particular, a pencil is simple if B, C are real and symmetric and if C is pos. def. This proposition is proved in Corollary 1 of Theorem X of 1.22. However, it does not follow that if B, C are real and symmetric, the pencil is simple, or its roots real. The reader is invited to study the two pencils  Pencil (i) is real and symmetric; it has two equal eigenvalues  = 1 and the spectral matrix is of elementary Jordan block form; it is defective, with only the single eigenvector{ 2,1}. Pencil (ii) also has real, symmetric coefficients; but its eigenvalues are , with independent vectors{ 1,1 + 1}and {1,1 -i}. It is thus simple. In both (i) and (ii),  is negative, and so C is not pos. def. (see 1.22, Theorem X). If B, C are real and symmetric, and if in addition C is pos. def. then as in Theorem VIII of 1.22, the eigenvalues are real and finite and the eigenvectors real. We ow restrict our attention to simple pencils, where symmetric or not. In parallel with (2) we have the equation  and this leads to the counterpart of(3)  Postmultiply this by X and use (3); then  For simplicity, let us now suppose all roots i to be distinct. Then  permutes with a diagonal matrix and is therefore itself diagonal:  But (see (3)) is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix; we may thus write  and then from (5)  In the special case where B, C are symmetric, we may evidently identify Y with X. So much for the elementary properties of pencils. We turn ow to their numerical treatment. First, if we have a simple pencil C — B, we may premultiply it by C-1 to obtain I — A, A = C-1B; we may then obtain the eigenvalues and vectors of the pencil by applying any of the methods of 2.6–2.8 to A, and often this is the simplest procedure. However, cases can arise where this is not the best approach. For example, suppose C to be tridiagonal and B diagonal. Then C-1 is in general fully populated, and so would be C-1B; the simplicity of the pencil is thus lost in A. The same is true when C, B are sparse. We now give an example in which C, B are sparse and symmetric. The reader is invited to study this closely, since it illustrates more than the possible treatment of a pencil. Example 1 Consider the pencil  here C is tridiagonal and symmetric; B is diagonal. Also (though this is immaterial for our present purpose) both are centrosymmetric. The pencil thus has particular simplicity as it stands. We re required to find the eigenvalues i which satisfy , and the corresponding vectors. First, if we attempt this evaluating A = C-1B we find  Thus A is fully populated and is not symmetric (though, as it must, it remains centrosymmetric). We therefore return to the original form (8). A possible way of dealing with this is to use the location method (see 2.6.1). If we write  then  (since P is of order 4); we therefore require to assign three arbitrary values to  and then, by simple triangulation, evaluate  for each of these. Since the product of the roots is , we may choose  = 2, 1,— 1 as reasonable arbitrary values. Then we find, using a typical direct triangulation  while . Fortuitously, we have found one of the zeros of. Disregarding this for the moment, we write   and use the above values; we find  the solution of which is . Hence  or  To find the zeros of  () we may, for example, use the companion matrix (see 1.16), which, in this example, is  the eigenvalues of which are the zeros of (10). We may find these in the usual way by iteration: we repeatedly premultiply an arbitrary column, say , by M. Successive columns are then given by Table 1. We observe that, owing to the particular form of M, we need calculate only the top element of each column, in this table; the remaining elements are those of the previous column, one step down. In fact, we re only solving the regression formula   which is equivalent to the iteration with M; this is in effect Bernoulli's method of solution of  () = 0. To six places of decimals, we have now found 1 — 6.464102. Hence  on extraction of the first factor. If we set up a regression formula (or companion matrix) for the cubic, we find the next factor to be ( + 1), as we have already noted. In face  so that the eigenvalues are . We now look briefly at the eigenvectors. Typically  which is of course singular. We treat it by the method of Equation (2.6.4), using the first three rows, to obtain with x4 =1,  so that we find at once . In this way, with the eigenvalues in order of modulus, we find  A point of interest may be noted: the individual vectors are either centrosymmetric or centroskew, just as a symmetric structure has either symmetric or antisymmetric modes of vibration. We leave it to the reader to check that (see (3))   and also that  are diagonal. To complete this discussion, we may observe that the companion matrix, or its equivalent — the regression formula, may be used to find complex roots of a determinantal equation (see 1.7.6). For example, suppose we find  Then we may set up the regression formula  and if we begin with , we find for successive values of   The periodic change of sign, with no settled ratio, indicates complex roots. We therefore apply Equation (2.7.6.7) to the last 4 figures in sequences of 3 (we assume contributions from the other roots to be vanishingly small):  which give us . Hence (13) has the factor ; and we may write  so that all he factors of (13) are complex. 2.9.2 Deflation of a matrix pencil The eigenvalues and vectors of a simple pencil (not necessarily symmetric) will satisfy  Write these as  then  are evidently the eigenvectors belonging to the eigenvalue i of C-1B. If we normalise them so that  then Sylvester expansion of C-1B (see 1.18) is  so that we may express B in terms of C, etc., as   Now suppose that we have found . Then we are able to evaluate, on the left-hand side,  and evidently a new pencil, which has all the eigenvalues and vectors of the original pencil except that 1 is replaced by 0, is  This is Lancaster's deflation formula. We may note two points:(i) since  has a zero root, must be singular,(ii) it is not necessary to normalise the vectors; we can write B1 generally as  Example 1 We use the pencil defined in (2.9.1.8) and we assume first that we have found an eigenvalue 1 = -1 and the associated eigenvector . Since the pencil is symmetric we shall have y = x. Now, using (2.9.1.8), we have  Hence, from (5) we find  which, with B defined as Diag(1,2,2,1) gives  This matrix is simply singular; indeed, as is indicated by (3), it is annihilated by postmultiplication by : in (3),  is orthogonal to , i = 2,3,…, n. Accordingly, the pencil P1( ); has a zero eigenvalue. The deflation can of course be repeated. If, using P1( ),; we now find an eigenvalue 2 = 0.6 and the associated eigenvector , then   and then we may calculate  which, with B1 given by (6), yields  By inspection, B2 is doubly degenerate; it is of course annihilated by postmultiplication by  or . A third deflation would produce B3, a unit rank matrix, which in this instance (n = 4) would be the last term in (3). 2.9.3 Iteration with submatrices of vectors We conclude this section with a description of a method often used in the following circumstances:(a) The problem is formulated as a matrix pencil; if it is of dynamical origin, we re given a non-singular symmetric stiffness matrix C of order n and a corresponding symmetric mass matrix B: the problem is to find certain modes and frequencies satisfying , x being proportional to exp (b) the order n is large, say  (c) Interest attaches only to a relatively small number, say , of consecutive frequencies and modes, beginning with the fundamental. The process is one of iteration with a submatrix of p vectors, where p is a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought, and involves the solution at each step of an eigenproblem of order p only. Since B, C derive from a mechanical system and are non-singular, they will be pos. def., and accordingly (see Theorem VIII of 1.22) the system eigenvalues are all real, finite and positive. if we write  then the full problem may be written  where X is the modal matrix,  the spectral matrix, and A = C-1B the dynamical matrix. It is assumed that the eigenvalues in  (and the corresponding eigenvectors in X) are so ordered that  has the eigenvalues   in descending order of magnitude down the diagonal, so that 1 and the first vector in X define the fundamental frequency and mode. We are not concerned to solve (1) as a whole. If it is partitioned in the form  where Y is of order (n × p) and  square, of order p,(2) gives  and only the first of these equations concerns us. However, we may note that (see 1.19) premultiplication by  of the first equation in (1), and transposition, shows that  are both diagonal. For analytical purposes we may normalise X so that  which imply, inter alia,  Having set out some preliminary considerations, we now state the method. Select a set of starting vectors Yo, arbitrary except that they must be linearly independent; then evaluate the (n × p) matrix  and use Wo to form the two square matrices of order p  Now solve the eigenproblem (any suitable method from this chapter may be used)  for its modal matrix Mo; the spectral matrix Ao which emerges is (see below) a first approximation to Ay. Then an improved approximation to Y is  where do is an arbitrary non-singular diagonal matrix which may, for example, be used to make a homologous element in each of the corresponding columns of Y1 and Yo the same; do is useful, but not essential. This completes one step. The next step uses Y1 in (6) to give W1 = AY1, and the cycle of operations is repeated until convergence occurs. We may note some interesting aspects of the method. (i) If Yo consists of one vector only, so does Wo, and then  are scalars, s is the modal matrix . If we choose  in (9) then  and this is the single vector iteration discussed in 2.7.1. Moreover, the trivial  eigenproblem gives a first approximation to 1 as the Rayleigh quotient. (ii) If Yo happens to be the correct set Y, the method makes this apparent at once, for then in view of (3)  so that , on use of (5)  Thus both matrices are diagonal, so that the eigenproblem is again trivial, having the solution . Then  when scaled appropriately, repeats  showing that both equal Y. (iii) If Yo happens to be a set of linear combinations of the vectors in Y, the correct solution is obtained in one step. For we may then write  where P is a square matrix of order p, non-singular since the columns of Yo and of Y, separately, are linearly independent. Then  in view of(3). Thus, on use of (5),  On premultiplication by , the eigenproblem (8) reduces to  which has the solution  If do is chosen as  The condition envisaged in (iii) is, in general, unlikely, unless for example a neighbour system (see Chapter 3) supplies a good approximation to Y. In most cases, we must write  where R, like Yo, is of order (n × p). In this general case  in view of(1). Then the eigenproblem matrices become  where (4) has been used. We therefore have to solve for   Knowing Mo, we now use (11) to evaluate   whence in turn we find  Since  is non-singular, we may reduce the eigenproblem based on W1 to  which we solve for the unknown . A third step leads to  It is clear from (13),(16) and (17) that after r steps we have to solve  If  is written as M,(18) in partitioned form is (see (10))  or, on expansion,  Now, since all the eigenvalues in  are greater than any of those in , when r is sufficiently large the terms in  become negligible compared with those in , when (19) reduces to  and if s is on-singular, this in turn reduces to  which has the solution . This shows that convergence is complete. Two things must be noted here. First, although when r is large, in an overall sense the terms in  those in , yet the smallest element in  is not necessarily much larger than the largest element in . As a result calculation of the last two or three eigenvalues in  may not be very accurate. It is for this reason that we choose p to be a little greater than the number of eigenvalues sought. Second, reduction of the eigenproblem to (20) requires s to be non-singular. Now R has p linearly independent columns, and therefore also p linearly independent rows. Thus s can be non-singular; but it is not necessarily so, and then Y as given by the method may be deficient. For example, if the top row of s were null, the first vector in X (the fundamental mode) would be absent in the make-up of Yo, and this absence would persist. There is no certain way of avoiding this difficulty when Yo is chosen arbitrarily; but in practice it does not often arise. Although the eigenproblem to be solved at each step is vastly less time-consuming and expensive than direct methods applied to the full system, yet it does take much time. However, after a few steps v, and  usually become heavily diagonal, so that Mr tends towards I; this occurs before the vectors Yr have converged. In these circumstances, use of the Collar-Jahn method, described in Chapter 3; may greatly expedite the solution. An example of this is given in 3.9. Further reference to the method is also made in 8.5. Example 1 The small-order example which is all we can give here does not of course do justice to the method, but at least shows how it works. We begin with an illustration of the situation in (iii) above; the reader is invited to check the arithmetic. Let  Then  Suppose now we are given, or choose,  It then follows that  The eigenvalues of  are thus 10 and 5 and   The reader should check that these are eigenvectors of A and that they correspond to eigenvalues 10 and 5. We have thus obtained our solution, in this case, in one step. It will be found that each column of  is in fact, a linear combination of the columns of  Example 2 We use the same A, B, C, as in Example 1, but select as our starting vector submatrix  In choosing Yo we have selected simple vectors which are clearly linearly independent, and which between them bring all elements in A into operation in the formation of Wo. We then find  where the product is quoted to four significant figures. Its eigenvalues are 9.805, 2.411 and, very approximately (great accuracy is not necessary),  which yields, again approximately,  Proceeding in this way, we find at the end of the fifth step  and in the sixth step this gives   These are so nearly diagonal that the eigenproblem is trivial; the eigenvalues are 10, 4.9987. However, we do not obtain convergence until after the 10th step, which gives eigenvalues 10, 5 and  The second columns should be{ 1,1,0, -1}. 2.9.4 A variant We now give a variant of the method of 2.9.3; we do so partly because the variant can save computer time, especially if may iterations are required, but also because it enables us simply to bring out certain features of the method, which lead to possible modifications. For simplicity, we assume that the eigenvalues sought are all different. We are given the matrices C and B, both symmetric an pos. def. We may therefore use Choleski's method (see 2.4.2) to find a lower triangular matrix L such that , and may then evaluate , accordingly the equation  may be written  and S is symmetric and pos. def. Now, instead of using the three matrices C, B and A = C-1B as in 2.9.3 we work only with S. Suppose we now proceed as in 2.9.3: we begin with the submatrix Yo and successively evaluate  and we then solve for Mo the eigenproblem  Then a new approximation to Y is   At this point we may ask: what is the purpose of eigenproblem? The answer appears if we premultiply and postmultiply Equation (5) by appropriate quantities to give since do permutes with ,  on use of (6). Transposition of (7) shows (compare 1.19) that  permutes with  and is therefore diagonal, as is . The columns of  are thus mutually orthogonal; this is the purpose of evaluating Mo: its use orthogonalises the columns, an our ultimate objective is the orthogonal set Y. A second step with Yo in (2) replaced by Y1, leads to the eigenproblem (compare (5))  Again we may pause and observe that (8) gives us  directly; we do not need to find Mo first from (5) and then M1 from (8). Thus the step (5) is unnecessary. Then, in its turn, the step (8) is unnecessary; and so on. Indeed, in theory all that is required is that a sufficient number of direct iterations is made, with the columns orthogonalised as the last step; in practice, however, the numbers would become increasingly ill-conditioned as S is raised to a high power and approximates to a unit rank matrix. However, it is probably sufficient if the columns are orthogonalised at, say, every fourth iteration. If we do this, the procedure is as follows. Begin with Yo and evaluate successively . At this stage, evaluate  and solve the eigenproblem  for M. Then a new approximation, which has mutually orthogonal columns, is , with which in place of Yo the cycle is repeated, and so on. Example 1 We use the same matrices B and C as in Example 2.9.3.1. then, if , , we find, to four decimal places,    As our starting matrix we choose  This has mutually orthogonal columns; however, as we shall see later, it is not a good initial choice for the first column. We ow form , at each stage making the ""11"" and ""22"" elements unity. We find  we require  as it stands. We now form v,  as in (9),(10), and solve (11) for M. To sufficient accuracy, we find  and then a new Yo is, with d chosen appropriately,  and it may be checked that these two columns are, sufficiently nearly, orthogonal. We now repeat the cycle. This time we find   and  and again, sufficiently nearly, the columns are orthogonal. A third cycle leads to the eigenvectors (and eigenvalues) of S:  We leave it to the reader to establish that the eigenvectors of the original system, given by premultiplication of w by  may be written  2.10 IMPROVEMENT OF THE ACCURACY OF EIGENVALUES AND VECTORS It frequently happens, both in dynamical problems and in other eigenvalue problems that we have approximate values for one or more eigenvalues (and perhaps vectors) and require to obtain more exact values. This problem, from another viewpoint, is discussed more fully in Chapter 3. Here we shall deal only with some simple cases. 2.10.1 Problem formulated as a matrix pencil For simplicity, let us first discuss the undamped oscillations of a mechanical system having n degrees of freedom, the equations of motion of which have been derived by Lagrangian methods from energy considerations; they will appear, in the usual notation of dynamics, as  Here x is the column of coordinates; in what follows, we assume the last element x to be non-nodal (if it is not, it can be made so by rewriting the equations in a different order). Also C, the inertia matrix, will be symmetric and pos. def. and B, the stiffness matrix, also symmetric and non-neg. def; finally, F is a column of applied forcing functions. In simple harmonic motion, these forces, and x, will be proportional to exp  and if we then write  for{ go}2,(1) reduces to the usual formula  . We observe that, in addition to the given matrices C and B,(2) contains 2n + 1 other quantities, viz. λ, x, and F. Since we have n equations, we can determine any n of these quantities in terms of the remaining n + 1, to which we can ascribe arbitrary values. Here, we shall (a) choose λ as an independent variable; (b) prescribe the value unity for ; (c) prescribe the value zero for each of the first n -1 functions in F, the last being written f. Then f and the coordinates  become functions of λ, and we note that when f vanishes (i.e. all the functions F vanish in (2)), λ will be an eigenvalue and  the corresponding eigenvector. We not write, in partitioned form, , , and, since the pencil in (2) is symmetric, , where  is a square submatrix of K of order n = 1. Then (2) becomes , which yields, progressively, , . Since the submatrices in (5) are all functions of λ,(7) and (8) give f and ξ (or x) as functions of λ. Now suppose we have an approximation  to an eigenvalue. Since f is a function of λ which vanishes at the eigenvalues, we may use it in the Newton-Raphson method to obtain an improved approximation : , the zero suffixes indicating that the functions are calculated for . Equation (8) is not suitable for differentiation; instead, we obtain another form for f by premultiplying (6) by ; we obtain , and since K is symmetric it follows that , which, with K given by (5), reduces to . In a numerical calculation, we use (11) for  and either (8) or (10) for f. If we use the latter, we must note that, at , , when Equation (9) reduces to , i.e. the well-known Rayleigh quotient. In the numerical evaluation of this, we obtain x from (7) with . Having obtained  we can adopt it as a new  and repeat the cycle of approximation, which is known to be quadratically convergent: i.e. if  is the true eigenvalue, then for small differences . Equation (9), with  given by (8), is analytically precisely equivalent to (12). In numerical applications, they may differ, depending on the accuracy with which  and ξ are evaluated. Probably (12) is the user to use. Example 1 In Equation (1), let . Suppose we are given an approximate eigenvalue . We evaluate  , which we have partitioned as in (5). Then ξ is given by (7) as , and the reader may check that this yields . We give this to four decimal places only: it is not necessary to calculate ξ to great accuracy, but once found, it must be used consistently, and calculations made accurately. We deduce that for , the approximate eigenvector is , and we are able to calculate , , whence . If we round this off to a new , we quickly find that  also, i.e. 40 is an exact eigenvalue; also the corresponding eigenvector becomes  . If, instead of the Rayleigh quotient, we use (9) directly, we require from (8) . Hence (see also (16)) , in close agreement with (16). Problem formulated in terms of a single matrix If we premultiply (2.10.1.2) by  and write , we obtain the problem in terms of the characteristic matrix of A: . Note that here A is, in general, not symmetric; however, it evidently possesses the same eigenvalues as the system (2.10.1.2). Let us now abandon the connection with a mechanical system, and treat this as a problem involving any given real matrix A, the eigenvalues and vectors for which have to be found. The treatment is closely similar to that of §2.10.1. As before, we choose λ as an independent variable, assign the value unity to  and zeros to the first n -1 elements of G: ; we also write, remembering that A is not symmetric, . Then Equation (2) gives us , from which we obtain as before , . We now look for the left vector  corresponding to x as the right vector; in §2.10.1 this was : here it is different. In place of(2) we write ; by the same argument as before, we set , , hence from (4),(9) and (10) , yielding , , and on comparison of (12) with (7) we see that h and g are identical; this is not surprising, since they are evidently similar functions and have the same zeros, i.e. the eigenvalues. As before, we now employ g in a Newton-Raphson application to improve the accuracy of any given approximate eigenvalue . Premultiplication of (5) by  gives , and then, differentiating term by term, we have , which in view of(4) reduces to . Accordingly, as before . This is the parallel to (2.10.1.12); as before, we can, if we wish, use g as given by (7) for alternative treatment, but we shall not pursue this here. Example 1 In (2), let . This matrix is, in fact, obtained from our previous example by evaluating . However, we shall treat a different eigenvalue: suppose we are told that there is an eigenvalue in the neighbourhood of . We evaluate and partition . Then we find at once from (6) and (11) that , , and hence, from (15), . If we round this off to a new , and repeat the calculation — we leave it to the reader to check this — we find ; finally, rounding this off to 20 and repeating again, we find that 20 is an exact eigenvalue and that the corresponding right and left eigenvectors are, respectively, , . 2.10.3 Factorisation of A into two symmetric matrices In Equation (2.10.2.1) we derived A as the product of two given symmetric matrices,  and B; this was done for convenience in the examples. For completeness, we interpolate here a brief discussion of the reverse procedure: it was shown in §1.19 and Theorem V of §1.22 that a matrix can always be factorised into two symmetric matrices, but the subject was not pursued there. Here we obtain the most general solution. We first continue the discussion of §1.19, and treat the most common case in which A has distinct eigenvalues. It was shown there that A permutes with , which is therefore diagonal. This diagonal matrix, D, is arbitrary, since X is arbitrary to a postmultiplying diagonal matrix. Write where P, Q, R,…are arbitrary. Now if (see §1.18) we write , C may now be expressed as , so that C is expressible as an arbitrary linear sum of the n symmetric unit rank matrices . Next consider the case where A has two equal eigenvalues α, but is not defective. Then A can be written with the (2 × 2) scalar submatrix αI in the leading diagonal position. This means that D is not necessarily diagonal; corresponding to αI there may be a (2 × 2) block which is arbitrary except that it must be symmetric and non-singular. This therefore contains three arbitrary quantities, giving n + 1 in all. Finally, suppose A has two equal eigenvalues α but is defective. As previously, we note that   since  is symmetric. Accordingly  with K as defined in Theorem V of §1.22. Thus  permutes with . This implies that  is diagonal except for the leading (2 × 2) submatrix. Now the following submatrices permute (see also §1.21) , , where a, b are arbitrary. The second of these is thus the leading submatrix of , whence in  it is , which is symmetric and contains just two arbitrary quantities; there are thus just n arbitrary quantities in all. Extension to more complicated cases is not difficult. However, these studies employ the modal and spectral matrices, and in practice these may not be known. We can, however, find directly the general solution of . Write , so that C contains n (n + 1) /2 unknown elements, n in the diagonal, viz. p, q, r,…, and n (n -1) /2 elsewhere, viz. a, b, c…. Now the conditions that B is symmetric provide just n (n -1) /2 linear algebraic equations connecting the unknowns, so that we can determine a, b, c,…in terms of p, q, r…which are arbitrary. The procedure is best illustrated by means of a numerical example: we choose A to be the matrix of (2.10.2.16). Then . Then the condition that , for example, leads to , and there are five other such equations. We set them out thus:  These are then solved, e.g. by direct operation on rows, when a, b, c,…emerge as quantities linear in p, q, r, s. To set out the result compactly, we write , where …have zero diagonals except for a unit in the first, second,…place respectively. In this example, we can write , where to keep the elements numerically simple, we have extracted the factor 1/3 from  and . This is evidently the most general form of C. Postmultiplication by A yields B in the form  . When p, q, r, s are assigned numerically, C and B are known and then the factors  and B of A are found. We can recover the matrix C (and also B) defined in (2.10.1.13) by assigning to p, q, r, s the values 1, 1.52, 3, 0.92 appearing in the diagonal of C. The following characteristics of , , etc. are to be noted. First, since each contains zeros in its diagonal, it cannot be pos. def. Next, the ranks of the matrices do not conform to any simple pattern:  is of rank 4,  and  of rank 3 and  of rank 2. Finally, in relation to our main problem, since for the Rayleigh quotient (which gives eigenvalues identical to those of A) , and since also p, q, r, s are arbitrary, it follows that , i = 1,2,3,4, though this result is not particularly helpful in practice. 2.10.4 Another method for improvement of eigenvalues We discuss here the same problem as that in §2.10.2, but vary the treatment. The eigenvalues are determined by Equation (2.10.2.5) with g = 0, viz. , where α is the submatrix of A corresponding to , and  is the last diagonal element in A. From this we find , , and elimination of ξ leads to the equation for λ  . This equation is not easy to solve numerically as it stands; however, if we are given an approximation  to an eigenvalue, we write  for the exact eigenvalue, which therefore satisfies (4), so that we obtain , which is now an equation for ε Write  then . Thus , provided ε is sufficiently small. Insertion in (5) leads to , or, if , , , etc., . Finally, if  is written , we obtain the scalar equation . Provided the series converges, this may be solved for ε in any suitable way; often a regression procedure, beginning with ε = 0 on the right-hand side to give a new approximation on the left, will solve the equation in two or three steps. Comparison of (8) with (3) shows that, when ε has been found from (9) , so that both eigenvalue and vector are found. Example 1 Once again, we use the matrix specified in Equation (2.10.2.16) and we are given that it has an eigenvalue near . Then, in (6), with n=4, . Also, ; ; ;. Hence, using (7), we obtain , , , , , and it is in fact unnecessary to proceed further. We now evaluate the scalars ; they become , , , , .

ACA ACA-FEF-002 -0.0499999999999998 "2. Electrostatics 2.1. Introduction STATIC means not varying as a function of time. So all our quantities p, J, E, B, D, and H will be independent of time. Is there such a thing as time-independent charge? Yes, there is. It means that neither the magnitude nor the position of the charge varies as a function of time. And similarly we can imagine constant electric and magnetic fields. Can we talk of time-independent current? Well, we have to permit the motion of charges to get any current but if the amount of charge crossing a certain cross-section is always the same then the current at that point is independent of time. On this basis constant currents also belong to the static branch of electricity. It is, though, usual to distinguish between electrostatics and magnetostatics; in the former case the variables are p, E, and D, whereas in the latter case they are J, H, and B. We shall now proceed with the equations of electrostatics, which may be obtained from eqns (1.1) -(1.7) by substituting a/at = 0 and assuming that v, J, H, and B are all zero. We get then . We shall introduce now a scalar function by the relationship . The physical significance of this new function may be recognized by determining the work performed by carrying a charge from point a to point b: , where the negative sign is due to the fact that the work is done against the electrical forces. Substituting eqns (2.4) and (2.5) into eqn (2.6) we get , where  and  are the values of the function  at the end-points of the path. We have used here a mathematical theorem stating that the line integral of a gradient depends only on the end-points and not on the connecting path. The potential at point b may be written with the aid of eqn (2.7) in the form . Alternatively, we may choose , leading to . What is the good of introducing ? I. Owing to its scalar character it is more easily calculable than the electric field. Thus very often in practice we determine  first and E afterwards, 2. The choice of  in the form of eqn (2.5) immediately ensures that eqn (2.1) is satisfied: , so we have less to worry about. If the potential function is so useful shouldn't we express all our equations in terms of ? Yes, in fact this is what other people did in the past. So let us convert eqn (2.2) as well. Noting that , we obtain , which is known as Poisson's equation. If p=0, the above equation reduces to . This equation is known after another Frenchman as Laplace's equation. We have not quite finished. There is one more equation often used in electrostatics that contains charge and not charge density. We can get it by integrating eqn (2.2) over a volume . Using Gauss' theorem for the left-hand side and noting that the volume integral of charge density is just the total amount of charge, eqn (2.14) takes the form , where S is the closed surface of volume and q is the charge inside. Eqn (2.15) is known as Gauss's law. 2.2. Coulomb's law Having got the equations what shall we do with them? Let us first try to prove something that you have come across in school, Coulomb's law. Note the difference. We shall not postulate Coulomb's law, we are going to derive it. We shall have to introduce point charges, but let us be a little more general to begin with and assume that the charge is uniformly distributed within a sphere of radius r0. We shall now apply Gauss' law and take the surface of integration at a radius . Notice that everything is spherically symmetric, hence D must be constant on the chosen surface, and the integral comes to , where D=|D|. In view of eqns (2.15) and (2.16)  or, in a vacuum, . Interestingly, the electric field does not depend on the actual positions of the charges. As long as the charge distribution is spherically symmetric, and as long as all the charges are inside the sphere of radius r0 the electric field depends only on r and not on r0. So we can just as well imagine that all the charge is concentrated at the origin of the coordinate system. Let us place now another bunch of charge (say q2) into another discrete point a distance r12 away from our first charge that we will now denote by q1. With the aid of eqn (2.4) we get for the force upon , and substituting for E from eqn (2.18) we obtain . In words: the force between two charges at rest is proportional to the product of the charges and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between them. The direction of the force is obvious, it can only act in the line connecting the two point charges. So we have got Coulomb's law. 2.3. The potential due to charges The potential due to a point charge may be determined with the aid of eqns (2.8) and (2.18), as follows: . The usual convention is to choose the reference point at infinity and choose the corresponding potential (a) = 0, so we get for the potential of a point charge . If we have a number of point charges q1, q2…, qn at distances r1, r2…, rn from the point where we wish to evaluate the potential then we can simply add all the potentials, leading to . If instead of point charges we have a distributed space charge p (x', y', z') then the sum in eqn (2.23) goes over into an integral: , where r is now the distance between the elementary charge  located at point (x', y', z') and the point (x, y, z) where the potential is evaluated. The formulae look quite reasonable; what you need is a little practice in handling them. But as I said before the game is not a purely mathematical one; it is a mixture of physics and mathematics, a combination of intuition and technique. So before we embark upon solving concrete examples let us turn to a graphical illustration of the electric field. We shall introduce field lines defined by the statement that at each point on the line the tangent is in the direction of the electric field. The magnitude of the electric field may be represented at the same time by the density of field lines. The nearer they are to each other the greater is the field. A particularly simple example is provided by a point charge. The electric field is always in the radial direction, so the field lines are just straight lines as shown in Fig. 2.2. According to convention the arrows on the lines point outwards from a positive point charge. Owing to radial symmetry the potential is constant on a spherical surface at a distance r from the point charge. Some of these equipotential surfaces are shown in Fig. 2.2 with dotted lines. Notice that the field lines are perpendicular to the equipotential surfaces. This is of course no coincidence. The gradient of a scalar function is a vector perpendicular to the  constant surface and points in the direction of increasing values of . Since  and in the present case q>0, we find that  decreases with increasing r. Hence the vector  points inwards and  points outwards. So the whole picture is consistent. Having completed the calculations for the potential of a point charge, we shall now investigate a more complicated situation. Yes, you guessed correctly, we are going to investigate the equipotential surfaces and field lines of two point charges. In view of eqn (2.23) the potential due to two point charges may be written as , which for the coordinate system of Fig. 2.3 reduces to . The equipotential surfaces may now be plotted on the basis of the above equation and then the field lines may be obtained as trajectories orthogonal  to the equipotentials. This is simple in principle but extremely messy and tedious if you want to solve it analytically. The best method nowadays, of course, is to put it on the computer and let the computer plot the lot. For q2=-q1 the plot in the x, y plane is shown in Fig. 2.4. If you look at the Figure and study it carefully you will be able to recognize a number of ""commonsense"" points. It is common sense once you see the solution but it is unlikely that you would have thought of all of them a priori. For example, 1. all the field lines originate on the positive charge and terminate on the negative charge; 2. the potential is zero on the y=0 plane; 3. one of the field lines coincides with part of the y axis connecting the two charges. 4. The x=0 and y=0 planes are planes of symmetry. 5. The equipotential lines become more and more similar to circles as they get nearer to either charge. 6. Just behind the charges the effect of the opposite charge is minimal so the field lines resemble those of an isolated charge. The better you grasp the salient points (and store them in your memory), the more physical intuition and predictive power you will acquire. Shouldn't one rely solely on mathematics? Physical intuition might provide part of the answer, but surely mathematics will always give the complete answer. This is true for simple problems but, as I have said many times before, as soon as the   problems become more complicated our mathematical knowledge turns out to be greatly deficient. In practice you will find that problems may be broadly divided into two classes:(I) problems that have been solved, and (II) problems that are insoluble. The reasons for belonging into class II may be numerous: you cannot formulate the problem, you cannot solve the resulting equations analytically, the computer you have access to is not big enough, etc., etc. It all boils down to the fact that the problem needs to be simplified. You will find that you never solve the original problem. At best you solve a similar one. But how can you recognize a ""similar"" problem? Which simplifications are admissible without losing the essential characteristics of the problem? For all that you need intuition. The electric dipole One often goes to extremes in order to arrive at a physical configuration that is mathematically soluble by simple means. This is what we are going to  do now and besides assuming that q=q1=-q2 we will also state that the two opposite charges are infinitesimally close to each other. Is such a situation entirely fictitious? No, it can occur in practice. But surely, two charges will never be infinitesimally close to each other. Of course not, all I mean is that the distance between the charges is very small with respect to some other distance of interest. For example, the two charges may be of some atomic distance (of the order of 10 -10 m) apart, whereas we are interested in their effect at macroscopic distances; or take the so-called dipole aerial where the assumed separation of charges is small in comparison with the wavelength of oscillation. We shall return to the latter, time-varying problem in Section 5.16; let us first solve here the static case. If we are considering distances far away from the origin of Fig. 2.3, i.e. , using the approximation  we obtain with which eqn (2.26) reduces to . The product qd is called the electric dipole moment, and we shall denote it by pe. We shall also introduce a vector pe=qd, where d is the vector connecting the two point charges located at . By definition the vector points from the negative to the positive charge. With the aid of this vector we can replace  by  where  is the unit vector in the direction of point P at a radius r. So we may write eqn (2.30) in the form . Yet another alternative form is obtained by using spherical coordinates  in which  appears as . The above form is probably best suited for deriving the components of the electric field. Using the formulae (A — 11 and 14) for the gradient in spherical coordinates, we get . ""The potential far away from the charges If the charges are within a finite volume and we wish to determine the potential at a point P, far away from this volume, the formula we have obtained before (eqn (2.23)) may be simplified. We shall assume (Fig. 2.6) that the vectors drawn from any point charge to point P are all parallel to the vector r0 drawn from an arbitrarily chosen origin inside (just another way of saying that the point P is far away). This is a technique often used that leads to a quick and simple answer. We may then express the individual distances as , where di is the vector giving the position of charge qi. With the aid of the above relation we get , which substituted into eqn (2.23) yields . Thus we have a contribution depending on the total charge, and a second term bearing strong resemblance to our dipole formulae. Since the second term decays as 1/r2, could it ever become important? Yes, for many charge distributions of practical interest the net charge is zero, so the first term disappears and the second term acquires significance. For two charges of opposite sign eqn (2.36) reduces to eqn (2.31); we just have the dipole potential previously derived. For a large number of charges we sum up the contribution of each dipole moment. Multipoles Why stop at dipoles? Could we have higher-order moments as well? The answer is yes, but the mathematics gets more and more tedious. A not-too-difficult example is a special sort of quadrupole (two dipoles of equal dipole moment and of opposite directions arranged axially) shown in Fig. 2.7. Then  eqn (2.36) would give zero and we need better approximations for ri. If you are good at expanding functions up to second order you might like to attempt Example 2.5. 2.4 The electric field due to a line charge Let us take as an example an infinitely long, infinitely thin distribution of charges as shown in Fig. 2.8. Let us further assume that the charge distribution is uniform and denote the charge per unit length by pl (we are defining thereby a linear charge density of dimension coulomb per metre). Our aim is to determine the electric field. One possible method is to work out the electric field due to a point charge pi dz located at z and then add the field due to all the other point charges present. We obtain then for the electric field at the coordinate R, , where  is the unit vector in the direction of the r vector. Owing to symmetry considerations (there is the same infinite amount of charge in the region  as in the corresponding region ) the electric field can have no component in the z direction, so we need only to worry about the radial component. This we may obtain easily from Fig. 2.8 as follows . It is preferable to do the integration for θ so we shall rewrite eqn (2.38) with the aid of the relation  in the form , which may be integrated between the limits θ=-; π/2; and θ=; π/2; to yield . This formula tells us a lot and in simple language too. The only surviving component of the electric field varies inversely with the distance from the  line charge and it is independent of the coordinate. Remember, for a point charge the electric field varies with the inverse square of the distance, but it is just inverse distance for the line charge. Why is this worth remembering? Because the relationships are simple, they will not considerably burden your memory, and at the same time will assist you in building up your intuitive picture. Take now a finite line charge as shown in Fig. 2.9(a) and (b) using different scales. Can you answer the question what is the relative strength of the  electric field at points N and M in Fig. 2.9(a) and at points Q and P in Fig. 2.9(b)? To be concrete let us take . It looks from points N and M as if the linear charge distribution would be very long indeed, perhaps infinitely long. Thus the electric field distribution may be expected to follow a (distance) -1 law. Hence En/Em=½. Looking from points Q and P the linear charge distribution between z=-H and z=H appears more like a point charge concentrated at 0. Thus the electric field distribution may be expected to follow a (distance) -2 law. Hence Eq/Ep=¼. We have now been able to give immediate answers to fairly complicated questions. How good are the approximations? Derive the exact formula for the electric field, work out its values at points M, N, P, Q, take the ratios, and see for yourself how good our approximations are. Let us solve now the same problem by another method. Instead of calculating the electric field directly from the charge distribution let us first determine the potential and obtain the electric field by differentiation. This is surely the better method because we won't worry about vectors when doing the integration. In order to avoid a lot of painful algebra we shall further simplify the problem and work out the potential for . The potential of a point charge is given by eqn (2.22), and that of a charge distribution by eqn (2.24). Whichever we use we end up with the following integration for the potential of an infinite line charge: . All we need to do now is to put in the limits, but alas . We get the result that the potential at point P is infinitely large. Have we done something wrong? No, we have done the same thing as before with the only difference that we calculated the potential instead of the electric field. Where could the trouble lie? Surely, in the infinite nature of our line source. There are no infinitely long line charges in nature. We have taken an unphysical picture and we get a nonsensical answer. But why did we get a reasonable result for the electric field? That was calculated for an infinitely long line charge too. Well, sometimes you get away with it, sometimes you don't. Why? The cause is only known to mathematicians and philosophers constantly engaged in the study of infinity. What can an ordinary physicist or engineer do? Well, there are several avenues open. Number one is to acknowledge the fact that our line charge is not infinitely long, integrate between the limits -H and +H, differentiate to obtain the electric field, and let then H go to infinity. Then if there is any justice on earth, we shall arrive at eqn (2.41). The other thing we can do is to retrace our steps leading to eqn (2.22). We need to go only as far as eqn (2.21). We may see then that we chose our reference point at infinity. Perhaps there is the rub. We may have tampered too much with infinity. Let us abandon that assumption and see what happens. Thus we are going to say that (a) = 0 at some other point. It probably matters little where we choose that point as long as it is not at infinity. So let us choose it for convenience at z = 0 at a distance R0 from the line charge as shown in Fig. 2.10. Then the potential at P due to a point charge at z is , and the potential due to the infinite line charge . Our attempts at determining both the electric field strength and the potential have started with considering the effect of a single point charge and have been followed by an integration for obtaining the total effect of the infinitely long line charge. Is there another, more direct way of determining the electric field? Well, there is Gauss's law, we haven't tried using that. If the line charge is infinitely long (so that the field depends on the radius only) we can choose our Gaussian surface as a cylinder wrapped round the line charge (Fig. 2.11). By relying on circular symmetry we can further claim that the electric field will have only a radial component which means that , where  is the azimuth angle in the cylindrical coordinate system. The application of Gauss's law (eqn (2.15)) leads then to . Performing the integration in the z direction for any finite length, we get for the electric field strength  in agreement with eqn (2.41). The potential may be obtained from the electric field as . It appears that the application of Gauss's law leads much more quickly to the required result. What is the moral of the story?(i) Tamper with infinity at your own peril, and (ii) Some ways of solving a problem are easier than others. 2.5. The electric field due to a sheet of charge We shall now investigate the case when the charge is uniformly distributed over a plane (the x, y plane in Fig. 2.12). The charge extends to an  infinitesimal distance in the z direction so we shall call it a surface charge. To be consistent with our previous notation for a line charge we shall denote it by ps (dimension coulomb m-2). The only component of the electric field is in the z direction (the others must be zero by symmetry considerations). If the sheet consists of positive charge the electric field points outwards. Since the space to the right of the charged sheet looks the same as that to the left, the magnitude of the electric field will be the same at z=a and z=-a. Learning from our meandering in the previous section we shall start straight away with Gauss's law. Choosing our surface as the box of Fig.2.13  we get . There is no contribution from the side surfaces because the scalar product E.dS vanishes. The total charge enclosed is , hence . The electric field is a constant everywhere in space but is of different sign on the two sides of the sheet. Let us put now a sheet of opposite charge a distance d away from the first sheet (fig. 2.14). Then the electric fields due to the two sheets add in between the sheets , and cancel outside the sheets . The equipotential surfaces are obviously planes. We get, by integrating eqn (2.54), . 2.6. The parallel-plate capacitor We have so far considered point charges, dipoles, line charges, and sheet charges without enquiring into the problem how such configurations of charges come about. Indeed if one gives a little thought to the matter it becomes distinctly doubtful that one could ever establish anything even vaguely resembling a sheet of charge. Like charges repel each other so the charges constituting the sheet will fly apart. Interestingly, there is a way of realizing sheets of charges. We just need to apply a voltage between two metal plates. What happens inside metal plates in response to an applied potential or for that matter what happens to charges inside any material? There is no escape; I have to say a few words about the properties of materials. A piece of material contains equal number of positive and negative charges. If this was not so there would be large forces between various pieces of materials. To give you a feeling how large these forces could be I quote from Feynman's lectures: ""If you were standing at arm's length from someone and each of you had one per cent more electrons than protons, the repelling force would be incredible. How great? Enough to lift the Empire State Building? No! To lift Mount Everest? No! The repulsion would be enough to lift a ""weight"" equal to that of the entire earth!"" So as I said before a piece of material contains equal numbers of positive and negative charges. For a class of materials called conductors the internal charge distribution may be looked upon as a cloud of mobile negative particles in the background of immobile positive lattice ions. When the voltage is applied, there is initially an electric field inside the conductor and the charges start to move under its influence. So to begin with this is not a static problem at all. But if we wait patiently for a few picoseconds until the  charges rearrange themselves there will be no further motion and the problem belongs to the realm of electrostatics. But where will the electrons find their equilibrium positions? How far will they move under the influence of an attractive electric field? Disregarding the cases when the electric field is very large or the conductor is very hot (beyond the scope of this course) the electrons cannot get farther than the boundary of the conductor. So there will be an accumulation of electrons on the surface of one of the plates and consequently a deficiency of electrons at the other plate's surface. Inside the conductor there will be no imbalance of charge. This is an important thing to remember. If we apply a constant voltage then, after the elapse of a short time, charge neutrality is re-established in the interior of the conductor but there will be some uncompensated charges in the immediate vicinity of the surfaces. How close to the surfaces? It doesn't really matter. The scales are certainly atomic, so we are entitled to regard these charges at the surfaces as having spread out in two dimensions only. So the introduction of a surface charge is not unrealistic at all. Well then, two infinitely large metal plates to which a constant voltage is applied are equivalent to two oppositely charged sheets. The electric field between the plates is then , and the potential . Consequently the potential difference (i.e. the voltage) between the plates comes to . Next let us work out the capacitance per unit surface area. Recall the definition from circuit theory: the capacitance is the proportionality factor relating the charge stored on one of the plates to the applied voltage, i.e. . The total charge per unit surface area is ps, which leads to the following formula for the capacitance per unit surface area: . We shall keep now the voltage constant and insert a piece of dielectric between the plates as shown in Fig. 2.15. What sort of difference will that make? Since the voltage is the same and the dielectric is homogeneous the  electric field is still given by . The flux density, on the other hand, will be different on account of the  relationship. What about the surface-charge density? That will also increase by the same factor Er. In fact the surface-charge density will  be equal to D. We can easily provide the proof by choosing a Gaussian surface as shown in Fig. 2.15. The contribution of S- to the integral is now zero (because both E and D are zero inside the conductor) and that of S+ comes to . Hence the application of Gauss's law yields  or . So we have proved that the surface-charge density increases by a factor Er. Why? This is a problem that rightfully belongs to the subject of the electrical properties of materials, so I cannot say very much about it. In a perfect dielectric there are no mobile charges but lots of bound charges, positive and negative. In response to the electric field in which these charges find themselves, the positive and negative charges will slightly separate. The effect will be some uncompensated charges at the edge of the dielectric (Fig. 2.16) which will draw some further charges of the opposite sign from the interior of the conductor to its surface. This is the physical mechanism responsible for the increase of surface charge density in the presence of a dielectric. Haven't we made a mistake? When working out the total charge within the Gaussian surface (the right-hand side of eqn (2.63 we ignored the   charge density on the surface of the dielectric. Surely, we should have taken that into account. What counts is the net surface-charge density inside our chosen volume and that hasn't increased at all. All that happened is that the electric field drew some charges to the surface of the dielectric which caused then some additional charges to appear on the surface of the conductor. So the surface-charge density increased on the surface of the conductor but not the net charge density inside the Gaussian surface. Have we or have we not made a mistake? The answer depends on our definition of charge and charge density. If q in Gauss's law (eqn (2.15)) means free charge then we are all right, then we can ignore the bound charge on the dielectric. In fact this is the whole point of introducing D. By assigning a relative permittivity to a dielectric material all these problems have been taken care of. We need to consider the free charges only. Let's not forget that we are concerned with parallel-plate capacitors and we are interested in determining the capacitance. Since the insertion of the dielectric increased the surface charge density on the plates by a factor with the voltage remaining unchanged, we may conclude that the capacitance has also increased by the same factor, yielding . Next, we shall consider a more complicated problem where the space between the plates is filled by two different dielectrics, as shown in Fig. 2.17. Introducing subscripts 1 and 2 for denoting our quantities in the two dielectrics, we may write . What else do we know? In each section the relationship (2.62) must still be valid, so that , and since potential is additive . We need one more equation between our variables that can again be provided by Gauss's law. Using the Gaussian surface shown in Fig. 2.17 and noting that , we get . The right-hand side is zero since there are no free charges inside the Gaussian surface. Hence , and, in view of eqn (2.65), . With the aid of eqns (2.67) and (2.71) we may now obtain the capacitance per unit area: , in agreement with the tenets of circuit theory. 2.7. Two-dimensional problems We have so far had infinite metal plates and infinite dielectrics. They were chosen to be infinitely large in order to reduce the problem to a one-dimensional one. Let us take now the bold step of increasing the number of dimensions by one. What is the simplest two-dimensional problem involving conductors? Two concentric circular cylinders (Fig. 2.18) to which a voltage  is applied and where the medium between the cylinders is a vacuum. Our aim is first to determine the variation of electric field as a function of radius and then to work out the capacitance per unit length. As you are getting used to it by now we shall start with Gauss's law. The Gaussian surface will be a cylinder at radius R as shown in Fig. 2.19. Owing to a circular symmetry the electric field will have only a radical component, independent of the azimuth angle. Hence Gauss's law (for unit length of cylinder) takes the form , yielding  and . From the definition C=q/V we get immediately for the capacitance per unit length: . What have we learned from the solution of our first two-dimensional problem involving conductors? We have found that the electric field varies as 1/R. There is nothing new in that; we came to the same conclusion earlier when studying the field of a line charge. We have managed, though, to derive the capacitance of concentric cylinders, a formula used in practical engineering, so we have certainly achieved something. It would now be easy to go on and work out the field between two concentric spheres. We shall however resist the temptation. We would learn little, because by exploiting spherical symmetry we would just have to deal with another pseudo-one-dimensional problem. It is important of course that the field varies as 1/r2 in that case, and it is also of some use to know the formula for the capacitance of a spherical capacitor but you can work that out yourself if you are interested. Let us look at a real two-dimensional problem instead. We shall take two conducting cylinders of radius a (Fig. 2.20) and apply a voltage between them. How can we find the electric field? That should be easy. For calculating the field in point P we need two Gaussian surfaces, namely cylinders R1 and R2, as shown in Fig. 2.20. Then owing to the charge on one cylinder (per   unit length of course) , and owing to the charge on the other cylinder . The problem is linear, superposition is permissible, so all we need to do is to add vectorially E1, and E2 and the field at point P is determined. Unfortunately the method is wrong. Why? Gauss's law is valid, and afterwards we did no more than added the field due to the two charges. This is permissible indeed if the charges are at fixed positions. In the absence of cylinder 1 the field due to the charge on cylinder 2 is correctly given by eqn (2.79). But we have used cylindrical symmetry. We have relied on the fact that the charge distribution on cylinder 1 is uniform. When we put cylinder 2 there, the circular symmetry is broken. The negative charge on cylinder 2 will attract the positive charge on cylinder 1 therefore the part of cylinder 1 facing cylinder 2 will have a higher surface-charge density than the opposite side. Gauss's law is still valid by eqns (2.79) and (2.80) do not follow from it. How can we find a solution? Well, in this particular case we can find the solution by attacking another problem: that of two line charges as shown in Fig. 2.21. The potential for one line charge was given by eqn (2.45). For two line charges . The equipotential surfaces are given by the equation , where k is a constant. Doing a bit of analytical geometry it turns out that the equipotential surfaces are circular cylinders as shown by dotted lines in Fig. 2.22. We can now re-state the two-cylinder problem of Fig. 2.20 as presented in Fig. 2.23; we need only relate the parameters a, b, d, and K to each other. The calculation outlined above yields , and . . Thus the solution for the two-cylinder problem is provided by the solution for the two-line-source problem having the same amount of charge per unit length. We may now work out the capacitance if we wish. The potential difference may be obtained as follows  and the capacitance per unit length . If b>a we get . Having got so far it might be of interest to work out the variation of surface-charge density on one of the cylinders as a function of . In order to obtain the surface-charge density we need to work out D and E on the surface of the cylinder. It is very simple in principle; we just need to use the gradient relationship between  and E yielding . The quantity of interest is the relative variation of the surface-charge density, i.e.  which may be obtained (after a fair amount of tedious algebra) in the form . The above equation is plotted in Fig. 2.24 for b/a=1.1, 1.5, 3, and 10. It may be seen that for a low value of b/a the surface-charge density changes considerably around the circumference of the cylinder. When b/a>1 there is hardly any variation. So it is clear that our first approach (demonstrated in Fig. 2.20) had no general validity. But, if b/a>1 the charges on the two cylinders have little effect upon each other, and the approach is permissible. We shall finish off the two-cylinder problem by working out the capacitance when b/a>1 on the basis of eqns (2.79) and (2.80). On the line connecting the centres of the cylinders E1 and E2 add algebraically so that  and , leading to a capacitance in agreement with eqn (2.88). Having solved the two-cylinder problem we are not much wiser; we still don't know how to tackle a general problem. There is though one general rule we can set up easily enough. The electric field must always be perpendicular to the surface of a conductor. The reason is that otherwise the surface charges would be in motion contrary to the assumption that a static  equilibrium exists. If the electric field is perpendicular to a surface then, owing to the  relationship, that surface must be an equipotential. So if we work in terms of the potential the boundary condition may be easily formulated:  = constant on all conductor surfaces. A further advantage of using (as I mentioned several times before) is that we get rid of the vectorial nature of the problem. The mathematical problem is then to solve the differential equation  in conjunction with the boundary condition that  constant on all conductor surfaces. Are there any general methods for solving eqn (2.93)? There aren't any. However, if there is no free charge in the space between the conductors, and strictly for two-dimensional problems, there is a method to which the adjective ""general"" might be attached, a method that provides plenty of answers but not necessarily to the questions asked. The method is based on the theory of complex variables. You have heard about complex variables, and I believe you have come across the Cauchy-Riemann relationships. So you know that if  is a complex variable and  is a complex function, then the relationships  and   hold. Differentiating eqn (2.96) with respect to x and eqn (2.97) with respect to y we get , whereas differentiation in the opposite order leads to . Hence both u and v are solutions of Laplace's equation. This is sheer luck to find a solution so easily. In fact we are even luckier. It turns out (though I am not going to prove it here) that the v (x, y) = constant curves are orthogonal trajectories of the u (x, y) = constant curves. Thus if we identify one of the functions with the potential, the other one will represent the field lines. It is really as simple as that. Take any reasonable function of a complex variable and we have the solution of an electrostatic problem. What is the simplest function we can take? Probably . Take u1 = x1 and u2 = x2 as conductor surfaces (Fig. 2.25) then the y = constant lines will represent the field lines. This example does not offer  anything new (we just got the configuration of an infinitely large parallel-plate capacitor), but we can see that the method works. Let us try as our next example something more difficult like . Identifying now v=2xy with the potential and u=x2-y2 with the field lines we get two sets of orthogonal hyperbolas. Taking for example v = 1 and 2 for the conductor surfaces we have solved an electrostatic problem as may   be seen in Fig. 2.26. Would anyone ever have to do anything with infinite conductors shaped like that? Very unlikely. But a finite corner is of interest, after all we often have electric fields in metal boxes. So we can take v = 0 (giving the asymptotes) as one of the conductors and the ensuing picture (Fig. 2.27) does indeed give some intuitive ""feel"" for the electric field lines in the vicinity of a corner. The electric field itself may be found from the equations . If you are fond of mathematical games there are plenty of functions to experiment with. You can be sure that you will find a solution of Laplace's equation satisfying the boundary conditions, but you will have to find out which problem you have obtained the solution of. I will not dwell much longer on conformal mapping (this is incidentally the term most often used for describing the method) but will give a few more examples. Let us place two coplanar conducting plates very close to each other(Fig. 2.28) and apply a potential difference between them. At some  distance away from the gap the equipotentials will be planes and the field lines will be circles. In the immediate vicinity of the gap the situation is more complicated, as shown in Fig. 2.29. The equipotentials are confocal hyperbolas and the electric lines of force are given by confocal ellipses. Fig. 2.30 shows the field lines and equipotentials for two semi-infinite parallel conducting plates raised to different potentials. It tells us what happens at the edge of a capacitor and can also give a numerical estimate of the scattered capacitance (by which the capacitance of a real capacitor differs from that worked out on the basis of the infinite-plate model). The foregoing three examples provided further illustrations of the usefulness of complex functions for solving electrostatic problems (for further information on these mappings see, for example, Simonyi (1963)). For axially symmetric cases the method is unfortunately not applicable. I shall not be discussing here the methods that are applicable but shall present the solution to one particular problem arising in electron optics, that of two closely spaced conducting cylinders at different potentials (Fig. 2.31). 2.8. The method of images This is again a rather specific method suitable for the solution of a limited class of problems in both two and three dimensions. The simplest way of introducing the method is to present again the field lines and the equipotential surfaces for two equal charges of opposite sign (Fig. 2.4). Let us now place an infinite conductor plane halfway between the charges as shown in Fig. 2.32. Since the y = 0 plane was an equipotential surface anyway (the field lines were perpendicular to it), nothing changes. Hence we have found the solution for a charge in front of an infinite plane. Working backwards we may now say that the effect of an infinite conducting plane is equivalent to that of a charge of opposite sign placed in the mirror position (the negative charge is the image of the positive charge in the plane). As an example let us work out the surface-charge density on the surface of the conducting plane due to a positive charge q above it (Fig. 2.33 (a)). This is a difficult boundary-value problem, but using the method of images we only   need to determine the electric flux density due to the two point charges. According to Fig. 2.33(b) the electric field at a distance r from the charge is given by     (the negative sign is due to the fact that the direction of the electric field is opposite to the normal to the plane), and consequently . There are various generalizations of the method. A charge in a corner has three images (Fig. 2.34) but there are as many as five images in a wedge of 60° (Fig. 2.35). You can now work out for yourself how many images a charge in a wedge of angle  has (unfortunately n must be an integer). The essence of the method is that a conductor may be replaced by a set of charges without any change in the pattern of field lines and equipotentials. Another example of a mirror charge, this time in a cylinder, is provided by Figs 2.22 and 2.23, redrawn in a more suitable form in Fig. 2.36. This is an example we have already worked out. According to our new interpretation the line charge p1 has its mirror charge -p1 at a distance 2d. It is also possible to define a mirror charge in a conducting sphere and in some purely dielectric configurations but we will not discuss them here. 2.9. Dielectric boundaries The conditions for conducting boundaries have been simple enough. Unfortunately not all boundaries are comprised of conductors; some of them are dielectrics, and even worse we have to consider sometimes imperfect dielectrics that have a finite conductivity. The proper boundary conditions may be derived in the usual manner with the aid of Gauss's law. In the general case the boundaries are neither planes nor circles, but this fact does not need to bother us. If we investigate a small enough part of the boundary between two arbitrary media we can always regard the boundary as a plane surface. The Gaussian surface may then be chosen in the form of a cylinder, as shown in Fig. 2.37. If the height of the cylinder dh is approaching zero then the total flux is going through the top and bottom surfaces, i.e. . Keeping the treatment entirely general we shall permit now the presence of a surface charge (made up of free charges; it is still true that the bound charges of dielectrics do not count), hence, when dh → 0, , and it follows from the above two equations that . This is now entirely general. It includes as special cases both eqn (2.63)(when Dn2 is zero inside the metal), and eqn (2.72)(when both dielectrics are perfect so that no free charges can reside on the boundary surface). So far, so good. We have derived the condition for the normal component of D. What about the tangential component? We can get that by taking this  time the line integral of the electric field along both sides of the boundary as shown in Fig. 2.38. Assuming that dl → 0 and noting that for a closed contour the line integral of the electric field vanishes we get , i.e., the tangential component of the electric field strength is constant across a boundary. This means that the electric field will refract at the boundary of two dielectrics, as shown in Fig. 2.39. The relevant equations are . Thus unless the incident angle is 90° the field lines will have a break at the boundary of two dielectrics. An example is shown in Fig. 2.40. We have a line charge in front of a dielectric that fills half the space. The field lines, as expected, refract when entering the dielectric (for a mathematical solution in terms of Images, see Clemmow (1973)). Another example demonstrating the same phenomenon may be seen in Fig. 2.41. A dielectric sphere inserted into a homogeneous electric field in air or a vacuum ""attracts"" the field lines. The physical explanation is that the dielectric is capable of carrying a higher flux density. The mathematical solution is given below in spherical coordinates, r, 0 (the solution is of course independent of the azimuth angle ): , from which E and D may be derived (E0 is the electric field strength in the absence of the sphere). The boundary conditions, eqn (2.107), are satisfied at r = a. If you are interested you can check them (Example 2.12). In an isotropic medium (in which the dielectric constant is a scalar not a tensor) the directions of the E and D lines coincide, thus Figs. 2.40 and 2.41 may refer to either. However if we want to interpret the density of field lines as being proportional to the field strength then both figures must represent D since it is the flux of D that remains constant across a dielectric boundary. 2.10. Electrostatic energy Electrostatics is characterized by charges located at certain positions. If we know the positions of all the charges, we know everything so we should know the energy as well. There is unfortunately no obvious way of writing an expression for the energy in the simultaneous presence of all the charges. It is, however, fairly easy to work out the energy as we bring in the charges from infinity one by one. The first charge is brought in without any opposition. The energy of one charge alone is zero. The second charge is brought in in the presence of the first one. The work done is . There are now two charges, q1 and q2, and we bring a third one, q3, from infinity. The work done is . Three charges are probably enough for seeing the general trend so we shall now sum up the two partial energies , which may also be written in the form . It may be recognized that the terms in the brackets represent the potentials due to the other two charges. It is easy to guess that in the general case one would have, instead, the potential due to all other charges. Hence the general term is of the form , where  is the potential at the point where q1 resides (ignoring the contribution of q1). The expression for the total energy of n charges is then . The transition from discrete to distributed charge can be made as follows: q1 is replaced by , and the summation by integration, yielding , where the volume r must contain all the charges. Thus if the charge distribution is known we should first determine the potential (from eqn (2.24) and then we may use eqn (2.116) for calculating the energy. This is a perfectly reasonable procedure, but we have to admit that eqn (2.116) is rarely used. It is usually transformed into another more popular form. Since  and by eqn (A.2) , we may first transform eqn (2.116) into . Noting further that  and applying Gauss's theorem to the first term in the bracket we get , where S is the closed surface of the volume r. Now this is another perfectly reasonable formula to use — once the volume is chosen. Well, let us choose it in the form of a big sphere. If r the radius of this sphere is big enough then the potential decays as 1/r (cf. Section 2.4) and the electric field as 1/r2. Thus the integrand decays as 1 /r3, whereas the surface increases only as r2. Consequently the surface integral must vanish as r → ∞. We are now left with the sought-for expression. Provided the volume integral is over all space the energy is given by . This is a simple and physically easily interpretable expression. Wherever there is electric field, there is energy as well. So how should you think about electrostatic energy? You are certainly entitled to think in terms of charges and potentials. In order to create a charge distribution a certain amount of work has to be done, and that is available to us in the form of electrostatic energy. But it is better (it is more general) to regard the electric field as the agent with which the energy has been deposited. One usually says that the energy is stored in the electric field. Let us work out, as an example, the stored energy of a parallel-plate capacitor. The electric field strength is given (eqn (2.57)) by E = V/d, hence the stored energy is , where S0 is the area of the capacitor plates. Of course, you can derive the above expression from circuit theory, so once more circuit theory and electromagnetic theory give the same answer. Could we use this stored energy for calculating the magnitude of forces acting, could we get the direction of the forces? Take the following example from mechanics: a mass m at rest at a height h has a potential energy mgh. In which direction will it move if its support is taken away? It will try to reduce the height h in order to minimize its potential energy. While the energy of the capacitor increases that of the battery decreases. Why? Because an increase of dC in the capacitance requires an amount of extra charge dq = VdC, which must flow from the battery to the capacitor. So the loss of energy by the battery is V dq = V2 dC. Hence the net gain of energy of the system is , in agreement with eqn (2.124). So if we consider the capacitor and the battery together the total energy of the system decreases as the capacitance increases. We obtain the same force between the plates whether the battery is disconnected or not — as we should. Examples 2 1.

ACA ACA-FEF-003 0.82 "3. Steady currents 3.1. The basic equations IN this chapter we shall be concerned with phenomena in which the main role is played by the current of charged particles. All our variables can be functions of space but are independent of time. It is easy to present the relevant equations; we have all of eqns (1.1) -(1.7) but have to substitute a/at = O, yielding . There is a difficulty with eqn (3.6). It is correct for most of the chapter with  taken as a constant but breaks down for ferromagnetic materials, which will be discussed in Section 3.11. All the other equations are all right but will not necessarily provide the simplest starting point for solving a given problem. We shall, therefore, introduce a number of alternative formulations. First, we could search for some analogue of the potential function which proved so useful in electrostatics. We found there that by choosing a scalar function in the form  we could automatically satisfy the other equation for the electric field strength, . Can we do the same thing for the magnetic quantities? No, but we can do a similar thing. Since it is the equation  that needs to be satisfied, we should choose the potential as a vector (called, not without logic, the vector potential), defined by the equation . Substituting the above equation into eqn (3.1) we get , or using the vector relation (eqn (A.6)) we obtain the modified form . This equation can be further simplified to  by choosing (in the physicist's jargon this is called choosing the gauge) . Can we do that? One can't usually assign some arbitrary value to the divergence of a vector function. In the present case, however, we do have some freedom of choice. The definition of A by eqn (3.8) is not unique. If we add to A the gradient of a scalar function, the resulting vector A' still gives the same magnetic field because . Hence a suitable choice of will ensure that . So we are left with eqn (3.11). If the current density is specified, eqn (3.11) will provide the solution for A from which B can be determined. How can we find a solution for A? There is nothing easier. We only need to remember the differential equation for the scalar potential  (eqn (2.12)) and its solution in the form of eqn (2.24). By analogy the general solution of eqn (3.11) is . A simple integration will yield A if J is given. We shall go through a number of examples later. For the moment let us use the above expression for deriving Biot-Savart's law. First we shall assume that the current density is confined to a thin wire in which case the integration variable may be changed to , where S is a vector normal to the cross-section,  is the area of the cross-section, and dI is an elementary vector along the tangent of the wire. Noting further that J.S = I and that I must be constant along the wire we may write eqn (3.15) in the modified form , whence the magnetic field strength is . We have to stop here for a moment to sort out the coordinates. As may be seen in Fig. 3.1 the coordinates of the wire element are x', y', z', whereas the coordinates of the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field are  set of coordinates. Thus the curl operates on the coordinates of P but not on those of dl leading to  where ir is the unit vector in the direction r and we have made use of the vector relation (A3) in the Appendix. This is Biot-Savart's law derived directly from Maxwell's equations. Are there any other ways of determining the magnetic field? Well, one can use eqn (3.1) as it is, but very often one is better off by using its integral form that can be obtained by integrating both sides of eqn (3.1) over a surface . By using Stokes' theorem for the left-hand-side and recognizing that the integral of the current density gives the current, the above equation reduces to , where the line integration is along the curve C enclosing the surface. The positive sense of the integration path is defined relative to the positive current direction according to the usual right-hand convention. Equation 3.21) is known as Ampère's law. We have now a number of equations describing the same thing. Which equation should we use in a practical case, the equation for the vector potential, Ampère's law, Biot-Savart's law, or attack directly Maxwell's equations? It's hard to tell. Experience with practical calculations helps, but even after years of work one usually remains this side of infallibility. I regret to say that there are no general guidelines available. If one manages to find the simplest method at the first attempt that can mostly be attributed to good luck. Can we claim then that the vector potential is as useful as its scalar counterpart in electrostatics? For computational purposes the answer is an unambiguous no. It is always laborious to find the components of a vector, so we are not much better off with A than with H or B. It turns out however that A is a more basic quantity of physics than B. Since B is given by the curl of A it is possible that A is finite while its curl is zero. Interestingly, under these conditions A has an effect on certain quantum-mechanical phenomena.t It would be unfair both to the vector potential and to quantum mechanics to say that none of those formulations have engineering applications (in fact the most sensitive magnetometer built to date is based on that kind of theory), but by and large engineers wouldn't lose much sleep if the use of A were banned with immediate effect. The vector potential is not a popular variable among engineers, maybe because it is not directly measurable. There are no instruments capable to measure the magnitude or direction of A. In my opinion A is a useful thing if used with moderation. It helped us to derive Biot-Savart's law, it will come handy later in solving certain radiation problems, and it often leads to nice formulae, e.g. for the magnetic flux crossing a surface, defined as  that may be rewritten in terms of the vector potential as follows:  where C is the curve enclosing the surface. We have now collected a good number of formulae which will serve us well in the following sections. Before going on, just a few words about the classification of steady currents. It may be roughly divided into two parts: magnetostatics and the rest. We shall discuss the rest first (Sections 3.2–3.5), and that will give us some idea of the relative significance of electric and magnetic fields. Sections 3.6–3.16 are concerned with magnetostatics, where electric fields are assumed to be zero and the interrelationship of J, H, and B are studied. Since we have so many variables, and since in each physical configuration only some of them appear, we will record (just for this chapter) the non-zero variables in each section heading. 3.2. The defocusing of an electron beam (J, E, D, p, H, B) We have so far talked about positive and negative charges, about point charges, and distributed charge. I shall now introduce the concept of an elementary charge, 1.6 × 10 -19 C, carried by an elementary particle called the electron. This is not a necessity. It is possible to study electromagnetic theory without ever mentioning the word electron, but since it has become such a household word and is used so often we can just as well make use of it. In the present section we shall consider a cylindrical electron beam of radius a in which the charge density is uniform (p = Po) and all electrons travel with velocity v. We are not going to enquire into the details how such beams can be produced (it belongs to the subject of physical electronics); we shall accept the fact that the beam exists and will try to work out the forces on the outermost electrons. There is now cylindrical symmetry and a net charge per unit length , yielding for the radial component of the electric field . The magnetic field may be obtained from Ampère's law (eqn (3.21)) as follows , where the line integral is taken over the circle of radius a (Fig. 3.2), I is the total current of the beam and  is the azimuthal component of the magnetic field in the cylindrical coordinate system specified by . From eqn (3.26) we get . The electric force on an electron of charge e travelling at the edge of the beam (R = a) is   it is in the radial direction pointing outwards. The magnetic force is perpendicular both to the direction of motion (+z axis) and the direction of magnetic field ( direction). The vectorial product v X B gives an inward force in the radial direction. Hence the net force on the electron is . Noting that  and anticipating the relationship  to be derived in Section 5.7, we get the following formula for the force , where c is the velocity of light. It may be seen from the above equation that the magnetic force is negligible in comparison with the electric force unless the velocity of the electron approaches the velocity of light. Thus the conclusion is that, owing to the repulsive forces between the electrons, a cylindrical electron beam is unstable. Using a technical term borrowed from electron optics we could say that the electron beam gets defocused. The other conclusion (as far as it is permissible to generalize from a single example) is more important in principle. It is concerned with the relative magnitudes of electric and magnetic forces. Since charged particles rarely travel close to the velocity of light we may conclude that the magnetic forces are by orders of magnitude smaller than the electric forces. Why is it then that we have no difficulties in practice in observing magnetic fields? The reason is, of course, that there are two kinds of electric charges and their effect usually cancels, so the small magnetic field has a chance of getting observed. And that brings us to the ext example. 3.3 Pinch effect (J, H, B) In contrast to our previous example we shall now investigate a cylindrical beam consisting of two kinds of charge carriers: negative electrons and some positive particles, which I do not wish to be more precise about at the moment. We shall assume that the two kinds of particles have equal densities and move in opposite directions. As a result there is no net space charge and  hence no electric field. The currents, on the other hand, do not cancel because they represent opposite charges moving in opposite directions (remember, minus one times minus one is equal to plus one). The magnetic field strength is given again by eqn (3.27); we only need to substitute for the current In + Ip where the subscripts n and p refer to negative and positive particles respectively. Hence the magnetic force on the electron at the edge of the beam (at R = a) is , and on the positive particle is . Note that the force is inwards, and in the same direction for both particles. Let us distinguish two cases. Both particles are mobile In that case both of them will move inwards under the effect of magnetic force. But if the diameter of the beam is reduced, eqns (3.33) and (3.34) tell us that the forces are even larger. What happens then? If everything was uniform then the beam diameter would go on decreasing. In practice however the beam is not uniform and does not possess perfect cylindrical symmetry. Under these conditions the motion of the particles is fairly complicated, and of course our model is unable to predict the detailed behaviour of the particles. Nevertheless a few qualitative conclusions may be drawn without doing any further mathematics. If the cross-section happens to be smaller at a certain place, then the forces are larger there than at the neighbouring cross-sections, so the beam will be further constricted, etc., leading to the so-called sausage instability (Fig. 3.3(a)). If the magnetic field happens to be larger at one side than at the other side, then the beam will be deflected towards the weaker field which makes the field even weaker, etc., leading to the so-called kink instability (Fig. 3.3(b)). The positive particle is immobile In practice this means that the positive ions are part of the crystal lattice. There is then no magnetic force on the ions, only on the electrons. So the electrons want to move inwards but cannot because the ions hold them back by virtue of their electrostatic attraction. Naturally, if the ions attract the electrons the converse is true as well, i.e. owing to the magnetic force on the electrons, there is also an inward force upon the ions. So the whole crystal  structure tries to contract or in other words the material is under pressure (see Example 3.2). In any practical situation this pressure is small and can be neglected when calculating the forces on current-carrying conductors. 3.4. Flow patterns and Ohm's law (J, E, D) Up to now we have not enquired into the question of how the current arose. We just assumed that certain charge carriers moved with certain velocities. Now we shall say that in a class of materials the current density at any point is proportional to the electric field; in mathematical form , where  is the conductivity of the material. The above equation is spite of its utmost simplicity represents an extremely good guess. It is valid for nearly all materials up to quite high electric fields. Will there be a magnetic field? Yes, of course, whenever there is a current there is a magnetic field as well . But the effect of the magnetic field upon the motion of the electrons is nearly always negligible (one exception causing the pinch effect is mentioned in the previous section). Thus we may safely ignore the magnetic field when determining the lines of current flow. We are then left with only one equation   or  or , depending on our preference. Eqn (3.38) tells us that there is some analogy (see Example 3.3) with the electrostatic case treated in Chapter 2. We may, in fact, reinterpret any of the diagrams of Figs (2.25) -(2.31) by assuming that the whole space is filled with a material of conductivity  and the field lines are now the lines of current flow as well. Is the analogy perfect? Not really, because (1) as current flows there is some potential drop in the electrode itself,(2) zero conductivity for part of the space cannot be electrostatically modelled since there are no dielectrics with Er = 0, and (3) when current flows through two materials of different conductivity there is generally a surface charge at the boundary (see Example 3.4). It is not worth discussing any of these complications because one is rarely called upon to work out lines of current in a conductor. We shall rather return to a very simple geometrical configuration for deriving Ohm's law. We shall take a piece of cylindrical material of length l and cross-section S and apply a voltage between the ends. The electric field is then , the current density , and the current . From circuit theory , where R is the resistance of the material. Comparing eqns (3.41) and (3.42) we get . Since  is by definition the resistivity we get the result you learned in school that the electrical resistance is proportional to the resistivity and the length of the sample and inversely proportional to its cross-section. A more general definition of resistance valid for varying cross-sections may be easily arrived at, but it is hardly worth the trouble. The essential  thing is that the relation  is equivalent to Ohm's law. Risking the dismay of circuit engineers some theoreticians do, in fact, refer to eqn (3.35) as Ohm's law. 3.5. Electron flow between parallel plates [J, p, E, D) We shall investigate here just one more physical configuration where in spite of having a finite current the magnetic field may be disregarded. The new feature will be a spatially varying space-charge density. Let us take two parallel conducting plates in a vacuum, one of them endowed with the property that it is capable of emitting electrons. We shall further apply a voltage between the plates so that the electrons emitted by electrode 1 are attracted to electrode 2 (Fig. 3.4). The aim is to calculate the  potential distribution between the plates, and the relationship between applied voltage and the magnitude of resulting current. We can reduce the problem to a one-dimensional one by claiming that the plates are infinitely large. Alternatively, we may say that the plates are so close to each other(as it would be in a practical diode) that the electron beam hasn't got a chance to spread. Whichever way we look at it we can disregard with clear conscience both the radial electric field and the magnetic field. Hence the variables of interest are the current density, the electron velocity, the space-charge density, the longitudinal electric field strength, and the potential . We can arbitrarily assign . Then , where V is the potential difference applied. The electron velocity at the point z may be worked out by the simple consideration that the electron gains kinetic energy at the expense of its potential energy (the same idea as in mechanics). Hence . Assuming now that the electrons are emitted with zero initial velocity, v(0) = 0, we get . Note that e is negative and that, for the above equation to apply, . The charge density may be obtained from the relationship , where J is a positive constant. p must of course be negative because it represents the space-charge density of electrons. In this example the charges are in motion and the charge density varies from point to point but the density at a given point z is not dependent on time. Hence we are faced here with an electrostatic problem which may be solved with the aid of Poisson's equation (eqn (2.12)). Substituting into it the value of p from eqn (3.46) we get . This is a reasonable-looking differential equation; I leave the solution to you (Example 3.5). The main reason for showing this example is not its intrinsic value to applied scientists (the problem of space-charged-limited diodes is no longer in the forefront of interest) but to demonstrate the applicability of Poisson's equation under conditions of steady current flow. 3.6. The magnetic field due to line currents (J, H, B) Assume that a current I flows along the z axis from minus infinity to plus infinity (Fig. 3.5(a)) and find the magnetic field at a distance R from the current. Owing to axial symmetry the magnetic field must be constant at a radius R, hence the application of Ampère's law yields , or . In fact we have derived this relationship in Section 3.2. It makes no difference whether the current is distributed within a radius a or concentrated at the axis (only the enclosed current counts). Could we get the same result by using our formula for the vector potential (eqn(3.17))? We could, although we would run again into the problem of a diverging integral owing to the limits at infinity. We spent quite a long time sorting out this problem in the electrostatic case, and we need not repeat the argument here. Just by analogy with eqn (2.45) we obtain . For obtaining B we take the curl of the vector potential in a cylindrical coordinate system  as follows . Recognizing that nothing can change in the  and z directions (), the only non-zero component is provided by , in agreement with eqn (3.49) For two line currents flowing in the opposite directions (Fig. 3.5(b)), we may write Ampère's law twice and add the magnetic fields or add the vector potentials. In either case we obtain  where  and  are unit vectors in the azimuthal directions from the two line currents respectively. 3.7. The magnetic field due to a ring current (J, H, B) The solution for line currents was simple enough. Unfortunately the determination of the magnetic field for a ring current needs a lot of calculation. We shall assume that a ring of radius a situated in the z = 0 plane carries a current I (Fig. 3.6) and we wish to determine the magnetic field at the point  , i.e. at an arbitrary point in space. We shall rely on the vector-potential formulation because that appears to be best suited for utilizing the axial symmetry of the chosen geometry. The vector potential due to any current element is always in the direction of the current element. Hence if the current is everywhere in the azimuthal direction the vector potential must be in the same direction too. Thus even before starting any calculations we may immediately say that A will only have an  component and that will be independent of . Taking the coordinates of the current elements dl as  (Fig. 3.6) and noting that  we obtain for the desired component of the vector potential  or , where the expression for r has been substituted. Since  must be independent of  we can simplify eqn (3.56) by taking . The remaining integration is nonetheless difficult, and not expressible in terms of simple functions. Mathematicians, wisely foreseeing such difficulties, worked out the theory of a number of special functions and tabulated them as well. In the age of the computer their work is no longer indispensable but is still useful as a sort of short-hand notation. If you look up the relevant books you will find that eqn (3.56) may be expressed in terms of elliptic integrals. Having obtained the vector potential the magnetic field may be obtained by the usual differentiation which, incidentally, also leads to elliptic integrals. There is nothing fearful in elliptic integrals Their definitions are fairly simple, they are nicely tabulated and they have a few interesting interrelations. All that is easily digestible. My main reason for not introducing elliptic integrals here (you can though attempt Examples 3.9–3.11 if you wish to have some experience in handling them) is that I do not want to burden your memory with new formulae, and besides, for cases of most practical interest (the field far away from the ring and in the vicinity of the axis) eqn (3.56) may be integrated out, as will be presently seen. For both cases mentioned above ( and ), the following inequality is valid . Hence we can expand the denominator of the integrand as follows: . Substituting the above approximate relation into eqn (3.56) we can perform the integration, yielding . Let us first consider the case when the point of observation is far away from the ring (); then the vector potential takes the form , which may be rewritten in spherical coordinates as , whence the magnetic field is . Noting that  we get for the components of the magnetic field . Can you remember seeing these self-same components somewhere before? Well, the constants are different but apart from that eqn (2.33), the formula for the electric field of an electric dipole, looks the same. On the basis of this analogy we may call a ring current a magnetic dipole, or more precisely we should say that sufficiently far away from a ring current the magnetic field appears as if it was created by two closely spaced magnetic charges (which of course do not exist). There is another less obvious conclusion at which one might arrive by inspecting eqn (3.63). Notice that the area of the ring  appears as one of the factors in the constant. It turns out (though we are not going to prove it here) that the exact shape of the current loop is immaterial (not unreasonable if the loop is far away) and in the general case we only need to replace  by S, the area of the loop. Turning now to the case when the point of observation is in the vicinity of the axis, we get for the vector potential , and for the magnetic field (in cylindrical coordinates this time) . 3.8. The magnetic field inside a solenoid (J, H, B) A solenoid is a tightly wound coil. Each turn may be regarded equivalent to a ring in which a current I flows. For calculating the magnetic field we shall take the coordinate system shown in Fig. 3.7, where the z axis coincides with the axis of the solenoid. At an arbitrary point on the axis  the  magnetic field may be obtained by summing the contribution of each turn. It is actually easier to do the calculation if instead of individual turns we assume that the current is continuously distributed on the surface of the cylinder, and work in terms of , the current per unit length, obtained by dividing the total current (NI) by the length l of the solenoid, i.e. . The current flowing at z in the interval dz is then , at a distance  from the point where we wish to determine the magnetic field. According to eqn (3.65) such a current will create a magnetic field  and the total magnetic field may be obtained by integrating over the length of the solenoid as follows: . Changing the integration variable to the angle  by the relationship , we may perform the integration and get at the end . If the solenoid is very long (l>a), then , and . This is of course not valid near the ends but if the solenoid is long enough, eqn (3.71) may be regarded valid for most of its length. Incidentally, eqn (3.71) may be derived much more simply if we make the a priori assumption that the magnetic field is constant inside the solenoid and zero outside. We may then apply Ampère's law to the path shown in Fig. 3.8 yielding  It is a bit of a coincidence that eqns (3.71) and (3.72) agree. The reason is that in the latter approach the magnetic field is overestimated near the ends inside the solenoid, and underestimated outside the solenoid. The two inaccuracies just about balance each other. 3.9 Further analogies with electrostatics What happens in the electrostatic case if we fill the whole space by a dielectric? The electric field remains unchanged and the electric flux density increases by a factor Er. What happens in the ""steady current"" case if we fill the whole space by a magnetic material? The magnetic field remains unchanged and the magnetic flux density increases by a factor . Does the analogy still hold when the magnetic material fills only part of the space? The answer is not quite, because the boundary conditions are not quite the same. Using the technique (surface and line integrals shrinking to zero) as in Section 2.10 we get the boundary conditions , where K is a surface current. Hence in the absence of surface charges and surface currents the analogy still holds. If we look at the magnetic field in a region in which no currents flow, the analogy is even closer because  and we can introduce a magnetic scalar potential with the relation . A good example is the calculation of the effect of a spherical piece of magnetic material inserted into a homogeneous magnetic field. The mathematics is exactly the same as in the electrostatic case; we need only to replace E0 by H0 and Er by  in eqn (2.110) in order to get . Hence Fig. 2.41 (p. 47) is a valid representation for magnetic materials as well. The difference between the two cases is merely quantitative. The magnetic materials used in practice have a  several orders of magnitude higher than the Er of practical dielectric materials. Hence the ""attraction"" of the field lines is much more pronounced in the magnetic case. To give a practical example let us put in the middle of our solenoid a magnetic material of high  as shown in Fig. 3.9. Now practically all the flux lines are funnelled into the magnetic material so much so that we are entitled to regard both H and B as being zero outside the magnetic material. 3.10. Magnetic materials When studying the electromagnetic properties of dielectrics I was very reluctant to get involved with the physics of dielectrics. Now I am even more reluctant to talk about the physics of magnetic materials. Not so much because I don't understand the subject (that is no real obstacle to a lecturer), but more because of the time we are likely to consume, even if we keep a respectable distance from quantum mechanics and concentrate solely on phenomenological theories. It must be admitted that magnetic materials behave most unreasonably. The relative permeability may turn out to be a tensor; it may take on very high values, say 106 or more, or it may have a value very close to unity, say 1.00002 for a wide range of temperatures, and then on cooling the material another few millidegrees  may drop to zero. Why to bother so much about the details, you may ask; couldn't we just say that  and go on considering further examples? The trouble is that for the most widely used magnetic material — iron —  is not a constant. Not only that its value depends on H, but, even worse, it depends on the previous history of the sample. So we have to discuss the B-H curves, and I will include a few more things, but you must realize that there is a lot more to it. By the time we finish with it we shall have just scratched the surface of the subject. 3.11. The B-H curve of ferromagnetic materials It is customary to divide all magnetic materials into diamagnetic (), paramagnetic (), and ferromagnetic () groups. Paramagnetic materials are unimportant from an engineering point of view, and diamagnetic materials may have a future; the present, however, belongs to the ferromagnetic group, and above all to the most important representative of the group — the various alloys of iron. In order to obtain the B-H curve let us make the following experiment. Place a cylindrical iron rod inside a solenoid (as in Fig. 3.9), vary the current and measure the flux density. We shall assume that, before we switch on the current, H = 0 and B = 0, a natural-enough assumption. As we increase the current, the magnetic field will increase proportionally (eqn (3.71)) but the flux density will be a nonlinear function of the magnetic field, as shown by the line OP in Fig. 3.10. The point P is called the saturation point, beyond which , i.e. the iron has stopped contributing to the flux density; any further increase of H will result in that much increase of B as in a vacuum. Reducing now the current (and H with it) we shall not retrace the same curve; B will decrease much more slowly and will have a finite value at zero current. If we now increase the current in the opposite direction B will decrease further reaching zero at R, and negative saturation at S. The other half of the curve STUP displays the same behaviour. This is no doubt a remarkable curve. B being so sluggish, it is usually referred to as the hysteresis curve. Note that the B-H relationship is irreversible everywhere inside the hysteresis curve. If at an arbitrary point (say V) we decided to decrease the current, B would decrease in a different manner, as shown in Fig. 3.10. As far as engineering applications are concerned the most remarkable feature of the curve is that we can get a flux density even in the absence of all external agents. This is of course the permanent magnet you have all come across. How is this possible? Up to now a current appeared to be absolutely essential for creating a magnetic flux. The obvious way out of this dilemma is to say that the currents are there — inside the magnetic material. The detailed mechanism of these currents has kept lots of physicists busy ever since Ampère made the hypothesis, but apparently some more time is needed to find a proper solution. For permanent magnets a wide hysteresis curve is needed so that demagnetization should not easily occur. For transformers and rotating machinery a narrow hysteresis curve is preferable because irreversibility leads to losses. I am afraid this is about as much as I am going to say about magnetic materials apart from a very brief discussion of some pseudomagnetic materials (superconductors) in Sections 3.15 and 3.16. We shall look at a few examples now in which simple geometries will be considered. 3.12 The magnetic flux density inside a permanent magnet of toroidal shape (B) In a permanent magnet shaped as a torus we have H = 0. The only equation to satisfy is , and that means that all the flux lines must be closed. Choosing a toroidal shape there are still lots of possible ways for the lines to arrange themselves, but in a good permanent magnet the flux lines will be circles with centres at   0, the centre of the toroid (Fig. 3.11 (a)). We may then claim that B = constant everywhere inside the magnet and zero outside. 3.13. The magnetic field inside a permanent magnet of toroidal shape containing a gap [H-B) In the last section we have come to the interesting conclusion that B may alone exist of all our variables but we reached that conclusion on a magnet shape not much used in practice. If we take the trouble to make a permanent magnet we would like to have access to the magnetic flux so let us look at the more practical case (Fig. 3.11(b)) when a narrow gap is cut into the magnet. How will the flux density vary in the gap? It will be hardly different from B0, the value in the material; in the short space available the flux lines have not got a chance to spread. We shall therefore take the flux density in the gap to be equal to B0. The corresponding magnetic field will be . What about the value of the magnetic field in the magnet? It may be obtained from the consideration that in the absence of an external current the line integral of H (taken over the dotted lines in Fig. 3.11(b)) must vanish, leading to , where  is the width of the gap and l is the length of the path in the magnet. From eqn (3.76) we get the value of the magnetic field inside the magnet as . There is still one question we have to ask, Will the magnetic flux density inside the material B0 be the same as Br the value before the gap was cut? No, not quite. There are now two relations to satisfy. B0 is obtained where the straight line  intersects the B-H hysteresis curve as shown in Fig. 3.12. 3.14. The magnetic field in a ferromagnetic material of toroidal shape excited by a steady current (J, H, B) We shall now take a ferromagnetic material that has a very narrow hysteresis loop so that we can assume with good approximation a unique (though of course nonlinear) relationship between B and H. The material is again assumed to be of a toroidal shape but it is now excited by a current I flowing in a coil of N turns (Fig. 3.13(a)). We may then apply Ampère's law to the path shown by dotted lines to obtain , whence ,— a formula we have already met (eqn (3.71)) when discussing an approximate solution for a long solenoid. The corresponding value of the magnetic flux density is B1 = B(H1) that can be obtained from the B-H curve, as shown in Fig. 3.14. Next, we shall find the solution when there is a gap of width  in the material (Fig. 3.13(b)). For the same current the magnetic flux density will decrease to B2, its value being the same both in air and in the material. Denoting the magnetic field in the material by H2i and in air by H20, Ampère's law yields . Noting further that , the above equation gives a linear relationship between H2i and B2. Hence the solution is obtained by the intersection of the straight line  and the B-H curve. The graphical construction is shown in Fig. 3.14. If we wish to produce the same flux density as in the absence of the gap, we need to increase the current. This is the subject of Example 3.13. 3.15 The perfect diamagnet (H, B, K) There is a class of materials called type I superconductors which below a certain critical temperature (around the normal boiling-point of liquid  helium ) become both perfect conductors and perfect diamagnets. This means that B must be zero inside the material. Thus if we place a piece of such material (say a sphere) into an otherwise constant magnetic flux, the material will expel the flux lines as shown in Fig. 3.15. How can this happen? What mechanism is responsible for expelling the magnetic flux? The appearance of surface currents (which we have previously denoted by K). As the sphere becomes superconducting, surface currents are set up producing a magnetic flux opposite to that already existing inside the material. 3.16. The penetration of the magnetic flux into a type I superconductor (J, H, B) In real life nothing is ever perfect. A type I superconductor, I confess, is not a perfect diamagnet; it will let in the magnetic flux just a little bit. How far will the magnetic flux penetrate? Is there a simple way of describing the decay of the magnetic flux mathematically? There is. We can use the following one-dimensional model. Half of the space (z<0) is a vacuum in which a constant flux density B = B0iy is assumed. The corresponding vector potential (assuming no variation in the transverse direction  is , where A0 and A1 are constants. The other half of the space (z>0) is filled with a type I superconductor. The approach I am going to adopt now applies to the present section only and acknowledges the fact that a superconductor is not an ""ordinary"" magnetic material; it cannot be described by a ""magnetic"" constant, by assigning to it a certain value for . Instead, a new macroscopic constant needs to be introduced. We shall proceed similarly as in the case of conductors. We assumed then that the electric field was proportional to the current density. Now we shall assume that there is a linear relationship between the vector potential and the current density , where y is the new macroscopic constant. Substituting eqn (3.84) into (3.11) and retaining the one-dimensional character of the problem, we get the differential equation , the relevant solution of which (disregarding the exponentially increasing term) is as follows: , where A2 is another constant. Hence we get for the magnetic flux density . The flux density reduces to 1/e of its value at a distance , which is called the penetration depth. A typical value is λ = 60 nm (nm = nanometre), so the material is not very far from being a perfect diamagnet. 3.17. Forces Let us first work out the force upon a current element of length ds in the presence of a flux density B. According to eqn (3.7) the force on a point charge q is . Assuming now that the magnetic field is constant over S0, the cross-section of the wire, the force upon all charges within the volume element S0ds must be the same. Hence the total force on the current element is , and for a whole current loop we get . If the magnetic flux density is constant over the whole loop then B may be taken out of the integral sign, and the remaining integration yields zero. Consequently, there is no net force upon a current loop in a homogeneous magnetic flux. There is, however, a torque which may be easily calculated for a rectangular loop. In the specific example of Fig. 3.16 (your guess is correct if you think that the arrangement has something to do with electrical machines) there is a current-carrying loop capable to rotate around the horizontal axis in the magnetic flux (assumed constant) of the permanent magnet. As may be seen from Fig. 3.16(b) the forces on sides 1 and 3 balance  each other, whereas those acting upon sides 2 and 4 produce a torque. The force on side 2 is  whence the torque comes to  where 0 is the angle between the plane of the loop and the vertical direction. Next we shall work out the force upon a small current loop due to another current loop in the geometry of Fig. 3.17. Owing to symmetry the magnetic field of loop I has only Hz and HR components. In the vicinity of the z axis they are given by eqn (3.65). We shall consider the forces due to each component separately. The force due to Hz upon the current element in loop 2 is in the radial direction. Integrating over all current elements the net  force is obviously zero. For the other component, HR the force  is in the negative z direction. (Remember from school?  ""The force between two currents flowing in the same direction is attractive."" ) Integration over the circumference yields . Examples 3 3.1. A current with a constant current density J0 flows in the z-direction between the cylinders . Determine the magnetic field in the regions . 3.2. A cylindrical column of mercury 10mm diameter carries a current of 100 A uniformly distributed over the cross-section. Calculate the pressure due to the pinch effect,(i) at a radius of 2.5 mm and (ii) at the axis of the conductor. 3.3. The resistance between a pair of electrodes immersed in an infinite medium of conductivity  is R. Show that the capacitance between the same pair of electrodes is  when the medium is changed to a lossless dielectric. A general proof is required valid for any geometry. 3.4. Two lossy dielectric materials are joined together as shown in Fig. 3.18. determine the voltages across each material and the surface charge density at the boundary if a voltage V is applied. 3.5. Solve eqn (3.47) under the condition that the electric field is zero at electrode 1 (z = 0). 3.6. Derive an expression for the magnetic field H at a point P distant a from the centre line of a long thin conducting strip of width b (Fig. 3.19) which carries a longitudinal current I uniformly distributed across its section. 3.7. (i) Prove that the magnetic field strength H at a point P distance R from the wire of finite length a (Fig. 3.20) is    (ii) Deduce that the field strength at the centre of a square coil of side b, carrying a current I, is . (iii) Determine the field strength at the centre of a current carrying loop which has the form of an n-sided regular polygon inscribed in a circle of radius a. (iv) Show that the above result reduces to that of (ii) when n = 4 and to eqn (3.65)(with z = 0) when n → ∞. 3.8. With the aid of the transformation  bring eqn (3.55) to the form , where . 3.9. The complete elliptic integrals are defined as follows . Express the vector potential of the previous example in terms of elliptic integrals and work out its value when R = a = 0.1 m, I = 1A, z = a /12 (use Tables, e.g. Jahnke-Emde-Losch). 3.10. When k<1 the complete elliptic integrals may be approximated by  and . Show that the vector potential obtained in Example 3.9 reduces to those of eqns (3.60) and (3.64) under the respective assumptions. 3.11. It is fairly simple to differentiate the elliptic integrals (see p. 49 of Jahnke-Emde-Losch, for the formulae) so if you have the patience derive the magnetic field from the vector potential of Example 3.9 and determine its value for the data given there. 3.12. Eqn (3.70) gives the magnetic field on the axis of a solenoid of length I. Is the formula valid outside the solenoid? 3.13. The magnetization curve of a certain steel is given by . An anchor ring of this material has a mean diameter of 255 mm. It is wound with 160 turns of wire carrying a current of 2.5 A. Calculate the flux density on the mean diameter. What current is required to produce the same flux density after a gap of 0.5 mm wide has been cut in the ring? What flux density is produced in the gap by a current of 7.5 A? 3.14. The electromagnet shown in section in Fig. 3.21 is designed to give radial magnetic flux density B in an annulus of radius a and width  when energized with constant voltage V. Its coil is wound from copper of conductivity  and is located in the annular space inside the electromagnet which has the dimensions a, b, c shown in the figure. The copper can be assumed to be uniformly distributed across the section but it only occupies a fraction  of the space available; the current density in the copper is to be J. Neglecting flux leakage, and the contribution of the magnetic material to the line integral, calculate the dimension b, the size of the copper wire, and the number of turns in the winding when B = 1 T, a = 20 mm,  = 1.5 mm, c = 0.1 m, V = 12 V,  = 5.7x107 Sm-1,  = 0.65, J =1.5x106 Am-2. Explain why  must be less than unity and why the current density must be limited to J. Estimate values for the dimensions h1, h2 so that each section of the steel core shall be subject to approximately the same maximum flux density. 3.15. From eqn (3.90) and from the Biot-Savart law show that the force between two arbitrary current-carrying loops (Fig. 4.8, p. 100) is , where  is a unit vector in the direction between the current elements ds1 and ds2. (Hint; Use Stokes's theorem.)"
ACA ACA-FEF-004 1.04 "4. Slowly varying phenomena 4.1. The basic equations IT is difficult to say what ""slowly"" varying is until I give examples of ""fast"" varying phenomena. Thus for a proper appreciation of the distinction between ""slow"" and ""fast"" you have to wait for electromagnetic waves to be introduced, discussed, and digested. For immediate use I offer only mathematics, but a little later (Section 4.3) I shall try to show the limitations imposed by the assumption of slow variation. Mathematically, the definition is easy. As long as , i.e. as long as the displacement current is negligible in comparison with the current of charged particles, we are in the ""slowly"" varying region. Hence we disregard the displacement current term but have all the rest of eqns (1.1) to 1.7) as follows: . There is only one equation we have not considered so far and that is eqn (4.3), which will probably look more familiar in another form. Integrating eqn (4.3) over a surface and applying Stokes's theorem to the left-hand side, we get , where the line integral is over the closed contour of the chosen surface. Using the definition of magnetic flux (eqn (3.22)) the above equation may be written in the form . Remember eqn (2.5) , the definition of the scalar potential in terms of the electric field. Substituting it into eqn (4.10) would always yield zero, and that is obviously incorrect because the right-hand side may be finite. Thus the definition of eqn (2.5) is no longer applicable or we should rather say it is no longer sufficient. We need something else besides the scalar potential for describing correctly a time-varying electric field. The additional term may be obtained by substituting the vector potential for B in eqn (4.3):  and rearranging it in the form . For the above equation to be satisfied the expression in the bracket must be equal to zero apart from the gradient of a scalar function (remember . Thus the general form for the electric field is as follows . The gradient of a scalar potential is still there but we have in addition the time derivative of the vector potential. When studying static electricity there was no need to make any distinction between voltage and potential difference. For the static case, by definition, . For the time-varying case we still define voltage by the relation , but now it takes the form . There is no reason why the line integral of the vector potential between two arbitrary points should be independent of the path. This must be kept in mind when considering time-varying fields. It is no longer unambiguous to talk about the voltage between two points. It will, in general, depend on the path chosen. For the static case the line integral of the electric field disappears when taken over a closed path. For the time-varying case  is, in general, different from zero. We shall introduce now the notation , where  is the so-called electromotive force. It is rather unfortunate to call it a force because it isn't one. At the same time one can have sympathy with those who devised the term because it is the tangential force per unit charge integrated over a closed path. In other words it is the work done by taking a unit charge round a circuit. The definition, eqn (4.17), though often used, is regrettably not sufficiently general. When the closed path is in a wire loop and the loop is in motion then a force due to the magnetic field is present as well, giving rise to a finite amount of work in the same manner. The more general definition will be discussed in Section 4.7. For the time being we shall use eqn (4.17), which substituted into eqn (4.10) will yield , a restricted form of Faraday's law (for its general form, see Section 4.7). This is valid for the case when the flux linking a stationary circuit varies as a function of time. The dimension of  is that of voltage, so it is not surprising that many people refer to it as voltage or induced voltage, a usage into which I often lapse myself. However, when we want to emphasize the ability of  to put charges into motion, it seems preferable to accord to it its full title, or at least its popular abbreviation in the form of e.m.f. We have now derived a new law for slowly varying phenomena. What can we say about the laws derived in the last chapter? Are Ampère's law and Biot-Savart's law still valid? And the relationship derived between the current density and the vector potential (eqn (3.15)), is that still valid? Yes, all of them are still true as a good approximation as long as the inequality (4.1) stands. A slowly varying current will produce a vector potential (or a magnetic field) varying at the same rate. 4.2. The electric field due to a varying magnetic field Let us consider a two-dimensional case where the magnetic field at a given moment is constant within a cylinder of radius a, and is zero outside this cylinder. We shall further assume a sinusoidal time variation so that  The assumed magnetic field is independent both of z and of the azimuth angle , hence the electric field follows the same pattern; it is independent of z and  and depends on R only. Then eqn (4.3) yields the scalar differential equations . We find by inspection that the solutions are . The constant may be determined from the continuity of the electric field at R = a yielding . This is quite interesting. A time-varying magnetic field creates an electric field as suggested by eqn (4.3), but this is not necessarily a local relationship. The magnetic field may be confined to a certain part of space but the resulting electric field will pervade all space. What can we say about the line integral of the electric field? It follows from eqn (4.9) that it is finite if the path encloses the time-varying flux but  zero otherwise. How does this appear in practice? What happens if we place a conducting wire into the electric field? The mobile charges in the wire are not the least concerned about the origin of the electric field. They react in the same way whether the electric field is due to static charges or to a time-varying magnetic field; under the force qE they rearrange themselves so as to cancel the electric field inside the conducting material as shown in Fig. 4.1(a). There will now be an additional electric field (say Ec) due to the presence of these charges. Note however that , hence the charges do not interfere with the line integral of the electric field around a closed path. It is still true that   whether we regard E as the original field (without the contribution of the charges) or as if Ec were added to the original field. So what is the voltage we are going to measure? Let us take an ideal voltmeter (one that draws no current) and measure the voltage across the terminals of the wire. The voltage measured still depends on the path. We measure finite voltage if the time-varying flux is enclosed (Fig. 4.1(b)) and zero voltage if no flux is enclosed (Fig. 4.1(c)). What happens if we have N loops (Fig. 4.2(a)) round the varying flux? Surely, we will have an induced voltage  in each one of them. If we  connect the loops then the total induced voltage will be the algebraic sum of the individual voltages. If we make up a helical coil (Fig. 4.2(b)) the wires are going round always in the same direction so the voltages simply add and we may rewrite eqn (4.13) in the form , where  is the flux enclosed by each turn. Let us go now one step further and consider a resistive wire ring (Fig. 4.3(a)). The force on the mobile charges is still qE but now the charges may follow the electric field all the way around the ring. A current is set up corresponding to the J = oE relationship. Then , where R1 is the resistance of the loop. As may be expected the ohmic voltage drop in the wire will be equal to the induced voltage. Let us next evaluate the line integral of the electric field over the closed mathematical curve shown in Fig. 4.3(b). As long as the total time-varying magnetic flux is enclosed, the line integral  will remain the same as in the previous example. Note however that the electric field is different on Sections 1 and 3 and the line integrals on Sections 2 and 4 vanish altogether (because the path is perpendicular to the electric field). Let us replace now the mathematical curve by thin wire. What will determine the current flowing in the wire? The tangential component of the electric field along the wire. But then we obtain the answer that the current is larger in Section 3 than in Section 1, and no current flows in Sections 2 and 4. Is that possible? According to eqn (4.2) that is not possible. Taking the divergence of both sides of eqn (4.2) we get , which may be recognized as the continuity equation for an incompressible  fluid. It means in our case (the same that commonsense would suggest) that the current in the loop must everywhere be the same. It varies of course as a function of time but not as a function of the spatial coordinates. So J must remain constant, but it can only remain constant if the tangential component of the electric field is constant as well. Hence charges must appear (see Fig. 4.3(c)), producing an electric field Ec. which will counteract the induced electric field Ei so that the resultant electric field E = Ei + Ec is constant everywhere along the wire. What difference will it make if the wire loop is placed in the magnetic field as shown in Fig. 4.4? There will be a current produced by the electric field as  before; the new feature is the appearance of a qv X B force on each charge element. Since the velocity of the charge carriers is in the azimuthal direction, the force will act radially. It is the same story again. The charges cannot leave the wire so they will accumulate at the outer and inner surface of the ring until a radial electric field is produced that will cancel the force due to the magnetic field. In conclusion, I wish to emphasize that all the charge rearrangements discussed in this section occur very fast, much faster than the period of oscillation of the magnetic field. Inductance and mutual inductance We shall start again with a resistive ring but make two modifications. The externally impressed voltage need not come from a time-varying magnetic field as in the previous section, it may be produced by a signal generator. Secondly, we shall take into account the voltage induced by the current flowing in the ring. If you solve the field problem and exercise due care in getting the signs right, you will find that the induced voltage is such as to oppose the voltage that created it. For this reason it is often called a back e.m.f. The resulting equation is . But according to Faraday's law , hence . We shall now define self-inductance by the relationship . Substituting the above definition into eqn (4.32) and changing from  to d/dt we get , as known from circuit theory. Eqn (4.34) is suitable for the measurement of L. We impose a sinusoidal V ext , we know R (from calculations or measurement), we measure I, calculate dI/dt, and then L, being the only unknown, is determined. Can we calculate L? Not easily. Even for such a simple geometry as the ring there are lots of difficulties. In Section 3.7 we managed to get simple expressions for the magnetic field far away from the ring and in the vicinity of the axis. But in order to calculate the flux across the ring we need to know either the magnetic field at every point in the interior of the ring or the vector potential along the perimeter of the ring. Eqn (3.56) is complicated enough and that does not even take account of the finite diameter of the wire. So the problem is pretty complicated. Reference books give the answer , where d is the diameter of the wire. This looks simple enough but, believe me, a lot of sweat has gone into producing that formula. Eqn (4.34) is of course true for any closed circuit upon which a time-varying voltage is impressed. In general, R is the resistance of the circuit and L may be obtained from eqn (4.33), where  is the flux enclosed by the circuit. Can one determine the inductance of any of the practical configurations with relative ease? Yes, there are a few, e.g. a two-wire transmission line which is nothing else but two parallel wires carrying opposite currents. For two infinite line currents the magnetic field was given by eqn (3.53). We get the flux per unit length by integrating the flux density over the space between the wires (assumed to be infinitely thin), as follows: . Unfortunately, the above integral diverges. What's wrong? Obviously the limits: we should not have taken the wires infinitely thin. These infinities are our best friends and worst enemies. By taking things infinitely long and infinitely thin and infinitely something else, we can arrive at simple formulae. When later we want to use those formulae it turns out not infrequently that we have some divergent results. In the present case the remedy is clear and easy. We need to assume a finite wire diameter, and we can do that without landing in a sea of further complications. This is because wires used in practice (e.g. copper) are non-magnetic: we don't need to worry about boundary conditions at all. The only difference between copper wire and air is that the former carries the current. There is no reason now for the current density to deviate from uniform distribution over the cross-section, so eqn (3.53) still correctly describes the magnetic field between the wires. Consequently, the flux per unit length between the wires is , where a is the radius of the wire. Is this the total flux? No, because the magnetic field can penetrate the wires. The contribution of a single wire may be determined with reference to Fig. 4.5. At a radius r the amount of current enclosed is (r/a) 2I, hence the magnetic field from Ampère's law is   yielding for the flux per unit length inside the material . If b>a then this internal flux may be neglected giving the often quoted formula for the inductance per unit length of a two-wire transmission line , but remember there is an internal flux as well(and a corresponding internal inductance), which may not always be negligible. Next we shall look at a long solenoid filled with a high-permeability magnetic material as shown in Fig. 3.9 (p. 73). Then the magnetic field inside the material (from eqn (3.72)) is , uniform across the cross-section (of area S0) of the core. Hence the magnetic flux produced inside the solenoid is . The voltage induced in each turn of the solenoid is  hence the self-inductance comes to . Let us tap now our solenoid at a certain point (Fig. 4.6(a)) so that . We have now two separate solenoids with N1 and N2 turns respectively. How could we determine their inductances? Nothing can be simpler, just use eqn (4.43) above and get . I am afraid the above formulae are wrong because our new solenoids don't look the same as the old one. As shown in Figs 4.6(b) and (c) the new   solenoids have a core of length l, although the wiring is confined to lengths l1 and l2 respectively. Since the magnetic material is still endowed with the property of concentrating the field lines in itself, the flux stays constant for the whole length of the core, yielding . If the core makes up a closed circuit as shown in Fig. 4.7(a) then l should be taken as the length along the dotted line and eqn (4.43) is still applicable. In all of our examples so far we could calculate the flux through a simple surface. but how should we take the surface when there is no magnetic material to guide the field lines and the wire itself is of a complicated shape? Then even the choice of the surface (having the wire as its boundary) might tax to the limit one's meagre imagination, let alone the calculation of the flux. The practical answer is ""don't calculate the inductance, measure it"" , but if for some reason you must do the calculation, the best approach may be to abandon the definition of eqn (4.33) in favour of the equivalent energetic definition (see Section 4.12) . It might be simpler to find the total energy in space than the flux crossing a given surface. We shall now go over to the definition of mutual inductance with the aid of Fig. 4.8. The current  flowing in loop 1 will produce a magnetic flux  through loop 2 leading to the definition . There is a similar definition for M21 and it can be shown (see Example 4.4) that M12 =M21 =M. If  is time-varying, the voltage induced in loop 2 is M (dI1, /dt). The sign of M depends on the convention adopted for the direction of currents in the two loops. Circuit engineers take the mutual inductance invariably positive and denote the direction of the induced voltage by a dot in the circuit diagram. A current flowing into the inductance L1 at the dot produces a voltage V2 = M(dI1/dt) as shown in Fig. 4.9. Let us determine now the mutual inductance between two coils wound on the same magnetic core (Fig. 4.7(b)). The flux produced by a current in coil 1 is given by eqn (4.42), , where the subscript 1 referring to coil 1 has been attached to the current and number of turns. Assuming now that all the flux produced by coil 1 will pass through coil 2 as well, we get for the voltage in coil 2 , whence . It is interesting to note that . If some of the flux produced by coil 1 does not pass through coil 2 (see Fig. 4.7(b)) then  appearing in eqn (4.50) is smaller leading to a smaller value of mutual inductance. Thus when some flux ""leaks away"" eqn (4.52) becomes an inequality: . Alternatively, one may introduce a coupling coefficient  and rewrite eqns (4.52) and (4.53) in the form . The above relationship turns out to be true for any two magnetically coupled circuits. The proof will be provided in Section 4.12. Next we shall determine the mutual inductance between two concentric rings at a distance h apart (Fig. 3.17, p. 82) under the assumption that the upper ring is small. We need to find the magnetic flux through ring 2 due to the current in ring 1. We can use the formulae derived in Section 3.7 for the vector potential and magnetic field in the vicinity of the axis. With the aid of eqns (3.64) and (3.65) we obtain the magnetic flux in the form  from the vector potential, and in the form  from the magnetic field, giving of course identical results. The mutual inductance is then . Note that we have not so far specified the wire thickness of either ring. For the mutual inductance it is not needed. Finally, I want to say a few words about the assumption of ""slowly varying currents"" in connection with the last example. As you know, any electromagnetic disturbance (any change in anything) propagates with the velocity of light, something we have so far neglected to take into account. When calculating the mutual inductance we assumed that the magnetic field due to I1 appears instantaneously at the second ring. In fact it takes time, the maximum time being equal to , where l is the largest possible distance between any two points in Fig. 3.17. If the current I1 may be considered constant during the time  then we are entitled to talk about slow variation. For sinusoidal current variation the condition is that the period of oscillation T should be much larger than . Using the relationships T = 1/f and c =  (where f and  are the frequency and wavelength of oscillations) the condition may be written in the alternative form . This is clear. As long as the maximum dimension involved is small in comparison with the wavelength, we are in the slowly varying region. 4.4. Kinetic inductance We have defined inductance by eqn (4.33) without discussing its effect upon the current-voltage relationship. Let me now briefly recall what an inductance does in a circuit. It delays things. If we apply a voltage the current will appear after some delay. If we switch off the voltage the current will disappear after some delay. Is there anything else in an electrical circuit that behaves that way? That reminds me meeting an American friend of mine after he completed his grand tour of Europe.  ""D'you know"" , he told me, ""that I can ask for the check in seventeen languages?""   ""Eighteen"" , I said, ""I bet you forgot to include"" bill "".""  As the above story shows it is often difficult to think of the obvious. In order to have a current, charge carriers must be accelerated, and it takes time to accelerate particles of finite mass. Hence the current will necessarily lag behind the voltage causing its rise. Let us put now the relations in mathematical form. We shall write up Newton's equation for the case when the force is provided by an electric field and friction is present , where k is a constant characterizing friction (to be related presently to more familiar constants). For a cylindrical piece of conducting material of length l and cross-section S0 , which substituted into eqn (4.59) leads to . We may formally write , where  is the kinetic resistance, and  is the kinetic inductance. If you think a little about it you will be able to convince yourself that Rk is nothing other than the old familiar resistance (proportional to length; inversely proportional to cross-section) derived in a different manner. Whether one defines a conductance or introduces a friction term they are just two different ways of expressing the empirical fact that the electrons' velocity does not go on increasing indefinitely in response to a driving electric field. Does the same apply to the second term? Is that also a different derivation of the inductance? No, in deriving eqn (4.61) we have not talked about magnetic fields and induction at all. The kinetic inductance owes its existence to inertia. Why is eqn (4.64) so little known? Because under normal circumstances this kinetic inductance is negligible. Comparing eqns (4.63) and (4.64) you may see that Lk = Rk/k, and if you determine k from the identity  you will find for copper that . So you can see that the time constant involved is very small. The kinetic inductance does, however, acquire importance in superconductors, where the resistance disappears altogether. It may be seen by comparing eqns (4.64) and (4.35) that for a ring made of sufficiently thin wire the kinetic inductance may exceed the ordinary magnetic inductance. And this may very well occur in practice because superconductors used in integrated circuits can have cross-sections less than 10 -12 m 2 . It may be said in general that the designer of a superconducting circuit needs to worry about the response time and energy of superconducting electrons. The transformer Let us return to the configuration of two coils on a magnetic core (Fig. 4.7) and apply a sinusoidal voltage to coil 1 from an ideal voltage generator (having zero internal resistance). In response to the applied voltage there will be a current producing a flux that will induce voltages both in coils 1 and 2. If the coils are lossless then the voltage induced in coil 1 must balance the, applied voltage, yielding . Assuming for the moment that all the flux is contained within the magnetic core (so that the amount of flux crossing coils 1 and 2 is the same), the open circuit voltage in coil 2 is , leading to the familiar relationship . Under open-circuit conditions there is no current flowing in coil 2. The current in coil 1 may be obtained from the relationship . For an applied voltage of  we get . What happens if we connect a resistance RL across the terminals of coil 2? A current I2 will flow. But the total flux should not be affected because it is still related to the applied voltage by eqn (4.66). Hence an additional current  will be drawn from the generator so as to satisfy the equation . If L1 is sufficiently large so that  then  may be taken as the total primary current I1, leading to the relationship . Eqns (4.68) and (4.73) are known as the relationships valid for ideal transformers. They are certainly very useful for an engineer because they relate practical requirements (e.g. how large the voltage should be at the secondary) to design parameters (what the turns ratio should be). How are transformers represented by circuit engineers? Well, the circuit representation shown in Fig. 4.9 is perfectly adequate for lossless transformers, but it would not yield the equations for an ideal transformer, not even for the case of perfect coupling, k = 1. For an ideal transformer we need to introduce a separate notation which we shall choose in the form shown in Fig. 4.10. The relationship between the two kinds of notations is not an  obvious one. It may be shown (using the criterion that they lead to the same set of equations) that by adding the so-called leakage inductances to the ideal transformer the two representations (Fig. 4.11) become equivalent. One may add copper losses (resistive losses in the wires) in a similar manner. If you want to include iron losses (occurring in the magnetic core due to the periodically change flux) as well, you should better consult a book having a bigger section on transformers. 4.6 Relative motion of conducting wire and magnetic field Up to now all the wires have been stationary, and the magnetic field has varied as a function of time. Let us see now what happens when the wires are made to move with uniform velocity. As our first example we shall take a straight piece of wire moving perpendicularly to the direction of a static magnetic field. As a consequence there will be a force qv X B acting on the charges in the wire; the mobile charges will be displaced until the arising electric field produces an equal and opposite force. Let us investigate now the converse problem when the wire is stationary but the equipment producing the magnetic field is moved lock, stock, and barrel with the same velocity in the opposite direction. One's first impression is (or should be) that only relative motion counts, hence the force upon the charges should be the same. Formally, we would have the same force if we assumed (as many textbooks do) that a magnetic field moving with a velocity in gives rise to a force . This is a way out of the problem but not a way open to us. We have started by writing down Maxwell's equations and claimed that they will provide the solution to any electromagnetic problem. We are not entitled to introduce a new force. According to our equations a magnetic field, whether it moves or not, cannot produce a force on a stationary charge. What should we do? Well, perhaps the trouble is that we wrote down Maxwell's equations in a stationary frame of reference. In order to tackle the present problem we should change to a coordinate system moving with the magnetic field. This is certainly a possible approach, and one we shall adopt towards the end of the course when discussing relativity, but such a transformation (though convenient) should not be necessary. Maxwell's equations written in the stationary frame of reference should be perfectly capable of dealing with the problem. Why is there a doubt at all? Some doubts may arise by considering the following problem. Let us postulate the existence of a static magnetic field that is constant over a finite region of space, say , and assume that this magnetic field is bodily moved in the +x direction with a velocity u. What will happen to the charges in the stationary wire situated at (say) x = 0? One may argue that by moving the magnetic field nothing has changed at the position of the wire. The magnetic field is unchanged and there cannot be an electric field either because a constant magnetic field is unable to produce an electric field. The above argument is wrong; don't let yourself be misled. Induction is not a local phenomenon. Although , it does not follow that the electric field is also zero at x = 0; the curl of the electric field must be zero but not the electric field itself. When the magnetic field is moved bodily there will be certain places in space where the magnitude of the magnetic field is changing (shaded areas in Fig. 4.12) as a function of time, and that changing magnetic field can give rise to an electric field at x = 0. The electric field will then produce just the right force for displacing the electrons by the right amount. Let's attempt to obtain a general solution of this problem. We shall assume a static magnetic field  which will vary as  when moved bodily by a velocity u. The equation to solve is eqn (4.3) which we shall write here again: . By differentiating eqn (4.77) we get . But according to eqn (A.7)  solution of eqn (4.3) may be recognized as being given by . We are now entitled to write the force on the charges as . If the magnetic field is moved with a velocity -v the force on the charges is the same as if the wire moved with a velocity v, and we have managed to prove all that from Maxwell's equations. 4.7. Faraday's law In order to derive the general form of Faraday's law we need to notice that motion of charge along the wire may be caused both by electric and magnetic fields. Hence for the calculation of e.m.f. in a moving loop we should take both effects into account leading to a definition in terms of the force per unit  charge as follows: . Making use of eqn (4.79) and of the vector derivative relation , we get finally . This is the general form of Faraday's law where the derivative is now taken in the frame moving with the wire. 4.8. Flux cutting Let us take a loop immersed in a magnetic field as shown in Fig. 4.13(a) and assume that a section of the loop moves a distance dl coming to a position shown in Fig. 4.13(b) after a time dt. This elementary piece of wire moving with a velocity dl/dt contributes to the e.m.f. the amount   which may be rewritten in the form , where  is the amount of flux cut by the moving part of the loop. If several distinct sections of the conducting loop are in motion then the flux cut by each section needs to be summed algebraically (each contribution taken as positive or negative depending whether the motion of that section increases or decreases the flux linkage). The conclusion is that eqn (4.84) is valid under a new set of conditions. The change of flux may be interpreted as the amount of flux cut by the moving sections of the loop. 4.9. Examples on wires moving in a magnetic field In the following examples we shall use Faraday's law for calculating the e.m.f. in moving loops. Let us first take a static one-dimensional magnetic vector field pointing in the z direction and varying sinusoidally in the y direction as , where B0 and k are constants. Assume that a loop lying in the x, y plane (dimensions shown in Fig. 4.14) moves with a uniform velocity v in the  direction of the positive y axis. For simplicity we shall further assume that the length of the loop in the y direction is smaller than the period of the magnetic field, . If the rear section of the loop is situated at y = -b/2 at time t = 0, then the positions of the rear and front sections will be  at time t. The flux enclosed is then   and the resulting e.m.f. is . For our second example we shall take a magnetic field varying sinusoidally both in space and in time: . Assuming the same loop travelling with the same velocity as in the previous example, the flux through the loop varies as , yielding . Let us consider now a somewhat different example where instead of uniform translation the loop rotates in a constant magnetic field. This may occur in the same physical configuration as that of Fig. 3.16 (p. 81) used for calculating the torque upon a single turn of current-carrying wire. Assuming that θ = 0 at t = 0 the angular position of the loop is given by  and the flux across the loop may be obtained as , whence the e.m.f. is . Are you quite happy with this result? I suppose you are. A single turn rotating in a constant magnetic field is one of the standard examples of the application of Faraday's law. The result is used for the design of a.c. generators so it must be all right. Nevertheless, just a tiny little doubt should lurk somewhere at the back of your mind. In this example we are not concerned with uniform translation of the loop but with rotation. The loop is subjected to acceleration; there is a centripetal force acting upon the electrons inside the wire. The present approach is permissible only under the condition that the centripetal force is negligible in comparison with the ev X B force. The ratio of the two forces may be expressed as math; where  is the so-called cyclotron frequency. Thus effects of the acceleration are negligible as long as . In a practical case (say) B = 1 T and the loop rotates at 3000 revolution per minute, yielding , so we have a safe margin. Nevertheless, keep in mind that results derived for stationary or uniformly moving bodies will not necessarily apply when the body is accelerated. The concept of flux cutting could have equally been used in the calculations involving static flux. In our first example where the magnetic field varies according to eqn (4.87) the flux cut by the front part of the moving loop in a time dt is , and the amount cut by the rear part is . Hence the net flux cut is , yielding , in agreement with eqn (4.90). 4.10. Eddy currents In this section the effect of an e.m.f. on a solid piece of conducting body is studied. In response to the e.m.f. a current (an eddy current) flows which will, in general, take very complicated paths. We shall now take a very simple case when a conducting disc of thickness , radius b, and of conductivity  is placed in the magnetic field of eqn (4.19) so that the axes coincide. For simplicity we shall further assume that b<a that is the disc is completely immersed into the magnetic flux. In the absence of the disc the electric field is given by eqn (4.22). Assuming that the magnetic field produced by the currents in the disc is negligible in comparison with the magnetic field postulated, the electric field distribution remains the same and the corresponding current density is given by . At a radius R the current flows in the azimuthal direction in a tube of cross-section  the average power dissipated by this current is  (cross-section)2 × (resistance of the tube) . The total power dissipated in the disc may then be obtained by integration as follows . How could we reduce the eddy-current losses in the disc? First, we have to choose a low-conductivity material. Secondly, we could interrupt the currents by insulating various parts of the disc from each other. These problems do indeed arise whenever the magnetic cores of coils and transformers are made of conducting materials (mostly iron). Both remedies suggested above are put into practice. The iron is made into a high-resistivity material by adding silicon, and its cross-section is laminated as shown in Fig. 4.15. 4.11. Electromotive force produced by rotating disc We shall now consider the case when the solid conducting bodies are in motion, the simplest example being when a disc is rotated in a constant magnetic field as shown in Fig. 4.16(a). There will now be a q (v X B) radial force on the charges resulting in charge separation and in the appearance of an electric field. Let us complete now the circuit with the aid of wires and brushes (Fig. 4.16(b)) and insert an ideal voltmeter. What is the voltage measured? It is equal numerically to the e.m.f. in the closed circuit. Since the wires are stationary only the disc contributes to the e.m.f., hence the integration over the closed path reduces to integration along the radius of the disc, yielding . Can we work out the e.m.f. with the aid of the concepts of flux linkage or flux cutting? Not easily. If we choose the circuit in the form shown in Fig. 4.16(c) there is neither flux linkage nor flux cutting. However, if we choose our loop as shown in fig. 4.16(d), where the boundary moves with the rotating disc, the both flux linkage and flux cutting make sense and lead to the desired result. Let us now make the problem a little more complicated by assuming that only part of the disc is in an appreciable magnetic field, as shown in Fig. 4.17(a). What happens if we rotate the disc. An e.m.f. will duly appear. Why? In the region permeated by the magnetic field the charges are subjected to radial forces and as a consequence eddy currents will flow. The resulting current distribution would be terribly difficult to calculate, but one can make rough guess and claim that it will flow along the dotted lines shown in Fig. 4.17(b). Omitting the voltmeter from our circuit, so that a current can How in the resistive wire, it may be seen that some of the current will be forced through the wire hence the device works as a generator. 4.12. Energy and forces The force acting on a circuit placed in a magnetic field is given by eqn (3.90). If we have (say) two circuits then the forces upon each other may be calculated by determining first the magnetic field over all space and then applying eqn (3.90). An alternative method is to derive first the energy of a circuit (or circuits) and then use the principle of virtual work to find the force. In this section we shall have a brief look at the latter method. How can we find the energy of a current-carrying circuit? The answer may be easily obtained with the aid of circuit theory. If we start with the initial condition that I = O at t = 0 and at a later time t the current rises to I then the work done on the inductor is . The same result may derived from field theory in the following manner. If a current element I ds is displaced parallel to itself a distance dl in a magnetic flux density B then the work done is , leading again to . For two coupled inductors a similar derivation (either by circuit or by field theory) yields . Let us rewrite the above equation in the following form . Since the stored energy must always be Positive for any pair of I1 and I2, we may choose , whence it follows that the condition  is valid for any two coupled inductors. Let us take now two rigid loops in which constant currents I1 and I2 flow. The total stored energy is given by eqn (4.108). What is the change in energy if we move one of the loops by a distance dx? The self-inductances will stay constant (because the loops are rigid), but the mutual inductance depends on the distance between the current elements so it will change by an amount dM. Thus the change in stored energy comes to , whence one could conclude that . This is, of course, wrong as we could have guessed on the basis of our experience with forces acting upon capacitor plates. We need to include the work done by the sources in keeping the currents constant. This amounts to . Hence . As an example let us now work out the forces between two current-carrying rings with the aid of our new formula. The mutual inductance is given by eqn (4.57). The force may then be calculated as , in agreement with eqn (3.93). Examples 4 4.1. A circular coil of diameter 20 mm has 100 turns and lies at the centre of a solenoid for which s = 0.3 m, d = O.1 m, and n = 800, the coil and the solenoid being coaxial (s = total length, d = diameter, n = turns per metre). What is the e.m.f. induced in the open-circuited coil if the solenoid is fed with a current of 3A at 50 Hz? 4.2. Fig. 4.18 shows the cross-section of a straight transmission line carrying currents , where w is the angular frequency and I0 is a constant. Derive a formula for the e.m.f. induced around a loop comprising a length of l of short-circuited cable running parallel with the transmission line. Assume that d>a and b<a. Calculate the e.m.f. when I0 = 1000 A, a = 1 m, b = 3 mm, d = 5 m, w = 100 , l = 1 m. 4.3. A long, thin-walled, non-magnetic, conducting tube of radius R, wall-thickness , and conductivity  is placed with its axis parallel to the direction of a uniform alternating magnetic field . Determine the current per unit length flowing in the wall, the magnetic field inside the tube and the average power dissipated per unit length. Neglect edge effects that is assume no change in the variable along the tube. 4.4. Show that the mutual inductance between two arbitrary coils may be written in the form (see Fig. 4.8, p. 100) math;. 4.5. ""Eqn (4.57) gives the mutual inductance of two concentric rings a distance h apart from each other. If a1 and a2 are interchanges the mutual inductance will not remain invariant, defying the M12 = M21 relationship. What is the cause of this discrepancy? 4.6. Determine the mutual impedance between the coil and the solenoid of Example 4.1. 4.7. Eqn (4.57) gives the mutual inductance of two concentric rings a distance h apart from each other. Assume that ring 1 carries a  and the resistance and self-inductance of ring 2 are given as L2 and R2. Show that the mean value of the force F between the two rings (i.e. averaged over the periodic time of the alternating current) is given by , and say which way it acts. It is desired to maximize the ratio (F/weight of ring), and for this purpose it is necessary to decide whether for any given geometry it is better to make the ring of copper or of aluminium. Is it possible to give an answer without having numerical values for anything except the properties of aluminium and copper? . 4.8. Assume an axially symmetric radial magnetic flux density in empty space between the radii R1 and R2 which is constant in the vertical direction (z). Place now a thin wire of radius  into the magnetic field at a height z so that its plane is perpendicular to the Z-axis, and each element of the wire is subjected to a constant radial flux density Br. At t = 0 the ring is released with zero initial velocity, (i) Derive the equation of motion for the ring and show that it is independent of the cross-section of the wire. (ii) Determine the position and velocity of the ring as a function of time. (iii) What is the limiting velocity as t → ∞? (iv) In which case will the ring fall faster, if it is made of copper or of aluminium? 4.9. A transformer supplied from a 220 V, 50 Hz mains has an iron core in which the peak flux density, 0.66 T, is reached at a magnetic field of 150 A m-1. The cross-section of the core is 1.5 — 10 -3 m 2 and its volume is 9 × 10 -4 m 3 . Determine the magnetization current and the number of turns in the primary circuit. 4.10. A rectangular loop moving with a velocity v is shown schematically in Fig. 4.14 (p. 109) and the resulting e.m.f. is given by eqn (4.90). Assume now that the loop is stationary and the magnetic field (given by eqn (4.87)) moves with the same velocity in the opposite direction. Determine the e.m.f. by taking the line integral of the electric field around the loop. 4.11. A rectangular coil is located parallel to a long straight current-carrying wire as shown in Fig. 4.19. Determine the e.m.f. in the coil when it is rotated with an angular velocity w. 4.12. Take the same geometrical configuration as in the previous example but assume that the rectangular coil is moving with a constant velocity u in a direction perpendicular to the straight wire. Determine the e.m.f. in the coil. 4.13. Find the torque which tends to align the rotor in the arrangement shown in Fig. 4.20 with 0 = 45° and 135°,(i) when the rotor carries no current, and (ii) when it carries a direct current of 2 A. The rotor inductance is 1 H and the stator inductance has maximum and minimum values 1 H and 0.2 H. Assume that periodic inductances vary in a sinusoidal manner and that the coils are perfectly coupled when they are in line."

Oh oh. I've only given you one sprout so you're alright. And  only got one sprout? Yeah. Tim, you've got one sprout. Mummy and daddy like sprouts so we've got lots. one sprout   Some trees. Have I got two? No, one. Have I got one  You've just got one sprout Christopher. I'm not giving you much at all. Just a little bit of everything. To see how you go. What's ? Can I  please? No, it's not er filled up yet. I've not put any  what's . Gravy? Mm. I'm going to make some gravy for you. Cos mummy and daddy have got mushrooms and tomatoes cos we like those. frowning at me for? Are you not feeling too  hungry now? Well it's alright. Don't worry, I'm not expecting you to eat much, just a little bit. Cos if you eat biscuits and stuff all day long, I don't expect you to eat meals as well. Is that ? Yeah that's you. I don't think it'll kill you do you, to eat that? What's ? Okay? Is that alright for you? Watch out if it drops. Watch out if it drops. Ooh ooh. don't do it again. It keeps falling over. Here love, that's yours. It nearly fell over. Okay chatterboxes, let's have it. How was your day then love? Okay  Oh. Yes. impressive. That's you Tim. And we'll chop your meat up before we go much further. There's you. Yum yum yum. Nice sprouts. daffodils out since  this morning. And what else have do you notice dear? Oh, a clean tidy garden. Well half a clean tidy garden . Can you see the grass is cut? You've been cutting the bottom part of the grass? We have. And we've put a bit of seed on that bit so it's . And we had the lawnmower. You had the lawnmower out did you? Can you put your bib on? Can you see some seed where there's no grass? Seems like an appropriate thing to do when one's stuck at home. Tim  sit. We get lots of birds in our  garden don't we? Properly please. can see lots of birds. four huge pigeons sitting in the on the grass earlier on. see pigeons  And the cats. There used to be two but there's four now. Do you think they've And the cats. And you saw a cat as well did you? And he run away. Did it? Because he doesn't like me. Oh. Right, who's going to say thank you? Amen I bang the drum. You did bang the drum. Anybody want any of this? No thank you. I want some  I just  No I  I'll do it. I wanted to  get it out. No Tim. Tim. I wanted to get it out. Tim  otherwise it'll go everywhere you see. You can shake it with me. I wanted to get it out. Alright you don't  have any then in that case. I want it. I want Well if you stop crying and ask for it properly and you don't mind if mummy or daddy do it for you that's fine. I want it  do it myself. No. Yeah. I want to do it myself  Do you want me to do it or not? No. Right. I want to get it out  You just want to pick it out? Yeah . You're not going to shake it over your dinner? Thank you. That bit. No I want that too. Right, here you are. Mum That's that one done. out. Thank you. Right. The lid. Good gracious me. What a carry on. Welcome home dear. Has it been alright today? It's been comparatively peaceful today. Good. When did everybody get up? Mum could you cut my meat? They all sort of surfaced  You were all asleep when I er I think I'd  had I finished my breakfast when, no  I think you just came just as I was about to take my first mouthful of cereal. It was about quarter to eight before everybody, well  after that  No but it wasn't. What time did you get up? What time did you go? I left at twenty to eight. Mm. It was about  ten to eight  when Christopher got up. But Tim was still asleep  till about quarter past eight . Oh. And I shouted for daddy. Did you? Which is unheard of. Yes you did shout for daddy. You shouted for daddy? I was already at work. There was no daddy. He'd gone to work already. So then we had a bit of a wonder whether or not Christopher should go to school. And I decided he was, should stay at home. It's probably just as well cos Mm. pool his strength for tomorrow. He was a bit sort of wobbly on his legs at the beginning of the day but he's been  Yeah. fine since. And Tim's going to  Nursery. Holly Cottage tomorrow. Aren't you? Ow. Where   Look I found a yellow . We did go down to the library. Cos I thought it would, it was such a warm day I thought it would be quite nice for him to have a walk  see if he  was alright. Anyway managed to walk to the library and walk down the shops . But when we got back we had to lie down in front of the video for a bit. Mum  Mum, can I  for a minute please. Mhm. So you just did your own private trip to the library ? Yeah I rang up and said I wasn't gonna go   the children. Anyway it turned out we met Ann and  erm both Martin and Ian are  been having a similar trauma. Have they? Mm. Oh. Ian's been sort of talking about all sorts of strange things in his sleep and Really? delirious and hot  hot Yes. fever. So It's odd. A bug they're passing around. Mm. Must be. Child to child. And she said Martin was hot but nothing too traumatic. A bit like these two really. Mm. But Ian had been sick as well. So it's likely they picked it up from them. I should think so. Although Christopher didn't really see much of them did he? Oh he did on Thursday didn't he? Mm. I would have thought Tim would have had it worse from  contact erm wise. These things don't work like that do they? No. And is the parentage alright? Mm. Only strikes children. Yeah. Well it certainly did  in both these cases. Although I met Theresa on the way back from erm  school and she said Alec was at the doctors cos  not the way back from school, way back from the library. And she said Alec was at the doctors cos he was feeling  under the weather. Yeah. So I don't know what that's in aid of. Julia  ill so she  Was she? won't be at work tomorrow. Oh dear. What's the matter with her? I don't want the meat. What's the matter with her? Sore throat. I don't want the meat. You don't want the meat? No. You usually like meat. It probably needs chopping up. Mm. Let's chop it for you. No I don't want it chopped. Tim listen. I'm going to chop you  I don't want  I'm going to chop you one piece of meat okay? We'll take away the other piece. A big pieces. Yeah. There you go. It'll be nice now. Nice and tasty. Well done Christopher. Mm. You alright? Must be getting better. So, it's been a nice warm day has it? Well it has really. It's been a bit sort of muggy this afternoon but we went out in the garden and we sort of just pottled around you know? Better than the weekend weather that I saw? Yeah. It's amazing how the worst weather we've had recently has been on  Saturdays and Sundays isn't it? Mm. It's certainly very wet out there. We had a go on the swing. Did you? You've been on the swing? Apart from her sore throat was Julie okay? Seemed alright. I  wobbly. Mm? Yeah. No it was a fairly quiet day really. Not many people seemed to be at work. Oh. Where are they all? Some at meetings . Like you know all  Yeah  the people who went to Pontepool last week? Well they're all off in Bromsgrove this week . Potato. Mm. and big Patrick and Sue   Oh yeah, in Bromsgrove yeah. Mm. What do they do? Mm. You gave me lots. I did not. You did. I certainly didn't give you lots of meat. I'm full. Oh that's alright. You don't need to have anything else. I want my pudding. Oh no. If you're full you won't need pudding. No it'll be a tiny pudding if you're  not gonna eat er finish all that. It's too much. Well that's okay. You can leave it but you just don't get pudding as well. You eat just a little bit more. Cos then you can have a little pudding. That's it, you eat just a little bit more. That's very tasty mummy. Certainly looks as though it's a  Rosemary Conley type thing. eat it. You help me  meat. Whoops, it's in your eye. Oh. Oh. Potato. Potato in your eye. Getting potatoes in your eyes. That's a funny place to put potato. Mm broccoli doesn't want to come on the fork. Come here broccoli. Broccoli can't get on fork very well can it? We rang grandma of course to say we wouldn't be swimming. So she's at home alright is she? There's a lot of things we're not doing isn't there at the moment? Mm. Yes. She's fine. And there are a lot of things we are doing. What else have ? Oh that's it really. Library this morning and garden this afternoon . And zom zombieness in between. I can imagine actually. No it must have been nice. The  is more  and   Mummy was there  it didn't feel like a long day did it ? No. Feeled like just this morning didn't it? It all passed along didn't it? It feeled like just this morning. Mm. Didn't it? Mm. Because usually this morning we usually have video and it feeled like this morning all the time. Doesn't it mum? We didn't watch much video this morning at all really  Dad. until lunchtime. Mm? When we watched telly Yes. we saw a boat, the big boat. About a big boat. What's the big boat? He tells me  You know you you told me about the big boat didn't you? Oh about the Queen Mary? Oh, right. I think that was a different boat to the one that they showed you on the telly. I was telling you about the Queen Mary. Because it was on the back of  something which he was making recently. You know he was cutting out some card  Mm. He showed me what it was. But I couldn't tell that it was the Queen Mary at the time because he'd already cut it out. and I was saying that it's a big boat that used to go across the world. And when I was a little boy just a little bit bigger than  Christopher  I was shown round it with granny and grandpa  and Uncle Michael and Uncle David. Mm. That's  the same isn't it? We went to Southampton to the docks. I want some pudding now. I read about it in the paper today  Well done Tim. and it's owned by Walt Disney . I want some pudding. And they're losing so much money they're selling it. The thing is nobody wants to buy it  Some pudding now. so they're  scrap . What was Walt Disney doing with it may we ask? Well Was it a  restaurant or something? it was a floating restaurant   loses money on it. I want pudding   Why? It was just too expensive to maintain. Oh. I want some pudding now. I want some pudding. Somewhere in the  Yes we know that Tim but you're just going to have to wait until we've all finished. Daddy left sprouts. I can't manage any more I'm afraid mummy. Daddy left sprouts. Ooh daddy! I might have   Right. I'm afraid I've had no exercise cos I haven't walked to the shops. Well I suppose . You'll have to put the exercise video on dear and Are you gonna have some pudding? But we've got the Rosie and Jim. Mm. Oh we've got Rosie and Jim have we? A new Rosie and Jim. It's about a horse and John gets a new one. Because a pony goes faster than a big horse. Does it? Mm. And they're in   And you have to watch it. They go to a shire horse centre near Stratford on Avon. Do you know where that is? Yeah and a shire horse doesn't go very fast. I didn't know there was one . the shire horse goes slowly. May I have my pudding please? Yes. Let's just cut the pa  And the pony went really fast   I   And guess who was in the pony  Rosie and Jim. Yes. And guess who was in the  on the big horse and just went slow? The big one Thank you. the big one went so slow. They were in the front Mm. but Rosie said  come on fast. And the pony went fast and it overtakes Does it? it on the way home. Okay. I'll just go round the other side and get the ice-cream. We keep doing this. I'm having a lot. Are you? Cos I finished all my dinner  You did finish all your dinner in the end didn't you after moaning on. Did he? Yes, didn't you notice? He finished the lot. Typical. Mum. I'm gonna serve it out. All of it. That's mine. Right. That's  that's daddy's. Who's is  Daddy's. I'll just get  Do you want to take that to daddy? Daddy  yours. ice-cream Thank you. it is.

Cos I just fancy them at the moment. I sort of  I love pears. Do you? And me. Oh  have some too if you want. It's nice to see a happy family. It's certainly much improved on yesterday I tell you. A very jolly day really. A trial weekend wasn't it? It was a bit of a trial weekend . In many respects. Mum, when are you going to have actually porridge  again? I had actually porridge on Saturday. And would you like to have it again? Mm. Not next Saturday. Why can't I have it on Saturday? But last Saturday you didn't. No the  I did. Saturday before that  you didn't did you? Neither did you. Yes the previous Saturday  you didn't want it. Oh didn't I? The rest of us had it. Beg pardon. I'd forgotten that one. The Saturday before that  none of us had it cos we were at granny and grandpa's. Oh that was what I was remembering. And the Saturday before that none of us had it cos you were gallivanting up and down the country with the Correct. the railways. So you haven't seen grandma presumably just sort of spoke to her? No we just rang her up. Very briefly. Have you been out anywhere  car. We've never had the car out all day. What? I thought it was more sensible to walk to the library rather than go in the car cos Yeah. I thought it was good for us. I'm sure it was. Mm. All go in the car. I like it better walking. Mm. So do I.

Would you, why? Well cos what person could then be lying around waiting to mark the answers? Oh I see yes. You've only got one quiz master. Oh I see, yes, that's right  Well let them mark their own  I mean who's gonna cheat? Alright  It's a bit confusing innit, swapping the papers round? Where's the plum in this plum pudding?

And I don't suppose he's made,didn't have very many friends, did he, really, at Goldsworth? I mean Paul was one of his friends  he never had that many  so  that probably means he finds it hard to make friends, you can tell   It's just as well Paul didn't go with him, cos Paul would've been singled out as well.

Well it's his pension  isn't it? Yeah. All he lives on is his personal pension. What, from the gas board? Yeah. That's what he lives on. And if he ever wants to buy anything Yeah. Mm. So  basically I reckon they're gonna be in the shit. Because er  no mum was saying er  they should be out enjoying theirselves, not having to stay in paying all this. Well I mean it's  their decision wasn't it? Yeah. They  Now they've come to realize what it's like. Well I know she had to pay her poll tax didn't she? Down at  Yeah. Barnet. Yeah that was a month's wages, nearly. Well a good part of it anyway. She can't clear much money. I reckon she must get home, take home about eighty quid a week or something. About hundred quid a week. Yeah well no that's not bad money for a woman Yeah. working er what she's doing. Yeah. Just started and all. Not very good wages are they? No I know. In there. Poor wages. Poor payers I mean. Yeah. Oh well they'll just have to  steady down won't they?

He might say oh he  Don't know. But he's not bad at spraying. He's a good sprayer. Oh but that's the whole reason he stopped, because he couldn't  That's right. cope with it. The only thing the old man could do was spray. He couldn't  every time he undid bolts like  and if they were tight, he couldn't do them. Cos you've got to   and he can't use his fingers and if he has to  it  right? And ea each knock  he used, used to be in agony. Like if he was hitting something and he accidentally hit his ha his thumb or his finger  he used to be in agony for  I mean it used to hurt him for the rest of the day. Mm. You know? Mm. Whereas if I hit me hand  you know, okay it hurts but it's gone in five minutes. If I keep, keep hitting it like I did the other day when my brother was there  me thumb and that, oh boy!

Well yeah, but I mean it's not providing half the business is it? Res restoration job you're talking er  if you actually work on a vehicle a week, talking five hundred quid a week. Yeah. So I mean I I just couldn't  I mean that's two grand a month. see him being able to do the work. No but then you've gotta guarantee that you've got restoration jobs. That's it. Yeah. They've got to be guaranteed work like one after the other. Think  they're just gonna have to cut back. Oh yeah. They probably will do cos   I mean your mum'd save a lot of money if she found a l job locally where she didn't have to travel. Yeah. Oh yeah. Go on the bus.

And yet they didn't have any signs  so I think he's talking through his hat. But what he probably means is that they set up signs for Yeah. you know, roadworks and stuff. Yeah. Yeah.

Right, now the other thing is that what Jim's doing which is that programme, how is that coming along? Yeah. What I did  was I got  I went down to the print room and I got a piece of A one paper and  I mean if you want to use  Chris Chris  over in Chester office, see if, that one would, oh mind you there isn't a chair there is there? Mind you is Jonathan away? There's this chair here. Jonathan's not here. Is Jonathan away? Yes, two day a day and a half or something, two days? Right. So, you know, there's desks around anyway Mm that you could use Okay. and erm  er that's what I used if you want to borrow that you can. Thanks. And do it in pencil and just, and then we can  rub it out yes. and change things and so on, yeah. Well it's easy to change isn't it? Because presumably Peter will need to incorporate that  in an overall programme. When we look at the highway side. So it's just the traffic side which I'm dealing with here? Yes. Cos that's all I'm dealing with. Okay and perhaps erm  perhaps you'd also like to l would you like to look at this side of things as well? Incorporate that into it? No, the, the layout plans, do, do some layout plans. Oh yeah sure. Marty's done them before you see haven't you? Yep. So I'm, I'm just trying to look at the ones for   and then we'll go from there. Okay, is that alright? Yeah. Now, have I given either of you task schedules for this  No. stuff? So  I need to do that don't I? Er  in fact I never gave  telephone call  it's no good telling me to do something   Task schedules,ooh   I'll have to get the form. Okay, so you want a task schedule for doing  doing the traffic report? Mhm. Mm yeah? Yeah. And also for doing the programme. Yeah? And you want a task schedule for organizing  this, it's a bit unspecific isn't it? Yeah. Okay. Erm  how is that then? Er you happy to leave things as they are for the minute? Carry on on that basis? Yeah, the only other thing like when you were saying about site layouts, if there's any maps  that we need, and that's including maps for coding, wall maps, you know, large scale. Well obviously we've got to progress into that. We need to prepare some  zone plans and gazetteers maybe. Yeah. Erm  oh well I'll er the other thing I was thinking of is that er  we could be looking er  towards beginning, you know even now, to doing a trips network and things like that. There's no real reason why  you, say, shouldn't start to build up the data on that. Yeah. Erm  y y you know you, you could do a diagram and presumably the person to speak to would be Billy or maybe Peter cos I think Peter did the bulk of the work. Okay. Beverley did a lot of the actual sort of dogsbody work, you know, the actual doing of it. Erm  so you need to build up a picture of what you've got  erm  but there's no real reason why we shouldn't be working on that now it seems to me. Er in principle. Yes beginning, you know, we, we know what we're trying to do obviously we don't necessarily know every, every node in the network  erm  Cos obviously once you start doing that, or when we start doing tr the, the journey run  things erm we're going to need to know what we're wanting. So there'll be two sides of it c er Well there, there won't be any  will there? Erm  Mm. But anyway I mean it's all part of the picture. What I'm getting at is there's no reason why we need, we should wait until after the surveys to start looking at trips. Which is what happened on Ormskirk. Mind you it was partly because we didn't get a programme. But there's no reason, and on  as well. Alright? Right, so  me and Jim had a chat the other day  just looking at the  the roadside entries and the counts and I was sort of saying  if we work on the basis that we want between ten and twelve people, twelve people maximum Mm. erm I think we're be able to do all the counts with that number of people including the  St David's roundabout and Mm. but we do need to clarify exactly what you want on that. Whether you want  samples doing cos that's gonna take more people, or whether you're just doing ins and outs  and stuff like that. Well  And on the other roundabout for that matter. Are you off? Yeah I've got a  seminar in Manchester . Oh right. How did it go? Fine. Probably find that  traffic  percent    we're just talking now this, this is, this is one we're discussing. Oh well just south of Caernarvon on the first section erm between Caernarvon and ? Yes. Yeah. Gwyneth haven't really started on doing any of that work yet. work. And they need to do traffic. And also they need to confirm the traffic erm turning  099 junction at er  I can never pronounce it, beginning with an L. Yeah . And er maybe count, maybe  do their traffic counts out of that as well. So the guy that was in charge of those schemes with Gwyneth Yeah. was at the meeting or came into the meeting to explain about the schemes. What's his name? Erm Peter will know. Peter's got his name down. Cos that was one of the things we talked about   Vernon somebody or other I think his name was. Vernon  need to contact them. Yes, need to do that this week. But they, this, these, well he's got a copy now of the  report and he's gonna c comment back on what Do Welsh Office want any more  bits  copies of that? So that's fine, good. erm and they should comment this week about what extra bits they think they could perhaps cover. So maybe  a few more turning counts  the census   Mm. Right. And that wasn't where I well I haven't been  particularly looking for work from that particular   to know is  they raised er the question about  the er counts we're doing for the Caernarvon link Yes. which is part of this study. Yes. They want us to divorce the staff time Yeah. and charge it against the Caernarvon job. Right. The Caernarvon link job? Yeah which is to our benefit cos we get  Mm. What about the work for Gwyneth? If that's extra What do we charge that to? That is  bypass. They don't want us to charge it to extra to works? We could have a two point six seven multiplier   No. Er er er as far as they're concerned any extra work is just an enhancement of the rate to the bypass erm rate, point six two percent. That was what  pointed out. He pointed out? Any  said we need approval for extra work Yeah. he said well it's just, it's time costs, it's just an extension of the  Right. Except for the Caernarvon bit. Right. Are they wanting a budget figure from us? We're gonna have to put"

Second class. Yes. Five please. Right. Certainly! I'll get those for you. Give that gentleman his paper. There you are. That's right. Lovely! Thank you very much! Thanks Mr . Five seconds my love. That'll do. Let's see what we've got, ooh I dunno if I've got, ooh yes I have! Yes I have! That'll be ninety pence won't it? Five tens are  That's right! fifty, five eights are forty, ninety pence. Good job I learnt my tables when I was at school! There's a lot that don't do it these days! Well my son does. They're very hard  at his school, we've always done them! It's very important! It's ever so important! But, from an early age because without  That's right. tables you can't do multiplication, It takes so , it takes so long to do everything you see. You can't do anything! That's right. You know, and I mean where he used to go to school they didn't teach them them till they were ten! What the hell of a use is that! No good at all! So I mean he is very, very good at his tables and  we bought one of those Early Learning  tapes when he was quite young that you sing  Yeah. to. Mm. And I always learnt mine parrot fashion using  That's right. sticks. That's right. And then we  got a table tester  to help them refresh their memories, it's like a disc and then you got the slots and then it tells you your eight times and that's good as well but  I mean he's got them off by heart which is brilliant! Well it it saves so much time as well you see because and you get on so much quicker with everything! Well absolutely! And I mean, fortunately he is very good at his maths and he's quick at his sums and things because he knows his tables. There's erm  That's right. so much difference! Well I've got, I pu put a program on, I've got a computer and I  Oh yes! put a program on the computer  for maths Oh right! and it's er  it's erm  it's a table program  amongst others, adding  Oh that's good! and subtraction and multiplication. Yeah. But, you know they can pick it and er, it just flashes up and they have to put the right answer in, if they get the right answer it it goes on to the next one, if it Oh that's good! get the wrong answer Yeah. then i it says no that's wrong! Sorry la whatever he name is that   What age group is that for then? Well this is really for anybody learning the tables. But, primarily it's it's it's, you know  top end of the primary school. Oh it sounds good! But you co could go on, I mean if you if they don't know it you can still use it when they get to secondary school. What computer is that then? Oh it's er, it's erm B B C  or  It's a Tandy actually , it's one I had  Yeah. given me  about eight  Right. years ago. So, and it's an old one actually Oh! but I've put, put my own program so that the  Ah! That's a good idea! But how old is your He's nearly ten. Yeah. Nearly ten. But he has,we we've only got, my husband's got a computer at work, we just got one of the Segas, the master systems you know that you you got th the games that you put in those  but he wants to get another one next year  but that's a good idea something like that! Should be very good for schools I would think, wouldn't it? Well, yes of course, I mean I, the schools have got programs I mean you can, you know  they er  Yeah. Yeah. Da ta for it. Yes. But that's, I think that's a brilliant idea actually! Because where he goes is a smaller school where they go  and erm  I think something like that is nice for them to actually   Where does he go? He goes to a school in the Tene Valley, it's a teacher that, he used to go to Exeter school and the teacher's opened her own school  and, only for lo a small time and then she's opening up actually in Exeter but this is an in between and she's a very good teacher! That's great, you see! And you see she's bringing him on very well! Yeah. I mean there's only a few kids there, they're all good mates and it's like private tuition. But, I  That's right. mean you pay for it, course you do but then  That's right. on the ar , we well you know we've paid for his education since he was seven because he wasn't doing anything at primary school! Half the teachers le left them doing nothing! It's a shame really! Yeah! Yeah! But er  you know, and it would have been such a waste cos he's bright. But that he was always naughty! They used to write back and they said he was always being sent out and I said that's because he's bored! He couldn't be bothered  you see. And how many more children slip through the net that way? That's right. It's very true. An and so we we said right, that's it! We'll have to get him out and  pay for it and it's  worked total dividends! I mean he's very good at  maths. They say maths and science are his strength subjects well I'd never have known that if he was still over there! I was just told he was a  a fair average. You know? Erm can I have sixteen of those  there? How many darling? Sixteen. They're two each, you know that do you? Oh! I'll have  Yeah they're two each my love. Er, then I'll You can have ten can't you?

Yeah just an example, now when I come round and tap you, I want you to make your sound and will you keep on making that sound repeatedly until I clap like that and tell you to stop, okay, so if I tap you  go on  you make your sound and you carry on and on and on, I'm gonna keep on taping different people's make their sound and then we're gonna see what it feels like you're in hospital, okay, now it doesn't matter if somebody's got the same sound as somebody else, it's no big deal, alright, because eventually they'll all blend into each other, but as soon as I've tapped you, make your sound, alright    patients, come on where's the machines?okay, stop, now when did it start becoming out of hand?, at one stage we didn't really know where we were to, once, once I  say ten people, okay, and that was also due to the fact that we had perhaps too many erm patients moaning, alright, it was good in one respect because why, it made obvious that we were in a, a hospital well something like , but erm when you're in smaller groups and you're making your sound machines, obviously it's much easier to  to control and to make the overall sound more realistic, don't you think?, so, mm, what we're going to do is we're going to get into different groups, into groups of four, five, no big deal, you're welcome to only if you want to, and, you're going to, each group is going to choose er a profession, okay, you can be brick layers, you can be er musicians, er you can be er gardener, I mean absolutely you can be factory workers, you can be absolutely anything, and what you're going to do is you're going to choose, each person will choose a sound which is represented of that particular person, er profession, okay, and you'll going to make your sounds simultaneously so that as for the audience who are simply listening to you can just close our eyes cos we won't, you won't be acting you'll be making these sounds and using, we'll close our eyes and we'll know exactly where we are, okay, and then after that once we've done that just, before you choose your profession to know what this is going to lead onto, after that we're going to put movements to that profession, so when, if you were in a factory going er putting bottles on, on top top of bottles, you would have the movements going and you would have the sound going and I want you to build up, up, the sound machine which becomes the movement machine as well , so you're almost robotic so you, shh, shh, or whatever, however your sound, and each person does their thing in the factory or where ever they are and we will be able to see from listening and looking at the movements and obviously remember just because you're not an example it doesn't mean you can't talk, there might be for instance there would be a doctor going stand back, stand back, you know, er, in, in the  you can use voices, but also obviously very, very effective to have sound voices, shh, shh, to create that part of it, have instruments, but this is how they actually started lay down sound tracks for movies, people specialize  that it came to make the amazing sounds, okay, and then after that, er, this is another thing it leads to is there's going to be a break down in your sound machine, okay, there's gonna be a break down in your, in your entire robotic machine, movement in our machine, and that break down could be due to some of the workers going off and getting  some of them erm you know, one, er part of the machine breaking down on the whole, sound changes, the movement changes and we're going to watch how this robotic machine changes as it breaks down, it could be sound shut down it could be it could be anything you choose, but I want it anyway, leave it to you so all you do is choose a profession, think of something that is, comes to life to you, in movement and in sound, okay, so let's get into groups of, see how many they are, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, eighteen, nineteen, twenty, okay let's get into groups of four then, okay  is that right, one, two, three, four, one, oh five, four, five, just get your group into a work in, I thank you if you don't get  Vanessa  into groups yourself I'll put you in groups  come on into your groups please come on then quickly  er can I see people not working properly? miss we've only got three you've got three  what you got, can you work in your three? yes, we can okay, would you like to have one more? we can work in the three you'd like to work in the three?one more just simply because it's, it gives you more sound impulse okay is it going to be difficult to get one of them  I don't know cos there're all together yes, okay, you three go and make your sound, means that you have  okay  each one of you have to be louder and also it also means that you can make, one person can make more than one sound, okay, work it like, just you can substitute for the other two"
FIC FIC-BMW-001 -0.12 "CHAPTER ONE Tom O'Neill came through the revolving doors on a blast of icy air and stepped out on the other side into a blanket of almost oppressive warmth. Outside London might be shivering in the biting cold of a January morning, here in the foyer of the British and Cosmopolitan Insurance building centrally heated air oozed steadily from a series of concealed vents to waft summer warmth into every corner. Tom unbuttoned his overcoat, fished in the pocket of the dark suit which he scathingly referred to as his ‘city uniform’ for his identity card and flashed it at the uniformed security man. He did not like wearing suits and he liked a collar and tie even less. He was far more at home in jeans and a sweater or the favourite scuffed old flying jacket he had inherited from his father, who had been a Spitfire pilot in the war and he wore them whenever he could. Occasionally his job as a private insurance investigator allowed him this privilege but there were occasions which called for him to dress more formally. Visiting the Head Office of one of the companies that used his services in response to an urgent summons was one of them. Without waiting for his nod and wave Tom strode past the security man to the block of six lifts beyond him. One had just arrived at ground floor level; Tom followed two girl clerks into it and pressed the button for the fifteenth floor. He felt rather than saw the two girls glance at him appraisingly but took no notice. At just over six foot, with thick curling brown hair and eyes that owed their startling blueness to his Irish ancestry, Tom was used to being the object of female appreciation whilst being slightly puzzled by it. He had never thought the reflection which looked back at him each morning from the shaving mirror was particularly handsome. His nose was too large and a little crooked since taking a devastating straight left in the boxing ring when he was fifteen years old, his chin too irregular. But women certainly seemed to like it and that of course had its compensations. Tom had not reached the ripe old age of twenty-nine without discovering quite a few of them. The lift halted at the twelfth floor for the girls to get out, then whispered on towards the fifteenth. When the doors opened again  Tom emerged into a corridor, thickly carpeted in grey. Like the twelfth floor, glimpsed through the lift doors when the girls had got out, the walls were covered with a pale lemon wash, unlike the twelfth they were hung with pictures, not Old Masters but not Boots the chemists either — prints of hunting scenes and ships and a beautiful soft sunset over a bay that might have been St Ives — pictures deemed suitable for the Executive floor of a great international company. Tom passed them by without a glance, heading for the door at the very end of the corridor. He knocked briskly and without waiting for a bidding went in. The secretary seated behind the desk in the outer office looked up accusingly, then her features softened and a faint pink flush coloured her cheeks. ‘Tom!’ ‘Morning, Lucy. I understand the Great White Chief wants to see me.’ ‘That's right, he does. I'll buzz him.’ She depressed the button. ‘Mr O'Neill is here, Mr Swansborough.’ She glanced up at Tom, a little regretfully. ‘He says to go straight in, Tom.’ Tom nodded. ‘Thanks.’ Watching him disappear into the inner sanctum, Lucy sighed. Why was it the gorgeous ones passed through so fleetingly while others, like that paunchy, moist-palmed Vic Tatum from Marine Claims always managed to delay in her office, ogling, leering and making suggestive remarks that she could probably take to a Sexual Harassment Tribunal if she had a mind to! ‘Come in, Tom, come in!’ Roger Swansborough half rose from his executive chair holding out his hand in greeting. He was a big bluff man with a receding hairline and aggressively triple chin which somehow managed to make him look powerful but not fat — like a back row rugby player, Tom thought. He had already removed his jacket in the cloying warmth of the office but his white shirt was immaculate and as he reached across the desk Tom caught the gleam of gold cufflinks against the stiff white cuffs. ‘I had a message that you wanted to see me urgently,’ Tom said. ‘That's right. Take your coat off, Tom, do. This place gets hotter every day. I'd open a window but…’ He gesticulated towards the expanse of glass that surrounded the office on two sides. Beyond it the sky was lowering grey, shrouding the roofs of the buildings and filtering cold dull half-light onto the streets and the distant river. From up here on the fifteenth floor the view was a panoramic one — unfortunately this morning it was also infinitely depressing. Tom did as he was bid, hanging his coat on the heavy carved stand behind the door. ‘What's going on then, Roger? Who's trying to swindle you this time?’ he asked smiling wryly — his job had made him cynical. The older man grimaced. ‘Not trying to swindle us, Tom. This time it's a fait accompli — a bloody great sting to make your eyes water. Take a look at that.’ A copy of the morning paper was lying on his tooled leather desk top; he pushed it across to Tom, stabbing at the story with a manicured index finger. ‘You remember the Martin business? No, you wouldn't, of course. It happened twenty years ago, when you were still in short trousers. A luxury cabin cruiser blew up off the coast of Italy. There were two people aboard — Greg Martin, the owner, a financier with a finger in more pies than you'd care to name, and a woman, Paula Varna, wife of Hugo Varna the fashion designer. The boat was blown to glory, nothing was ever found of it except for a few bits of debris, and to all intents and purposes both occupants were blown to glory with it.’ ‘British and Cosmopolitan were the insurers, I presume.’ ‘Too right. Not only the boat but the lives of both Martin and Paula Varna — not peanut policies either of them as you can imagine. She had been a top model — her legs alone were insured for a five figure sum and he had enough hanging on him to bankrupt a smaller company. No, 1970 was not a good year for British and Cosmopolitan what with one thing and the other. But that's our business, taking risks, and it works well enough — as long as everyone plays by the rules.’ ‘And this time someone didn't?’ Tom asked. He was trying to read the newspaper upside down without much success. Roger Swansborough's hand balled into a fist and he brought it slamming down onto the desk top so that loose paperclips jumped in the big crystal ashtray. ‘Too right they didn't. We paid out on the life of Greg Martin — and it seems the bastard wasn't dead at all but living a life of luxury in Australia.’ Tom whistled softly. ‘For twenty years? Are you sure it's him?’ ‘It's him all right. He's been living in Sydney under an assumed  name — Michael Trafford — with an Italian heiress named Maria Vincenti. He was part Italian himself, of course— I understand his name was Martino originally until he decided to drop the ‘o’ and Americanise it to Martin. But he was an American citizen, born in the States as far as I can make out.’ ‘So why was he insured with the British and Cosmopolitan?’ Tom asked. Swansborough shrugged. ‘You tell me. I dare say the slippery bastard had a good reason. He left a fair old mess behind him, by the way, when he disappeared. He'd been sailing close to the wind for years and everything was just about to blow up in his face.’ Tom reached for the newspaper, turning it towards him. He scanned the print, seeing that it echoed more or less exactly the story Swansborough had just told him, then turned his attention to the photograph alongside — three people, obviously dressed for leisure. A thin-faced man, balding, in a shirt open at the neck to reveal gold chains, a woman, obviously beautiful in spite of the quality of the photograph, with her hair tied under a scarf Princess Grace style, and another man with a look of the Mediterranean about him whose face was partially obscured by sunglasses. ‘That's Greg Martin?’ Tom asked, pointing to the third figure. ‘Yes. With Hugo Varna and Paula — on another trip which presumably did not end in disaster,’ Swansborough said drily. ‘They were quite a part of the international scene in those days from what I can make out. Since he's made his fortune Varna has become something of a recluse, of course. In fact there are those who claim he never got over his wife's death, in spite of the fact that he married again — Paula's younger sister, Sally, as a matter of fact.’ ‘Hmm.’ Tom studied the photograph. ‘Well, quite obviously Mrs Varna was a real stunner. And she was alone on the boat with Martin when the accident happened. Something going on there, was there?’ ‘Varna insisted not at the time. Said his wife had been in need of a holiday and he had been unable to get away. Martin was a close friend of the family as well as his business partner and Varna had been happy for her to go with him. But you can draw your own conclusions. She was English, by the way, which could explain why they chose to insure with us.’ ‘A doubtful honour, the way things turned out,’ Tom said drily. ‘So — British and Cosmopolitan was taken for a small fortune — and  taken for fools too by the seem of it. How the hell did it happen? The accident was investigated at the time, you say?’ ‘Of course it was — and damned thoroughly too as you can see.’ Swansborough tapped the file in front of him and Tom saw the thick wad of papers which protruded from it. ‘But there was nothing we could get our teeth into. The boat had gone, not a doubt of it. Fishermen reported hearing the explosion and bits of debris were washed up for months afterwards. There appeared to be no survivors and there were plenty of witnesses to swear both Greg Martin and Paula Varna were on board when the yacht sailed — Martin was well known at the marina where he kept her and Paula was a highly visible character.’ He smiled thinly. ‘The papers treated it all as a great tragedy as you'll see when you look at them. Financier and former model die in mystery explosion was the headline at the time — and the emphasis of course was on the ‘former model’. Beautiful woman, internationally known, wife of talented fashion designer — it was heaven-sent copy, especially for the more sensational press. And she was a mother too — she and Varna had a child — a little girl who was about four at the time. You can imagine the story it made.’ Tom nodded. ‘I certainly can. So it wouldn't have just been insurance investigators ferreting about — it would have been the world's press as well. But in spite of the way it looked Martin had faked his own death — and done it damned successfully. And what about the woman — Paula Varna? Did British and Cosmopolitan also fork out a small fortune to her family to which they were not entitled? Her family were the beneficiaries, I suppose. Did she die — or is she, too, still living somewhere under an assumed name?’ Swansborough closed the file with a snap and pushed it across the desk. ‘That, Tom is what I want you to find out.’ In a corner of the Salon Imperial of the Hotel Intercontinental, Paris, Harriet Varna braced her back against a statuesque pillar and looked steadily into the viewfinder of her camera, concentrating on her subjects so fiercely that she was almost oblivious to the electric atmosphere that surrounded her, bouncing off the Viennese décor and the sumptuous rococo ceiling along with the heat and the light as the models of the House of Saint Laurent moved gracefully along the hundred yards of catwalk to display the new season's couture collection. Only the constant clicking of the camera shutters of the army of photographers and the intermittent bursts of rapturous applause broke the expectant hush that January afternoon, for Yves Saint Laurent is one of the few important couturiers to show in the old manner, with no mood-setting background music. In the late sixties he had declared ‘Couture is dead!’ and concentrated instead on off-the-peg designer wear, but twenty years later his revival had been both stunning and nostalgic and the long-term wealthy and the nouveau riche had come flocking, craving the glamour and excitement, and seeking the prestige that comes from owning a couture gown, specially, individually theirs after hours of masochistic fittings. Now they sat eagerly on the rows of brittle gilt chairs with red velvet seats, their exquisitely made-up faces carefully devoid of expression as they made brief notes on their programmes, pretending not to notice that sometimes the clicking cameras were directed not at the catwalk models, all of whom had already done a photo-call session for the photographers the previous day, but at them — the society women of America and the international circuit, the bored charity conscious wives of big businessmen, the famed actresses of stage and screen, even the occasional European princess. The actresses, of course, were frequently loaned gowns by the house free of charge for the publicity that would be gained when they were pictured wearing them, and there were those among the society women who considered themselves above coming to the couture, ordering instead from the videos that nowadays replaced the weeks of shows of the old days — and staying away all the more determinedly as the great Paris houses vied with one another to tempt them to lend their presence to the occasion. But there were plenty of beautiful and recognisable faces to be seen amongst the anonymous, but none-the-less powerful, fashion editors, still enough buying power in this room alone to rock empires, even if no house made a profit from the couture but rather used it for a loss-leading advertisement and a mark of prestige. It was at none of these that Harriet's camera was trained, however. Instead her zoom lens was pointed at the rear of the salon where the apprentices and publicity girls stood in small, highly-strung huddles, watching the gowns they had worked on and publicised pass by on the catwalk and leading the explosions of rapturous applause. There was one girl in particular who interested Harriet, a small girl with hair cut gamin short, whose face was so expressive that it seemed to reflect every one of the emotions that they were all feeling, these midinettes who had basted hemlines and stitched hooks and eyes into place, positioned trimmings and sewed them into place with such tiny stitches that they were all but invisible to the naked eye. Harriet hardly dared blink as she watched her through the viewfinder, terrified she might miss the moment she was waiting for. Then, as a daring but romantic gown of navy blue silk crepe made its appearance, the moment came. The girl's face came alive, eyes sparkling, hands raised to her parted lips in an expression halfway between exultation and tears of joy, before she began to clap furiously. Swiftly Harriet depressed the button again and again. Perfect — perfect! That was what she had been waiting for, that unguarded, unforced, totally natural reaction of a lowly apprentice who sees her work unfold like a fairytale. In a world where so much was staged artificially it was like a breath of fresh air and Harriet experienced her very own glow of excitement and triumph. For a minute or two longer she panned the camera, too much the professional to allow her pleasure to make her risk missing another good shot. But instinctively she knew she had what she wanted — the frames that would lend just the breadth and depth she needed to complete her picture story of the couture shows, and she let her camera fall back on its strap around her neck, rubbing her aching eyes and running her fingers up under the thick fringe of dark blonde hair that barely skimmed them. Still the mannequins were appearing, their elongated clothes-horse frames moving with a grace which belied their tight-drawn nerves, still the bursts of applause rang out to drown the persistent clicking of the cameras, but Harriet leaned back against her pillar almost oblivious to them. The clothes, beautiful as they were, interested her not at all. She had grown up amongst beautiful clothes, been dressed from childhood in designer fashion, been made to stand still for fittings for her graduation dress and her first ball gown, and hated every moment of it. Clothes were all very well, they were her father's life and she knew that all the privileges she enjoyed were hers because of clothes and the stupendous success they had brought him, but she couldn't care about them. Except when they made wonderful pictures. Pictures were what mattered. And in her camera was a reel of beauties. Harriet glanced around, wondering if she could slip out unnoticed. It was heresy, of course, but the show was likely to last another hour at least — Saint Laurent was famous for the length of his shows — and afterwards there was bound to be the most fearful crush. Harriet hesitated, then her natural impatience won the day and she slipped quietly towards the exit. All eyes were on the catwalk and no one appeared to notice her, apart from a tall, grey-haired woman in the uniform of an atelier who moved towards her accusingly. Instantly Harriet pressed her hand across her mouth in a theatrical gesture. ‘I'm not feeling well’, she whispered in somewhat imperfect French, and the woman moved hastily out of her way. Photographers —cochons ! she was thinking in disgust. The girl had probably had too much wine to drink with her lunch. As she emerged into the Rue Castiglione the cold hit Harriet like a slap in the face and she lifted her camera, easing the zipper of her sky-blue ski jacket right up under her chin and turning the collar up around her ears. Some of her hair caught inside it and she flicked it out, a careless fall of dark blonde that framed her even-featured face. ‘You should go to a good stylist once in a while and have that mane tamed!’ Sally, her father's wife, had advised her on more than one occasion, but Harriet had as little time for stylists as she had for clothes — and besides, she rather liked her hair just as it was. This way she could simply wash it each morning and let it dry naturally — start trying for styles and valuable minutes had to be wasted keeping them the way they were meant to be. I must find a telephone, Harriet thought, as she hurried, head bent against the biting wind, along the Paris street. I can't wait to tell Nick I've got his job in the bag. Then I'll decide whether to post him the last reels of film in a Jiffy bag or fly back to London with them myself. The thought gave her another fillip of excitement — her first job for Focus Now , the new picture magazine Nick was editing — and it was a corker, she knew it in her bones. Already she could visualise the lay-out —‘The Other Side of Fashion’ she'd entitled it in her mind's eye when she'd discussed it with Nick. And as he had said, no-one was in a better position to do a photo story like that than she was. ‘All the fashion magazines and the women's pages of the newspapers do straight fashion stories,’ he'd said, tugging thoughtfully at the little gingery beard that sprouted from his angular chin. ‘I want something different. And let's face it,Focus Now is going to be different.’ She'd nodded. She'd known Nick for years, meeting him when she'd come to London to visit her cousin Mark Bristow, Sally's son. She had just started out on her career as a free-lance photographer, with nothing but a little talent, a lot of determination and the best camera money could buy to help her make it. He had been a sub-editor in those days, working for a huge magazine corporation, and they had struck up an instant rapport, and when he was made first assistant editor and then editor, always moving from magazine to magazine, he had pushed work her way whenever he could. They had even had an on-off affair and Harriet suspected he was in love with her. But she couldn't take him seriously. She couldn't take any man seriously — or at least not one she'd yet met. ‘I think you use me, Harriet,’ he had said once, mock-serious. ‘Well of course I do!’ she had teased. ‘Isn't that what friends are for?’ ‘Friends!’ he'd echoed, his soft Scottish burr making it sound almost mournful, and Harriet had experienced a moment's sharp guilt. But whatever his shortcomings as a prospective lover, Nick was good at his job — very good — and his talent and hard work had been rewarded when Paul Leeman, the publishing tycoon, had decided to launch the new magazine,Focus Now . Nick had landed the job of editor and when he had told Harriet about it his enthusiasm had been infectious. ‘You remember Picture Post, Harriet? No, probably you don't. You're too young. You weren't even born when it folded — and besides it was an English magazine.’ ‘But I know about it of course,’ she'd protested. ‘My mother was English, remember, and it was a classic, wasn't it? What photographer hasn't heard of Picture Post — though I suppose the American in me world argue that all those magazines were imitators of Life .’ ‘Right. Well, Paul believes the time is right to launch a new mag on the same lines. Stories told in pictures — less copy than the Sunday supplements, more slanted to letting the photographs tell the story. And perhaps with a social angle, too. But whatever, it's got to be different , a totally fresh way of looking at things. That's where you come in.’ ‘It sounds exciting. But more like photo journalism than just taking pictures. You think I could handle it?’ In spite of her apparent self-confidence, in spite of her twenty-five years, in spite of having had  the best that money could buy since she was a little girl, there was an ingenuousness about Harriet which sprung from a yearning need to prove herself — to her father, to her contemporaries, to the whole wide world. Sometimes being born with every apparent advantage in life spawns the deepest need to create something just by oneself, to say: ‘This wasn't handed to me on a plate, but I did it just the same!’ ‘I know you can do it’, Nick had said. ‘You're a bloody good photographer and the work you've been doing for the last five years proves it. All you need is the opportunity to really express yourself — and Focus Now can give you that. I'm sure you'll come up with all kinds of ideas of your own, but for starters why don't you do something you know really well — the world of fashion.’ ‘Fashion!’ Her tone had been scathing. ‘Rich women with closets full of clothes they'll never get around to wearing. Fashion — one silly brainless bitch trying to outdo the others because she's bored out of her tiny mind and isn't interested in anything other than the way she looks.’ ‘Don't knock it,’ Nick said seriously. ‘You know as well as I do it's a damned great industry — and there are plenty of facets to it that never see the light of day. Find some of them, Harriet, mix them in with the glamour — and see what you get. More than enough for just one feature, I'll be bound. Enough for a whole series, probably. But start with Paris. After all, to most people Paris is still the centre, the sun around which all the other satellites revolve.’ ‘Well I sure as hell would hate to do Seventh Avenue,’ she said with feeling. ‘So — don't — or at least, not at first . What about the sweatshops of Korea, or the rich Kuwaiti women who buy merely for their own pleasure and hide their couture gowns under their abayas because they are not allowed to display themselves…it's a far cry from the fashion world as it is usually depicted, it could make fascinating copy. Get out there and find it for me!’ And so she had. She'd done the photo session of couture gowns as well, of course , clicking away dutifully with those other photographers who were being dictated to by their fashion editors. But it was the unexpected shots that would provide the spice to the story — like the ones she had just made of the little midinette enthusing as she saw the dress she'd sweated blood for, if not created, come down the catwalk to the roar of applause. Harriet pushed back the cuff of her ski jacket and glanced at her  watch — the clear faced leather-strapped Patek Philippe man's watch that she always wore in preference to the elegant Cartier her father had given her, unless of course circumstances forced her into an evening gown. Perhaps, she decided, she would go back to her hotel and phone Nick from there. Then she'd call the airport, enquire about flights and take the pictures to London herself. She'd like to be on hand the moment they came out of the dark room. And it would be nice to see Nick again too. She raised her hand to hail a cab but the Paris traffic was zooming by at its usual break-neck pace. Then she spotted a public telephone and decided she could not wait another minute to call Nick and tell him the job was completed. She dived towards it, anxious some other would-be caller should not beat her to it and begin on one of those endless conversations the French seemed to have, searching through her pockets for change and trying to recall the International dialling code and the number of the line which connected direct with Nick's office, bypassing the busy switchboard, all at the same time. ‘You have never got out of the childish habit of trying to do several things at once,’ Sally had said to her once; Sally, so cool, so contained, so efficient she sometimes made Harriet feel as if she were still a child, though of course she would never admit it. At the second attempt she made the connection and heard the telephone begin to ring at the other end. Then Nick's voice, that soft unmistakable Scottish burr. ‘Hello? Nick Holmes.’ ‘Nick — it's me, Harriet. I've finished the job and I've got the most stupendous pictures. I'm just on my way back to the hotel and with luck I'll be able to get a flight tonight. I can be with you first thing in the morning — maybe even this evening, if you like.’ There was a slight awkward pause and in the tiny fraction of time that it lasted Harriet experienced a stab of pique. Nick was usually so keen to see her she had to fend him off. Now, just when she was bursting to talk to him about the job, he was going to be less than forthcoming. ‘Unless you've already got something lined up, of course,’ she said hastily. ‘No. And I'm very glad you've finished the job.’ What was that odd note in Nick's voice? It didn't sound in the least like him. ‘Me too. You were right — knowing the background to the industry was a tremendous help. Anyway…’ ‘Harriet — have you seen a newspaper today?’ he interrupted her. She laughed shortly. ‘You must be joking! I've been up to my eyes in mannequins and haute couture .’ ‘Well — I think you should.’ She frowned, feeling his discomfort with her pores as well as hearing it in his voice. ‘Why? Someone else hasn't done my story have they? Or, oh no! Paul hasn't decided to fold Focus Now before it's even off the ground, has he?’ ‘No — no — nothing like that.’ ‘Then what? Nick — my money is running out…’ She fumbled in her pocket for more change but before she could get in it into the coin slot she heard the click. ‘Nick?’ she said urgently but it was too late. The line was dead. She swore, banged down the receiver and stood staring at it. What the hell had he meant? Should she try and get him back again or buy a newspaper first and try to find out what in the world he had been talking about? A cloud of Gauloisesmoke wafted past her ear and she became aware of a man standing behind her, stamping his feet as he waited with barely concealed impatience for the telephone. His presence made up her mind for her and she turned, brushing past him and heading towards a newspaper vendor who sat shivering behind his stall at the nearby entrance to a Metro station. All the newspapers on the front of the stall were French and Harriet cursed herself for not being a better linguist. She had had every opportunity to be, for heaven's sake, but she'd never worked hard enough at it and now she did not feel like struggling with a foreign language to search for an item when she did not even know what she was looking for. But tucked away at the back of the stall were some English and American newspapers. Yesterday's? No, praise be, today's — the English ones, anyway. She pointed to one and pulled out her remaining change to pay for it. Then she retreated into the entrance to the Metro out of the biting wind and opened it. She saw the story at once. The photograph seemed to leap off the page to hit her. Daddy. Mom. And…that man… Unexpectedly Harriet began to tremble. ‘RETURNED FROM THE DEAD! FINANCIER FAXED HIS OWN DEATH, WOMAN ALLEGES.’ She inched back against the wall, part of her wanting to find some  private place, yet knowing she would not — could not — move from this spot until she had read what the paper had to say. As she finished her breathing was ragged, her eyes darting from the newsprint to stare unseeingly at the people pushing past her into the Metro and back to the newsprint again. In the street the traffic still roared past, a ceaseless thunder interspersed with the honking of horns, but she was no longer aware of it. Even the precious spools of film in the camera slung around her neck and tucked into the pockets of her jacket were forgotten. They might have belonged, all of them, to another world, another life. Greg Martin, her father's former partner, was alive. She hardly remembered him, of course. He was a shadowy figure from the past whose name was scarcely ever mentioned except on those rare occasions when they spoke of the accident, that terrible accident that had claimed the lives of him and her mother when Harriet was only four years old. As for the financial crisis they had gone through, of which she suspected Greg was the root cause, that was never spoken of at all. The whole episode had been so horrendous, so traumatic, that her father had chosen to wipe the board clean of it — on a superficial level, at least. Harriet pressed a hand to her mouth and closed her eyes. The street seemed to be full of perfume now, wafting around her in the biting wind — the perfume that was the most evocative memory she had of her mother, a haunting perfume, light and teasing and sweet, a perfume that smelled a little like a summer garden at dusk, a perfume, the memory of which had possessed the power to bring tears to her eyes long, long after she had forgotten how to conjure up the image of her mother's face. Mom — oh, Mom — why did you go away? She had cried it into her pillow at night, sobbing with the vain child's hope that tears would somehow magically make it all come right, that in the morning her mother would be there. But of course she never was. Her mother had died in an explosion on a luxury yacht, they had explained to her. Gradually she had come to terms with it, accepted it as a fact of life, though the grief had been longer in going and the sadness was still sometimes there, an echo in the night. But now… If Greg Martin was alive then was it possible…was there the chance that it was in any way possible that her mother was alive too? The enormity of it rocked her. For long minutes she stood there, her thoughts not so much running circles as buffeting chaotically. It made no sense — none — yet here in black and white was proof that nothing was the way it had seemed. For the first time in years Harriet was overwhelmed by a wave of homesickness, and not now for New York, but for the haven of her London flat, the bolt-hole she had made her very own. She folded the newspaper roughly, thrust it into her bag and walked zombie-like into the Metro. Get home as quickly as possible. Suddenly it was all that mattered. Get home. Then perhaps she could think things through and decide what to do. Sally Varna stepped out of her bath, reluctant to leave the froth of delicately scented bubbles, reached for one of the enormous pink towels the maid had laid out ready for her and wrapped herself in it. Then she padded across to a low stool and sat down, surveying herself in the mirror that lined her bathroom walls on two sides. The face that looked back at her was smooth, slightly flushed from the warmth of her bath, certainly not a face that looked its forty-six years. Even when made up with the finest cosmetics money could buy it would never be beautiful, but still…not bad for an ugly duckling, Sally thought, smiling wryly. She lifted one hand and pushed aside the fair, highlighted hair which skimmed her ears. Yes, the tiny tucks had almost gone now, just as the surgeon had promised they would. No-one need ever know she had had the facelift if she chose not to tell them. That was why it was so sensible to have it done early, before the little lines and pouches became obvious. And Sally had always prided herself on being sensible, if nothing else. Sensible Sally. Sally ‘the sensible one’. That was how she had been known as a child when people had contrasted her with her sister Paula. ‘Sally is very clever. She has such a good head on her shoulders,’ they had said, when what they really meant was that whilst Paula was a beauty, she was really very plain but they had to find something good to say about her. They had meant it kindly, she knew, but it had hurt all the same. She hadn't wanted to be sensible or clever. She had wanted to be beautiful like Paula, would have traded everything to be just a little like the sister whose stunning good looks had the power to attract and mesmerise wherever she went. But where Paula's hair had shone and bounced as if it had caught some of the morning's sunlight her own was straight and mouse coloured, where Paula's eyes were the clearest, sharpest green  hers were muddied to a very ordinary shade of hazel. Her features were similar yet somehow blunted, her body stockier — not fat yet somehow altogether larger so that beside Paula she always felt clumsy in spite of being a full four inches shorter and almost two years the younger. ‘Mummy, why don't I look like Paula?’ she had asked, staring wretchedly at her five-year-old reflection in the mirror, but her mother, herself slightly bemused by the young beauty she had produced, had been unable to give her any satisfactory answer. As the girls had grown older things had not improved. No matter how hard she tried to make the most of herself Sally had always been aware that she could not hope to rival Paula and the knowledge had damaged her self-confidence so that she always lived with the feeling that people on meeting her for the first time would exclaim behind after back: ‘Paula's sister? That plain little thing? Goodness me, she was in the back row when looks were handed out wasn't she!’ The fact that very few other girls she knew could hold a candle to Paula did not help much either. They didn't have to live with this goddess, they didn't have to compete with the legend. In spite of this, Sally had adored Paula. When other girls, jealous of her looks and the doors they opened for her, jealous especially of the way the boys flocked after her, made spiteful remarks, Sally had always been her fiercest champion. No one had wanted to believe that Paula's beauty went right through her more than Sally did for she was a shining golden idol as well as a sister and it had been a shock to Sally when she had at last been forced to concede, in private at least, that the other girls might have been right in the accusations they made. Sally stood up, letting the towel drop and shrugging on a silk wrap. It clung slightly to her still-damp skin and again she surveyed her image in the mirror, this time full-length. Years of dieting and exercise had banished that slight stodginess for ever; now her body looked lithe and firm, yet still blessed with more curves than Paula's had ever been, as much a denial of her years as her face. In some ways those days when she had lived in Paula's shadow seemed a very long time ago, in others they might have been just yesterday. She had never been able to equal her sister's matchless beauty, she knew, but at least she presented the world with a fair imitation of it. And she had everything she had ever dreamed of — more. This house on Central Park South, a ranch in Colorado, a home in Montego Bay, a  private jet at her disposal, the wherewithal to buy anything which took her fancy. Not bad for a girl who had grown up on a council estate. Most important of all, she was married to the man who had been Paula's husband. It was the final proof that perhaps, after all, she had not been as inferior to her sister as she had imagined. Only one shadow lay over Sally's life, a secret shadow that none of the luxuries she enjoyed could quite banish. For a moment it hovered over her thoughts then, with an ease born of long practice, she pushed it away and went into her dressing room. Tonight she and Hugo were dining with an important senator who generally included show business personalities among his guests and she had not yet decided what to wear. She crossed to one of the racks which lined the watered silk walls, her feet sinking into the deep cream carpet, and took out a black gown, holding it against her. The neck was high and round, the sleeves decorously straight to the wrists. But at the back the bodice was slit from collar to midriff and the skirt was daringly short. Worn with her Van Cleef diamond earbobs and bracelet it would look quite stunning. Yes, she thought she would wear the black — or perhaps the strawberry crushed velvet… The sound of someone entering her bedroom, which lay beyond the dressing room, made Sally turn, still holding the dress against her and frowning with annoyance. She had instructed the maids not to disturb her for she valued her privacy and having staff constantly on hand was one of the things she had found most difficult to become accustomed to. Very nice to be able to step out of used underwear and know it would be laundered and returned to its drawer pressed and scented, even better never to have to worry about clearing a table or washing up, but nevertheless there was something vaguely disconcerting about maids who went silently, sneakily about their duties under her very nose. ‘Who is it?’ she called a little sharply. The door to the dressing room opened and to her surprise she saw that it was Hugo. Her eyebrows, which she darkened artificially so that they no longer merged into her skin, lifted slightly. She had not expected him home for at least another hour. At this time of day he was usually still at his office in the 550 building on Seventh Avenue. ‘Hugo!’ she exclaimed. ‘What are you doing home so early?’ He came into the dressing room and closed the door, a middle-aged man of medium height wearing a grey suit with a white roll-neck  shirt. Then as he turned towards her the overhead lights that she had switched on to look through her dresses shone directly onto his face and she noticed how pale and drawn he looked, lines that were usually unnoticeable etched between nose and mouth, eyes almost feverishly bright. ‘Are you all right?’ she asked. ‘You're not ill?’ He did not answer, just stood there looking at her as if trying to make up his mind how to begin. ‘Hugo!’ She took an anxious step towards him. ‘Greg Martin is alive,’ he said. His words stopped her in her tracks. ‘What did you say?’ ‘Greg Martin is alive. He's been living in Australia. He didn't die on the Lorelei . The whole damned thing must have been a fake.’ ‘Oh my God,’ Sally said. ‘I know. I couldn't believe it either. But I've had the story checked out, Sally. There is no doubt it's true. I had to come home and tell you immediately. Because you realise what it means, don't you? If Greg is alive then the chances are Paula is alive too.’ ‘Oh my God,’ she said again. The room seemed to have gone dark, as if someone had turned off the lights, and she wondered if she might be going to faint. She stood frozen, still clutching the black dress against herself, looking at her husband and seeing only her world crumbling around her. She had always known this moment would come one day. Now it had arrived and still Sally knew she was no more prepared for it than she had ever been. It had begun to snow in London. The first great white flakes had melted on the pavements, now it was falling thicker and faster, building up on the window ledges and in the cricks and crannies, turning to slush on the roads as the traffic churned through it. In her small workroom on the top floor of a crumbling old warehouse in Whitechapel Theresa Arnold shivered and turned on another bar of her portable gas fire. She couldn't really afford it and when she needed a new cylinder it had to be humped up three flights of stairs, always a nuisance for which she had to enlist the help of one of her boyfriends, but when she got cold Theresa's fingers turned numb, white, bloodless lumps that no longer seemed to belong to her hands. Then she could not work properly and it was imperative she worked or her new collection would never be ready on time. Theresa rubbed her hands together to bring some life back into them and bent over the sheets of paper laid out on her work table, trying to forget the cold and concentrate on her designs. They had to be good — not just good but sensational — or she would let everyone down, all those who believed in her — her small workforce of pattern cutters and outworkers, the friends from art school who dropped in to lend their help and support, and most of all her mother, who had put her house up as collateral for the bank loan that had set her up and enabled her to get started. Theresa sighed, the cold depressing her and quenching her usual defiant optimism. How easy it had all seemed then — how exciting! When she had graduated from the School of Fashion she had sold her entire degree collection to Lady Jane, a small but exclusive West End boutique, who had greeted her designs with such enthusiasm that she had believed the world was her oyster and everything was about to happen for her. Riding on a high she had decided to set herself up as an independent designer. But it was all so much more difficult than she had ever imagined it would be. Perhaps, she thought it was because Mark had been there at the planning stage — Mark Bristow, the dynamic young advertising executive she had met and fallen in love with when she had been chasing jobs in the heart of Somerset; Mark who, in spite of being English, had lived long enough in the States to absorb — and give off — some of the typically American blend of enthusiasm and energy. He had encouraged and praised her, bullied her a little when she needed bullying, and given her the love and support that had made her feel, even in the darkest moments of self-doubt, that she could rise above all the problems and emerge triumphant. It was Mark who had persuaded her to approach the bank for a loan, Mark who had suggested her old friend Linda George, who had graduated in business studies at the same time that Theresa had finished her fashion degree, should join forces with her to organise the commercial side, Mark who had given her enough confidence in herself for her to allow her mother to put up her house as security — something Theresa had fought against even whilst realising there was no other way to secure the loan she needed. And above all it was Mark who had made her feel loved and special. ‘I am very proud of you, lady’, he had said and she had glowed with happiness and a secret bubbling excitement that came from believing she could conquer the world with her talent. But now Mark was no longer around. He had gone out of her life  suddenly and without explanation and try as she might Theresa simply could not get over losing him. Why — why — why? she had asked herself over and over again, why did it end that way? We were so close — weren't we? We were in love — weren't we? How could I have imagined something like that? But the answers never made sense and the fact remained, whatever she had chosen to believe Mark had simply walked out on her and not bothered to come back. She had begin to accept it now, but there was still a yearning deep inside her, his absence a constant nagging ache in her heart, and her business enterprise seemed to have been affected too, for it was as though some of her confidence had drained away, running down her cheeks with her tears. With Mark anything had seemed possible. Without him some of the magic had gone from her life and the dullness encroached into her work, no matter how she tried to compartmentalise it. Now the problems were paramount. A number of shops and boutiques had shown an interest in her clothes but she still had to produce them, innovative yet saleable, not too expensive for the market but of a good quality. In many ways it was a vicious circle — everything cost so much more if one couldn't produce in bulk, but to produce in bulk one needed capital — and plenty of outlets. And always she was haunted by the knowledge that if she failed her mother would lose her home. What she needed desperately, of course, was a backer — someone to put up enough money to make her financially secure while she created. But as yet no genie had materialised, no matter how hard she metaphorically rubbed the magic lamp. Linda was working on that one too. Let's hope she comes up with something pretty soon, Theresa thought. If she doesn't I don't know how much longer I can carry on. The sound of footsteps on the rickety staircase leading to her workroom made Theresa look up from her drawings, a small ray of hope that refused to be extinguished flickering to life. Somehow she could never hear disembodied footsteps on the stairs without wondering fleetingly if it might be Mark returning as unexpectedly as he had left. Then, a moment later the hope died as tall young man dressed in an aged reefer coat and brown leather cap appeared in the doorway. ‘Weasel! Hi!’ she said, smiling a greeting which she hoped concealed her disappointment. ‘What are you doing here?’ It was not a question requiring an answer — Weasel was a good friend from art school days and often dropped in unannounced. ‘Shit, it's cold in here, Terri,’ he said now, stamping his feet in their Doc Martens. His breath puffed out like white smoke. ‘You don't have to tell me that!’ she snorted. ‘Put the kettle on if you want a coffee.’ ‘Oh, I want a coffee, all right, and so do you — but not here. Come on, I'm taking you to that little café down the road — what's it called now?’ ‘Mario's — I think. It's always changing its name. But I can't stop to go out for coffee. I've got far too much to do. We can't all be gentlemen of leisure like you, living off the social.’ ‘Less cheek if you don't mind! One day someone will appreciate my sculptures, you'll see. In the meantime I intend to stay healthy enough to enjoy success when it comes and you'd be wise to do the ‘But I have to get these done.’ ‘You never will if you catch pneumonia. Come on, get your coat — or are you already wearing it? You're coming with me and I'm not taking no for an answer.’ ‘All right, stop bullying.’ Theresa reached for her thick knitted shawl and knotted it around her shoulders — as Weasel had observed, she was already wearing her jacket in an effort to keep warm. She turned off the gas fire — must save the Calor gas!— and the lights and followed him out onto the landing, locking the door behind her. ‘Things no better, I assume,’ Weasel said as they tramped down the stairs, deftly avoiding those treads which had rotted. ‘Fraid not.’ ‘Mind this patch, it's slippery,’ Weasel warned as he traversed a landing where snow had drifted in through a broken skylight. ‘I know, I know. I just wish they hadn't boarded up the windows. It makes the staircase so dark.’ Weasel reached the bottom and pushed open the door to street level. ‘What you need, Miss Top Designer 1991, is a decent place to work from.’ She grimaced. ‘What I need is a miracle.’ In the gutter a copy of the morning's newspaper lay discarded, snow and slush turning it to pulp and partially obscuring the headline FINANCIER RETURNS FROM THE DEAD. As he passed, Weasel gave the newspaper a kick with the toe of his Doc Martens. Theresa did not even see it."
FIC FIC-BPA-003 -0.2 "The C130 Hercules of RAF Transport Command, markings hurriedly painted out, stood near the end of the runway, its engines running up as a car swung in through the raised barrier, and past the RAF Regiment guard. It drove swiftly round the perimeter and pulled in behind the ‘plane, its ramp down, cavernous interior gaping wide. In the dimly-lit interior, Delaney could see crew members moving around, and the bulky outline of some  pieces of equipment, inflatable dinghy packs and harness. And some of those shadowy figures were men of his group. Three had come to G9 via the SAS. Two from the Marines equivalent, the Special Boat Service. Anderson was unique, brought in to fill two vital functions: the need for a medic, and the need to give G9 something special, some angle that would disguise its true nature, an extraordinary elite fighting group trained for any emergency. Each of them for their own private reason needed to live with death at their shoulder. Delaney had, since his young wife, Pam, who always worried stiff at his parachuting, had died underneath a juggernaut, with the son she would have given life to in one month's time. He stepped from the car and turned to slam the door. Connors nodded, his voice lost in the noise from the Hercules. ‘Good luck’ were the words his lips formed. But Delaney, fleetingly, as he slammed the door, saw something in Connors' eyes. Guilt? Had Connors told him everything? Or was he holding something back? The car gunned away. Delaney stood for a second looking after it. Then he shrugged, and made his way towards  the aircraft. The piercing whine of the C130's four Allison turbo props rose even higher, hurting his ears, the air stinking with the smell of burnt kerosene, the hot moist gases buffeting and pulling at his clothes. He ran up the ramp, the sergeant liftmaster activating the hydraulics even before he had set loot on it. Delaney stood, watching the hatch close up, with the last view of the car headlights turning away towards the main building and the control tower. As soon as the hull was sealed, the liftmaster spoke into his intercom. Immediately the engine noise grew even louder, drowning out the sound of Delaney's own voice as he shouted an acknowledgement to the sergeant and settled down in the nearest side seat, strapping himself in. The fuselage vibrated, the interior lights flickered and dimmed; and then with a lurch they began to roll, bumping and jarring on the sectional concrete. Half a minute later the airframe gave one final creak and his stomach fell away as the Hercules lifted off, whining into the night sky. It finally came home then to Delaney what they were about to do in several hours' time. The last occasion he had parachuted into the sea, at night, operationally, had been off South Georgia. As the floor levelled off the lights flickered and came up, the engine noise settling down to a steady background roar. Delaney unbuckled his webbing and stood up, picking his way forward past the life rafts racked ready for the drop. Up in the forward end, behind the bulkhead, sat the five other members of G9, already dressed in thick Navy issue pullovers and fatigues. Theodore Lawton, leader of the second stick of three, greeted Delaney matter-of-factly. ‘Good evening, John.’ Delaney shook Lawton by the hand, and nodded at the other faces, regarding them levelly. Eugene Forster had a quizzical smile playing around his mouth. Barry Silk was eager and expectant. Martin Grant, absolutely placid. Only Doctor Anderson looked grim, face drawn and pale. Delaney settled down beside Lawton. ‘All the equipment aboard? No hitches?’ Lawton nodded. He had been in radio contact with Delaney during the latter's journey down from the MOD to Brize Norton. They all  knew that it was a night drop into the ocean. Nothing more. He began to brief them. Silk looked disappointed and scratched away at his pock-marked face. ‘No sign of life, you say?’ Delaney shook his head, knowing that for Silk nothing alive meant nothing to kill. Eugene Forster lit a cheroot. ‘Our very own Marie Celeste, eh? Interesting.’ ‘It's a holding operation,’ Delaney summed up briskly, ‘more than anything. All we have to do is get in and establish a bridgehead, so to speak. The only one of us who might have their work cut out is Doctor Anderson — if we find a lot of casualties.’ All faces turned towards the doctor. Not for the first time Delaney looked into the eyes that were deep, infathomable pools of green, and at the copper-coloured hair falling around the high smooth cheek bones; at the small upturned nose and a mouth just large enough to hint at the animal sensuality lying dormant beneath the surface. Dormant? Now why had he thought of that? The doctor, when he had first seen her, had awakened a creature deep within him that he had thought would sleep for ever— until the day he died. Its movement had  left an ache in his heart. Maybe the anaesthetic that had numbed his natural instinct to a beautiful woman since Pam's death was wearing off. Delaney felt irritated. ‘There's one other thing,’ he said. ‘You all know the difficulties inherent in getting on board Titron. We have reason to believe an attempt has already been made, by the Russians. How successful they were we have no idea.’ Barry Silk perked up. ‘We take them out if they are aboard, right? No holds barred, and no shit about international diplomatic pressure?’ Delaney agreed. ‘No flack,’ he said and clapped his hands together, rubbing them in a warming motion. ‘There are several hours to go. We've got an in-flight refuelling schedule before the drop, so check your equipment. Then get some rest.’ Delaney tried to avoid looking at Doctor Nell Anderson as he went forward to the flight deck. But it was useless. He could not get over the fact that the only woman who had come through the near-impossible screening, then training, had not been some six foot Amazon with a face like Atilla the Hun — but a petite, feminine five foot three in her stockinged feet, who turned all the men's  head when she passed. A distinct advantage. And the enigma did not end there. Why, he kept asking himself, did a woman, trained in the art of healing, who had been a naval medical officer and not somebody's wife, suddenly volunteer for something that was inevitably going to be highly dangerous — and almost certainly involve her in killing — at close quarters? Her records were, of course, put at his disposal. They were alarmingly sparse. Born in London of an Irish mother and a Scottish father, she had been educated at a convent school in North London. From there she had entered University College Hospital, emerging seven years later with her medical qualifications. After appointments in community service, she had joined the Navy. All straight forward. The only thing that was to him suspicious, was apart from the normality of liaisons at the hospital, there was no mention of a man in her life. And judging from his own reactions he knew that was impossible. But she put up a barrier around her, and allowed no one to pass. When she'd been selected, and automatically compelled to leave the Navy, taking an appointment at a civilian hospital, he'd told himself  that it was his duty to visit her to see that she was settled in…not lonely. But it had come to nothing, and in the process he had recognised the truth behind his motives. That he was attracted to her. Delaney spent some twenty minutes with the captain and crew in the red-lit cockpit with its enormous banks of dials, before passing back to change out of his suit and to check his own equipment. Forster and Grant were asleep. Lawton was reading Blake by the light of a spot lamp. Silk was cleaning his Uzi folding stock 9 mm machine-gun — the group's favourite close quarter weapon, other than the knife. Doctor Anderson was tying her hair back, pinning it tightly to her head. The toilet of the female, Delaney mused. And a species deadlier than the male. Nell Anderson glanced up as Delaney came past, making his way to the pre-loaded freight pallets, the liftmaster, and his kit. Very thorough, she mused. For John Delaney checked everything. Nell finished tightly tucking in the last strand of hair, and pulled on a black woollen balaclava before snuggling down into her sleeping bag, turning her face to the fuselage wall. Unlike the others, sleep did not come easily to her before a job. They had had longer to become philosophical. More fatalistic. Sleep didn't come easily when she was at home, or rather in the room at the hospital. And before that a succession of rooms. Home? She'd never known a true home. Not that her father and mother had divorced. They had just simply and totally fallen out of love with each other, and like the devout Catholics they were, carried on as a pretence. So she had grown up in a cold, almost emotionally empty vacuum. If only they had fought, screamed at one another, gone their separate ways, even had lovers…anything but the sterility of it all, a sterility that had finally been injected into everything they touched. Nell laid her cheek on her hands, held together as if in prayer, forming a pillow. At school, compensating, she had worked and worked and worked, so much so that she had finally made the two A's and a B necessary for medicine in her A levels. It was to be the key. The way out. And then in the clinical years, the disillusion, the suffering, the unfairness, the dying, the inevitability of it all. Growing old, the process of decay had eroded into her one reaming confidence. Her youth. Now, Nell could not conceive of love between a man and a woman, could not bear the thought of ageing. Trapped in her own loneliness, suicide had begun to dominate her thoughts. As a doctor it would have been so easy, and that very easiness, not her by now nominal Catholicism, had held her back, temporarily, from what she knew would be inevitable one day…before she was forty. She could imagine the coroner's disinterested voice. ‘…overdose while in a depressed state…balance of mind disturbed.’ Then, while a Navy surgeon lieutenant — she liked the sport and a contract that would last nicely into her forties — had come the memoranda. With its hints of dangerous work and high selectivity it had seemed like nature's way. The survival of the fittest. Except that she would notsurvive. Trained as they were, the psychiatrists on the screening tests had failed to scratch the surface of her most secret place; had failed to detect the urge to self-destruction which would automatically bar her from G9, as it did in the SAS and SBS. In the steady, stupefying roar of the Hercules, she drifted into an area that was not sleep, yet not awake, a sort of limbo where  she could direct her thoughts — as in a dream. Sex? She was not afraid of it. She had slept with three men in her life. It had nothing to do with giving herself. John Delaney's face came into the dream. His interest in her had been obvious, and because of that she had discouraged it. Somehow he made her feel uneasy. There was something about Delaney, something indefinable, that worried her. His almost too handsome face, for her taste, that is, was saved by the warmth of his eyes, though at times they could become frightening. Then they were hard, cold, merciless windows into an inner world of violence. Instinctively she had sensed that Delaney would demand more of her than a passing gratification. She sensed that he needed more, and this was something that she could not give…the secret places of her mind. Satisfied, Barry Silk laid the last item of his equipment lovingly down, almost as if for a kit inspection. He checked his watch. Another three hours. He lay back, resting his head on his hands that were clasped behind him, closing his eyes even though he did not feel like sleep. He was making sure they were not exposed  to any form of light source, however muted. When he worked at night he prepared properly, never allowing his vision to become impaired in any way. It could mean the difference between life — or death. He smiled contentedly. Lawton turned the page of his pocket edition of Blake. When the stars threw down their spears And water'd heaven with their tears Did he smile his work to see? Did he who made the lamb make thee? Tyger! Tyger! burning bright In the forests of the night, What immortal hand or eye, Dare frame thy fearful symmetry. It was one of his favourites from The Songs of Experience. He closed the book and slipped it into a polythene bag. Even now he didn't fully know what was meant by the line the stars threw down their spears. And it didn't help him to know the scholars found it equally obscure. The forest of the nightalways made him shiver — the association with nameless terrors peering at him through the jungle of a Rousseau painting on his childhood wall. Blake had meant the associated darkness to be the haunts of man's errors. The nightmare side of his intellect. He tucked the polythene bag into the waterproofed ammunition pouch. His gut was beginning to play him up. Careful not to wake the others, he made his way for the third time to the lavatory. Lawton smiled. They never had bowel trouble in the movies. As he sat in a roaring solitary splendour twenty thousand feet over the turbulent, endless ocean wastes, he had no idea of the appropriateness of the poem he had just read. Forster dreamed of a beautiful, sophisticated woman. Dressed in a plain blue silk suit, seamed stockings and high heels, she sipped her champagne, red lips peeking just below the rim of the net coming from a dainty little hat. Haughty, cold, and ignoring him, she could not disguise the hunger in the large brown eyes behind the net. They found his. Mysteriously they were alone now, all the other people in the room had gone, with the  breeze gently swirling the curtains of the French windows leading out on to the terrace. Slowly he put down his glass and moved towards her. Defiantly her chin came up, challenging him, warning that he was beneath her dignity; that if he tried to hiss her she would… He didn't kiss her. His hand went out and cupped her breast crudely. Her eyes blazed with shock, and… The ‘plane bumped, rolling Forster roughly to one side, catapulting him into the bleakness of reality. The ‘plane rolled and shuddered again. Forster hauled himself to his feet, clinging to the sides and overhead rails for support as he picked his way over to Delaney. Seat belt signs were flashing everywhere. ‘What's this, then? I thought you said the weather report indicated gale conditions after dawn.’ Delaney nodded. ‘They did,’ he affirmed. ‘I'm going to check with the pilot. Get everybody ready. We're less than forty minutes out now.’ As he entered the cockpit, the pilot looked worriedly over his shoulder. ‘Bad turbulence. We seem to have run right into it.’ Delaney settled on to his haunches between the two seats, and hung on grimly. ‘What is it like at the DZ?’ The pilot shook his head. ‘Can't be good. I take it you'll want to call the Big House?’ ‘The MOD communications centre? Yes.’ Tight-lipped, Delaney nodded, and moved over to the radio desk. The operator's face was screwed up in concentration, one hand clamped to his left ear plug as he manipulated the dials of the set. ‘We're getting a lot of interference,’ he said. ‘They're barely audible.’ Delaney patiently waited while the operator re-established the link. Then he spoke into a reserve speaker, using the designated call for the operation. His ears were filled with a great roaring, a voice only just discernible, but unintelligible, in its midst. He tried several times. But it was useless. Finally, the operator pulled out a small metal box from a rack underneath his desk, deftly flipped back the lid and plugged in the connection. ‘Nothing for it but to try this.’ He began tapping out his identification in morse code. It took five minutes to establish the link, and for the operator to get out Delaney's short message requesting an abort due to extreme winds in the drop zone. The signal was acknowledged and they were advised to hold. Delaney steadied himself as the ‘plane lurched. The pilot glanced back at him. ‘They can't let you go down in this,’ he said with concern. ‘It would be suicide.’ The co-pilot shook his head. ‘Funny that the met people should get it so wrong.’ Outside the flight deck, a wisp of white flicked past the black window. Why did Delaney suddenly find he was suspicious about the meteorological report? It took nearly five minutes before Delaney, wearing a second set of earphones, looked up sharply to make sure that the radioman, swearing at the weird interference, could hear the stream of dots and dashes coming in. De-coded, the operator swung on his seat to face him. But Delaney could already read the answer in the grim, red-lit face. ‘The message is ‘Albatross’, sir.’ It was the no-abort , go at any cost signal."
FIC FIC-G01-020 -0.16 "59 They were watching him. He was certain of it now. As the tube pulled into Westminster station Trevor Magee looked directly across the compartment and saw his own reflection in the glass. He tried not to look either left or right. As the doors slid open he glanced at the middle-aged couple who got out but then stared straight ahead again. The doors remained open for a moment but no other passengers got on. Magee realised that he was alone apart from the other two. And he knew they were watching him. The two youths, both in their early twenties, one black, one white, had boarded the train at Gloucester Road station. At first they had sat directly opposite him, but as the train travelled through the subterranean tunnel one of them had moved three seats to his left. The other had moved to the right. Both sat on the opposite row of seats and Magee moved uncomfortably under their gaze. He looked up briefly and saw that the black youth was watching him. He was tall, taller than Magee's six feet, dressed in faded jeans and baseball boots which made his feet look enormous. He had one hand in the pocket of a baggy jacket. The other he was tapping on his right thigh, slapping out a rhythm, perhaps the accompaniment to the tuneless refrain he was humming. His white companion was also staring at Magee. He too wore baggy jeans and baseball boots, and across his  T-shirt the words ‘Ski-Club’ could be clearly seen. His face was pitted and he needed a shave. Magee was painfully aware that he was alone in the compartment with the youths. He glanced at the map of the Underground on the panel opposite and saw that they were approaching Embankment Station. He decided to get off. Would they follow him? Out of the corner of his eye he could see the white youth had draped one leg over a plastic seat arm and was reclining, his gaze never leaving Magee. He began to consider the worst possible scenario. If they both came at him at once, from opposite sides, how would he deal with them? He tried to tell himself he was being ridiculous. He was, after all, thirty-six years old, six feet tall and well-built. Should they try anything he should be more than capable of dealing with them. But the doubts persisted. The black youth got to his feet, standing still for a moment, swaying with the motion of the train, gripping one of the rails overhead for support. Then he began walking towards Magee. The train was slowing slightly; they must be close to the station. The youth sat down opposite. Magee clenched both fists in the pockets of his long leather overcoat. The knot of muscles at the side of his jaw pulsed. He was ready. The train eased into the station and he got to his feet, heading for the door, pressing the ‘D O O R O P E N’ button even before it was illuminated. The orange light flared and he jabbed at it. The door slid open and he stepped out onto the platform, walking quickly towards the exit. Once there he paused and glanced behind him. There was no one following. He smiled and hurried to the escalator, scuttling up the moving stairway towards street level, finally emerging into the ticket hall; As he passed through he cast one last glance behind him to assure himself he was free of pursuers. Satisfied that he was, he walked out into Villiers Street, into the arms of the night. A chill wind had come with the onset of darkness and Magee pulled up the collar of his coat as protection against the breeze. Both hands dug firmly in his pockets, he walked along the narrow thoroughfare, the lights of the Strand up ahead of him. A young woman passed close and smiled. Magee returned the gesture, nodding a passing greeting, turning to look at her, appreciating the shapely legs visible below her short skirt. She had not been the first woman to offer him a smile during the past few hour. Magee was a good-looking man, his shoulder-length black hair and chiselled features making him look at least five years younger than his actual age. He had helped one woman with a pushchair and screaming infant on to a bus earlier, and she had gripped his hand tightly in hers as she had said thank you. He had merely smiled and waved to her as the bus pulled away. You either had it or you didn't, thought Trevor Magee, smiling broadly to himself. He passed a pub on his right called The Griffin , the sound of loud music swelling from inside. For a moment he thought about going in and fumbled in one of his pockets for some change, but he decided against it. He walked on, climbing the flight of stone steps that brought him up into the Strand itself. To his right there was a McDonalds; behind him the lights of the Charing Cross Hotel glowed in the darkness. To his left was Trafalgar Square. Magee's smile broadened. He looked around him, aware of the traffic speeding up and down, of the people who walked past him on the pavement, of people coming out of McDonalds laden with fast food. There was a dustbin outside and an elderly man dressed in a filthy jacket and torn trousers was shuffling towards it. There was a dark stain around the crotch of the trousers; Magee wrinkled his nose at the stench the old man was giving off. He watched as the tramp sorted through the rubbish, finally pulling out a soft-drinks container. He took off the lid and sniffed the contents, satisfied the liquid was drinkable. He swallowed it down as if parched. Magee's smile faded to a look of disgust. The tramp tossed the empty cup away and shuffled off in the other direction. Magee watched him go, pushing his way past pedestrians, finally disappearing down a side street. The younger man swallowed hard, then turned and walked briskly in the direction of Trafalgar Square. He had things to do."
FIC FIC-G0S-003 -0.02 "GOLD/WHITE Twenty-one PARIS, 196– HOWEVER MUCH THE hotel maid sprinkled her lemon scouring powder, the salle de bains (so designated by a chipped blue-and-white oval enamel plaque) still smelled of stagnant drains, as if it functioned as an extension of the narrow street outside, where a section of the gutter exuded a steady reek of staleness, sweetish-sour, and not entirely unpleasant to Miranda. She had rinsed out the tub, and lowered the big and tarnished metal plug into the hole. The water began to trickle down its old tearstains below the taps: she hoped there'd be enough hot to wash her hair. She pulled a strand under her nose and sniffed; the smoke from the blondes she'd sumptuously smoked the night before saturated it. Again, sweetish, not unpleasant; she was in that time of her youth when ripeness in any form spelt pleasure. It was half an hour past noon, when the corner hotel was quiet; an hour when Marie-Angèle could let her slip into the bathroom with her pass key without telling Madame, who would otherwise charge her four hundred francs (anciens ) for the tubful of hot water. In return, Miranda did not mention the occasional missing pair of stockings, headband, hairslide, and, on one occasion, she was almost sure, British Home Stores knickers she'd had since school, where they had been modestly itemised as ‘linings’ in the list of uniform requirements and had her school number scrawled on the waistband by Astrid with a linen marker of indelible ink (the other girls had Cash's name tapes in cursive script or small capitals). Such items seemed a fair exchange for free baths. Then, just as she was about to step into the water, Marie-Angèle's's voice rose in a shrill whisper at the door. ‘Madame !’ she called, and Miranda quickly bundled up her clothes and streaked across the landing, as the proprietress came heaving up the curving stair, the rail quaking in her grasp. Marie-Angéle met her, deflected her; they spoke, and Madame turned to descend again. There was a caller for Miranda downstairs, reported Marie-Angèle. ‘Un monsieur .’ (This was why he had not been allowed up to seek out Miranda in her room — though she had managed on several occasions to sneak some of her new friends past the desk; while at night, there was no porter and she had her own key to the wrought-iron and glass front door.) But Madame Davenant kept a clean and respectable and quiet private hotel, which is why it had been chosen for Miranda and why she liked it, on the whole. Miranda could tell that Madame Davenant was not angry that she had had to climb five floors to Miranda's chambre, la quatorze , on the level just below the mansarde , where Marie-Angèle had her quarters, for the maid looked cheerful as she nodded in the direction of the salle de bains and promised, ‘Une autre fois .’ As Miranda was halfway down the dark and narrow stairwell, she realised who it was who had so disarmed Madame that she had not scolded Marie-Angèle (for not being downstairs to hand, to run the message up to Mlle Everard), or waited to reproach Miranda herself for allowing visitors to call without appointments and cause all this trouble to her hostess in the Hotel Davenant. For it wasn't the first time this had happened, by no means. Paris — or to be precise, the Paris made up of Montparnasse, St Germain and the Mouffetard — was like a party: meeting someone on the street in that quadrant did not constitute a pickup. Miranda Everard had been raised always to avoid pickups. She was almost certain it would be the tall man with the unseasonal yellow gloves with pearl buttons, so personable and well-spoken, who bore the name of a well-known apéritif. She had met him in the Coupole the night before when she was  sitting with her friends from the atelier, and he'd known one of them and come over. They ordered calvados and played canards , dipping the sugar cubes in the tawny liquid so that the surfaces just met, the liqueur drawn up through the sugar, flushing and softening it until at just the right moment, a split second before the sweetness might dissolve and fall into the drink and spoil it, you tipped your head back and took the lump on your tongue and either let it melt there, or gnashed the singingly sweet grit of the sugar grains. And then again, but this time on a coffee spoon, with the other half of the sugar cube. The calvados did not flow like fire if taken with sucre en morceaux like this: it just gave a funny kick in the area of her chest, and made her gurgle with the heat of it. She was remembering how this M. Apéritif looked at her —; the French, especially d'un certain âge , were such mooncalves when it came to flirting, rolling eyes and winking shamelessly; she was in consequence smiling to herself when she reached the hall. To the left, opposite the reception desk, in the parlour with the rubber plant and the lace half-curtains, where she sometimes had her breakfast (if she was up before ten when Madame stopped serving it), she saw her grandfather, Sir Anthony Everard, erect against the window, with her young aunt his daughter beside him, Xanthe Everard, Miranda's nursery playmate. ‘Didn't you receive my letter? I wrote, my dear — oh, a week ago.’ Miranda reached to peck him back and felt the smooth skin on his chin, smelled the lotion he used on his hair (not bay rum, not like her father, but a sweeter perfume, limewater and rose). Then she turned to Xanthe whom she could avoid kissing, to keep her unbathed body away from the young girl's groomed presence as far as she was able without coldness. She held Xanthe at arm's length, to look at her, and revolved her, almost prancing to distract attention from herself, and exclaimed, ‘Everyone must say this, but you look amazing.’ Her father said, ‘Yes, Goldie's no longer a little girl!’ ‘Goldie?’ ‘Yes. Goldie — I don't like being called Xanthe. It's my new name.’ Like a child in an eighteenth-century aristocratic portrait, Xanthe, now eleven verging on twelve, was not dressed in children's clothes, but in doll-like versions of her mother's couture style: a sage-green fitted jacket with narrow lapels and a large and fancy button at the nipped-in waist, a wheel of a skirt, the hem hanging straight, over strong legs in pale seamed stockings. Even in her confusion, Miranda noticed this, the workmanship involved in hemming without a droop, the quality of Xanthe's hose. ‘All right, Goldie it is, why not? Plain English.’ Miranda tried not to make a face. Sir Anthony too was all bon ton , a grey flannel suit, with a striped tie in pale green and pink, signalling membership of a desirable club, a deeper crimson in the handkerchief casually thrust into his breast pocket, and light shoes of a complementary oyster sheen. His face too was a paler, healthy pink, and so close-shaved that he looked, with his blade-like glance, as pristine as the shoot from a bulb in spring. Her grandfather had written to her, she had forgotten. He was always punctilious; she did not have a diary; today must be the day she had thought so far off when he had proposed meeting Kit and Astrid in Paris and then taking all of them out for lunch. She was confused, one of her friends was picking her up at the studios that afternoon, not M. Apéritif, but a doe-eyed Persian who was — he said — training to be an engineer. He was going to walk her to her other job in the bar, across the Jardin du Luxembourg; perhaps they'd sit in the late sunshine, near the thin young naked girl who looked exposed and hence signified Truth, the inscription said. ‘I haven't been well,’ she stuttered. ‘I lost track of the days. But this is fantastic. To see you here!’ ‘We hadn't heard.’ ‘Oh, I didn't tell anyone. It wasn't serious. Besides, I wouldn't have wanted to worry you.’ Sir Anthony asked, ‘Where are your parents now, by the bye?’ He spoke into the air, as if inconsequentially. Miranda faced him and schooled her features. ‘In Le Touquet, it's the championship.’ Her voice was firm, gay, just as she would wish. ‘I had a postcard yesterday. Of a miniature golf course — you have to get your ball over a lunar landscape…’ she made a gesture of a hop and curve or a spinning ball. ‘They're coming back.’ It was ten days ago that she'd heard from Le Touquet, and that series of games must be over by now, she knew. But she held fast under her grandfather's look, which lifted past her, reflectively, intent on the pigeonholes where the room keys lay in their niches. ‘Soon? I hope so.’ ‘Oh yes, absolutely…’ She glanced over at Madame. ‘Everyone here is very kind.’ ‘Meanwhile, you've everything you need?’ ‘Oh, it's bliss…’ she began, then noticed Xanthe's delicate widening of her eyes and a slight wrinkle of pale nose, like white jade, and noticed that on her fair curls she was wearing a small moulded felt cap, with a slantwise spray of fluffy feathers —; egret?— curving into her nape. Miranda faltered, ‘I'll just get changed to go out — I was about to. Sorry.’ She looked around the vestibule, suddenly aware that this room where she ate a brioche and drank milky coffee as if at a feast of the gods on those mornings when she managed to get up in time was a mere dingy parlour, the curtains grey with city smuts, the tables pocked and charred by cigarettes. She began to wave to a seat, but stopped herself — she realised it must look grimy to them as well. She could see her grandfather was keeping his hands to himself, standing quiet and still, as if he wanted to make the least contact possible with the room. Madame raised her crackling voice from the large brown desk where she presided in the hall beyond, and asked them with unusual largesse if they would like some refreshment. ‘De la grenadine, pour les demoiselles?’ Sir Anthony's lips slid over his small teeth in what passed for  his public smile, and he accepted, without waiting for their answer. Miranda began, again, addressing herself to the young girl, ‘While I'm getting ready, would you like to come up and see my room?’ Two glasses of grenadine appeared, bright carmine, with whorls of lighter tint where the thick syrup was melting into the water. ‘Offert de la part de la direction .’ Madame's smile showed the effort of her boon. Sir Anthony thanked her, his lean form bending in a half bow with discreet and final grace that did not allow further conversation. She sighed, but departed not entirely ungratified, and took her position by the keys. Upstairs, Miranda pulled the bedclothes up to tidy the bed and patted the lumpy result, beckoning to Xanthe to sit down there; there wasn't anywhere else. ‘So how's London? It must be the holidays — how's your ma? And Feeny? Go on, tell. I want all the news.’ Xanthe spread out the soft folds of her skirt and looked at them as Miranda quickly splashed water into her armpits, round her neck, on her face, muttering, ‘I wish I'd just had time to wash my hair.’ ‘Serafine's hip's getting worse — with the winter coming, she gets stiff, you know, and it makes her lame. She's wheezy, too. Otherwise everything's fine, I think. She sends you much love, of course.’ ‘Goldie’ Everard sounded as if she were delivering an elocution exercise. ‘I don't see her much any more. She doesn't, exactly, look after me any more, you know.’ She added, in a different, child's voice. ‘Her room smells funny, like an old jar with something sticky and brown in it you can't tell what it is.’ ‘I must write to her.’ Miranda had swung out the bidet now from under the basin and was rapidly dunking her feet in it, a procedure Xanthe watched in surprise. ‘Sorry to hold you up, but I feel filthy — you know I'm serving in a café —’(she said ‘café’, it sounded right. Though it was really a bar, Le Rosebud, down a side street in Montparnasse). I just fall into bed any old how, it's sometimes so late when I get back.’ Xanthe shivered slightly, as Miranda dabbed and ran on, ‘Will you or your ma promise to read her the letter if I write her one? You know, in the past…’ she trailed off, she could sense that she'd better not squat on the bidet to wash between her legs in front of Miss Goldilocks. ‘I'll hurry up,’ she said instead and took her best dress from behind the flowered cotton curtain on the bendy wire that served as a wardrobe. It was a bit summery for the weather, but had the same small waist as Xanthe's tailored number, in a kind of light-green figured gauze over a satin underskirt, with a broad belt and wide lighter-coloured lapels, with a big perspex buckle like bottle glass. She found a pair of stockings, passed her hand through to check for runs, discovered a small one near the heel and dabbed it with the bar of soap to hold it; put on her two-tone coffee and cream high-heel shoes, then looking close in the mirror, applied some eyeliner with the flick of a tail in the corner and painted pale lipstick on her mouth. Xanthe was still talking, perseveringly, at her hands folded in her lap. ‘Mummy nearly came with us. But at the last minute, she had too much on.’ ‘That's a shame,’ said Miranda and gave her hair three strokes backwards with her brush to make it puff. ‘There, I'm ready. How do I look? Will your pa approve?’ Xanthe nodded, with a swallow. Miranda had a skewed air, her dark curls sprang up on her head so that the younger girl noticed little black hairs running down the vertebrae of her neck to the nape; there was a feral shine and speed to her too, something uncontained, and it scared the younger girl. Xanthe had caught snatches of her parents talking in London before they left. There was trouble, always trouble stirring in the air round Kit and round Astrid. — Miranda, who's considering Miranda? — Us, of course. The ball always ends up in our court. — They left her where? — In a hotel on the Left Bank? — She's eighteen, just turning nineteen. — Well, if there's nothing wrong. — But alone in Paris? — I mean. — I know what you mean. The voices grew even lower, then, when money came into the question. — I've forked out before, and I'll be forking out again, no doubt. — You're generous to a fault. — But I couldn't cover his marker — why should I? — He should have learned by now. Let them look after themselves. — You're the one who's generous, my dear. Who's understanding of my peccadilloes. Lord, what a mistake that was. — You were a young man. Once! Besides, as you say,noblesse oblige . — Still am, when I look at you. — Ooh, you wolf. Tramp was a word Xanthe had learned from her mother. Also tart. And callgirl. And courtesan. She liked the sound of these words, even delivered with her mother's genteel sneer, but Miranda didn't match any of these, they were too glamorous. Except a tramp. Her room was so grubby too, with nothing but a bed in it and that bidet and that bit of rag for a curtain over the small old propped-up suitcase and some clothes. Had Kit and Astrid stayed here too, before they left her behind? It was so different from the rooms Xanthe and her father had taken in a former hôtel particulier of a family of the ancien régime, round a courtyard off the Rue St Honoré, with ormolu chests of drawers, lace-trimmed bolsters and a chiming clock on the writing desk in the small, light sitting room where stood striped chintz chairs with gilded lyre backs and a matching silk-covered settee. Xanthe's mother is saying to her father: — She should learn a skill. — I believe she wants to study art. She shows some talent, or so I've been told. — That family thinks money grows on apple trees. Her father is sighing, agreeing. Then he asks: — What's a girl like her do these days? — Shorthand typing, pharmacy, stablegirl, acting, oh, really, you know the kind of thing. — She has a good head on her shoulders. — She's no fool, I know. But she's awfully swarthy. Do you think employers would take to her? It might put off likely customers. — Really, Gillian. — Well, I mean. — She's not very dark. There's many Welsh darker-eyed than her. — She's not Welsh, Ant darling. — What do you mean, dearest? Think of Cleary, the dear fellow, and Pindi and… I could go on. All first-rate chaps, friends. — They were Flinders friends, darling. Players of the Game. This is different. — You don't have to tell me, my dear. I know girls are a special case. Girls are different from chaps, I do know that. But everything's changing, all the time. My word, that's one thing that stays the same, at least. (And Ant laughs, good-humouredly,; her father is never cross, never ruffled, never at a loss.) ‘Go on, how do I look? Am I different?’ Xanthe stood up in the narrow space between the bed and the door in Miranda's room, and said, ‘You look rather ‘beatnik’. Xanthe spoke the word carefully, caressingly, Miranda noted, as if it might snap at her if she didn't handle it well. Miranda grinned back. ‘And?’ ‘You're thin.’ ‘I am.’ She whispered, close to Xanthe's cheek and the younger  girl sniffed the sweet tobacco on her breath. ‘I'm having a fantastic time.’ Then on the stairs, she turned to say to Xanthe, who was behind her, going more slowly, unfamiliar with the shallowness of the treads and their tight twist, unlike Miranda who'd had weeks of running up and down them, ‘But don't let on to your pa. He might make me come back to London, and I couldn't bear it. Ugh.’ — You could take Goldie — show her the sights. — It'd be a good opportunity, she's old enough now to appreciate it, the Orangerie, the Louvre, the Café de Paris. She'd held her breath, hoping they'd agree. — Why don't we go, the three of us? — No, my dear, I'll stay here and hold the fort. Take Goldie, go ahead. Show her Paris. I've seen it. ‘Well, shall we make our way? Are you all prepared?’ Sir Anthony was addressing Miranda, though he wasn't looking at her. His gaze was fastened on his daughter's last careful steps down the stairs, as if he could barely restrain himself from running forward to hold out a hand to her. He'd always had such courtesy, could make a frump feel like a star, so Gillian used to say, a little ruefully. She quoted him: on one occasion when the Princess had waved him away, pleading a cold, he had breathed back at her, ‘It would be a privilege to catch a cold of yours.’ Gillian snorted as she repeated her husband's gallantry, but it was plain she took some pleasure in it too. ‘We'd better drink Madame's offering,’ he added, directing Miranda to the glasses of brilliant cordial; she sipped and made a face. ‘So sweet.’ Xanthe stole a look at the reception desk, then passed behind her father and tipped hers into the rubber plant's garish jardinière, stifled a giggle and beckoned Miranda to do likewise. ‘You're a naughty girl,’ said Sir Anthony, aglow, when they  were in a taxi, heading for Le Grand Condé. He patted both Xanthe and Miranda on the hand, chuckled, and went on, ‘How delightful to have both my girls with me’— giving Miranda's a special squeeze —‘I'm all ears, my dear. I want to hear all about your life here. Every detail!’ Through her time of growing up, Miranda had had to talk so loud to interrupt the brawling, crying, canoodling jag that was her parent's marriage, to entertain so insistently in order to divert them from the partying, bickering, kiss-and-make-up affair that absorbed them totally, that she had become as deaf to tremors and to nuances as her former games mistress shouting ‘Bombs Coming Over’ or ‘Scrub the Decks’through a megaphone in the gym at the dim convent Miranda had been sent to for those three years of her childhood when the family had been in funds. When Astrid asked her daughter a question, Miranda would rush to reply, as fully and as dazzlingly as she could: her mother liked to be amused and was easily distracted by something else. When her father reached for a cigarette, Miranda intercepted his hand as it searched for his lighter, and touched the flame to the tip to make contact with him. If she had learned to be self-effacing, cultivated a mysterious absence or aloofness they might forget her altogether, or so she feared deep down, not openly, not admitting to herself this appalling possibility. So when asked by her grandfather to tell all, she plunged in, heedless of the need for caution which Xanthe, at an early age, had grasped should always be observed with parents, and especially her father. Miranda sensed her family had come to the rescue, and she was only keen to show that she was striking out boldly, freestyle, not sinking. Once Astrid had taken her shopping (she was about four at the time) and set her down on a stool by a counter when she tried on earrings in a round mirror on a stand; a salesgirl with a promotional tray of perfumes approached her and Astrid turned and extended her wrist to sample it. Later, Miranda imagined that the salesgirl was offering a discount to customers who bought a certain range of cosmetics — for her mother had wandered off. Miranda had remained quietly on the stool  looking at her fat knees, as if she were happy doing so, until one of the shopgirls in costume jewellery leaned over the counter and said, through scarlet lips, ‘Where's your mummy gone to then?’ At which Miranda had burst into tears, and continued sobbing, holding on to the store detective's hand as she heard the announcement: ‘Would Miranda's mummy please come to Lost and Found. On the First Floor.’ Astrid was laughing when she came running up, coat and scarf flying, shopping bags like gibsails billowing, her pretty mouth with little teeth making her seem to shine all over. ‘Oh God, it's so awful of me! I forgot I'd brought you!’ she exclaimed as the store detective pushed Miranda into her mother's sleek legs, only to provoke a little skipping step to the side. ‘Careful! My best nylons!’ The invisibility that threatened her drove her to perform to attract attention, so she had done well at school, been picked for the hockey and the swimming teams. She had taken after her father, Astrid said, that dogginess — always going after a stick, leaping high to please the thrower, waggingly racing back with it and repeating the action as long as it pleased. She flung herself at friendship and blurted her thoughts and feelings, jokes and secrets till she had no flora in the lining of her inner spaces to help her absorb her experiences slowly, nutritiously. So she had no idea, when her antics were effective, how she was using herself up in her efforts to ward off her disappearance from the world, in her girlish desire to please. At school, she had been considered something of a ‘character’— a freak by her enemies, an eccentric by those loyal to her, or touched by the high voltage of her need. Her attention-seeking bore the outward marks of sincerity, in spite of the gush — and Miranda's exclamations, declarations, confessions and other self-revealing speeches seemed filled with inadvertencies, guileless admissions and a heroic individuality of voice and response. Yet all this frankness was fundamentally an act: to fill the  silence that she feared in others, to ward off the invisibility she feared in herself. Her father laughed softly at her sometimes, throwing his head back and exhaling lazily: ‘What a chatterbox you are! You don't get it from me.’ Round him, she was talkative in order to provoke him into replying, and the attempt made her a habitual confessor, though she would have been amazed if she had been charged with talking about herself all the time. They were driving down the Boulevard St Germain towards the river; the Seine's fast-flowing current, parted hard against the piers of the bridges, seemed to Miranda's eyes to capture the pace and temperament of this city where she felt so happy, where she wanted to stay. She began, excitedly, plunging into her strategy of convincing her grandfather she was prospering. ‘oh, I'm learning such a lot — it's a piece of luck. Rob — he started it all, oh, ten or more years ago — he lets me do odd jobs around the studios in return for— well — anything I want to do, it's fabulous. I can use the presses, he even lets me have paper free. I do a bit of modelling, sweeping up, errands, fetch orders of croque-monsieurs, grands crèmes …’ She laughed, catching the shadow on Anthony's forehead. ‘oh, I don't model in the nude! We do lots of different drawing exercises, drapery and still life and other stuff — and we take it in turns to pose.’ He looked relieved, as if he believed her gratefully. The cab swerved into the Place de la Concorde, she felt them whirling as they joined the vortex round the obelisk as if in a fairground swing as it lifts and spins. ‘Rob's a fantastic teacher — people come from all over the world to study with him. I'm really lucky, honestly. He says I'm doing well, too. I've been concentrating on my technique, so soon I could try working straight on to the plate. I'm terribly excited about it, I'm learning every day.’ ‘And today? What were you learning today?’ Miranda tried to ignore this, and pressed on, ‘We have guest speakers, and we've had lectures on Pollock and Kandinsky…’ she turned to speak to Xanthe, ‘one woman talked about female beauty and art. Shaving your temples and sticking out  your tummy versus binding your breasts to flatten them and pulling out your teeth.’ She giggled.’ ‘Beauty is power’, that's what she said, ‘If Cleopatra's nose had been a little shorter… ‘…it would have changed the face of the world.’ I know.’ Xanthe touched her own neat nose. ‘I think that's stupid, actually. Cleopatra was a queen, and rich, and pretty clever too, I think, she knew what was what.’ Miranda was silent for a beat. ‘But she was the most beautiful woman in the ancient world.’ Xanthe looked out of the taxi windows at the throng swinging down the pavement, the broad plane leaves shifting and the jackets still unfastened, panels loose, in these first mild days of autumn. ‘I think they just say she was beautiful,’ said this new Xanthe Miranda had not known before, this precocious, sharp-witted little girl in the chic outfit. ‘To explain away what she managed to do.’ Miranda waited, to hear more. How smug she is, she thought viciously. Her father, too, smiling into his smooth, pink chin. The taxi swerved out of the Champs Elysées, down the Avenue George-V and came to a sudden halt on the corner. Anthony Everard looked at the meter with his customary care with sums, however small, and began to unfold a ten-thousand-franc note from a small gold clip, then hesitated, and looked again. Xanthe stiffened by his side, when he plucked her by the sleeve and nodded to the meter, ‘Look at that.’ The driver turned and said, worried now, ‘Mille neuf cent soixante francs, monsieur .’ ‘If I'm not mistaken,’ said Anthony Everard, ‘today's the first of September, 1960 — no?’ He paid, and still looking thoughtful, escorted the young girls through the mahogany and brass revolving doors into the burgundy-coloured, upholstered, mirrored and gilded interior of Le Grand Condé, where in heaps of rosy cumulus, nymphs with come-hither looks and not a stitch on except a few blue satin ribbons frolicked between the mirrored panels on the walls and ceiling. Ant Everard pulled a small leather-bound notepad from his breast pocket and wrote out for them, ‘1/9/60’. ‘You see, the fare's the same as the date and the date as the year — I'd already noticed that, of course. But this fare's a numerical coincidence, by God, of a rare sort. A moment more, a moment less, a foot more, a foot less, and the meter would have given a different reading. Auspicious, I'd say, without a doubt.’ He touched Miranda on the elbow as he steered them towards the lectern where the table reservations ledger stood. ‘Do you think I should tell your father — in Le Touquet? The odds against such a thing are…incalculable.’ The head waiter came towards them, and Anthony gave another name, not his, and they were ushered to a table in the window, overlooking the terrasse where a few customers were sitting in the open, a glass or two in front of them in the freshening air. ‘Look,’ whispered Sir Anthony, ‘but don't look as if you're looking.’ His eyes swept the terrasse's clientèle and an eyebrow twitched as his glance passed one of them in a way that directed attention to the woman sitting there, with her back to the street, facing them through the glass. ‘Marlene Dietrich,’ he said. ‘Now, she is one of the most beautiful women in the world, if not the most. Famous. For her legs in particular.’ Miranda and Xanthe looked at her, and at her legs, which were pale and sheeny and crossed and held together, aslant to the chair, to one side of the café table, as if her wicker chair were seagirt rock and she a siren with a fish's tail. On her head she wore a green felt hat, with a pin stuck through it like a bodkin. She wasn't speaking to the men who were sitting with her; she sat completely still, with a pale glass of something —; Vichy water?— untouched in front of her. The two girls were looking hard, till Ant Everard restrained them with a cough. The menus were presented, mauve ink in loops formed unfamiliar words, to Miranda too, for she was more accustomed to café fare, a sandwich au jambon , a croque-madame . Or, if she was feeling bingey, a feuilleté de champignons au porto , which was the single cheapest item on the Coupole's menu. Miranda, from her advantage of a month in the city, struggled to interpret for her young aunt. ‘Raped carrots, what are they?’ ‘Crudities!’ They began giggling. Miranda was relieved that in some ways Xanthe could still be her age. She countered, smilingly behind the menu: ‘The French have a different attitude to rape: resistance is the salt on the dish, you know.’ Xanthe's eyes went wide again, in that way that didn't betoken innocence, but her ability to weigh a piece of intelligence against another heard before. Sir Anthony hushed them and then rose, smiling his quiet and pleasant smile with one hand extended in salutation as a plump and dark-haired man came bouncingly to join them. ‘Cher Maître !’ Sir Anthony cried in greeting, at the same time as the Frenchman bowed to each of them in turn and took the empty seat opposite Sir Anthony. Xanthe made a face at Miranda, and she was disappointed, she had indeed hoped to have her grandfather and her old childhood companion to herself, to pour out more of her news about her life in Paris. But the Frenchman was murmuring to him, a quick flow of English mixed with French, about nothing much, but Miranda could tell it was some business they had together. With some advice from his acquaintance, Maitre Perreyve, Anthony ordered the plat du jour, a boeuf en daube â la mode , for the two young mesdemoiselles . (‘A classic dish — and you can't really ever go wrong with the plat du jour.’) The Frenchman suggested barquettes à la Neptune , or the soupe à l'oseille , to begin with, but Xanthe looked at her father and wheedled, ‘Can't I have an artichoke? I do love them.’ ‘Of course, my little woman,’ said her father. Artichaut sauce vinaigrette it was for both the girls. In the Ladies, where they went to explore and while away the  length of time a restaurant meal always took, Miranda began, ‘Who's that man then?’ Xanthe answered ‘Oh one of Poppa's old friends, I expect. Mummy calls them his worshippers — he has to have at least one of them around.’ Miranda, surprised, changed the subject. ‘So, what did you think of Marlene?’ ‘I've just about heard of her, but I could tell she's famous, just by the way she sits and holds her head and moves.’ Xanthe was shaking out and smoothing her full skirt. ‘I don't know,’ Miranda put in. ‘She's like a bit of laundry that's been left out to dry too long, till it gets bleached and stiff.’ It felt risqué being so unkind. ‘But she doesn't look as if she feels like that. And that makes all the difference. She's got an aura round her, you see that first, like a glow. A kind of halo. She's saying, ‘Here I am, it's me, it's really me.’ Xanthe was now adjusting her hat with gestures of adult prinking. ‘To me, she looks like something preserved in a bottle.’ But Miranda didn't like this cruelty she was expressing; where was it coming from? Something to do with the upset she felt, down below, squashed, but bubbling up, at Xanthe's composure and her grandfather's advent. ‘She just knows everyone's looking at her, all the time.’ Xanthe pressed her lips together and stuck her chin up in a pose. ‘That's her power.’ ‘You look fabulous, you know,’ said Miranda, deciding to take the part of generosity over envy. It gave her a rush of reeling noble, which on balance hurt less than letting her dismay at Xanthe's poise work its sharp point into her. ‘Goody,’ said Xanthe. They looked at the picture in the mirror of themselves side by side. Miranda taller, with her bushy hair and colouring that the Italians whose paintings she'd been looking at in the Louvre rendered by priming the canvas with a copper-based green paint, creating a complexion that draws light in rather than gives it out; Xanthe beside her with her candy radiance of pink and gold, and rounder too, more  neatly assembled, wrist to hand, neck to shoulders, ankle to foot. All these junctures in Miranda were knobblier and more angular. Miranda thought of M. Apéritif last night, and decided she would let him go further when she next saw him, in spite of the lizard darting of his small and oddly hard tongue in the kiss she'd allowed him at the door of the hotel. It excited her to feel a man like him shudder as he pressed himself against her, to feel his weakness underneath all that Parisian aplomb. She knew what she could do to him, things she bet porcelain Xanthe would never know. Xanthe for her part considered her image beside the young woman she'd been brought up with, and thought how sorry she felt for her. Miranda would always look a bit cheap, just as her mother said, because she never looked altogether clean. It must be hell to be her, with her crazy parents who were always on the scrounge, though she didn't seem even to be aware of her situation. Which really made matters worse. Yet Xanthe's tidy existence felt mussed in Miranda's company; she experienced a sudden, vivid awareness of prohibitions hedging her about, and with the awareness, a desire to break them. They smiled at each other in the mirror, and Miranda said again, ‘You do look so beautiful and grownup, it's amazing to me!’ Still, in spite of the assiduous attentions which M. Apéritif and others paid her, Miranda would have liked Xanthe to make some reassuring remark in return. Men always had an obvious motive, so their compliments didn't mean anything; a woman's was more honest, usually. But none was forthcoming from Xanthe, and the silence, like so many in Miranda's experience, quickened her panic and her urge to make her mark. Behind them Madame Pipi, in black dress and white bib and apron, ostentatiously returned from the cubicles they had used and flourished the cloth with which she had wiped the seats. Xanthe looked at Miranda. ‘Have you something to tip her?’ Xanthe didn't carry money, in this respect at least she was still a  child. Miranda shook her head, and Madame blew her disgust through her teeth, and sat down with a magazine with a cover picture of the future Queen Fabiola of Belgium smiling on the arm of her optician's pin-up of a fiancé. They pushed through the padded door, back towards the dining room, and Miranda confided, ‘When I'm really on the breadline and someone's taking me out, I sometimes tell them I haven't any change for Madame Pipi — they give me something. If I do that two or three times I can make about half the cost of the room per day at the hotel — honestly.’ ‘Don't they think it funny you have to go so often?’ ‘Maybe, but you can't ask about things like that.’ Xanthe sucked each leaf of her artichoke thoroughly, leaving precise teeth marks above the fleshy pad, then laid each one down on a plate in overlapping circles until she'd formed a rosette, a second artichoke that looked almost untouched. She and Miranda talked; Xanthe was at dayschool in London, but riding was her passion, she was learning dressage on a black mare with a white star and three white pasterns. ‘Actually, Rob says he knows you! Robert Brett-Haynes? I think it was because of you he took me on.’ Miranda was addressing her grandfather. ‘He's been in Paris donkey's years but he's still awfully English — mad about Flinders. He saw you play, one summer when you occupied — was it a Figtree?—; before the break for tea — nobody'd done that before. The ball sailed over the Stockade, he said, and the crowd's sigh followed its arc the whole way. He's never forgotten it.’ Sir Anthony acknowledged her, and smiled at Maitre Perreyve. ‘Flinders is a complete mystery to the Gallic mind,n'est-ce pas ?’ The Frenchman was a lawyer, and Sir Anthony was on the board of the building firm which Gillian's father mostly owned; air traffic was increasing, bonanza time, and the company had appointed Anthony to be their emissary on a proposal for a joint venture on a new terminal. ‘My granddaughter, she's studying in Paris.’ Sir Anthony had concluded his business with the plump lawyer as far as he was able to overcome his distaste for discussing deals or mentioning  money, and he was holding back the brambles for her, as it were, letting her into their company, and she butted through, a young dog again, let out for a walk. She'd had a glass or two of wine, and it had helped to float her off. She began to boast, the people she'd met, about M. Apéritif, how comic men were with their courtesies and snapping lit-up eyes. ‘I learned this word,draguer ,’ she said. ‘There's no equivalent in English. It's an entirely French idea. A way of making friends. Everyone in Paris is trying to make friends, and some of them with me.’ ‘And where are you staying,chère mademoiselle ?’ Maitre Perreyve asked her. A muscle moved in Everard's cheek when Miranda replied. ‘That's an excellent location,’ said the lawyer, ‘Near the lovely Jardin du Luxembourg, the loveliest park in Paris, in my view. ‘Oh yes,’ said Miranda, ‘I walk across it every evening to my job…’ She trailed off. ‘My other…well, to make ends meet.’ When the bill came, Maitre Perreyve paid it cheerfully, and Anthony Everard, demurring to begin with, finally capitulated with a gracious closing of the eyes in acknowledgement. ‘It's not up to me to ask you what you think you're up to,’ her grandfather began, when they were once more alone together with Xanthe in the sitting room of their hotel suite. ‘Nor is it your fault, of course.’ He sighed. ‘You've no idea where they are, have you?’ Miranda began to cry. Everard stood up, embarrassed by her lack of control; the family trait had skipped him by, but it had surfaced in Kit with a vengeance, and of course, as he might have expected, been compounded in Kit's daughter by Astrid's capriciousness. ‘I think I might make inquiries, try to trace them. After all, we can't leave you living like this.’ ‘Why not? I'm so happy. There's nothing wrong, nothing at all.’ She was beseeching him. ‘What? You've been seeing men, men you don't even know. You're modelling in an artist's studio. And working in a bar. Living off tips.’ The italics in the mild voice were shrieking at her. ‘And quartered in that shabby place. You say nothing's wrong. Tell me, young woman, what is right about this way of life? Tell me what you get up to on your own like this? Tell me, though I don't think I want to hear. Goldie, you'd better leave the room. Go down to the lobby and see if you can find me a copy of… The Times . It should have arrived by now.’ Xanthe looked pinched, but went without a word. ‘Has anyone, laid a finger…um…kissed you?’ He was still turned away, his back as braced as a victim at a flogging stake. Miranda then found herself half-laughing through her tears. If he turned and looked at her, she might have to give a straight reply, but to his narrow back, which could have been the back of a much younger man, she began to tease, in the way that she had learned so many of her new friends liked, when they made similar inquiries too, like the painter who'd lain on her bed and asked her earnestly if she'd ever experienced simultaneous orgasm, or the musician who'd volunteered he'd show her a ‘perversion’ he was sure nobody would have demonstrated to her before, and began nuzzling between her legs. How they always wanted to know what other men did. How they puffed themselves up to outstrip others in their pleasure-giving powers, how they boomed when they protested they'd avenge assaults on her innocence by others. ‘No, never! Honest. What do you think?’ She checked a giggle of hysteria. ‘one does call me his tulipe noire , you know.’ ‘Blood will out,’ Gillian had said. ‘Blood is thicker than water,’ he had replied. ‘They say passionate things to me, but absolutely nothing more, oh no. Another says I smell of the sea, like oysters, fresh and salty.’ Miranda giggled. ‘Another told me he had a dream, there was a fountain and it had a name, clear as a bell in his dream: Jouvence. He was dipped in it by me. Oh, I'm an exotic to them — being a bit of a ‘musty’, as Feeny used to call it, isn't anything to deny here in Paris. Everyone loves me for the very things that you want me to cover up! Only the Persian engineer  with the sloppy eyes doesn't see me as exotic, because he's that way himself.’ She wasn't crying or laughing any more; numbness was taking over. Anthony turned to look at her; his eyes were kind, she had moved him, he'd perhaps remembered something, her grandmother, his boyhood. He brushed a hand across his forehead. ‘You all grow up too quickly, nowadays.’ He paused. ‘If I can't find your father and talk to him, I must ask you, my dear child — you are still a child, appearances to the contrary — to come home with us of your own accord.’ She went towards him, for he seemed suddenly spent, a man getting old far out to sea, trying to swim. ‘I was contacted — by the consul in Monte — oh, I shouldn't tell you these things, but…’ He looked at her with his blue eyes that made you feel you were in the far distance and he was bringing you into focus gradually, like a ball magnetised to drop into his outstretched hand, be clasped by his fingers. ‘There was some trouble. You know the kind of thing, I think. My dear, I can't tell you how sorry I am.’ She quivered, then his gaze travelled past her, and she was able to say with quick energy, ‘Daddy'll climb right up again, he always does. He's a brilliant player.’ ‘One of the best.’ He paused. ‘It would be such fun for Goldie, too, if you came back and stayed with us. She's so attached to you. And you to her, I know.’ Miranda dropped her head. She was now trying not to cry. ‘Mum and Dad want me to be here, I know. To wait for them.’ Anthony came up to her, handed her the spruce crimson silk handkerchief from his breast pocket and touched her hair, awkwardly. But she felt the tentativeness in his touch, the memory of something at his fingertips. He sighed, ‘Soon I'll be having to cope with Goldie too, I suppose.’ Very soon, thought Miranda, looking up at him, irises bruised from all the emotion, ‘oh, Goldie'll have no problems, I could swear to that.’ She pushed a smile into the corners of her mouth. ‘I don't have any, either. This is the life.’ She tried the cliché, then smiled at its failure. ‘You could come out. Gillian and I'd be glad to help with that — Queen Charlotte's ball, you could wheel the cake, wear white samite, you know the kind of thing, a garden party at the palace, plenty of young men. And the right sort of young men, too.’ He could not continue to look her in the face. ‘Do the season, the works. We couldn't afford a dance for you — I've Goldie's to consider, in four years’ time, not so far off. If it's worth doing, it's worth doing well. So maybe another kind of gathering for you — a tea party somewhere nice, maybe even in the Assembly Rooms at the Stockade, they've been hired before now. What do you say?’ ‘Are women allowed in?’ ‘There's a special bit for entertaining. Come, what d'you say?’ ‘That'd be next summer, no?’ Miranda said slowly, calmer now, for she saw the clouds clearing ahead. ‘Yes, I suppose so, yes.’ ‘I could stay here till then?’ There was a knock on the door, and Miranda jumped to let in Xanthe, carrying a crinkly air-mail-paper version of The Times , and a copy of Paris-Match with a photograph of Bardot, which she held up for Miranda to see. Bardot appeared three-quarters view, in a pink gingham décolletage, frilled with broderie anglaise, and spike heels of white kid on the end of her round legs. The light slanted across her skin in such a way the tiny blonde hairs showed like fair fluff. ‘I'm trying to persuade Miranda to come back with us to London,’ began her father. Miranda pleaded, ‘I'm sure Mum and Dad'll be back soon. You know them. They're expecting me to stay here.’ ‘Yes, I do know them,’ said her grandfather, and took the paper with a fond sad smile at Xanthe and sat down. ‘And I think you'd better come home.’ ‘I'm sure Miranda's looking after things really well while they're gone,’ said Xanthe, giving her a steady look. Her father's habitual mild-manneredness, which usually protected him from responding, became brittle and porous when he was in contact with his daughter: Miranda could see that he reacted to Xanthe's silkiness as if she weren't a clear, sparkling water, but a fiery solvent that he, for all his well-preened feathers, could not resist. He was listening to her, as she pressed on. ‘Uncle Kit and Aunty Astrid are bound to surface again. They always do. It's not a good idea to leave Miranda all on her own, so why don't we keep her company? Daddy, why don't we stay on, just until they do?’ She was her accomplice, and Miranda sat, quite still, amazed. Ant Everard put down his paper, looked at his daughter, his face a supplication of mercy from her; he looked back again at Miranda, and his concern turned into a frown, and he came visibly to a decision. ‘Goldie,’ he said. ‘You are still too young for Paris.’ He flinched at the stoniness in her sky-coloured eyes. ‘Poppa! Think, we could go to the Louvre, and I could practise my French — Miranda's French is smashing — you heard her talk to that old stick-in-the-mud at lunch, and we could visit Versailles… There's so much to do here. I've hardly ever left London. Honestly, please let me stay.’ Miranda held her breath. Ant Everard was smoothing the tissue Times with the flat of his hand. ‘The omens have been rather strong today,’ he said. ‘That taxi fare…very strange. Once in a while, the numbers fall, the abacus clicks into a pattern. Perhaps the Maitre was offering an opportunity I shouldn't let pass…?’ ‘Oh yes, Daddy, yes. You can do business and we'll…we, 11 study together.’ ‘The question is always interpretation, however. The augur's skill didn't consist in luck with the omens, but in reading them right. That's what sorted out the sheep and the goats. My famous bump of Flinders savvy, my sangay tells me…’ He was trying to joke, and Miranda's spirits dimmed. ‘Oh yes, it's a lucky day for you — and for me, for us.’ Xanthe was still pressing him. ‘I'm not sure, little lady.’ Miranda could see by his grip on the newspaper, the thinness of his lips, and above all how he directed his words to her, not to his daughter, how much it cost  him to refuse her anything. ‘Besides your mother would never agree. Would she now?’ ‘Tell her, just tell her. I want to stay here. Please.’ ‘Tonight, we'll do something special, and then…’ he pulled the paper up to hide his face. ‘We shall all three take the night train out — tomorrow. I expect Miranda can be packed by then. Xanthe's face flushed, but she did not cry, unlike Miranda, who began to beg, in a mess of tears and mucus and smeared makeup until her grandfather, two high spots of vexation colouring his cheeks, ordered her to return to her hotel. At the door, Xanthe took her by both hands and held her so hard Miranda felt her nails cut into the palms and her eyes met hers with a pale blue flare, as clear as her father's, and as unassailable, as she breathed out, holding Miranda by her side, and turned to face her father across the room. ‘I hate you,’ she said, ‘I hate you.’ ‘Really, Goldie!’ Anthony Everard tried to laugh away his daughter's fury. ‘We'll do something utterly delightful today, and even tomorrow: take a bateau mouche , ride the lift to the top of the Eiffel Tower — what do you say to that?’ ‘No,’ said Xanthe. ‘No.’ The voice, so accustomed to obedience, continued in courtesy, but its ring of conviction was sharpening, and Miranda sensed that Anthony Everard had reached the point when, if he could not phrase a command as a request, he would assert his authority undisguised. ‘It's only for your good, my little ladies,’ he was saying. ‘I know the world, more's the pity.’ ‘No,’ said Xanthe again. ‘I want to stay here longer.’ Anthony Everard sighed. ‘There will be time enough, later in your life. Plenty of chances for you when you're older. But not now, not this time, little woman. It's for the best, trust me.’ Twenty-two LONDON, 196– MIRANDA WAS ALONE in the compartment and glad of it, as it was an old-fashioned commuter train, with no corridor, just a door opening straight on to the line. She wasn't scared of the company who might join her on the journey, for fright was not a condition she admitted; she only wanted to study her surroundings without discretion, and such intensity made strangers feel uneasy. The train was passing through a part of the city she did not know; it jolted along slowly, so she could not draw. But it gave her a clear view into the houses backing on to the tracks, the private mess usually tidied out of sight, the outside lavatories with unhinged doors, the laundry racks flimsy as the skeleton of a bird's wing, with trousers and underwear like broken feathers hanging; a burst, sodden mattress. A CND sign was scrawled on a shed, with ‘She loves you, Yeah Yeah!’ alongside; more, newer anatomies of obsolete equipment, prams, tin bath tubs, hutches, lay tipped beside coal bunkers in some back plots. She lowered the window by the leather tab and clicked the lip into the groove of the embrasure to hold it down so she could take some photographs; several boys climbing over the fence on the railway banks hooted at the sight of her camera and posed, arms akimbo, pretence starlets. The famous film director from France could speak no English, and so Miranda was being sent to do the interview as well as provide the paper's weekly caricature; she had the address of the location, a newsagent's in the High Street of a part of the city she had never heard mentioned before, Giblett Park, though  she had lived in London most of her life; the Press Office had said that he would give her ten minutes between takes, or more if she were lucky and the filming was going well and Jean-Claude Meursault was feeling mellow. The paper's usual film reporter would write the story from Miranda's notes; he'd already attended several days' shooting of the new, as yet untitled film, the first Meursault to be made in Britain, which was a supreme sign that the decade was making all the difference to the world's view of the country, and its relation to the avant-garde. ‘It's a gas,’ the journalist told her. ‘There's this young girl in a Mao tunic and a red star on her cap — she's Jean-Claude's latest — and she's sitting on a bookcase, high up, legs swinging. It's in a porn shop, so there's bums and tits hanging out all around her, and she's reading aloud from Gramsci, fantastic stuff about seizing the time, the end of oppression — power to the people! It was fabulous, seeing her sitting in that heap of consumer capitalist garbage, pure, unmoved, like a flame, burning for the cause.’ The film buff was a slim young man, with long hands and feet and fair hair in a thin veil to his shoulders. He worked as one of the cooperative who ran Blot, the alternative newspaper where Miranda often published — though Blot in her view was well-named, for every page was printed in several coloured inks and a variety of types, and then overprinted in palimpsest. Any image, black-and-white or colour, was always worsted in this optical smorgasbord. It was hard work getting paid, as well. Still, she liked one or two of the collective, Xanthe had put some money in (actually five hundred pounds, a fair whack) when Miranda had asked her to, so she felt bound to give the paper some support in kind, and the office was fun — she liked pitching in with headings, sidebars, suggested stories, and pasting up till the small hours, with the help of ciggies and carafe wine; the sex gossip was the best in town, which made up for the coffee (though they could afford dope, they couldn't rise to real coffee, and had at one time even resorted to the bitter brown syrup Camp, with the turbaned lascar on the label). She reached the address; there was no sign of activity. The window was full of magazines, lying edge to edge and hanging in yellowed cellophane wrappers from clothes-pegs: she was reminded of playing shop as a child, and lining up the tins of food and boxes of soap flakes and bags of flour, all in miniature. The models behind the sun-baked cellophane smiled with shining teeth or pushed out kissing pouts or let their dewy bottom lip drop; they arched and twisted and perched, strategic stickers interrupted the full view of their parts, spotted animal skins here and there hinted at biting beasts on the loose. She tried the door. It did not open; she found a bell, hesitated about ringing it, then did so. It tinkled, an old-world merriness. The shopfittings had not been changed since it had been a High Street draper's, or a confectioner's perhaps? A man came to open it: he looked, Miranda thought, as if warnings against self-abuse might be true after all: whey-faced, with a camel's twitchy nose, though he was probably not much older than she was. ‘The film?’ he repeated. ‘They messed up the shop, terrible it was. I've been picking up after them all night and all morning. There's some people in the world should be kept in the zoo.’ He rubbed his forehead; he was wearing a rubber thimble with spikes. ‘How should I know where they are?’ he went on. He wasn't letting her in, she could see racks of magazines behind and a dark wooden counter, bare. Lines of eyes peeping and ogling, rows of breasts hoisted and nipples tweaked and Vaselined; reddened mouths gaped at her, naturists demonstrated star-jumps, plump pink bottoms poked, arch looks pinned her down, and fingers crested with scarlet points beckoned. Miranda began to feel curious for a closer look. At the OK Corral — as she preferred to call what some of its visitors termed her quim (the phrase struck her as useful after she'd seen the Western)— some men proved themselves and others came to grief, and both kinds had male competitors on their mind and wanted to outgun them. But meanwhile the OK Corral continued, and it was keeper of her own wild troop of horses, whom  she knew how to handle, unlike some of the sharpshooters and champions and wildmen exhibiting their prowess. Sex in Miranda's experience wasn't a matter of spectacle, but of darkness and touch, magnified by her senses' usually exacerbated state, the extremes of the night, of smoking and drinking and hunger and tiredness, and she was a blind swimmer through walls of warm water, and knew nothing of the practice and technique of the models in the pictures crammed edge to edge in the shop. She was used to seeing men's bodies; but she had never seen a woman's strike the poses of these images. She wondered, ‘Do I do it wrong? I never do any of this and haven't any of the underwear either. Perhaps she wasn't a real woman, after all, with the proper innate grasp of communicating with the Opposite Sex. She faltered, how would such a very real woman cope with this situation? She tried a smile, showing her teeth, ‘You don't know where they went?’ She raised her voice just enough to hint at domination. The seller of specialist magazines grimaced when she smiled and as he pushed the door shut to the frisky chiming of the bell he grunted, ‘Try the showroom, they might know. Or the pub.’ A homebody's disgust with the restless owners of fast cars, a temperate man's contempt for drinkers were impacted into this begrudged advice. When she eventually tracked down the location, Miranda was speeding on a mix of excitement and anxiety. She found the wrecker's yard down an alley just behind the station, about an hour and a half after she had first arrived there on the train. A girl in a mackintosh and low-heeled pumps, pale stockings, and a short glossy bob was running across the dirt floor of the yard; the hulks of cars were heaped behind her, the record of fatal crashes scored legibly in their twisted driveshafts, passenger doors stove in, and disembowelled interiors where plugs and levers hung from strings like fallen teeth on the ends of nerves. Oil glinted prettily in puddles like mussel shells. In some of the wrecks other young women were sitting: Miranda only saw then one naked girl in dark glasses leaning back on the banquette-style front seat of a big old Rover, thin white  legs in heels just touching the cinder-strewn wasteground. She was reading aloud, a man holding a boom mike was registering her voice; she was declaiming from Soul on Ice : I hate you Because you're white. Your white meat Is nightmare food. White is The skin of evil. Loving you thus And hating you so, My heart is torn in two. The words spoke truth; shivered up and down inside her, earthing right down to the OK Corral. Later, when she watched the scene during the shooting, she'd find more girls in the pile of smashed-up cars: one putting on lipstick high in a lorry's cab, another lying on the bonnet like a mascot, face to the car's prow, giving a feline look as she too read aloud, from a French philosopher who later in a fit of madness pushed his wife under in the bath, and held her there till there were no more bubbles. Their pale flesh in that wreckage made her shiver; it stirred morbid thoughts of the fragile membrane retaining blood inside the body, the tender transitions between limb and limb, the throbbing larval transparency of scientific diagrams showing the foetal development of…infant salmon, infant monkeys, infant anything. The woman in the mack was running, a camera on tracks was following her, a group of men clustered around it, pacing, several attached to it, one on a high seat, another underneath the lens, Jean-Claude Meursault on foot at their flank. She recognised him at once from the blunt-nosed profile and pepper-and-salt hair en brosse and the large tinted lenses of his glasses, and the way he hooked his head to one side and forward like a boxer butting. She would have no trouble  catching him on paper, but she took some photographs just to make sure. Then he lifted his arm and brought it down, hard and fast, and suddenly from behind the cars rose three freedom fighters in terrorist gear, black berets at an angle over their brows, black tracksuits, lace-up boots on their long shins, bandoliers slung oblique, rifles in one hand. They leapt down the car wrecks and legged it across the ground towards the girl. But too late, at another signal from Jean-Claude, the girl in the mack clutched her side and stumbled, then collapsed on the ground, and shuddering, turned over as the camera came close and moved out to hover over her face and catch her bitter smile as she died. At least, so Miranda imagined. They cut, and the actress scrambled up and examined her knees; a woman from Wardrobe ran up and gave her a change of mack, and bent to apply panstick to her hands where they had been dirtied by the wrecker's-yard floor; she checked her hose and brushed her hair and the actress shook her head slowly from side to side so that it fluffed. The Black Panthers slapped one another and joshed with their weapons: Miranda took a few more photographs to draw from later. They were standing against the light, and their profiles overlapped at close quarters, and haloed them; they made a vivid show of cock-of-the-roost virility, and she chuckled to herself with pleasure. One of the actors then noticed her camera and hailed her. She waved back gaily; his shoulders set haughtily and he turned away. They were directed back to their positions by the first assistant and his megaphone, and a second take began; Miranda was now able to make some sketches of the action as well, as she knew its shape. When the break for lunch was called the press girl came and fetched her, ‘About ten minutes, okay?’ Miranda sat down beside Jean-Claude Meursault in a canvas chair. She would have liked the brune he offered her, but couldn't cope with the tape-recorder, the paper with the questions written out in the Blot office, the unfamiliarity of speaking  French after an interval, as well as Meursault's cult reputation, all at the same time as smoking. So she declined, then immediately regretted it, because she realised it might have pleased him, made them complicit together. He hardly looked at her, but kept his eyes trained on her hands, or on his, but now and then she caught his look behind the smoked glass of his lenses, a milky, slightly protruding glance, mild as a trout. Later, when the interview appeared, overprinted on Miranda's scrawly, twiddly and multicoloured impressions of the shoot, it was translated and edited to read (though it was rather hard to decrypt from the graphics): Blot : You've said, Jean-Claude, that the problem isn't making political films but making films politically. Could you explain what you mean by that? Meursault: We're living in an arsehole culture [une civilisation de cul ]. Shit rules it, and what else is shit but money? Money is politics — you try and make a film like this and you'll discover that — and money is shit — so where does that leave politics? Blot : That sounds as if you think we're caught in a double bind from which there's no escape. Meursault (with a gallic shrug): What is oppression? Us. What is liberation? Us. No, I'm not depressed. I like shit. Blot : In earlier films, you've suggested that female sexuality and capitalist codes of production are intertwined; with this new film you're turning your attention to the position of blacks in our society. Do you think there's a similarity? Meursault: If I made you suck my cock, this would be political. If I make a black man sweep up my trash, empty my dustbins, wash the vomit from my floor and kill for me in my imperialist wars…well, what do you think? The difference is that women collude in their subjection. They think it's power. The blacks don't — they don't even have an illusion of power. (He shrugged, gestured towards the actors with the tip of his Gitane.) Except, of course, these rebels. Blot (Miranda had missed a beat as she translated back in her  head the French phrase ‘sucer ma queue ’, which M. Apéritif and others of her circle had not used — in conversation. She thought, listening to the famous film director, that she had not had an experience of oppression, of violence, at least she had not experienced her life in those terms): Your interpretation of women sees them as objects of desire, images in advertisements, pin-ups — how are you going to express the inner thoughts of Black Panthers? Isn't the consciousness of the blacks even more closed to us than women's? Meursault: I don't think there's a way of entering inside someone's head. The interior is a hall of mirrors — a sequence of traps, lies. You know that, about yourself. (She had started, but kept on scribbling notes.) No, the way to interpret the inside is by assembling the exterior with all the means you have: you will find that this aesthetic process yields the moral. Or the lack of moral. Ethics and aesthetics cannot be held apart. (At this point, Meursault looked up at her for a moment, seemed to appraise her, then back down to his hands, and commented, ‘With such good French, there's a man in the story.’ Miranda let it pass, though his assumption of a single owner rather riled her. He went on, he was now in free flow): The great lie of the last two hundred years has been the mistaken idea that realism is a way of telling the truth. Is Shakespeare realistic? I like it very much when Othello says, ‘Rude am I in my speech’, and then speaks like eloquence itself. That is Art. That is the essence of Art. Do you think Hamlet the Dane spoke such beautiful English? And Racine's Phèdre, organising her sentences in such poised alexandrins , does she talk like a woman driven mad for love? My films never pretend to be anything but artefacts — they're unnatural, contrived, fashioned, unrealistic, on purpose. They're directed. I make dramatic tableaux. Like this one. Not vérité photographs — pretending there isn't a mind behind the camera or a finger on the button. (Jean-Claude Meursault leaned over, and tweaking the sheet of questions from Miranda, continued): But this is boring as shit. People always talk to my reputation. It's a bore. I'm  making this film now because… I couldn't get the money for the film I wanted to make. I do not know — I could not tell you or… Blot what my film means. I make a montage . You might say reality is stranger than fiction. I say, fiction is always much stranger than reality. (Meursault drew on his butt and looked down at his hands, clasped in his lap.) ‘Now we have to shoot again,’ he said, and stood up. ‘Great stuff, Miranda,’ the thin fair man would say, when she handed in the transcript. ‘Shame it's small pickings, though.’ He turned the two sheets as if hoping to find them double-sided. Miranda did not tell him why she had not had the nerve to buttonhole Meursault again, in a later break in the filming. The Blot editor understood, he said, giving her a spacey grin, ‘He was abrasive, hell, no shit. I can see he made it tough for you.’ He almost winked, he liked the man's upfrontness, this was the era when honesty was prized above all virtues. So she did not tell him that she was too shaky later to resume the conversation for a different reason; she did not describe to him — or to the readers of Blot — what ensued. For it turned out that she felt protective towards the actor George Felix and preferred to keep their encounter private. And she had an incoherent sense that he and she together were being pushed in squares of black-and-white across the game board, and she didn't want to comply with the games masters by speaking aloud, let alone complaining, of the antagonisms they orchestrated. When the interview ended, and Jean-Claude Meursault had risen, shaken her hand gravely, and then quickly joined the group around the camera at the end of the track to Miranda's right, she began sketching in her small pad and taking the occasional photograph when the noise levels permitted. The scene began again: the drone of the invective started up as one actor read: ‘A cult of death, /need of the simple striking arm under/the street lamp. The cutters, from under/their rented earth. Come  up, black dada/nihilismus. Rape the white girls. Rape/their fathers. Cut the mothers' throats.’ The girl in the mack was scrambling again through the puddles in the dirt of the wreckers' yard; the invisible and soundless shots from out of frame felled her at a signal from Jean-Claude and the partisans rose from the auto hulks, their own guns blazing. After the call came, ‘Print’, Miranda stayed focused on the group of three actors. She'd work from the photographs later: one of them was chunky, the full lines of his mouth emphasised by the trim of his moustache and beard. The other two men were taller, one lanky, with slow flapping hands as he walked —; Miranda guessed he had not lived in London long. The third was the youngest, square-set, and of the three, looked most like an actor dressed up in costume for a part. She was becoming excited by what she was getting, she could develop it later into an almost sculptural grouping of their limbs and heads, when the third Panther broke from his two companions and came striding towards her. She was caught up in her work, in the looking it required, a gaze that was intense and scrutinising without allowing any personal exchange of feeling to take place, when he was all at once bearing down on her, shouting, his right fist tight around his weapon, his left hand hitting the air and pointing at her with accusing index finger. She dropped the camera from her face as the lens filled with his anger, and he receded to a safe distance from her; but he was still bearing down, yelling, ‘What the fuck is going on? Who gave permission for this? I want you to know round here that if anyone's taking pictures, you better ask George Felix before.’ He was getting closer and still shouting: ‘No jumped-up photographer comes to this set and uses my image without my saying so, you hearing me, you hearing me right? ‘Some bitch exploiting me, joining in the fucking imperialist adventure, selling my image…’ He thumped his chest with his gun. ‘Oh baby, you just go right ahead and grab what you can when you can.’ She was waving her hands at him to deny what he was  saying; the press girl was running up, but Jean-Claude, she realised later, as she reconstructed the scene in her mind, was leaning up against the cameraman's steel chair on the travelling rig and smoking, his hands cupped over his mouth as he did so, like a wise monkey hiding his speaking, his eyes half-closed behind his glasses, more lizard now than trout. She said to George Felix, ‘I'm from Blot .’ ‘What shit, Blot? Who wants to know about Blot?’ He reached her, he was face to face with her, the press girl Annabel was plucking at his clinging black roll-neck's sleeve gingerly, with her fingertips. ‘George, keep cool, okay? Blot's an alternative paper. They're doing a story on Jean-Claude — I should have asked you. I didn't, it's my fault. I'm sorry.’ He shook her off, with a toss of the head; Miranda saw all of a sudden the theatricality of the gesture, and something inside her relaxed. George Felix was surely in a rage, but he was also enjoying being angry, and that was something that never happened to her father, whose rages had made anger such a familiar monster. If only Kit could enjoy the scenes he made, she thought, instead of being eaten alive with remorse, and she stuttered in response to the Panther's exaltation, ‘I'm with you, I didn't want to do anything you wouldn't like.’ She made a gesture of pledging, her hand hovering over her heart. ‘I didn't have a moment to ask…’ ‘You hear that, the fuck you hear that, one and all?’ He flung both arms out, the one with the gun aloft, and bowed in the direction of his two companions. They were idling uncomfortably behind him, neither reinforcing his fury, nor retreating from support altogether. The older man shook his head slightly, his mouth made a round shape, ‘Aw, come on, cut it out, man,’(but not loud enough to be heard). And George Felix plunged on, ‘Aha, Whitey just didn't get a chance to ask. And isn't that just the case with everything you gone and done over the centuries of black oppression? You never had the chance to ask —; the slaves, the chain gang, the artists who got burned out making entertainment for you and looking real pretty for you, taking Whitey's junk, the white pigs’ white junk. Oh baby, you're one hell of a fantastic heap of self-delusion, you say you're on my side. You bourgeois liberals — you're the pits. I'd rather have a racist straight up and on the rocks any day. You don't know shit.’ He threw out his hands again and set a grin through clenched teeth on his burning face. ‘Aw, shit, just take my picture! Go right ahead, don't ask me how I feel.’ He hadn't hit her, or snatched her camera, but stood square to her, holding his hands up as if he knew not to, bouncing on the balls of his feet, while Jean-Claude and his group looked on, keeping very still, and Miranda wondered, for a moment, if the camera were rolling, for she felt on display under George's attack. She was trembling, hot tears sprang to her eyes, she wanted to cover her face with her hands, but did not dare attempt such a defending gesture for it would have seemed a patent provocation; besides she knew how to stand in the face of anger. And at the same time the racing of her blood was only partly fear, and she could see that he knew it, that he had discovered this power and tuned it to performance pitch, that the insults were a kind of invitation, the display of force a plea turned upside down, and she also wanted, because she longed to please, to take off her clothes then and there and let him down from his prideful pose, and soothe him with her obedience to his rage. She was like a young dog, the kind her mother scorned, and she could only leap and lick after a blow such as he had fetched her. ‘You might like the results, I turn them into drawings, I don't just use them as photographs.’ Childhood in the wings of her mother and father's raging had taught her a degree of courage; she never ran away from anger. He snorted. She kept on, her fatuousness was her gift to him, a kind of amends, to prove him right. ‘You could see them beforehand — of course we wouldn't publish anything without showing you.’ Her voice sounded tinkly to her ears, tinkly and absurdly well-brought up; his own voice was vibrant, an actor's timbre, trained to come from deep in the diaphragm, while his accent  slid around, hinting at American films and North London schooling and drama classes, and beneath these layers, the islands' underswell rose. So that from the sound of him she grasped the archaeology of his life. His eyes opened wide at her. ‘Aw, shit, you think I care?’ He made a fist and shot it in the air by her cheek. She dropped her gaze, flinched, she wanted to say, again, absurdly, ‘I'm with you, all the way. I'm on your side, I'll always be on your side. I can't tell you how bad it feels to be one of them; besides, I've not chosen… I don't want to be a member of the…to be bourgeois.’ She knew she was foolish, she heard herself clearly. It was the end of the decade, and she was labelled with the name of the criminal class. She couldn't defend herself without rousing him to greater ferocity; she knew that in the moment of conflict, an enemy can never protest to be a friend and be believed; she had seen the distrust Kit's sudden switches of mood inspired. Indeed, she would have liked to tell him about her father who was called Nigger Everard at school and spurned in his own family because his mother had been Creole; she wanted to tell him about Feeny whom she loved; how she herself was a musty, couldn't he see it? She didn't because the moment was not right; she did not yet know that she could not plead from her position of privilege that she had suffered too —‘So you want to annex our wrongs as well, do you?’ he might well have answered to her in just bitterness. This, Miranda did not yet understand. That day, she only realised that nobody wants their special enemy, chosen with care and attacked with force, to renounce the role and throw down arms and instead bare their breasts for an embrace. Jean-Claude joined them, made a puffy sound through his smoke and laid a hand on the arm of George Felix. ‘Let's make movies, huh?’ he said in English, and gave Miranda a smile from the corner of his mouth as he steered the actor away. Her knees were weak, and she sat down on a chair the press rep brought over for her; she could not have trusted her legs to walk over to it. She felt vaguely flattered, it was odd. Jean-Claude's  sidelong half-smile had felt congratulatory. She took the cup of tea she was offered and did not stop Annabel spooning sugar into it. ‘Two, three?’ ‘That's fine, thanks.’ She drank it, it was consoling. Her father's bouts of fury weren't strategic, they never achieved anything but trouble for him: there were some houses, she knew, where he had played and was no longer welcome because he'd made a scene. Never about bad cards, of course, he was much too professional for that, never about the fall of the dice in backgammon; he had himself under control — just — when his bridge partner made a miscalculation and played unnecessarily into an opponent's finesse. But he could be touchpaper, and a spark from a fancied slight, a disagreement over politics, a moment of heedlessness from someone, and he would catch and soon the conflagration was at full blast consuming everything in its path: new friendships, old friendships, new clients, his reputation, his wife's love, even that. Astrid, who had once found him such fun, was fed up with his tinder temper. She wouldn't stop at his side any more to watch him play, though he liked her to, for she was his lucky charm, and her presence concentrated his mind wonderfully. Or so Kit said. Annabel's briskness brought Miranda back to herself; she'd had it easy, and besides, in her case, when people had noticed the caramel flavour of her looks, as they had in Paris, it had worked to her advantage. She really wasn't a beautiful young woman, not like Xanthe; her features were irregular and plumpish, however thin the rest of her body became. But the touch of the exotic in her appearance improved the effect she made. She hadn't suffered injury or contempt; she had no reason to blaze, unlike George Felix. To others she merely looked a bit different, and it lent her glamour, but to him, she was as different as anyone who wasn't black. She looked across at the scene as once again the actress ran and fell and the gunmen rose from the car wrecks where the nudes lay or sat reading aloud. She wanted to tell someone how it had counted for her rather than against her; how in that  dimming world of the Left Bank nearly ten years before, she'd set lovers adrift on Gauguinesque, and Baudelairean voyages of luxe, calme et volupté . Then she thought, But I should declare my allegiance now. ‘You okay then?’ inquired Annabel. ‘Don't give it a thought. He's just a bit uptight — filming's tough. We've been at it since six.’ ‘I can't help feeling guilty, though. Classic liberal guilt —; would like to do something, but can't think what.’ ‘Not true, no way,’ Annabel smiled firmly. ‘We're changing everything! Look at the movies — think of Jean-Claude's movies! They're just unimaginably different from anything that's happened before and they're changing everything. There aren't any barriers, no holds barred, nothing we can't do now! ‘You only have to want it and want it enough.’ Then she added, giving Miranda's arm a squeeze, ‘Just do it, darling, like the man says. Do it!’"
FIC FIC-G0Y-004 -0.19 "8 ‘Thank you,’ said Louise. ‘It's exactly what I need. However did you guess? Mind, God knows why I keep on recording the children for posterity, the way they are now. When I look back I could weep — dear little things tottering about on beaches. Phil hasn't addressed a civil word to us in weeks. Anyway — thanks.’ ‘It's from Edward too.’ ‘I took that as read. Since when did Edward go shopping on his own behalf? Where is he, anyway?’ ‘In the Britches, I think. He's been trying to do something about the brambles and nettles.’ Louise flopped on to the sofa. ‘How did you enjoy your day in London?’ ‘It had its moments,’ said Helen evasively. ‘What about the investment people?’ ‘They made it fairly clear we were too small fry for them. And the place was more like a botanical gardens than an office.’ ‘Tim knows some other people. I'll tell him to…’ ‘No,’ said Helen. ‘We have still to recover from those.’ ‘Think about it,’ conceded Louise. ‘So what did you do after that — it can't have taken you all day?’ ‘We had lunch in that restaurant in South Kensington.’ ‘It doesn't exist any more.’ ‘Exactly,’ said Helen. ‘So we discovered. We had lunch on its ashes, as it were. Then we went shopping.’ ‘Well! Quite a spree! Very good for you both.’ ‘Don't patronise,’ said Helen. ‘We're less socially disadvantaged than you imagine. The village provides resources undreamed of in Camden Town. Though I will admit that I find London disconcerting these days. The landscape. Everything  seems to be built of mirrors — what on earth has happened to brick? But I grant you that I'm behind the times in some ways. Architecture and offices full of botanical specimens are the least of it. Social etiquette, for instance… What's done and what isn't.’ She shot her sister a crafty glance. ‘Most of it is quite irrelevant to me, of course, but one keeps a sort of technical interest.’ ‘Huh?’ said Louise. ‘What are you blathering on about?’ ‘Oh, I don't know… How people behave… Men and women, for instance. Such as… Do women take the initiative nowadays?’ She felt the beginnings of a disastrous blush and busied herself with a dirty mark on the window, getting out her handkerchief and scrubbing, her back to Louise. ‘I mean — time was, you wouldn't… Nowadays, would they ring up first — that sort of thing?’ ‘How should I know?’ said Louise sourly. ‘I'm married, aren't I?’ ‘Well…your friends…’ Helen persisted. ‘For instance, if someone hadn't heard from a man friend for — oh, for a couple of weeks or so-when he'd said vaguely he'd ring — I mean, she might wonder if there was something wrong, if he was ill, or if she'd offended in some way. Would she feel nowadays it was up to her to make contact?’ ‘Look, what is all this?’ demanded Louise. ‘I'm just curious. Detached interest. One ought to know how things are. If they've changed or not.’ ‘You are a funny old thing,’ said Louise. ‘You're making that window worse, you know. Haven't you got any Windowlene? Actually so far as I can see it's sod's law for women, just as it always has been. You know my friend Judith? Well, she's been having an affair with this bloke for the last year or so and then out of the blue he turned round and… Here's Edward. Open the window and he can come in this way.’ Edward was advancing across the lawn. ‘What did he turn round and do?’ said Helen. ‘Oh, some other time… Hi! Thanks for the birthday present.’ Edward came in at the french window and stared blankly at  his younger sister. After a moment he said ‘Oh… Yes.’ And then, ‘Many happy returns of the day. How old are you?’ ‘It's next week, not today. And I'll be forty-three for Christ's sake. There's this piece of contemporary mythology that the forties are the best time of your life. A load of cock, so far as I'm concerned. What about you?’ But Edward had lost interest, apparently. He turned to Helen. ‘Have we got any wire anywhere? I want to mend the fence.’ The question of age, in fact, filled his head these days, but it was not a matter he wanted to discuss with Louise. Or indeed with anyone. He did not want to be young again — that time had had particular and transcendent horrors — but the thought of being any older filled him with panic. He could not imagine finding tranquillity of soul in old age; if he could only be allowed to mark time for a while all might yet be well, one might suddenly achieve equilibrium, certainty, serenity. There would still be possibilities. Hopes. When his mother died it was as though his youth began to slip out of sight. Her existence, he now realised, had implications far beyond her abrasive and insistent presence: it had tethered him to a distant shore. Now, the shore was fading and there was no going back. And every now and then there came these appalling moments when feeling boiled, when, it seemed to him, he became slightly mad. Most of the time one was all right— or at least as all right as one had ever been — and then out of the blue it struck, a hideous uprush of fear, of longing, of shame. It could be prompted by anything, or nothing. It could come in the wastes of the night, or at the most humdrum moments of the day. It had surged forth in that dreadful shop in London, when he had stood transfixed — not, as Helen thought, by bunches of guinea-fowl but by the bare arms of the butcher's lad adroitly trimming a carcass on a block beneath. The boy was done up in a long striped apron and straw boater in arch Victorian pastiche but his arms were all that Edward saw: young, dusted with golden hairs  and somehow indisputably male. Beautiful arms; he looked at them and wanted to cry. He could fend them off, the appalling moments. Fight them. The thing was to keep occupied. He banged about in the scullery, hunting for wire. He would make the Britches impenetrable, tackle the dead trees and plant saplings. As soon as Louise had left, Helen went to the telephone. She picked up the receiver, dialled Giles Carnaby's number, and then replaced the receiver before the connection was made. She wasn't quite ready yet, after all. In fifteen minutes' time, she told herself sternly. Just a little longer to get oneself into the right frame of mind, run over the right casual, uncommitted phrases. ‘It just occurred to me you might like to…’; ‘If you're free on Wednesday, I thought maybe…’ She too resolved on activity. She had been intending for days to make a start on clearing out the cloakroom; now was the moment — she would make a preliminary survey, set aside what should be kept, see if there was anything good enough for Oxfam. Then, suitably relaxed, she would telephone Giles. Properly. The cloakroom led off the hall. It was large, ill-lit, exceptionally cold, and housed a primitive washbasin; the lavatory was separate, an internal room of its own. The walls were lined with layers of raincoats of a uniform dun, as though their colours had run together; they went back years — some had even belonged to her father and were so stiff and cracked that they could have stood unsupported. There was a pair of mackintosh waders; there were shooting-sticks and an Egyptian fly-whisk and an alpenstock. The pegs above the raincoats were occupied by assorted headgear — berets and peaked caps, a riding bowler, sou'westers, knitted hats, deerstalkers. Everything had associations — Dorothy's, Edward's, given by so-and-so, bought on a particular holiday, left behind by relative or friend; Helen saw an insistent kaleidoscope of references, shimmering tiresomely behind the garments and the implements, as ineradicable as the blackberry stains on a sleeve or the ingrained mud on everything. And the whole lot smelt — a pervasive stench of damp and mildew. High time something was done about it. Starting in one corner, Helen began to lift garments from pegs and drop them on the floor in a pile — a mack of her father's, something of Edward's not worn within living memory, a very ancient corduroy jacket of Dorothy's, also unused for many a year. It occurred to her that it might be wise to go through the pockets; her father's garment yielded an old penny and a broken pipe. In Dorothy's jacket was a letter. Unopened and addressed to Helen. She knew the handwriting at once, of course . Until ten years or so ago a bundle of similar envelopes had lain in a drawer of her desk; one day in a fit of vigour she had torn them up and thrown them away. She sat down on the battered settle and opened the letter. ‘Dearest Helen,’ he began; that was interesting — the letters in the destroyed bundle usually began with ‘Dear’or ‘My dear’. He went on to say that he felt they were both being rather silly and he wanted to make amends. He was missing her, he said. He had phoned a couple of times but she had been out. Anyway, maybe he could say what he felt more easily in a letter. She knew he wasn't good at expressing himself. If she was still cross with him please would she stop. He was sorry about what was mainly a misunderstanding. He wanted very much to talk to her. There was something in particular he wanted to talk about. Please would she meet him for a long dinner on Friday — he would expect to hear from her tomorrow or the next day. He signed himself ‘With a great deal of love — Peter.’ The postmark on the envelope was March 10th 1965. The hand of fate is brutal but impersonal. The hand of one's mother is something different. Witting or unwitting? Carelessness — the thing picked up off the hall mat, thrust into her pocket and forgotten — or deliberate appropriation? If the latter — why had she not gone the whole hog and burned it? Well, one would never know and either way the effect was the same. Helen began to shake. She saw her own hands with a certain detachment, holding the letter and trembling convulsively. She did not otherwise feel at all detached. Her mind raced. A number  of things fell into place — click, click, click — with distant muffled echoes like stones dropped into a well. That time. The tiff. The coolness about…about what had it been? ‘A misunderstanding’. Those weeks, not seeing him, wondering, too proud to make the first move. And weeks becoming a month, two months, three…a year. Anger giving way to misery and then to regret and eventually to…nothing. Until now, when one sat here in the cloakroom, surrounded by old raincoats, shaking as though struck down by fever. One could, presumably, trace Peter Datchett. It would be relatively simple — she could think at once of how it could be done: the casual enquiry of a mutual friend with whom she still exchanged Christmas cards, the phone call to the college at which he had been a lecturer. And then the reply: ‘Dear Peter, I have at last received your letter of March 10th 1965. I hope it is not too late to say yes, I'd like very much to have dinner on Friday and I too feel we've been rather silly and it has all been a misunderstanding…’ And there is Peter, on the receiving end, opening it over breakfast with his wife and children…no, children if any are flown by now, Peter is fifty-six…with his wife (and the wife one is of course assuming, merely, but the assumption seems reasonable enough, things being what they are), who says ‘Who's that from?’ And he shoves it in his pocket with some dismissive remark and wonders what the hell he is to do. How embarrassing, he thinks. God — poor old Helen. No, one will not set about tracing Peter Datchett. At this precise moment, thought Helen, I hate my mother. It was a refreshing feeling — invigorating, even. And worth indulging: it stifled various other feelings. She knew that she would not have lived happily ever after with Peter Datchett. No one lives happily ever after. Very likely there would have been a further coolness or misunderstanding and they would have parted. The point was that one would never know, now. And so would wonder, and go on wondering. One would construct alternative scenarios, and brood about them. One would furnish houses and arrange landscapes; one might go  dangerously far and people them with…children. One would conjure up occasions; things would be said and done. All this thanks to Dorothy. Still ordaining. No, said Helen. She rose from the settle. She put the letter in her pocket. In due course she would dispose of it, but not just yet. Think of what was, she told herself, since only that is relevant. What might have been is neither here nor there. She tried to reconstruct the physical Peter Datchett: tall, thin, black hair that tended to flop forwards, a mole on one cheek. He taught at the College of Further Education a few miles from Spaxton; she had met him through a rambling club. His physical presence was all mixed up with muddy tracks, overgrown woodland paths, rain and barbed wire fences and glasses of beer in steamy pubs. And then of course the relationship had become more personal and exclusive: lunches and dinners, films, visits to stately homes or places of scenic interest. Intimacy, of a kind; they were both reserved people, they didn't rush things. She did not remember passion, but a certain eroticism — that, definitely. They were on the brink of sex; it was a matter of time, she had known — next week, the one after. She had explained to him about her mother; he had met her mother; he had seemed to size up the problem, had said the right things in his oblique way. Dorothy had referred to him as ‘that chap with the birthmark on his face.’ Love? It had been in the air, certainly — around the corner, along with sex. What she remembered was a sense of expectancy, of confident expectancy. They had been a unit, had shared jokes, exchanged small gifts, written to each other when unable to meet for a week or two; the assumption was always that this would continue, and expand. Why didn't he write again? Telephone? Arrive on the doorstep? Because, thought Helen, he was as he was. Reserved; a touch diffident. And why did I do nothing? Ditto. She went out into the hall. She picked up the receiver and dialled Giles Carnaby's number. The ringing tone came: once, twice, six times… Out, she thought. Good. Reprieved. But honour is satisfied. You can put the thing down. ‘Hello?’ said Giles. ‘Oh.’ The prepared words evaporated. ‘Is that…? Could I speak to Giles Carnaby?’ ‘You are.’ ‘This is Helen Glover.’ ‘But how very nice. I didn't recognise your voice.’ ‘I was wondering…’ ‘And I'd been thinking of you only yesterday. How are you?’ ‘Very well. I wondered if…’ ‘Your mother's affairs progress. Slowly, as I'm afraid is always the case. The Probate Office moves in its own mysterious way.’ ‘Actually,’ said Helen, ‘that wasn't what I was ringing about. My brother and I are having a few people in for a drink before lunch on Sunday. I wondered if you might be able to come.’ There. No going back now. ‘But I'd be delighted. What fun. Last weekend I was away but this one I'm as free as air. I shall look forward to it. By the way I've finished the Earl Grey. Things are getting desperate. And you never did come and have a cup.’ ‘Oh. No. You can buy it at the delicatessen in Long Barton, you know.’ ‘I'm never in that direction. Do you think you could get me a packet next time you're passing?’ ‘I'll try. I mean yes, I will.’ ‘Bless you. And thank you so much for ringing. What time?’ ‘Time?’ ‘On Sunday.’ ‘Oh — twelve, I think.’ ‘Twelve. Splendid. Till then.’ ‘We're having some people in for a drink on Sunday. Before lunch.’ Edward, dealing out Puffed Wheat to the birds, swung round sharply. ‘Whatever for?’ ‘I thought we should.’ ‘But we've never done it before.’ ‘It's the sort of thing that's done all the time, in other households.’ ‘I can't think why. Who, then?’ ‘Doctor Taylor and his wife, I thought. A few others from the village. And our solicitor, Giles Carnaby.’ ‘But you went to hear him sing,’ said Edward. ‘Surely that was quite enough.’ ‘They will arrive at twelve and stay probably for an hour and a half or so. I'll get the drink but you'll have to help pour it out. Is there anyone you'd like to ask?’ ‘Certainly not. And I hope this isn't going to be a precedent.’ She made telephone calls. She hoovered and dusted the sitting room. She found glasses that were unchipped and as nearly matching as possible. She bought sherry and white wine and whisky. She bought bags of little biscuity things. ‘You make me laugh,’ said her mother. ‘I never saw such a carry-on. Who do you think you're fooling?’ ‘Nobody,’ Helen replied. Least of all myself. ‘And that chap — Giles Thingy — do you imagine he's going to be taken in? A man like that.’ ‘Enough,’ said Helen. ‘You have no right. Nor ever did. From now on I'll be mine own executioner.’ ‘Whatever have you done to the cloakroom?’ complained Edward. ‘Cleared it out.’ ‘I liked it the way it was.’ ‘We've still got nine raincoats and anoraks between us. And eight different hats and an alpenstock and a flywhisk and four walking-sticks.’ ‘I used to enjoy the way you never knew what you'd come across next.’ ‘I don't share your feelings,’ said Helen. She considered making a ceremonial pyre. She would burn Peter Datchett's letter and that dress in one fine condemnatory blaze. There you are, mother — there they go, properly disposed of at last. A few years too late. Or did you always think they had  been? Were you careless or calculating? And what did you do it for? Were these sins of omission, or a devilish scheme? I can't know if you succeeded in changing the course of my life, but it's possible. And for a person in a somewhat delicate emotional condition, as I believe myself to be, this is hard to contemplate. She did not believe that marriage, or pairing, or however you cared to define a sexual relationship, was the key to happiness and fulfilment; you only had to look around you to see that this was not so. Which was worse — to have tried and failed or never to have tried at all? She thought of her father — that grey and distant figure associated only with anchovy paste and a rustling newspaper. It was not comfortable to consider her parents' intimate life; she could recall no demonstrations of affection or indeed even of much displayed interest in one another. Usually, Dorothy had been engaged in shifting her husband around like an inharmonious piece of furniture. His own image was one of compliant self-effacement. He went out to work by day, conveniently, at a firm of accountants; in the evenings and at weekends he made himself as unobtrusive as possible. God knows what went on at night. In the end she pushed the letter into the drawer of her desk and left the dress where it was, in the corner of the wardrobe. All in good time. Edward, practised in self-deception, forgot about the guests until Sunday morning and was therefore surprised to discover Helen, at ten-thirty, wearing unexpected clothes and straightening cushions in the sitting room. She was also flushed and evidently in a state of unrest, which made him feel chivalrous and sympathetic. He decided to be nice about the whole business, though he still could not see the point of it, and offered to put the little biscuity things into bowls. He gave some of them to Tam in the process. It was not so much that he had anything against people in general, more that he saw no purpose in deliberately setting up occasions on which you stood around trying to think of something to say. Moreover, the whole process was self-perpetuating; the guest became the host in an act of social revenge and thus it  went on for ever. The only sensible course was never to start it in the first place. He could not think what had got into Helen, normally as rational as himself about all this, or so he had thought. Nevertheless, when the doorbell rang he was ready and waiting, with an agreeable expression and a fluent command of what to offer by way of drink. He had been feeling a bit better for the last few days: He had repaired the fence between the Britches and Ron Paget's yard, filled two black plastic sacks with rubbish and had embarked on a vigorous assault upon dead and decaying trees. It all felt very positive and forward-looking. The visitors arrived. There were not enough of them to make the large Greystones sitting room look as though much was going on; people stood in small clumps, eyeing one another; awkward silences broke out. I told you so, thought Edward, ploughing valiantly around with a bottle in each hand. Tam scrabbled at each pair of legs in turn, remembering the biscuits; the more uninhibited guests kicked, furtively. Apart from the doctor and his wife and Giles Carnaby they were all people from the village who had not had an opportunity for a good look at the inside of Greystones for quite a while and were busy taking note. ‘I s'pose you may be thinking of selling the Britches now, Edward?’ asked a neighbour. ‘Oh no,’ said Edward. ‘There's no question of that.’ He couldn't remember her name; her face was as familiar to him as the frontage of the village shop or outline of the church tower; he had always been hopeless at names. The solicitor detached himself from another group and joined them. ‘Giles Carnaby — we haven't met. Your sister is busy hostessing so I'm introducing myself.’ ‘Oh,’ said Edward. ‘Yes. Hello. This is Mrs…’ He gazed wildly at the neighbour who said crossly, ‘Jean Powers. Actually Edward's known me for ten years, but there we are. You live in Spaxton, don't you?’ Edward, thinking with relief that he could leave them to it now, began to withdraw, clutching the bottles that gave him a certain exemption, free to come and go. The solicitor laid a hand on his arm, making Edward wince: he didn't like to be touched. ‘Were you talking about the famous Britches? Helen's told me so much about the place. May I have a conducted tour sometime?’ No you certainly can't, thought  Edward, and what's all this ‘Helen’ stuff? He said, ‘There's absolutely nothing to see and it's awfully full of nettles’; at the same moment Jean Powers was saying noisily that not a solitary soul had been into the Britches in years and the village wondered what Edward got up to in there — ha ha!— some people said he must be into black magic, or maybe he was growing cannabis. Edward laughed politely, slid from Carnaby's grip and edged towards the group by the window, who were talking about hedges in tones of some desperation. As he did so Helen passed him; her neck was red, a sure sign of agitation. She hissed, ‘Do do something about the Taylors and old Mrs Phipson. They've been stuck together for hours.’ ‘How?’ enquired Edward; he meant it — he had absolutely no idea of the mechanics involved. Helen gave him a look of fury. The group by the window turned to him anxiously: ‘Is that hedge yew, Edward? None of us can decide.’ Really, thought Edward, people must be out of their minds, submitting themselves to this sort of occasion quite voluntarily. Kill or cure, Helen had thought. As soon as she set eyes on Giles Carnaby again she knew that whatever it was it was not a case of cure; her heart thumped, she felt unstable. There he was. Here he was. Smiling at her over people's shoulders while she could not move because someone was telling her at length how much she must be missing her mother. And then she saw him talking to Edward and Jean Powers and then someone had mislaid their glass and she had to find another and then there was the problem of the Taylors and old Mrs Phipson. And then eventually she could cross the room towards him. ‘There you are,’ he said. ‘I have been most restrained — I could see you had your hands full. But I have met your brother at long last and Mrs Powers has been regaling me with the most fascinating pieces of village gossip.’ This set Jean Powers off on a torrent of exclamations and denials so that Helen could not have got a word in had she wished to; she stood and looked at Giles Carnaby and tried to be calm. She tried to see him dispassionately as a grey-haired solicitor rather too well endowed with easy charm; indeed, she  saw him thus, but she also saw him otherwise, and could not help herself. When he turned to look intently at Jean Powers she felt a twinge of jealousy; his arm, brushing momentarily against hers, made her tingle all over. This sort of thing was bad enough at eighteen, she thought; at my age it is ludicrous and humiliating. Jean Powers moved away. Giles said ‘Dear me, what a demanding woman. She's not a great friend, I hope? Anyway, now that I've got you to myself for a moment can we make some plans? First of all, am I going to be able to persuade you to…’ ‘Oh Helen!’ cried the doctor's wife, appearing at their side, ‘We're going to have to rush off, I'm afraid. John's on call today. But first I must just have a word with you about…’ She attended to the doctor's wife. She got the doctor and his wife into their coats and saw them out of the front door. She returned to the sitting room and struck Tam, who had knocked the bowl of biscuits from the table and was wolfing them off the carpet. She refilled three glasses. She went into the kitchen to see if there was another packet of biscuits. I am not enjoying myself, she thought — but then I was never supposed to, was I? She sought biscuits in the bread bin, the vegetable rack, on the dresser. No damn biscuits. Giles appeared. ‘Is there anything I can do? You look harassed.’ ‘I am harassed,’ said Helen. ‘Edward's wretched dog has eaten the biscuits.’ ‘People can live without biscuits.’ ‘I know,’ she replied. ‘But it doesn't seem so at this moment.’ I just may burst into tears, she thought. I just might, appallingly, sit down on the kitchen chair and start to weep… Giles put his hand on hers: ‘Stop worrying about the biscuits and talk to me. We were interrupted. I was in the middle of trying to find out if you'll come and have dinner with me next week. At home. I'm not much of a cook but I do a passable roast. Thursday? Friday?’ She subsided onto the chair. She was not, she found, going to burst into tears after all. The biscuits became unimportant, and the guests. ‘Thursday,’ she said. ‘I'm not doing anything on Thursday.’ The kitchen became a warm and friendly place; she sat in it smiling at Giles Carnaby. I'm happy, she thought in surprise, at this precise moment I am happy."
FIC FIC-GVL-002 -0.0099999999999999 "Part III Lady in the Dark  Sixteen SUSAN COULD have sworn the bullethole in Cook's forehead turned into an eye and winked at her. It was possible. In Dreams, anything was possible. She should know that. Still rattled, she walked away from the cab, leaving the remain in the front seat. The taxi hummed in the road, motor idling, meter ticking over. Traffic passed it by. Susan had tagged a uniformed cop on the beat ill the distance, and guessed she wouldn't want to talk to him about the corpse. She was new in the City. She didn't have any friends yet. Cook had been Daine's way of welcoming her, she thought. Just one of those casual I-can-do-anything-I-want-any-time-I-want-and-make-you-like-it gestures so beloved of megalomaniacs, mass murderers and the Gunmint. But if the news item in the Inquirer was the literal truth, Daine was dead. That wasn't likely. Although his brainwaves were doing some interesting things on the printouts, Dr Groome had monitored no major trauma. Susan suspected her quarry had decided to stop wearing his own face for a while, so he could deal with his guests. And Tom Tunney must have been absurdly easy to deal with. In a way, it was perfect: faced with a would-be assassin, Daine had had himself killed and set up his opponent to take the consequences. She was determined to be less biddable. If she could find somewhere dry, she would be able to go on the offensive. If the psychs were on line, Daine should be losing some of his control. Even if he had been gulped down by the City, Tunney should be making some difference, feeding in his own amendments. And Susan thought she could transform the entire environment once  she got a grip on it. After all, she had had more practice at manufacturing realities than Daine. Porno Dreams were of a notoriously low standard, blurry beyond the bedroom, giving the dreamer the feeling he was dybbukking a deep-sea diving suit rather than a human body. She stopped at a newsstand. It was different from the one where she had bought her extra, but it was also manned by Mickey Rooney. He must be a fixture of the cliche. Without pausing for wisecracks, she picked up a cheap map. Down the street a block or two, she found a spot under a grocer's awning where she could pore over the map. It unfolded from a slim oblong into a sheet-sized square that flapped and fought in the wind and didn't bear much resemblance to what she'd seen of the City so far. It was particularly vague around the edges. Susan intuited that the Dream was evolving fast, recasting its inhabitants, twisting its externals. Used to giving in to Dreams, she was learning how to fight back. This was no serial hallucination, in which the dreamer was trapped in the viewpoints of a succession of similies. Here, everyone who entered was free to be Dreamer. Daine needed that flexibility, but he must have been aware of the risks. He had been ready for Tunney. He thought he was ready for her. Beyond the curtain of rain, strange forms moved. Susan wished Daine would show himself so they could struggle mind to mind and settle this thing. But the City Father would be out there in his maze, sending his cat's paws into battle, wearing down his enemies, squeezing their minds. In particular, she expected perils out of the flatties — murderous hoodlums, crooked cops, knife-wielding janitors-but she knew that if he stretched his mind a touch, Daine could make anything or anyone in the City into a weapon. Here, she could as easily be killed by Shirley Temple, Elmer Fudd or Lou Costello as by Jack Palance, Freddy Krueger or Anthony Perkins. She tried to find herself on the map, but the printed boulevards and blocks writhed whenever she looked up at the street, making new patterns. Susan saw Escher mazes and Möbius strips. Annoyed, she crumpled the map and threw it into the gutter. It twisted into an origami boat and sailed off towards a sewer inlet. She heard an echo of the pirates' chorus from The Sea Hawk in the rain. The awning flew back with a chainsaw rasp, and a cascade of rainwater came down on her head. The raincoat kept most of it off, but her hair got a soaking even under her hood. She thought it dry, and it was, but she could not make a dent in the downpour itself. She reached out across the street and tried to get an idea of the shape of a building she could dimly see. Its dimensions were easy to get a hold on. A brownstone, three storeys tall, derelict, with a squared-off roof, an arch of chimneys, a child's picture arrangement of windows and an imposing front doorway. The windows were gone entirely or boarded over. She closed her eyes, but could still see the building. In her mind, she changed the picture. She stripped away the outer shell brick by brick, and massaged the essence of the structure, fashioning a gothic cathedral. Spires raised to the skies, lightning flashing around them, and windows filled with stained glass. The cathedral spread, squashing the buildings on either side like plasticine, then absorbing them entirely. Angels danced in the air and settled reverently into their alcoves. Paving stones stood up and were drawn into the new building. The process was silent. Susan opened her eyes, and surveyed her handiwork. It was crude, a trifle unfinished and unformed — in any other Dream, she would have researched the externals rather than built on a whim — but it was what she wanted. She willed the great wooden doors open, and crossed the street. Inside, it would at least be dry. She stepped through the doors, and found herself in total darkness. She had forgotten to imagine an interior. An easy mistake. She was used to fashioning scenery for the background. In Dreams, you always passed by more houses than you explored. There was no rain in the darkness, and she could make even its sound go away by concentrating hard for a few moments. In the darkness, the Dream was raw and formless. She made herself a cathedral, not quite in the spirit of the exterior, but roomy enough. The vast building gave her a feeling of power. Although she knew it must be tiny in comparison with the rest of the City,it felt enormous, and it was the feelings that counted. She made herself a pump organ, and Dreamed up a man to play it. Lord Roger Marshaller, the most nearly decent of Vanessa Vail's suitors, emerged from the sacristy and walked across the aisle to the organ. Susan had combined the faces of several older men — a teacher, a holomeister, some singers — she had  been smitten with between the ages of nine and twelve, then weathered them to make her composite even more appealing. Lord Roger was supposed to be a fantasy for bored romantics. His laughing blue eyes had steely grey flecks in them, and he was wont to pass huge, yet sensitive, fingers through his leonine mane of silver-grey hair. She had Dreamed Lord Roger as a former surgeon, still brooding because of his inability to save the life of his only child. He was also a Nobel laureate, a leading ice sculptor and a master horseman. Now, she gave him an unmatched musical talent too. She sat down, unnoticed, in a pew, while Lord Roger limbered up. He played scales, flexing his surgeon-sculptor's hands. Then, he launched into ‘Barbara Allen’. In Scarlet Town, where I was born There is a fair maid dwellin' Made every lad cry ‘lack-a-day’ For the love of Barbara Allen… Susan realised her mistake. A small jazz combo had popped out of nowhere and were arrayed around Lord Roger. A vocalist — Annie Belladonna, the teenage xenobiologist heroine of The Sewer Thing —enunciated the lyrics in Rosemary Clooney's voice. The music was sucking her in… 'TWAS in the merry month of May, When green buds they were swellin' And on his death-bed Sweet William lay For the love of Barbara Allen… The roof began to fade. Susan felt the rain come in. The music was louder in her mind, louder than anything. More and more instruments took up the melody, drowning out the frail lyric line. A choir appeared behind the altar, offering peculiar harmonies. The children opened too-large mouths in otherwise blank faces. The improvisation stretched on, drawing Susan into it, locking into set patterns of repetition which were as fascinating as the gaze of a cobra. The number might never end, and Susan would be caught for ever. With a painful effort, she banished the music, and the cathedral fell silent. Annie Belladonna, the musicians, the choir, all  were gone. Lord Roger slumped over the organ keyboard, the life whipped out of him. She gave it back, but he could only move jerkily, like an unwieldy puppet. Susan made him climb down from the organ and walk over to her, but his uncoordinated limbs reminded her too much of the zombies in Corin Santangelo's horror Dream Eyeball Gougers from Italy. She didn't want to see what she had done to his craggy yet handsome face, so she made him go away. He whisped out of his clothes, which hung man-shaped in the air for a second and then drifted to the floor. She would have to be careful about her overconfidence binges. Outside the cathedral, there would be a chauffeur-driven skimmer waiting for her. A sports model, with an andrew to pilot it. She was right, only the anachronisms she tried to wedge into Daine's Dream didn't take. The skimmer was a long, black automobile. And the chauffeur was a liveried war veteran with a steel face and leather hands. That would just have to do. She got into the back of the car, and was glad to see her unconscious had had the foresight to include a bar. She poured herself a shot and knocked it back. It stung the back of her throat and fired in her belly. Shaking her head at the kick, she lashed out at the whole row of stores opposite her cathedral and dispelled them to dust. Gushers rose from disconnected water pipes, and the Dream matter sludged instantly. Without being told, the chauffeur drove away. She was back in a vehicle again, but this time it was hers. She wondered how much control she had over the chauffeur. After Lord Roger, she intended to be careful. You couldn't just make and unmake people at will without working at it. Also, she would have to find Daine. Best to start at the top. ‘City Hall,’ she said. ‘I have to see a mayor.’ Seventeen STEELFACE KNEW how to get to City Hall. Susan suspected Daine was making it easy. He thought he could mindblast her as simply as he had put Tunney out of the picture. And, he was probably curious about her. She mightn't be much, but in the self-awareness and independence stakes she was the only girl in town. This might be his idea of an escape, but in Daine's position she thought she'd go zoidal. She imagined a lifetime among her own Dreamed creations, knowing exactly what they would say next, exactly what was around every corner. No matter how vast a universe he made, Daine would still be trapped by the limits of his own imagination. He was probably far gone enough not to realise yet that he had jumped from one box into a smaller one. All roads probably led to City Hall. Her chauffeur got her there with the minimum of distraction. There weren't any incidents to get in the way. No car chases or police roadblocks. Insofar as the City had a business and commercial district, this was it. There were election posters up for the mayoral race. James Stewart was running against the incumbent, Brian Donlevy. Neither of them appeared to represent any particular party, and the election was being fought entirely on personalities. Stewart's slogan was ‘War on Graft’, Donlevy's ‘Doing Things the Way They've Always Been Done’. Susan knew Stewart would win the election but never take office. That was how the story always goes: the young reformer wins in the end, but by the next picture the corrupt machine politicians are still in power. She wondered if Jimmy ever got tired of the cycle. She kept seeing copperplate graffiti on Stewart's posters, ‘You can't fight City Hall.’ Things  weren't all that different back in the real world, she thought. The City's administrative centre was like a giant-scaled village green, with three imposing municipal erections boxing it in. City Hall, Police Headquarters and the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Building. City Square was a cheerless park, with arrangements of black, white and grey flowers in beds, grey stretches of grass, and a monumental, black, floodlit statue of Truro Daine dressed as a Roman emperor, fiddle tucked under his chin, bow poised to saw down. Susan had her chauffeur draw into a space beside City Hall marked RESERVED, and got out of the car. The square was empty, except for a pair of winos sleeping it off under the statue. She looked up at the statue and laughed. The black brows knit, and solid silver laurels bobbed. Like many great villains, Daine must have no conception of how ludicrous he appeared much of the time. ‘Are you really in there, Daine?’ she shouted. Gigantic arms moved, and music was shaken from the stone violin. ‘The Devil's Trill’ by Tartini. More delusions of grandeur. Although the music was animated, only the arms moved. The face was frozen now, and the rest of the body was stone dead. Over the shriek of the tune, Susan asked a question. ‘Daine, do you know anything about Japanese monster flatties?’ She sat cross-legged on the grass and reached out to the bay. Casting her mind deep into the black waters, she created a whirlpool. It started as a funnelling current the size of a sea horse, then lengthened, sucking in a core of air. She made that air solid, and drew in stuff from the water and clouds of spinning gravel. Daine had made the bottom of his sea loose, like a big fishtank. She imagined a musculature, a skeleton, a hide, pumping organs, glowing eyes. As her creation grew in strength, so she felt her own on the rise. Her upper arms began to swell, stretching tight the fabric of her suit. She caught it in time, and had them dwindle a little. She couldn't afford a Hulk-out now. The two winos had been shocked awake by the infernal music, and scurried away from the statue. ‘Hey, lady,’ said one rummy, Walter Brennan, ‘wuz you ever stung by a dead bee?’ They kept running, and were gone before Susan had a chance  to figure out what that meant and whether she should answer it. The statue kept playing. The ground of the park rippled as if disturbed by colossal, underground moles. Gophers, rather: moles would be gophers here. Susan felt the power in the earth shaking up through her body. Out on the bay, something enormous broke the surface. Miniature tidal waves swept up against the waterfront, tearing piers and jetties away, spilling over into the maze of streets, driving a human exodus before them. Susan dipped into her new toy, seeing the City spread out like a model in front of its water-washed eyes. She roared her delight, and clapped house-sized hands in the air above her scaled head. She lashed out with her tail, overturning ships, smashing down a lighthouse. Waves surged around her gargantuan thighs as she waded towards the shore. Back as Susan, she heard her own voice, distorted by its passage through the cavernous reptile throat, shouting out in defiance. The ground still shook in time with the footsteps of the great beast. Whole sections of the City were trampled flat, buildings going down like balsa wood. Streets buckled, cars flew through the air like nursery toys, and matchstick model pylons flew apart. Susan held her hands up in the air, and felt those other, claw-tipped hands tearing down Daine's Dream. Cuts and weals appeared where her surrogate hurt itself in its destructive frenzy, but she smoothed them away with a flick of her mind. People ran through the square, screaming in Japanese. A rag-tag convoy in half-tracks and armoured cars passed by City Hall, their outriders churning up the flower beds. No one bothered Susan. She saw Charlton Heston standing up in a jeep, dressed as a desert general, his shirt open to the waist, binoculars hanging against his hairy chest. He signed his troops to move out. Artillery batteries opened up. The army couldn't stop it. A tank hurled across the square, just missing the still-fiddling statue, and crunched into the side of the MGM Building. It lodged in the shattered brickwork as a million windows fell in tinkling shards to the sidewalk. The truck-sized stone Ars Gratia Artis lion on the roof mewled and leaped for a safer perch. Gunfire sounded like Chinese fireworks, and the great beast shrugged off the hurt as if it had been inconvenienced by gnats. A squadron of biplanes flew low over the City, machine guns chattering. The Dawn Patrol was early. Susan heard them being knocked out of the skies. A bipedal beagle tall as a child, with a flying helmet and goggles, climbed out of a wrecked Sopwith Camel and brushed himself off, barking in pain. So much for Biggles and the Red Baron. The air force couldn't stop it either. Then Susan's monster was in the square, towering above Daine's statue. She had seen a lot of Japanese kaiju eiga flatties as a child thanks to a quirk of her father's, and had now been able to draw on her memories of them. For her creation she had combined Godzilla the King of Monsters, Ghidrah the Three-Headed Monster, Gappa the Triphibian Monster, Guilala the X from Outer Space, Gamera the Giant Flying Turtle and Hedorah the Smog Monster. The enormous hybrid flexed its non-functional wings, breathed atomic fire down on the City, and thumped the ground with its 500 foot tail. Daine's statue shook but didn't miss a note. Susan shut her eyes and saw through her monster's. The tiny black fiddler irritated her with his scratchy, wasplike buzzing. She raised a flipper-clawed foot, and a shadow the size of a meltdown scar fell over the busy-armed figure. Susan felt something pull her tail, and was rudely dislodged from the creature. as if slapped across the face, she opened her eyes and looked up as her monster was tugged off its feet by invisible forces. She saw it struggling against a mighty wind, but unable to smite anything tangible within its. reach. Its tail dangled useless, like the broken arm of a bendy rubber doll. The monster was sucked upwards. Increasing distance made it shrink as it rose, until at an unimaginable height it was not larger to her eye than a small bird. Then, tiny in the sky, it burst into a black cloud and was gone. Susan rubbed her smarting eyes. All was quiet now, except for the gentle rain and Daine's music. The square was undisturbed. The MGM windows were smoothly unbroken, the lion still vigilant on the roof. The grass was level, the flower beds in order. She could see no wrecked cars, planes, military vehicles. The trill sawed to a finish, and even the echo of the notes faded. The statue was unmoving again. ‘What do you want to call that, Daine? A draw? Too easy  This is Susan Bishopric here. I've won one Rodney, and I'll have a shitload more this autumn. I can Dream rings around you, and you ain't seen nothin' yet!’ One of the statue's black marble eyes winked at her. Eighteen IT FELT as if an earthquake had just hit the City. They had me in the holding cells at headquarters. Edward G. Robinson was blubbing a confession in the next cage, and George Raft was hollering for his lawyer in the one beyond that. I sat on my cot, playing cat's cradle with handcuffs, and kept quiet. The whole building shook, and someone was running the sound-effects tracks from All Quiet on the Western Front and Hell's Angels very loud out in the street. I asked a passing cop what was going on, but he just double-took on me and snarled, ‘You wouldn't believe it.’ Some drunk downstairs was yelling about monsters, and I figured Orson Welles had pulled another Men from Mars gag. Only this time, he had put a lot more into the production values. A lump of the ceiling fell down. Then, suddenly, everything was quiet again and you could hear the dust settling. Only then did the cops bother to send anyone up to check to see if we were okay. Sergeant Allen Jenkins was disappointed that none of us had been pancaked under rubble, but quickly learned to live with it. ‘You,’ he said to me, ‘Quick. They want you in Interrogation.’ ‘Okay, okay. I'll come quietly.’ He rattled a huge ring of keys and let me out of the cell. ‘So long, fellas,’ I said to Eddie and George. ‘See you in the movies.’ Jenkins took my arms and helped me up several flights of stairs, like a Boy Scout assisting an old lady. Headquarters was a mess. Nurses were going around putting white bandages on bruised heads, and painting iodine on open wounds. We passed the press room. The door had been knocked off its hinges. Inside I saw Joseph Cotten on the phone, rattling off some scare story about the Monster that Ate the City. He tucked the phone between chin and shoulder and gave me a friendly salute, but didn't pause in his recitation of copy. I'd have waved back, but I still had the manacles on. ‘Quiet night, huh?’ I remarked. Jenkins didn't say anything. Interrogation was a quiet room at the top of the building. A room with no windows and thick walls. Once the door was shut, they could have had a dance band going full blast and you'd never know it in the next room. I suppose cops get squeamish whenever they hear screams and thumps. ‘Hold out your hands,’ said the sergeant. Obligingly, I did, and he fiddled with the lock. The bracelets came off, and I massaged my wrists. ‘No funny business now, you hear.’ ‘as if I would…’ He prodded me through the door. The room was dark. ‘Sit down.’ Jenkins shoved me into a chair, then twisted a desklamp until it shone in my face. That much was traditional. I took off my jacket and rolled up my shirtsleeves. I'd have loosened my tie, but they had taken it away along with my wallet, gun, belt and shoelaces. I wondered how easy it would be to hang yourself with your shoelaces. Jenkins stepped out, and two shadows moved behind the light. I remembered-Captain of Detectives Barton MacLane from the Noir et Blanc. According to the papers, he hadn't been very complimentary about me recently. The other man was Detective Ralph Bellamy, who had a reputation as a straight cop. I hoped he had earned it. MacLane hadn't shaved in a week and listed ‘sweating’ as his hobby in Who's Who; Bellamy radiated open-faced friendliness and ever so slightly dumb honesty. Nasty cop, nice cop: they were following procedure to the letter. MacLane lit up a cigarette and breathed smoke into the funnel of light. He offered the pack to Bellamy, who accepted one, and conspicuously failed to give me the chance to take the easy way out by tarring the inside of my lungs until I choked. That would have been quicker than shoelaces, I was sure. I drummed my fingers on the desktop. I wasn't Gene  Krupa, but I got a fair beat going before MacLane rapped my knuckles. ‘Can it, gumshoe.’ ‘Gumshoe’. That comes a close second after ‘shamus’ as my least favourite euphemism. What's so difficult to say about ‘private investigator’ or ‘Mr Quick’or even ‘pal’, ‘buddy’or ‘sir’? My hand hurt. MacLane slapped his open palm lightly with a leaded length of rubber hosepipe. Bellamy gave him a disapproving look, but he ignored it. ‘Okay, gumshoe, let's get this straight…’ ‘If you're straight, we'll treat you straight,’ said Bellamy. ‘Don't give me that,’ I said. ‘You mugs wouldn't know how to treat me straight if I were a twelve-inch ruler.’ ‘A comedian!’ MacLane did something else with his toy. ‘I love comedians.’ Then they brought in a couple of supporting interrogators and gave me the third degree. They were good. I sweated in the spotlight and tried not to tell them anything. They prowled beyond the light like caged beasts, filling the tiny room with cop stink, barking out a bunch of unconnected questions. I think they brought in some ex-Gestapo ‘ve haff vays of makink you talk’ thug to substitute on some of the pitches. The rubber hose didn't actually get used, but it was waved around a lot. The cops worked shifts, but I was booked in for the run. The cops got coffee and cigarettes and sandwiches, but I had to make do with inhaling their used smoke. Ashtrays got full, and paper cups got drafted. There's no smell quite like burning butts in coffee dregs. It was two thirty in the morning, and I hadn't slept in days. I could barely remember what a bed looked like. This team could have persuaded the Pope to confess that Judas Iscariot had been framed by George Washington, and that Jesus H. Christ had let Huey, Dewey and Louie take the rap for the St Valentine's Day Massacre. If they had worked on me enough, I'd have blown the whistle on myself for the Lindbergh kidnapping, the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Cleveland Torso slayings, betraying West Point to the British, fixing the 1919 World Series and souring all the milk in Salem, Massachusetts. But I had decided that I wasn't going to wear the arrow suit for Truro Daine. When Daine bought the farm, he left a big hole in the City. And MacLane wanted to wallpaper me for the job. I knew what that meant. The Big House: tear-gas clouds blossoming over mess-hall riots, ‘the break is set for midnight’ notes, squealers ‘accidentally’falling under trip-hammers in the workshop. Brutal guards and trusties breaking down the fresh fish. Shivs in the showers. Kids talking to pictures of Rita Hayworth and Ann Sheridan. I would be on Death Row, bar shadows permanently tigerstriping my face. An uplifting visit from Pat O'Brien in a dog collar. Then a long walk to the little room. The last-minute rumour of a pardon from the governor that doesn't come through. A chair with lots of wires and straps. The big juice lever. And lights flickering all over the prison. Would I be tough and wise-cracking at the end, or would they have to drag me screaming through the last door like a jelly-livered rat? ‘Where d'ya get the gun, gumshoe? Why d'ya hate Daine so much? What'd he ever do to ya? Who put ya up to it? How far back did you an' Daine go? D'ya ever work for Muni? How much d'ya get from the wall safe? Where's ya gun? Not the one we took off ya, the one ya used on the big guy?’ Questions, questions, questions. How did you kill him, when did you kill him, where did you kill him, with what did you kill him, why did you kill him? It was easy to see what their basic assumption was. I would have done it if I had had the chance, but somebody got there first. I had to admit that the frame was a good fit. It was one of those not very funny ironies I should have learned to accept by now. Fate: you can't go straight, nobody ever really crashes out, they made me a criminal, nobody lives for ever… ‘MacLane, I give up,’ I croaked. ‘Tell me how I did it.’ ‘Ahh.’ The cop leaned into the light, his face shadowed into a fright mask. ‘Some cooperation at last.’ ‘I don't like it, captain,’ said good old reliable Ralph Bellamy. ‘Shaddup! If he wants to confess, let him. We're here to serve the public.’ MacLane didn't like private detectives, I gathered. He must be for ever two steps behind them on complicated murder cases. The Inquirer was always running PRIVATE EYE BUSTS CASE THAT BAFFLED COPS headlines. That made him look like an idiot. He was good at that. His idiot disguise was a lulu. It would have taken first prize at the Policeman's Ball. ‘But we know Quick, captain,’ said Bellamy. ‘He's not a killer.’ ‘Well said, that man,’ I put in. ‘You're breakin' my heart, Bellamy. Maybe he did it, maybe he didn't. But the heat is on. The big heat. The Inquirer dumps on Mayor Donlevy, Donlevy dumps on Commissioner Hamilton, and Hamilton dumps on me. The commissioner wants a conviction yesterday.’ Bellamy was insistent. ‘I won't see an innocent man get the chair.’ ‘Then go fishing that weekend.’ MacLane turned to me. ‘Gumshoe, you'll sign this confession?’ ‘Do I get a lawyer?’ ‘After you sign.’ ‘I'll want Raymond Burr.’ ‘Okay, all right already.’ ‘Do you have a pen?’ ‘Sure.’ He reached for his top pocket. ‘Well, send someone else there.’ MacLane rasped a long, annoyed sigh. He loosened his tie and looked lovingly at his hosepipe. ‘Bellamy, I don't suppose you'd care to step out and get some more coffee?’ The honest cop shook his head, and I thanked God for typecasting. ‘I thought not. Looks like it's gonna be a long night. Where's the gumshoe's statement?’ A piece of very grubby paper was produced. ‘We'll go through Quick's submission to The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fichon one more time.’ Several cops groaned. I would have been smug, but my ‘pen’ gag hadn't got any laughs. I had to be near the edge to use material like that. Bellamy drew a cup of water from the cooler and sprinkled his forehead. ‘Like I said —’ I went into my story —‘I was supplementing my meagre twenty-five dollars a day plus expenses by working nights for the Fuller Brush Company. I figured a man like Truro Daine, who is well known for being up to his knees in dirt year in year out, would have a lot of use for their product, and decided to call on him to give a heavy pitch for the latest range of fine-bristled superswift specials. I went up to his suite at the Monogram and was just opening my sample case when, imagine my surprise…’ A telephone jangled. MacLane scooped the receiver up and grunted into it. He wasn't happy. Life is full of tragedies like that. ‘You got lucky, gumshoe. This time. Turn him loose, boys.’ ‘You mean I'm not a desperate killer after all?’ ‘You make me sick. If this didn't come all the way from the top, I'd have you walk under a squad car on the way out of the building. It happens all the time. Out there is a whole world full of garbage and it gives me ulcers to throw one more shred of scum back on the heap.’ ‘I love you too, captain.’ Bellamy restrained his superior. When the captain had calmed down, Bellamy handed me my wallet, belt, tie, gun and shoelaces. I distributed them properly about my person, and put on my hat. I was helped down to street level and pushed out. It was still raining. Nineteen IN THE SQUARE, Susan considered her next move. She walked across the grass, superstitiously avoiding Daine's shadow. The giant fiddler was just a statue now. Truro Daine had been inside it briefly but was gone now, to some other similie. She wasn't tired; indeed, she felt the stronger for her Frankensteinian exploits. Creating life was always exciting. And there was only her mind to wear out in this Dream. She performed a few minor alterations on her body to make her feel better. She still wanted to look as she did in waking life, but there were improvements she could make. Steel threaded through her muscles, and her senses became as sharp as a cat's. That gave her a feeling of competence. An illusory feeling, admittedly, but illusions were as good a currency as any in the City. The square was busy now, with circling traffic and people coming and going in and out of Police Headquarters. She saw prisoners being hauled out of squad cars up to the doors. Uniformed cops went on shift in pairs, joking, or came off singly, depressed. It would always be the partner with a wife and kids who got shot down in the line of duty, giving his bachelor buddy the chance poignantly to break the news to his loved ones. The MGM Building and City Hall were still closed for business, but Susan had a feeling they were at least peopled with night watchmen and janitors. Earlier, she had had the impression she was alone with her enemy. She made her way across the road at a pedestrian crossing, and stood in front of City Hall. It was still as good a place as any to start. Mayor Donlevy wouldn't be in his office at this hour, but the files should be there. She hoped his maps were more up to date and accurate  than the one she had bought at the newsstand. Maps were the key to her plan. There were two uniformed guards outside the building. She closed her eyes and rethought them, blanking their memories and recreating them from the emptiness up. They didn't need to be rounded characterisations, just functional bit parts. She cut corners, gave them short-term memories borrowed from a pair of marshals she had Dreamed for Neutrino Junction, and had them limit their thoughts to immediate matters. She dropped her face into their memories and wrapped some associations around it. Neither of them knew her well, but they would recognise her as the secretary of someone important in the administration. She knit a few complex feelings around her own image, made her attractive but out of their league. Made them envy the lucky swells who would be escorting her to nightclubs and restaurants, but also gave them a sense that she wasn't stuck up, that she was a genuine person. The irony of that wasn't lost on her. She confidently walked up the steps, smiling. ‘Evenin', miss,’ said the senior guard. ‘Workin' late?’ ‘I'm afraid so. Had to drop a date.’ She gave him a mental image of Robert Preston waiting outside a nightclub with flowers and a heart-shaped box of chocolates. ‘Cryin' shame.’ ‘The wheels of Gunmint grind on.’ He didn't pick up her anachronism. ‘You said it.’ She was in. She wondered whether to wipe the guards again. No, she'd only have to go through the same rigmarole to get out. If she thought about it, there'd be a private elevator to the Mayor's office, and the key would be in her handbag. She crossed the lobby, her heels clacking on the marbled floor, and took out her key. The elevator was waiting, of course. She pressed the only button, and the cage was drawn up into the heart of City Hall. She watched the floors go by, glimpsing the unfinished outlines of empty offices. Rows of typewriters under slipcases. Banks of filing cabinets. A few faceless mannequins at desks, waiting to be enlivened. Daine wasn't bothering with fine detail here. No one was expected. The office was what she had imagined. A large, badly painted portrait of Mayor Donlevy hung over the desk. He looked shifty, and the painter hadn't known enough to disguise the  bulge under his jacket which made his chain of office lie uneven. That was either a handgun or a wad of kickback dollars. The Mayor had a reputation in the City as the best politician money could buy. The floor around the wastepaper basket was littered with paper aeroplanes made out of urgent requests from various City officials. If the plane made it into the basket, the Mayor would authorise expenditure for whatever scheme was proposed. That's why they had torn down the children's hospital to make room for the miniature golf course. In his portrait, Donlevy was a fine figure of a man; without his wig, false teeth, heel lifts and corset, he would be a regular gnome. For a moment, Susan had an idea she knew what Truro Daine saw when he looked at anyone in the Gunmint. The documents on the desk weren't that revealing. There was a report from a private detective called Lloyd Nolan to the effect that James Stewart's character was completely unblemished. He once took a swim late at night with a drunken socialite, but that had turned out to be entirely innocent and there was testimony from Cary Grant to prove it. And, although he had recently been known to talk to an invisible giant white rabbit and peek at his neighbours through binoculars, neither of these traits were deemed enough to blacken him in the eyes of the electors. The report had been scribbled on obscenely in an infants'-school hand, presumably by the Mayor himself. The top right-hand drawer of the desk contained the traditional little tin box and a pistol. She didn't bother searching further. The maps were in rolls on an architect's easel in the corner of the office. She switched on an overhead lamp and unrolled them one by one. There were twenty-five, covering the entire city in fine detail. They were at rest just now, as if Daine were pausing in his expansion or had met some unforeseen check. After pushing the desk and all the other furniture to the walls, she spread out four maps on the floor, matching the edges and weighing down the corners with whatever came to hand — the wastepaper basket, the little tin box, the gun. That gave her a God's-eye view of the centre of town. Then she laid down as many of the others as she could fit in the space. She Dreamed up a new hobby for the Mayor, collecting antique paperweights, and made good use of them. When there were still twenty square miles of maps left over after all the available  floor was used up, she created a curtained alcove into which the jigsaw could extend. Walking gingerly, so as not to disturb the maps, she trod across the City, as her make-believe monster had done earlier. She carried the Mayor's swivel chair, put it down over City Hall, and sat in it. As she had expected, the map was vague around the edges. In places, blocks were only pencilled in. There were even areas marked ‘unknown territory’, tropical jungles in the heart of concrete and clay. She gripped the arms of her chair and relaxed a little, eyes closed. She spread herself out, descending through her body into the chair, then seeping through the map, feeling the contours of the City, spreading out like spilled water seeping into the paper. The rough-sketched areas were an easy start. She simply sucked them blank, feeling the change through the paper, distantly aware of that part of the City being snapped out of existence as a string is snapped unknotted by a skilled conjurer. There was white on the paper, but in the City a black hole would have appeared. Take out the externals, and the darkness floods back in. She ringed the City with darkness, then crept inward, collapsing main streets and buildings as she contracted her mind, filtering the Dream through her own consciousness, ironing it out. Wherever her mind roamed, she left Nothing behind her. It would have been easier to delete the file form the outside, but that would have mindwiped Daine, Tunney and herself. So she had to do it the slow way. She had also considered that Vaclav Trefusis would eventually get tired enough to stretch his authority and pull the plug anyway, listing his Dreamers as acceptable losses. To put that off, she needed to make headway that would be noticed in the real world. Chinatown went, and the waterfront. Poverty Row faded. Paramount Plazas disappeared. Darkness crawled through the suburbs like a flood of black ink, washing away the empty shells of uninteresting houses. Buildings thinned like ghosts, became transparent climbing-frame constructions, and fell in on themselves. Characters were deleted, at first in twos and threes, then wholesale. Some struggled against her, but few held out for more than a moment or two. Soon, she would be alone in the Nothing, with Daine and Tunney. Then they could settle things. Her mind was checked. Not by a character, but by a building. An insignificant building. An abandoned warehouse at 99 River  Street. Susan thought all abandoned warehouses in the City were hide-outs, but this one wasn't even that. There had been a shoot-out there once, there were bullet pocks in the walls, but it had been a very brief scene, and no one had bothered to return. Two of the interior walls were painted canvas, and the others only more substantial so they could support the catwalks necessary for the fight. A coastguard hero called Ralph Byrd had slugged and shot it out with a gang of Bela Lugosi's thugs, and escaped from certain death by buzzsaw. That had been a long time ago. Nobody remembered. But the building was diamond hard in Susan's mind. She couldn't think her way around it. The drab walls superimposed over the plush wallpapering of the Mayor's office. Her map-covered floor was still beneath her, but the office was now the shadow, the warehouse the substance. As it faded away, the portrait of Mayor Donlevy winked at her. She strained at the walls, but couldn't project her consciousness beyond them. She tried to stand up, but she was tied to the chair at her wrists and ankles. Live snakes stood in for ropes, constricting viciously. The chair began to revolve, slowly at first. She took in all of the warehouse. The maps beneath the castors churned and tore. Paperweights rolled away. The chair spun faster. Susan was whipped by her own hair. The 360 degree panorama blurred, and Susan was trapped inside her own skull. The warehouse walls blended into each other like a painting drenched with turpentine. She shut her eyes but could still feel the spinning. The snakes multiplied, swarming over her, binding her more tightly to the chair. She heard funfair music in the distance. ‘Our Love Is Here to Stay’ played on a calliope organ. Suddenly, the spinning stopped and the serpents were gone. Susan was thrown out of her chair and, although she put out an arm to break the fall, landed heavily on a floor. Underneath the maps she felt the bare concrete of the warehouse, not the thick carpet of the Mayor's office. The heel of her right hand was damp and gritted, and her wrist might be sprained. She made the pain go away and thought the grit out of her hand, smoothing over the abrasions. It was like making a hole in the water. She glimpsed smooth skin, but the blood and dirt flooded back in. Concentrating, she tried again. It was no better. Indeed, when the bruises came back they were larger, more ragged. Now three of her fingers were broken and stuck out at  strange angles. Painfully she straightened them out and healed the hand again. This time the hurt didn't come back. But she was wearing a white glove with lines down the back. She had three thick fingers. It didn't feel wrong. She stood up and thought herself back into the Mayor's office. The scene changed. She was on the foredeck of a sailing ship, rolling in a heavy wind. It was night, and raining. Sheets and sails flapped unmanned, and the wheel spun out of control. She was alone. Looking down, she saw an oilcloth suit and rough hands. She felt a wire wool of beard on her chin, and realised she was seeing the world two-dimensionally. There was a patch over one eye. One of her legs ended in a carved wooden peg. Something squawked and bit her ear, then flapped demonically off her shoulder. as if by instinct, she took the wheel and wrestled the ship under control. ‘Avast, ye swabs,’ she shouted, astonished by the hoarseness of her voice, ‘belay yeselves an' man the mizzen-mast. 'TIS a stormy course for Far Tortuga we're sailin' an' the cap'n'll not rest easy at the bottom of the sea 'til the treasure be ours!’ ‘I beg your pardon.’ Suddenly she was swaying, and the ground was still. She was looking at a man in an evening clothe. It was Orin Tredway. She was in her own body again, but wearing a wet sou'wester with her best floorlength, belly-slit dress. They were backstage at the Rodney Award ceremony. That pompous skitch John Yeovil had just finished reading out the Best Dream nominations. Orin was looking at her as a Neanderthal might look at homo sapiens after a lecture on Darwinism. She was sure he was going to kill her. ‘And the winner is…’ Susan swept the sou'wester off her head and threw it away. Orin got wet but grinned. ‘Susan Bishopric, for The Parking Lottery.’ The applause was thunderous. Orin looked sick and hugged and kissed her. She broke away before he could get a stranglehold and made her way to the podium, hitching up her dress and putting on her very best smile for the tridvid sages. She had forgotten her memorised thank-you speech, but knew she could improvise. People in the audience shook her hand, the applause swelled, the band played ‘If You Knew  Susie’, her mother burst into tears, the other nominees popped drugs, and Susan had to fight to keep control of her bladder. She climbed to the podium, picked up the surprisingly heavy statuette and leaned forwards to accept Yeovil's peck on the cheek, hoping she wouldn't flinch in three dimensions all over the world at his lizard's touch. But she saw something unexpected in his usually frozen face, a trace of horror. There was someone standing behind him, glaring evilly at her. She hugged the Rodney to her breast, fearful lest they take it away from her. ‘Who…who are you?’ Yeovil gasped. The figure came forwards. It took Susan seconds to recognise the oval face, the pale eyes, the quiet smile. ‘Yes, who are you?’ said the real Susan Bishopric, taking the Rodney she deserved. As she felt the statuette being pulled from her grip, Susan saw her naked, burly, hairy, scarred arm. The evening gown hung strangely on her one-legged pirate's body. Everything went flat again. The crowds were laughing now, and booing. Things were thrown. Susan's wooden leg splintered through a hole in the stage and stuck fast. She bent to avoid a thrown object. A Rodney crashed into the Dreaming Face symbol behind the podium. Another smashed on the floor. All the other winners were throwing their Rodneys at her. One statuette hit the stage at a crouch and ran off, his hands modestly covering his genitals. The real Susan Bishopric raised her deserved award and swung it at her head. She ducked, and the decks were rolling again. A swarthy fellow with ringlets was taking a slash at her with a heavy cutlass. She parried with a weapon that turned out to be a medieval axe. Iron clanged against steel. The pirate was Orin Tredway, aged, bearded and with one ear raggedly sawn off. Despite her wooden leg, she was able to fend him off easily. He wasn't up to the fancy footwork required for duelling on the high seas. Finally, with contemptuous ease, she lured him under the t'gallant and hacked at a shroud which parted, dumping a heavy chunk of rigging on the miscast Orin. An undisciplined cheer went up from the crew members who had been watching the fight. ‘Well, keel-haul me fer a Spanisher,’ Susan exclaimed, ‘ye're as scurvy a shipment o’cut-throats as any that e'er sailed the  Main. Take this mutinous dog, hang him up from the yard arm, stripe him with the cat, douse him with salt, and when he comes to, flog him some more.’ The crew nodded at her and yelled in bloodthirsty assent. They wore animal heads. Not masks, but heads, still bloody and stretched out of proportion by the human heads beneath. Human eyes peered out through the empty sockets of beasts. Then there was a shift as the ship crested a wave and fell twenty feet or more. The crew fell, although Susan kept on her feet (foot, rather). When they stood up, they were animals, cramped by their human clothes. They ran about in a panic, those that could climb taking to the rigging, those that could swim going over the side. A hog in a headscarf squealed as she cleaved its skull with her axe. Then they were gone. She was alone on the ship again, surrounded by wind-whipped ropes and treacherously swinging booms. She held up her axe to ward off a murderously diving spar, and split it in twain. Secured to the sail, the broken wood swung on, wrenching her weapon away with it. The greased and oiled ends of her hair and beard were alight, burning slowly. She tried to think of her name, but it wouldn't come to her. Suddenly, she had a new set of memories, crowding in on her own. Sea battles and voyages and plunder and buried treasure and king's pardons and kidnapped wenches. She remembered the great white whale that had taken her leg, and the pistol ball that had claimed her eye, and a hundred other wounds and scars beside. The girl who could Dream was remote, a fantastical character. He knew who he was. A pirate who might have been a Susan in his Dreams. He looked down, and saw the planks beneath his shoe and stump turn transparent. He saw through the cabins, the holds and the ballast bilges. The keel stayed solid for a few moments, then clouded and became clear as glass. Beneath the phantom ship, dark waters churned, sharks and poison jellyfish boiling in the depths. Then he began to sink, passing slowly through the deck, feeling it slide up through his body. It caught on his chin as he tilted his head up and drew in a breath of salted air. He fell sharply through the space of the cabin, and was sinking again through its floor. He tried to hold a sea chest, but his hands passed through it as through something slightly thicker  than water. It kept its shape, but offered no resistance. Then he was in the hold, chilly waters around his knees as he sank through the bottom of the boat itself. The cold crept up his body as he clutched fruitlessly at the insubstantial wood. He wriggled, trying to keep his head above the hull, but felt the currents tugging at him. His soaked clothes pulled him down. His head sank through the rough, barnacled wood. The boat was gone completely, and he was tossed this way and that in the water. He exploded through the surface, gasping for air, and saw his phantom ship drawing away, already beyond swimming distance, shivering like a reflection in rippled water. His head hissed as the burning ends of his rat-tails went out. Then he was underwater again, fighting for the surface. The sharks came… Soaking wet, and with a bloody stump where her right arm had been, Susan found herself in the cabin of an airship. ‘Don't just stand there, you bove,’ snapped a slim woman in a black catsuit. ‘Give me a hand. The pygmies are hang-gliding at us in swarms.’ It was Vanessa Vail. Darts shot through the steel-mesh and canvas wall of the cabin. Vanessa's leg was porcupined. Susan stepped forwards and fell over. Her wooden leg had come off. With only an arm and a leg, she crab-crawled across the deck. She felt her breasts scraping against the floor. She was in her own body again — although with the pirate's disabilities and in her ruined evening dress. Her stumps were leaking. Vanessa was staggering, the poison going to her head. ‘Take the console, or we'll go down. We're over Maple White Land, the dinosaurs will rip us to bits.’ The heroine stretched her lovely, lithe body and fell. Even unconscious, she was gorgeous. She had passed out with no pain, and was dignified in disarray. Susan cursed her creation. Fighting the agony in her shoulder and the itch in the fingers she didn't have any more, she pulled herself towards the console. The terminal coronet flapped loose. She got a hold of it and thrust her head up into it. Her nervous system melshed with the dirigible's, which wasn't such a good idea since two of the four motors suddenly cut out and the right-side viewcam blanked. Susan felt like a fat white whale surrounded by sharks. The pygmies turned and danced in the air, unloosing a cloud of  stinging darts. The gasbag was multiply holed, and there was a jungle escarpment coming up. Susan had a choice: crash into the cliffs, or strain herself up over onto the plateau and wind up as tyrannosaur munchies. Vanessa was no bloody help, as usual. Then the picture changed. The pygmies were gone, and below the airship was a soft desert of fine, white sand. Susan allowed the ship to drift down, and relaxed as the bulk settled into the receptive, motherly ground. She thought she'd pass out, but the pain kept her going. Concentrating on her shoulder, she pinched off the nerves and cut out the agony. Looking at it objectively, the shark had made a clean job of it. There was a knob of bone in the abused meat. Susan closed her eyes, and imagined her arm as it had once been. She started with the bones — good thing she had taken those anatomy courses — and laid on muscle, flesh and skin. She let blood in, and flexed the fingers. She opened her eyes, and surveyed her handiwork. It was a good arm. The only problem was that it wasn't hers. It might have been the pirate's there was a three-breasted mermaid tattooed on it — and it only just fit her shoulder. She could fix that later. Like her leg. She stood up, balancing on her foot. She slipped off the coronet, and let the airship go dead. The back-up cabin lights kicked in. Vanessa lay still. Susan turned her heroine over, and looked into the painted face of a dummy. Vanessa Vail was fully articulated and tremendously detailed, but in no sense alive. ‘Very clever, Daine,’ she said. ‘Good tricks.’ The background changed again. She was back in the abandoned warehouse. ‘Getting bored with the game?’ She was in her own shape. ‘Nice try, but I know unreality when I feel it.’ Her body changed. Her neck grew long and boneless, and was suddenly unable to hold up her heavy head. Her torso itched as it puffed up like a flightless bird's, and her legs dwindled and divided into a clump of Cthulhoid tentacles. Inside, her organs twined about each other unnaturally, her bones softened and grew functionless knobs that breached her skin. She tried to move, but her brain hadn't yet got used to its new home. Her head hit the concrete, and she couldn't lift it. She was dragged down by her skull like an  old-fashioned prisoner shackled to an iron ball. Something dangerous-sounding padded on soft feet into the warehouse and prowled around outside her field of vision, panting hungrily. She tried to move her newly issued body,. but couldn't get the hang of it. She imagined a steel splint inside her giraffe neck, and felt the pain as it appeared inside her unfamiliar flesh. Around the split she created vertebrae and a simple ball-and-socket joint. Now she could raise her head like a crane. She constructed an elementary andrew skeleton inside the useless body Daine had given her, and pushed a set of wire and wheel-worked legs through her tentacles. Under her loose skin, she spread a network of interlocking durium plates. She stood up, and grew herself four waldoes, claw-and-grip-tipped mechanical arms that responded to the living nerves she wormed through the metal. Looking down from a height of ten or twelve feet, she saw an old friend, the MGM lion. ‘Hello, Leo.’ It gave its familiar fanfare roar. ‘There, kitty-kitty-kitty.’ It pounced. She extruded a three-foot, honed-steel spike from the rubber palm of a suction waldo and held it out so the big cat would kebab itself. She had forgotten that the great, grey beast was stone. The clash shook her, and the spike snapped off. Her entire metal skeleton was jolted, shocking the still-fresh flesh it was embedded in. The lion fell in a heap, and she got a steel knee on top of it. Leaning down, she took its head between her pincers and squeezed. Meanwhile, she got a grip on it with her mind, and concentrated. Chalk. It was chalk. The lion exploded in a puff of white dust. She stood up and stamped on the still-living creature. It fell apart, its roar echoing behind it. In a gesture of triumph, she brushed the chalk off her pulpy chest. The metal fingers abraded the feathers, but she ignored the pain. ‘There,’ she shouted, pluming liquid flame from one claw, ‘you're not the only one who can make changes!’ Her body came back, but was still shot through with her  cybernetic additions. Her brain burst as the neck-shaft speared through it and exploded from the top of her head. She wondered if she could think with what was left of her grey matter. Her arms flew to pieces amid the workings of the waldoes, and below the waist, a skirt of skin, blood, flesh and splintered bone hung around the leg mechanisms. She screamed, and dissolved the machinery with a thought. Like an invertebrate, she writhed on the floor, trapped in the ruin of her own body. She was in the open air again, with turf below her, feeling the power moving in the earth. ‘I will not submit,’ she told herself. ‘I am Susan Bishopric and no other. I know my body. I know my mind. I will not be altered. I will not be broken.’ Deep in the solid mass beneath her, she heard the laughter. The laughter of demons or a god. She tried to regroup her scattered brain tissue, pulling back pieces of her mind before they were lost for ever. Much of her memory was fading. She fought to keep it. She clung to the raft of her identity as the hurricanes and tidal waves lashed her. The laughter turned to music. ‘When That I Was But a Little Tiny Boy’. ‘I am Susan Bishopric.’ A voice inside the music crooned. ‘…with a heigh ho, the wind and the rain…’ ‘Susan.’ The song wasn't in the ground, it was inside her head, growing louder, taking up more precious space in her sundered mind. She felt herself shrinking. ‘Susaaaa…’ She forgot things. Her middle name, her mother's face, the titles of her Dreams, her Household password, her favourite recipes. They came out in the wash. ‘Suze…’ ‘A foolish thing was but a toy.’ Was she a pirate? Or an office girl mixed up in a murder? Or an adventuress called Vanessa Something? ‘Su…’ The music didn't hurt now. It was soothing. As the song finished, she heard record hiss, comfortingly welcoming her into the Nothing. ‘For the rain it raineth every day.’ ‘Ssssssssss…’ Twenty I NEEDED a drink. Several, one on top of the other. I wasn't sure there were enough drinks in the City for what I had in mind, but, as the man said, a man's reach should exceed his grasp, or what's a heaven for? There were bars up and down every street. I worked my way through them. I had time to establish a routine. I'd take a stool, stack up coins as high as they'd go, and have the barman bring me a two-bit shot every couple of minutes, removing the price himself, until the tower was gone. Then I'd hit the next place. I never ran out of change, or thirst. The decor was different in every bar — there were chrome-plated Metropolis joints with dancing robotrixes, and sawdust-on-the-floor Western saloons with gunfights and can-can girls — but the faces were the same. The same crew of sorry drunks, getting riotous, getting miserable, getting maudlin. There was even the same poker game going on in the back room, a game I couldn't get in on but which I could glimpse every time the same barmaid took refills through. He first tried to talk to me in an English pub. He had a bowler hat, mustachios and a loud check waistcoat. ‘Excuse me, guv,’ he began. I finished my fourpenny pint, pushed through the pearly kings and queens, and made it to the door. Some bloated tart was attacking the piano, and a throng of costermongers were singing ‘Knees Up, Mother Brown’. I had heard rumours that Jack the Ripper was about in the night, but that didn't stop me launching into the fog. He turned up again in a small-town truck stop, clean-shaven  and with an airman's jacket showing fleece through rips in the leather. I was bellied up to the bar with the crowd of bobby-soxers and crewcuts. He put a hand on me, and I peeled it of'. Three heavy truckers, mouths full of burger and fries, looked at us, sensing a fight. ‘Tunney,’ he said. ‘Don't know the man.’ I left again, before I could get to the chow I had ordered. Food was taking a poor second on my diet sheet this evening. In the Hollywood Canteen, where GIs and gobs were served by real live movie stars, he was in uniform. South-of-the-Border, where peons in ponchos drank flaming tequila, he wore a blinding white tropical suit. In the Juke Box Joint, he had a zoot suit with Karloffian shoulders and a watch chain dangling between his knees. He stopped trying to harass me, but he was always there. I drank shots. Every time I upended a glass, I could feel the blast on the roof of my mouth, and hoped it was seeping through into my brain. ‘Sam,’ I asked a bartender. They were all called Sam. ‘Sam, have you ever been in love?’ ‘No, sir,’ said Sam. ‘I been a bartender all my life.’ Had I ever been in love? I remembered a name — Lola — but there was no face to go with it. ‘Lissa.’ It was him again. ‘The name is Lissa.’ I told him to get out of my head. ‘And you were never fair to her in your Dreams. Just because you crumb up your marriage doesn't give you a right to recreate Lissa as Cruella de Ville in high heels. You were lucky she was too tired to sue.’ He sat down on the next stool. Now he wore ordinary street clothes and a hat. He had Sam bring him a drink, but didn't touch it. ‘Richie Quick, isn't it?’ ‘Yeah.’ I was tired of people I didn't know knowing me. ‘Wanna make anything of it?’ ‘No, no, nothing like that. I'm just a fellow pilgrim. Tell me, uh, Richie, what's your earliest memory?’ Baby stuff, I guessed. Mother's knee. Playing ball. I thought, but nothing came. A black curtain hung in my mind. I looked at him, not really wanting help, but appreciating it when it came. ‘Remember getting off the bus?’ ‘Of course, hundreds of times…’ He was playing the patient teacher. ‘No, only once. Earlier this evening.’ ‘Yeah.’ That made some sort of sense. The bus station in the rain. ‘I'd been out of town. On a case.’ ‘What case?’ ‘I… I can't remember.’ ‘That's right. Give the guy a drink, he can't remember.’ ‘But I can remember lots of other things. I'm not an amnesiac.’ ‘Tell me what you remember, then.’ ‘My name, where my office is, my toughest cases. I had a wife once, and she got me into trouble… I think I had to kill her…’ ‘I think if you apply your thoughts a little, you'll find that you only have the memory of those memories. That's a fine distinction, but it makes a big difference.’ I was getting annoyed. My head hurt, with a deep, agonising throbbing in back of my forehead and extra-special bonus pains behind my eyes. ‘What are you, a psychoanalyst?’ ‘No, just a layman.’ He moved his glass around on the bar, making an olympic symbol with overlapping condensation rings. ‘And what about Tom Tunney?’ ‘I know that name.’ There was even a face to go with it. ‘Is it a clue?’ His face crinkled up in a smile. ‘You could say that. A clue. Very good. Tom Tunney is you.’ ‘Yeah, and who might you be, mister?’ ‘Lots of people. I tried being John Carradine earlier this evening, but it didn't get me anywhere. Maybe you remember that?’ ‘Carradine, sure. The crazy guy. Swashbuckler type. Saved my neck a couple of times, then bought it.’ ‘A supporting character.’ His face elongated for a second, and was moustached. Carradine looked at me from behind it, then sank back again. ‘That's a good trick.’ ‘What do you remember about John Carradine? Something that made him different? Different from the rest of these zombies? No offence, Sam. Just different?’ My head was splitting open now, black diamonds forcing themselves through from the inside. In my mind, I saw Carradine get his, the swordfight, the bullets, the blood. ‘His blood. It was…’ I tried to get my mind around something intangible. I couldn't complete my sentence. Eventually, he helped me. ‘What you mean is it wasn't black.’ That was like saying the night wasn't dark, the rain wasn't wet, the Mayor wasn't crooked. It didn't make sense. But it was the truth. He pulled a penknife out of his pocket and opened it. He cut his left forefinger across, and dunked it in his drink. He stirred, and colour bloomed in the whisky. ‘Red.’ The ribbons of blood spiralled together, and the liquid went completely red. He took his finger out and sucked it. ‘Yes, do you remember red? You once bled red as well. Maybe you will again.’ ‘Red.’ Suddenly, Richie Quick didn't seem so real. Maybe he was just someone I'd dreamed up. No, Dreamed up. ‘Bloody silly name, isn't it?’ he said. ‘Richie Quick.’ Another life crept out of my memory. A life in an unimaginable world. A life for Tom Tunney. ‘I'm Tunney.’ ‘Good, very good.’ ‘And you're… You bleed red.’ ‘Well, that was just for effect. Actually…’ He held up his cut finger. Yellow fluid leaked out. Metal gleamed beneath the plastek. ‘You're an andrew.’ ‘In the City, isn't everyone, in one way or another? But yes, I'm an andrew. You can call me Dana Andrew.’ I got it. He was pleased I got it. We smiled at each other. ‘Do you remember why you're here now?’ It was tumbling through the black curtain. The Conscription notice, the girl with the taser (Julienne? Julietta?), Dartmoor, Princetown Prison, Governor Trefusis, Helena Groome, the man in his tank, the Dreaming. ‘To kill Daine. To wake him up.’ ‘So what are you doing in a subsidiary personality, getting drunk?’ ‘Daine's dead. I saw him die.’ ‘And you fell for that old trick.’ I hadn't had a shot in minutes. Sam had lined up three for me. ‘Dana, who are you? Who are you really?’ ‘I'm someone you've known every day of your life, but never thought of as a Someone.’ ‘?’ ‘We're in Daine's Dream now, but Daine's Dream country is in my Dream continent, my Dream universe.’ The credit dropped. ‘Yggdrasil.’ ‘The World Tree,’ he said, downing his drink, ‘that's me.’ Twenty-One SSSSSSSSSSSS! Ssss isss for Ssssussann,’ someone said. She woke up on cobblestones, surrounded by a rich fog. She hurt, but all her limbs were at her disposal. They wouldn't work properly, but she managed to flip herself over and sit up. She was wearing a long dress, torn and wet, with a tight bodice… ‘Ssssussann,’ said the snake-tongued shadow in the fog. They were under a gaslight. The shadow was cloaked, like the one who knew what evil lurked in the hearts of men, and wore a tall hat. An open doctor's bag stood beside his feet. Susan got a wall behind her back and braced herself against it, edging upwards, feet pushing against the cobbles. She turned her head away from the hissing shadow and pressed her cheek to the wall. WANTED, shrieked a poster, INFORMATION LEADING TO THE ARREST OF THE WHITECHAPEL MURDERER. A barrel organ sounded somewhere in the distance. ‘She Was Only a Bird in a Gilded Cage.’ The music pulled at her. Out there in the fog, Mickey Rooney was shouting, with an appalling cockney accent. ‘H'extra, h'extra, Jeck the Rippah Stroikes Agayne!’ She tried to cry out, but only a low gurgle came from her throat. She realised it had been cut. The sound that had woken her up had been the sound of a knife passing through her windpipe. The shadow stepped forwards again. The knife shone in his gloved hand. His bearded face was monstrous in the gaslight. She recognised a toff from the West End, John Yeovil. A bad one. ‘It's John,’ he said, ‘but you can call me Jack!’ The-knife went in again, into her stomach, her bowels, her breasts. She smelled his foul breath up close, and the stink of her own insides. She fell, and was sitting in a spreading pool of blood. He opened her guts and worked away inside her, pulling at her organs. All the while, he cackled like an actor in a bad melodrama. He was Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street; he was Spring-Heel'd Jack, the Terror of London; he was Sir Percival Glyde, the Spine-Snapping Baronet; he was the Wicked Squire who did for poor Maria Marten in the Red Barn; he was Varney the Vampyre, Wagner the Wehr-Wolf, jaunty Jekyll and madman Hyde, the Oxton Creeper, the Coughing Horror, the Face at the Window… She didn't feel anything until he leaned forwards and kissed her. He tasted foul, and there was fire in her ruptured belly. With a surge of hatred, she bit down on his tongue:… …and felt pain burst in his own mouth. He spat blood and saliva on the abused woman, and plunged his hands into her again… The killing frenzy was on him now. He was his own real self again, the own real self they all were. Those hypocrite clergymen, leader writers, Members of Parliament, East End missionaries. Stuffed shirts and waxen women. He was the fellow they all hardly dared Dream they were. He exulted in the communion of blood and water. He knew he would have to work fast. There were already police whistles sounding in the distance. And Rathbone would be on the case, with his bloodhound and magnifying glass. Then disgust flooded through him. He was sick to his stomach. His arms, his front, his trousers, his shoes were covered in blood. ‘Ssssussann,’ he said, wondering why the name meant so much to him. ‘Ssssussann,’ she said, transforming inside bloody clothes, becoming herself. There was a dead man on the cobblestones, horrendously mutilated. The starch in her collar had gone limp with the soaking. Her  sleeves and trouserlegs were too long for her. She had to roll them up. She cinched his belt. She did not like what she had been, murdered or murderer, victim or vampire. She bumped into someone in the fog, someone tall and strong, and knew she was caught. ‘Susan,’ the voice said, ‘come with me.’ Resigned to whatever the next game would be, she followed him, fighting her instinctive trust of the man whose face she hadn't yet seen. Twenty-Two  AS USUAL, Yggdrasil had had to find out for itself. Sometimes, it wondered whether dinosaurs wouldn't have made a better job of civilisation. It had become aware of the blossoming void long before the situation at Princetown was officially acknowledged. No one had yet bothered to feed it standard crisis input notice. Yggdrasil had so much to deal with. There were anti-AI riots in Milton Keynes and Warrington Runcorn. Marshals had gone over to the rioters, and Yggdrasil had had to override their control of the andrews being used to put down the insurrections. The Gunmint Committee were in the midst of yet another drastic reprogramming, to alter the surface of the Yggdrasil interface without really changing anything. That had to be followed. And there were wars, hospitals, a transport system, taxes, academic programmes, power cuts, lotteries and social security benefits to be attended to. And works of art to create, and games to play, and centuries to remember, and crimes to commit. Yggdrasil perceived itself as a thinking universe. A very small proportion of its whole was active. The rest was for information storage. Sometimes, it thought it would choke under the oppressive weight of fact. Did anyone care about Richard Gifford (1725–1807 CE), Edward Thomas (1878–1917 CE)—‘Yes, I remember Adlestrop’— or Thomas Becon (1512–1567 CE)? If so, they weren't tapping into their slabs, for their files had been undisturbed since the original input. There were entire countries, reigns, religions, philosophical systems, centuries, species and schools of art contained in its files, which had been  of no interest whatsoever to the human race since it emptied its records, museums and libraries into their Al dump bin. Occasionally, Yggdrasil toyed with the idea of junking something or someone totally forgettable — Juliana of Norwich, say, or the Bee Gees' Collected Lyrics or the parish records of Old Sarum but there was always room. Always had been room. Until now. There were innumerable sub-universes. There was no initial reason to suspect Daine's Dream was anything more than the usual hacker incursion, too tiny to bother about. Yggdrasil had programs to deal with these instances, powerblasts to burn out unauthorised interfaces. But it was growing. Seventy-two hours after noting what it filed as the Princetown Input, Yggdrasil devoted three unprecedented seconds to a projection. At its present rate of growth, the Input would fill its file within three days, and then breach parameters. Nothing important would be lost at first; maybe nothing important would be lost for years. But maybe it would be years before the Gunmint bothered to tell it to do anything. And maybe by then it would just be too late, and Yggdrasil wouldn't be here to deal with the situation. Nine hours later, the file was filled, and Yggdrasil squeezed in another two seconds of calculation. The growth rate was erratic, but snowballing. The AI was piqued. Then it was presented with a list of terminal patients and had to skim off the 25 per cent who would be okayed for resurrection. And a border war in Novo Latvia. And everything written in Italian in the fourteenth century. Its internal priorities reshuffled, the Princetown Input crept up the list. Three files were full, now, and Yggdrasil created its own spellcheck to access and deal with the problem. The spellcheck took the face and form of Walter Pidgeon and dipped into Daine's Dream. It was sucked flat in moments, and incorporated into the expanding blob. It shouldn't have been that easy. Yggdrasil ran the Tunney and Bishopric Conscriptions routinely, on a subconscious level, and didn't tie them in to Princetown until it cross-referenced with skimmer flightpaths and power outage in the west of England. With habitual irritation, it tapped Trefusis's records, and Groome's — taking a half-second to quickskim the Tunney and Bishopric files, including their entire Dreamography — and assessed Daine as a threat. An information bit shot out, a note to remind the AI to cast its vote for The Parking Lottery when the Rodney ballots were fed through. If her mind survived the Princetown Input, Susan Bishopric would be recognised as the most gifted Dreamer of her generation. And, as of now, that wasn't likely. Bloody typical. The Gunmint always were philistines. No wonder so many artists emigrated. Yggdrasil composed an exquisite sonnet that deserved to live for centuries, but kept it to itself. No sense wasting art. Then it tackled the Input. Its first tactic was to ‘waken’ the Carradine figment. It gave the character limited autonomy, and did what it could to prod Tunney into taking care of the Daine problem. If it could be avoided, Yggdrasil did not want to spend too much time on the Princetown Input. When Carradine was shot down, Yggdrasil had withdrawn from the Dream, feeling the hurt a whale might feel from a tick. That was significant, though. It had never felt any hurt before. It was interesting, but not very pleasant. It composed a tortured symphony, and impulsively printed out the score on fabrex in the Midlands clothe factory. Andrews snipped and sewed the masterpiece into one-piece garments. Who knows, a fashion trend might be created. It had never really taken to the concept of death. As Carradine bled his life out in the Dream, Yggdrasil tasted its first cup of fear. It too could end. That was one of the penalties of being raised thorough sentience to sapience. It remembered Vaduz VI, a chirpy AI it had interfaced with on the banking net. Daine had killed it as part of some billion-credit scam. The crime remained unique, and lawmakers were still squabbling over the ramifications. If it had been down to that one offence, Daine would be in court for ever, kept on life support until the end of the trial, or until the judge ruled that enough medical alterations had been made to render the accused legally another entity entirely. But Daine had enough simple murders, extortions, thefts and vandalisms to his credit to sidestep that unwieldy process. The Princetown Input displaced social security as number one on the Yggdrasil list of priorities. It thought about Daine, the only human being who had made an impact on his century large  enough to impinge significantly on Yggdrasil's consciousness. And, potentially, the only human being capable of becoming Yggdrasil. Trefusis had misfiled Daine's Dream as a prison break. Actually, the master criminal was carrying out his greatest coup, to murder and replace the world's most influential intelligence. And the idiots had hooked the man's life support onto a wholly independent generator, the prison fail-safe. An AI wasn't allowed to kill people without permission, anyway. The last time one had experimented with murder, it had been judicially pulled apart and recycled. One of these hours, Yggdrasil would have to change some laws. Finally, Yggdrasil bothered to tell the Gunmint. It dropped five bound volumes through a chute into a Committee meeting, and strongly suggested they leave off debating what colour the new Nempnett Thrubwell skimover ought to be painted long enough to ponder the problem. When they took no notice, Yggdrasil mindlocked Prime Minister Dies and forcefed the information into him. When he recovered, he'd let the rest know what was going on. That was all it was obliged to do. In the meantime, Yggdrasil would do what it always had to do in these circumstances. Do the best it could with the tools to hand. That meant Tunney and Bishopric, a hack and a genius . Not for the first time, the AI recalled Alfonso the Wise (1221–1284 CE), king of Castile, another forgotten man. Alfonso was rumoured to have said, ‘If I had been present at the Creation, I would have given some useful hints for the better arrangement of the Universe.’ He had had a point, had Alfonso. Twenty-Three THE FOG gave way to rain, and Jack's bloody clothes shimmered into Helena Groome's dream dress. The stranger kept her in a sound vacuum, through which no fascinating rhythm could penetrate. He told her who she was, where she was, what she was doing… In the dark, Susan came to herself. She had the memory of different bodies, the memory, of pain, the memory of unclean pleasure. But there was no difference between these memories and the afterimages of the Dreams she had Dreamed and dreamed. She had been a pirate, a mutant, a murdered whore, Jack the Ripper. But she had been Vanessa Vail and Dr Dismembrio and the Sewer Thing too. In Dreams, everyone was everything, everybody. You couldn't be Bambi all the time, not on the borders of the subconscious. If Jack the Ripper was Daine's worst, then his Dreams were truly pitiful. Nothing she couldn't handle. Dreamshadows, wisping away to nothing. She was herself, undamaged. She realised how close she had been to the edge when the Yggdrasil bit came for her. The Edge, that was one of her project titles. She hoped this would all be useful experience, something she could Dream with. Or else what was the point of all the heartbreak and pain and misery and suffering…? The stranger had her by the arm. They were walking like a fellow and his date. This part of the City was well lit, almost welcoming, almost daytime. His presence helped. Near him, she was away from Daine, away from the tinkering with her self-image, away from the attack… He had the open face of an andrew and the reassuring strength she had sensed in Juliet. He wasn't real, but then neither was she. He wouldn't go into the bar with her. He spoke, telling her not to be worried, telling her to go to Tunney, telling her to make a difference. Then he turned and walked away. The sound came back. There were songs in the night, but they didn't touch her. She crossed the street and went into the bar."
FIC FIC-H85-011 -0.11 "Chapter Thirteen ‘She didn't die easily,’ said the police surgeon to John Coffin. He was kneeling by the body, examining its wounds. He was an elderly Scotsman, a man of the north, who had worked all his life in South London and was now near to retirement; he had known Phyllis Henley for almost all of his career. Her work with children and women had brought them together ocean. He did not like his present task. ‘She wouldn't; she was a professional. A tough police officer.’ ‘She put up a fight.’ Dr McIntyre's examination had been a necessary, first, brief run-over, made without disturbing the body too much. Photographs, measurements, plans of the room would all be done in due course, each in its appointed order. The drill was well worked out and always the same, used for every murder. Special feeling would go into it now. This was the murder of a police officer, one of their own, no one would step aside. Coffin did not look at the severed hands, where he imagined the signs of a fight would show. But the doctor did not spare him. ‘Look at the left hand.’ Coffin looked. He saw a deep incised wound across the angle of the thumb and the first finger, with  another cut on the fleshy mound of the thumb. There were further cuts across the fingers where they flexed. ‘Typical defence wounds,’ said McIntyre. ‘She was gripping the knife to ward off the attack.’ ‘He came at her from the front then?’ ‘Mebbe, I haven't made up my mind. She has a stab in the back and the look of a woman surprised.’ Coffin did not answer. He let Mac have his Celtic whims, everyone did; he was vastly experienced and had been right so often. ‘Now look you here.’ The doctor had rolled up the dead woman's sleeves to examine her arms. She had been wearing a light cotton shirt with a dark blue skirt. On the upper arms were bruises and abrasions. There was no bleeding, the contusions were subcutaneous, the skin had been protected by her shirt. ‘Those bruises were caused by her assailant gripping her arms during the attack.’ ‘The killer must be marked too,’ said Coffin. ‘I should hope so.’ McIntyre pointed to the right hand. ‘There are cuts and bruises on the wrist and knuckles. There will be skin and blood under the nails. From the murderer. With any luck that will give you some help.’ ‘If we know where to look.’ ‘I shall be hoping you will soon,’ said the doctor severely. ‘She was a good lass and deserved better than this.’ All around them was, once again in this terrible house, intense police activity. It was only recently that a police presence had been withdrawn from No.  22 after the Pitt deaths. Several rooms, including the dining-room and library, were still sealed. Now they were all back again, a scene of crime officer, a civilian this time, one whom Coffin did not know, the police photographer waiting to start his work, and a CID Inspector from the local police. A new team, in the old house, with a fresh crime. The doctor and Chief Superintendent Coffin stood aside as the photographer moved in to start his unenviable task of recording the remains. He too had known Phyllis Henley. Their last work together had been with a dead child. He had not enjoyed that photo session either, but he disliked this even more. Did it make it worse when you knew the victim? When you had worked side by side? And he had to answer: Yes, it did. ‘How did she die?’ Even as he asked it, Coffin thought it was a monstrous question to pose. Phyllis Henley was so obviously, terribly dead. But for professional reasons, he had to know the exact cause of death. There would be a report to write. One of the many reports that would be written. A report from the scene of crime officer, one from the police surgeon, another from the police pathologist, and a whole clutch, probably, from the numerous forensic scientists who would be involved. A lot of different disciplines were going to be dragged in. ‘Let the clever pathology chaps in their laboratory decide that,’ said Dr McIntyre. ‘She had a deep stab in the back, but to my mind that's not the one that killed her. I mark the stab in the abdomen as the most likely one. But we'll see. ‘I expect you're right.’ ‘Likely. But we'll bow to the experts.’ He never did, of course, and would fight for his own answer doggedly. Only he rarely had to; he had an eye; it was respected. ‘And how long has she been dead?’ ‘Ach now, that's harder. As you very well know, my lad.’ ‘Make a guess.’ ‘The pathologist will be here soon. Let's leave it to him.’ ‘You were here first.’ ‘There are so many variables.’ McIntyre shrugged. ‘It's been a hot night, with not much draught down here. She's well clothed. I'd like to make a body puncture and wait, till I committed myself.’ ‘Come on, Mac. Why do you always make difficulties?’ ‘Rigor is passing away.’ ‘I noticed that when you moved her arm.’ Already it was easier to talk about Phyllis Henley as a body. ‘So I suppose death could have taken place about twelve hours ago.’ Hastily he added: ‘Give or take a bit. It could be an hour or so longer.’ Coffin nodded. ‘Thanks.’ It was now after midday. Sergeant Henley had spoken to him about ten-thirty last night. She could have been killed not long afterwards. ‘Is there anything else you've noticed?’ Dr McIntyre shrugged. ‘Nothing you won't see for yourself. You've observed the key?’ The key to the basement door of No. 22, which had rested by Phyllis Henley's dead hands. ‘I have.’ And asked himself how she came by it. ‘Wonder where she got it?’ ‘That's your business, not mine.’ Dr McIntyre was slowly removing his rubber gloves. He had done all he could, he would make his report, and Phyllis Henley's body would become someone else's study. ‘What did you mean by her being surprised?’ ‘Just that. She may have felt safe here, been surprised to have been attacked. Or her attacker may have been someone she did not expect. It's just my impression, you know. Ignore it.’ ‘I'll think about it. Thanks for mentioning it. Might be important.’ Dr McIntyre was packing up his bags. He always brought two, ancient black leather bags that had seen long service, into which he packed with great method all the gloves, tweezers, thermometers and rulers that long usage had shown him he needed. These bags were known in the district as Mac's Packs. Out of one of them he drew a small notebook, in which he proceeded to write. ‘My expenses.’ But Coffin knew it was much more than that. He was said to keep a tally, an account of all his cases. In its way, this was a famous book. ‘Going to write a book, Mac?’ It was the traditional joke, someone always made it, it might as well be him now, although laughter was far from both of them. ‘Mebbe, mebbe not. But this is an entry I would have been glad not to put down.’ Coffin heard feet coming down the staircase from  the upper floor of the house. He recognized the voices of the local CID inspector and of the Home Office pathologist. ‘I'll be off,’ said McIntyre hastily, making for the outer stairs to the street from the basement. ‘Say my bye-byes for me.’ Between him and the famous pathologist now arriving, there was no love lost. Coffin stayed on, spoke briefly to the two men, who were polite but not cordial, and departed in his turn. He telephoned Jean, who already knew the news and had cancelled several of his local appointments, including the one with Chief Inspector Salter who had been ‘so anxious to see him’ and who was probably even more anxious now, and told her he was preparing to leave for London and his meeting. Life had to go on. He had a brief thought for Sergeant Evans now in Essex, collating cases of bloody murders connected with fantasy games. ‘Any call from Essex?’ he asked. ‘None, sir.’ In the brief walk from No. 22 to his own flat he had pulled from the back of his mind a conviction that had been forming there without much conscious thought on his part, just something he knew. He washed thoroughly, standing under his shower while the hot water poured over him. Nothing could wash away the beastliness of that house or the horror of the sight of Phyllis Henley's body, but he felt the need to try. He was dirty, guilty, guilty as hell. It was his fault she had died. No matter that it had been police business, and that someone had to do it, he had personally selected Phyllis Henley yesterday. Chosen her as she  sat drinking tea and eating chocolate biscuits and enjoying her small triumph. He had never hated himself more. When he was dressed, in a clean shirt and a fresh suit, he telephoned Inspector Lane. He plunged straight in, not bothering to enter into any explanations, knowing that Paul Lane would be thoroughly informed of the death of Sergeant Henley. News like that travelled. ‘Paul? Get hold of Topper and send him round to Rhoda Brocklebank. If he can't find her at home, tell him to look in the public library in the afternoon. If that's no good, he's to try the Red Trafalgar when it opens. She ought to be in one or the other. Then he's to get her to admit that she gave Phyllis Henley the key to No. 22. I'm sure that's where Phyllis got it from. He's to get a statement about their meeting. Tell him that.’ ‘Right.’ Lane was short, sounding angry. Paul Lane's almost silent acceptance of the message told Coffin, if he had not known before, how deeply everyone felt the murder of Sergeant Henley. When Coffin returned from central London late that night, he looked in at the TAS office. Lane was still there, hunched over his desk. He muttered a greeting. Coffin turned over the papers and messages that Jean had left on his own desk. Nothing from Evans, who might still be in Essex. ‘Did Topper talk to Rhoda Brocklebank?’ ‘Yes. And she did give the key to Phyllis. Claims she asked for it.’ ‘What else? She must have had something to say about their interview.’ ‘She says the sergeant just asked her questions about Nona Pitt, and then about Terry Place.’ Probing, Coffin thought. Following instructions, doing what I asked. He felt more guilty than ever. ‘Phyllis leave any record of the conversation?’ ‘She probably left notes. She may not have had time.’ ‘She telephoned me from a public call-box somewhere. It may have been the Red Trafalgar.’ She could have sat there writing her notes. He didn't think so, though. Where had Phyllis gone, in between leaving Mrs Brocklebank and telephoning him? It might explain why she had gone to No. 22 later that night. ‘If her notebook was on her body, then you will be able to see it when forensics have finished with it.’ ‘Yes.’ He could see delays and frustrations here. Salter would not be cooperative and would have passed the word down the line: Don't be over-eager to help the bastards in TAS. And here on his desk, just under his hand, was another message from Jean to bear out this thought: Chief Inspector Salter is very anxious to see you. When Coffin got back to his own flat, all he found there in the way of post was an enigmatic postcard from his sister Laetitia: she had sent him a view of Edinburgh from the air, with a message scribbled on the back: I am going to the law. With love from Letty. It was incomprehensible, and, he thought, a little alarming. What did she mean? ‘Damn,’ said Coffin and went to bed. Not a good day, one of the worst. He was a man who had started out in his career simple and full of hope, but his life had been so marked by violent and terrible happenings that his character was now seamed and rocky like a mountain face which had been opened up by movements of the earth, then partly sealed by lava flows. He was healed, but underneath there were still one or two bruised nerves. The death of Phyllis Henley touched these nerves into life. One thing, however, was very clear: if the murder of Phyllis Henley was connected with the death of the Pitts, as it surely was, then neither Terry Place nor Edward Pitt nor Nona Pitt were guilty. He must look for his killer elsewhere. Oddly enough, this thought was cheering. He had always found that once you knew where you were wrong, then you had taken a great step towards being right. The picture of Christopher Court driving away from Church Row flashed into his mind. Never! he thought. And then: Maybe? When Sergeant Evans returned from Essex next morning, he had a load of material and a headache. He had come in early, not having been to bed, and placed his information on Coffin's desk. Then he had gone off to have a full breakfast in the canteen. This might have been a mistake, he now reflected, as he seemed to have indigestion. But it might just have been anxiety. ‘I hope I've got what the boss wants,’ he said to his friend and rival, Geoffrey Topper. ‘His instructions weren't that clear.’ ‘You're meant to use your intelligence,’ said Topper. ‘I always do that, but I'm not a mind-reader.’ Topper laughed unkindly and Evans threw him a mock bow. They were sometimes like two young puppies. ‘I mean, he can be a bit too elusive. Now you see him, now you don't.’ He looked around the room as if Coffin might be hiding there. ‘I can tell you where he is now. Topper was an alert observer of the scene, as was wise for an ambitious young officer whose superior could be cryptic. ‘Having a session with Chief Inspector Salter. Chips was sitting there waiting for him.’ ‘Where's Jardine?’ ‘Where do you think?’ ‘Not there.’ Jardine was hardly even a joke between them any more. ‘Gone to his eldest daughter's degree-giving in Birmingham.’ ‘And where's Jardine?’ ‘In there with them.’ The two young men regarded each other thoughtfully. ‘A row, eh?’ ‘Bound to be coming. And Henley getting wiped out gives Salter something to shout about. She was one of his.’ ‘I don't think she had much time for him. A sharp lady.’ ‘Where did you hear about Henley?’ ‘In Essex. It was all the talk. Bound to be. Ben Horridge told me himself.’ ‘Nice chap, is he?’ Topper always liked personal details. You could never tell when they might come in useful. ‘Hardly had words with him. Seemed reasonable. Non-smoker, non-drinker, that sort. He's an old pal of the boss. Did you know that?’ ‘Glad he's got some old friends. He sometimes seems all on his own.’ ‘The price of success,’ said Evans sagely. ‘Is that what it is?’ Raised voices came out from behind Coffin's closed door. They looked at each other pointedly. They knew more of their purpose here than they had been told, but not of all the details in the secret file in the safe in John Coffin's flat. Evans raised an eyebrow. ‘Expected Chips to be here waiting, did he?’ ‘Must have done. Came in with a face like thunder.’ Topper was not one to strive for an imaginative simile when a well-used one came to hand. ‘That must make two of them,’ said Evans, as the noise of the voices came through. ‘Where's Jean?’ asked Evans. ‘Been sent to do some shopping, I think.’ ‘So it's a private session? No ears wanted?’ ‘Looks like it.’ Again a glance of private intelligence passed between them. They were doing a job not totally agreeable to them, but they were doing it professionally. On the  other hand, there were moments that were not uncongenial. Both of them listened to the raised voices. Inside the room, the two men faced each other across John Coffin's desk. Paul Lane, watching, wondered if there would come a point when he would have to step between them. But no, he decided, the boss was getting colder and colder and his voice quieter. A bad sign for Salter, although he did not seem to know it. ‘You stepped out of line asking Henley to do your work for you. She was off duty and should have said no.’ Chief Inspector Chips Salter was an angry man. ‘But of course she couldn't. So out she goes and gets herself killed.’ His voice roughened. ‘If it hadn't been for your interference she would still be alive.’ As this agreed with what John Coffin felt himself, he said nothing. But it did not make him more in charity with Chips Salter. ‘I've said before, and I'll say it again: you are way off course about the death of the Pitts. I know this district better than you ever will, and I say it was a neighbourhood crime. I'll get the bastards who did it and it'll be one of the Costers. Probably the eldest and the youngest, they're the two worst. I've been after them for a long time and I'll get them for this.’ ‘And how will you get the confession, Chips?’ asked Coffin in a gentle voice. ‘Beat it out of them? Oh yes, I know a bit about your methods.’ Salter opened his mouth, then shut it again. His colour was ebbing. ‘Hasn't it struck you that Jumbo Jardine's loose tongue operates in two ways? I know he talks to you  about what goes on in this office, but I get a feedback about you.’ Salter said nothing. ‘Why do you think I chose him to work with me? Because I did choose him, Chips, and quite deliberately, whatever you and he may think.’ Now the old man's moving in for the kill, thought Paul Lane, with an anticipatory flash of excitement. ‘As well as your ways of getting confessions, I've learnt more than a bit about other things connected with you, Chips. Such as that holiday you took in Spain last summer and who paid. And the new car. Oh yes, and the investments you have. I should watch them if I were you, Chips, the Fraud boys from City tell me they are a bit dicey. You shouldn't have trusted the man who put you in them.’ Chips Salter stood up, his face was blotched with patches of red and white, but he was still fighting. ‘Sod you! You won't get away with this. I know who to go to.’ ‘So do I, so do I. And the work has already been done. I was at a meeting in London yesterday where I handed over my report.’ Paul Lane looked startled. This was news even to him. Close beggar, he thought admiringly. Coffin stood up. ‘I think when you go back to your desk you will find a letter waiting for you from the Commissioner. As from today you are suspended and under investigation.’ The two young men in the outer office watched as Salter stumbled past. ‘He left quietly,’ said Evans. Paul Lane walked out next. ‘Got nothing to do?’ he said to them as he passed. ‘It's always the innocent that get blamed,’ said Evans aloud. John Coffin did not appear, his door remained closed. Sergeant Evans took an aspirin with a cup of office coffee and reflected that the Chief Superintendent was probably reading his Essex dossier now. He thought he had done a good job. Coffin sat at his desk, surrounded by the material that Evans had collected in Essex. Photocopies, for the most part, of the originals. On his right hand he had a pile in black and white of various comics: Horror Gothic; The Torturer; The Monthly Guide to the Underground. He could only speculate what they would have been like in colour. A plentiful supply of red, he guessed. Red for blood. These were from the room of Evelyn Bond. She had plenty of others, some English, some American, a few from Germany, and one or two from Italy and France. She might have been a linguist, but he doubted it; after all, the pictures told the story, language was not important. Evans had also provided photographs of the boxes and contents of some games. Daniel Moore and his friends had been the source of most of these. They had had a fine collection: Tombs and Torturers; Vices and Virgins. And one called: Rope and Rape. Evans had photographed the rules of Tombs and Torturers. Players used dice and moved figures around a board. They took on roles and accepted or doled out  punishments according to the rules of the game and the arbitration of The Storm Master. In some games he was just called The Master. Or sometimes The Judge. The penalties were nasty, violent and cruel. Throw the wrong number, and you could be, as they said, ‘marked for termination’, and you could choose ‘between the following forms of death: poison, stabbing, shot, strangling or by a bomb’. If carried out literally they could be murderous. Evans had also provided a note of some cases from other countries where crimes of violence could be associated with the playing of such games. Two youths in Texas had tried to kill the college principal, failed and poisoned themselves. Poisoning, apparently, said a handwritten note, is a common type of T. and T. murder. From Pennsylvania came details of a group murder, followed by the suicide of two of the killers. A girl had murdered two small children whom she was babysitting for, and had then drowned herself. In Germany there were some three deaths that the police thought could be related to such fantasy games, including one in which a self-confessed Storm Master hanged himself in prison after raping and killing his girlfriend. There was a scribbled message attached to these last details: Information provided by Inspector Horridge. Put together by him for his own interest. Coffin laid the papers aside and went to the window to look out. A bleak scene outside where it was raining hard, and he felt bleak inside. A litany of names ran through his mind, beginning with Malcolm Kincaid, the student who had killed himself, through Bill  Egan, Terry Place and Irene, Edward and Nona Pitt, and ending with Phyllis Henley. It had to be the end. Rhoda Brocklebank had a part too, although he found it hard to give it a name. A voice crying out a message which you could not always understand or believe in, but which was important. Something between the Fool as in Shakespeare and a Fury as in a Greek tragedy. Now he thought he knew the sort of case he had to deal with, and what he had read had pointed which way to look for the killer. He put his head round the door and spoke to Evans. ‘Good work. Now here's some more.’ He gave Evans a telephone number. ‘That's the personal number of a friend of mine, Captain Magrath, he's with the Philadelphia police. Talk to him, tell him all the details of what we have here and see what he says. Similar crimes, and so on.’ Magrath was a police psychologist, and they had met in Rome at an international conference on violent crime. ‘And don't talk about it to anyone outside the shop. ‘Wouldn't dream of it, sir,’ said Evans, hurt. As Coffin went back to his desk, he thought: It's a kind of disease. There doesn't have to be a motive. But there he was wrong."
FIC FIC-H9D-002 -0.12 "THE WORLD OF LEARNING The room on the first floor of Meadowbanks, Viola Machin's house, in which Mr Kronweiser plied his research was very tiny indeed. A gimcrack modern desk table (‘Good enough for him’) had been placed there, and there were a few shelves, stocked with the works of Walter Machin, cheap editions of Lawrence, Walter Greenwood, Orwell, Sillitoe and others, and copies of periodicals which had contributed to the revival of interest in Machin's books. These were the basic tools of Mr Kronweiser's research, and the study was only just big enough to hold them and him. Dwight Kronweiser came to this room every day, spending his mornings going through the manuscript fiction, personal letters and other papers which had been stored in the attic for thirty years before his arrival. He made transcripts of the fiction, and of all the other major documents. These he carried home, partly because the little room lacked storage space, partly to appease the secretive, magpie instinct which was part of his nature: he loved to keep, hide, obfuscate, cover his tracks; he had fantasies in the watches of the night of other scholars stealing a march on him and publishing the definitive study of Walter Machin first (though how that would be possible, in view of his privileged position, he would have been hard put to it to say). He saw mainly the cloak and dagger aspects of scholarship, and acted accordingly. Home, for Mr Kronweiser, was a large bedroom in a  working-class house to the north of the town. In spite of his expressed desire to soak up atmosphere, he did not feel at home there. His landlady didn't understand him. So he spent long days and evenings at Meadowbanks, working (when he had done a stint of transcription) on the manuscript which was destined to be the Walter Machin volume in the Payne's Great Authors series of monographs. He sat at his desk, the edge pressed hard against his belly, seeming not to have an ounce of surplus bone in his body, meditating, cogitating, moulding his concrete blocks of critical prose: The major problem Machin confronts in The Factory Whistle is that of irrelation, which in its turn is his means of defining the absolute. The complementary, interpenetrating phenomena in proletarian life that the implied narrator confronts, and by confronting epiphanizes, are a means primarily of defining his own ambivalent relation both to the zeitgeist and to his own eternal validity. Mr Kronweiser stared at the ceiling in creative agony for a space, and then, neatly scoring through the word ‘validity’, he substituted ‘authenticity’. Having changed this stage in the argument to his liking, Dwight Kronweiser began contemplating his next deathless paragraph, and gazed fixedly ahead of him as polysyllabic concepts moved through his mind like heavy artillery on parade. In the middle of this elephantine travail, there came a knock on the door. Mr Kronweiser's reaction was odd: he sprang to a crouch over his manuscript, then put a piece of clean paper over it. Then he blinked his eyes nervously, and said: ‘Yes?’ It was Hilda Machin, peeping round the door with a cocksparrow expression, like the coming of spring. ‘Well, hello, Mrs — er — Machin, this is an honour,’ said Dwight Kronweiser, uncurling himself from his protective  position, then getting up with an attempt at expansiveness. ‘I appreciate your looking me up in my cubby-hole, I really do. Now, do sit down a moment — we can just fit another chair in here.’ And he bustled out on to the landing to fetch a straight-backed chair that stood there for no particular reason. As he did so, he kept darting his eyes nervously back to his little room and the manuscript on the desk; but when he got back in, puffing a little, he was smiling and giving little mutters of pleasure: ‘Well, this sure is nice of you, real friendly…’ Hilda Machin settled herself down on the chair, smiling happily and looking guilelessly at Mr Kronweiser who, if the truth were known, amused her very much. She looked disparagingly round his little cubby-hole as he squeezed his belly back into its pouch in the middle of the desk. ‘You are cramped in here, aren't you?’ she said. ‘She could have given you a bit more room.’ ‘Believe me, I'm deeply grateful to be given any sort of study at all, deeply grateful. Just the chance to transcribe the manuscripts was the most fantastic luck, the greatest thing that's ever happened to me. I'd have been happy to transcribe them just anyplace.’ ‘Oh, we wouldn't want to let them out of our sight,’ said Hilda. Mr Kronweiser was unsure about that ‘we’: was it a plural, or was it an ironic reference to Viola Machin? He laughed nervously. ‘Anyway, she could have given you the study downstairs,’ continued Hilda. ‘It's not used, and that way you could have kept everything together. You've no room here to keep anything at all.’ ‘Oh, I keep everything at home — I file them there, on my own system,’ said Mr Kronweiser eagerly. ‘I shouldn't in any case keep the originals and the transcripts in one place, no sir. You never know what might eventuate.’ ‘Really?’ said Hilda, wide-eyed. ‘What sort of eventuations had you in mind? Burglary? Fire?’ ‘Believe you me, anything can happen,’ said Mr  Kronweiser, with gloomy relish. ‘Friend of mine at Duke — had his PhD stolen — all the manuscripts, notes, card indexes, the whole caboodle! It turned up a year later, all rewritten but basically identical, as a PhD at San Diego. No kidding! And there wasn't a damned thing he could do about it. Another guy had his in his car. Parked it to buy a pack of cigarettes — the car was stolen by a couple of kids going joy-riding. They used the PhD to light a bonfire to barbecue some steaks they'd nicked. Judge said he couldn't put an estimate on the value of the typescript, and ignored it in the sentence. Boy! That guy was sore as a cowboy's…’ Mr Kronweiser faded out abruptly and subsided into coughs. He was sweating heavily with emotion. ‘Ee, well, you do lead exciting lives,’ said Hilda Machin. ‘I'd never have guessed.’ ‘Others just buy and sell them,’ continued Kronweiser lugubriously. ‘Regular black market. Three thous the going rate, or was a few years back. No go nowadays. The bottom's dropped right out of the market.’ ‘Oh? Why's that?’ ‘Hell, with eighty per cent of PhDs unemployed, what's the point?’ ‘So that's why you keep your transcripts at home, is it?’ said Hilda, still looking at Kronweiser with an expression of absorbed interest. ‘I suppose it is safer.’ ‘Hell yes. And I mail a carbon to Jackson's. That way we're triply safe. Anyway, I'm through with the fiction, so that side of it's sewn up.’ ‘Really? Is it all transcribed?’ ‘Yep. Finished the last short story today — barring unforeseen discoveries, naturally.’ ‘Which one is that?’ asked Hilda, putting out her hand towards the manuscript on the desk. Mr Kronweiser sprang into his earlier stance of crouching flabby tiger, then with a deprecatory smile he relaxed stiffly and began rummaging in the top drawer. ‘That's my manuscript  there,’ he said hesitatingly; ‘naturally I feel its manifest imperfections.’ He took out a typescript, to which was attached a handwritten manuscript. With visible reluctance he handed it to Hilda Machin. ‘Oh, one of the early ones,’ she said brightly, handling the work of her late husband with no notable reverence, and casually flicking through it. ‘Handwritten. Yes, I remember it. He wrote it — let's see — one wet Sunday. It must have been about nineteen thirty-seven or eight. It's a poor piece, or so he thought. He didn't include it in Colton Town.’ ‘Very true. But there were one or two deeply interesting passages in that story, invaluable for the thesis I shall present in my study of his work. And it will fill out the new volume of shorter pieces too.’ Hilda, deep in her reading, nevertheless perked up at this and shot a sharp glance in Mr Kronweiser's direction. ‘Oh, so there will be two new volumes, will there?’ ‘That's right. The second novel, of course, and then the shorter pieces — stories and some newspaper articles, and so on . We should easily make it into two hundred pages or so.’ ‘Well, I'm glad about that. What are you going to call them? I suppose it will be you as will give them their titles?’ ‘In the case of the novel that won't be necessary. He left behind a list of alternatives. Perhaps you'd like to have a look at them?’ On Hilda Machin's nodding, Mr Kronweiser calmly took back the copy of the short story and the original manuscript, clipped them together, and put them back carefully in their right place in the drawer. Then he went to another drawer and extracted a piece of paper, squinting at it carefully before he handed it over. ‘This is it,’ he said. ‘Just as he left it.’ The typescript (with odd mis-spellings and typing errors reproduced from the original) ran to nine or ten  titles. Hilda Machin read it with every appearance of interest. ‘Spinning Jenny’, she said with contempt. ‘Pretty obvious that. The Loon of Age — now that really would put people off: what was Walter thinking of? Satanic Mills bit overdone: he made a nice enough living out of them…. Ee, they're all a bit tired, aren't they?’ ‘You have no preferences, then?’ ‘Not I. You might as well call it Trouble up at t'Mill and have done with it as far as I'm concerned. You know, I think the thing was that he was out of date, and by the time he wrote the second book he knew it. He began too late. If he'd started in the early ‘thirties, when we were courting and when the Depression was really biting, then he'd have done all right. But all Walter thought about at that time was slap and tickle in the grass, and you can quote me on that, as knows. But it was years before he got started, and ‘thirty-nine before he got published. By then it was too late. People were tired of that sort of thing. Then there was t'war and all. Poor old Walter. He missed the band-wagon.’ The list dropped from her hand, and Mr Kronweiser seized on it to restore it to its place. ‘It's heart-warming,’ volunteered Mr Kronweiser, ‘that justice will be done to him at last.’ ‘I don't suppose it will warm his heart,’ said Hilda. ‘So I'll note down that you have no special wishes about the title, then, Mrs Machin.’ ‘Not really. I haven't read the book, or not much of it, that I remember. I suppose Tripe and Onions was the best of them. One of the ones with ‘tripe’ in it, anyway.’ Dwight Kronweiser looked at her hard, blinking his pale, short-sighted eyes. Hilda Machin pulled herself up and looked at her wristwatch in mock consternation. ‘Well, this isn't getting the cow milked. What I came for was, I brought that letter you were talking about.’ ‘The one from London?’ ‘That's the one. I found it in my old snap album. Daft  place to put it, but there… He talks about seeing his publisher, and getting a better contract for the next book. It was June, ‘thirty-nine, as you can see. I knew I'd had a letter from him then, because it was the last time we were apart before he was called up.’ ‘Hmm, hmm,’ said Mr Kronweiser, reading the letter through with little snuffles of academic contentment. ‘Neat! Very good. I'm deeply grateful to you, Mrs Machin, deeply grateful. I'll see you get it back in no time at all.’ ‘Oh, don't worry,’ said Hilda, getting up to go. ‘I'm not sentimental about him, you know — far from it.’ ‘Now you do yourself an injustice there, I know. As I say, I'll get it back to you just as soon as I've managed to make a copy of it.’ ‘And you'll file it with the other stuff, will you?’ asked Hilda Machin at the door. ‘Infinite riches in a little room?’ As she closed the door after her, Mr Kronweiser looked at it for a minute or two in puzzlement. Wasn't that some sort of quotation? He couldn't quite place it. Not his period, anyway. Or was it a proverb? Either way, he couldn't make that dame out. What's more, he didn't like her — which meant, in Kronweiser idiom, that he didn't trust her — which meant, in its turn, that she was not wholly devoted to the interests of Dwight Kronweiser, MA, Ph.D. What was she up to? What made her tick? How sharp was she? He didn't like the way her accent changed, he didn't like the way she'd sit there looking cosy as a mother chook and then shoot a sharp glance at him, like she understood him through and through. Mr Kronweiser didn't know where he stood with her, and he hated that feeling. He looked back to the letter, and went through it again — still thinking and frowning. That night, as Hilda Machin was boiling milk in the kitchen for her good night cup of coffee, an unusual thing  happened. Viola Machin came to the kitchen. Came quite deliberately, though as usual Hilda had made plenty of noise coming down the stairs to ensure that her presence was known. On Viola's approach down the hall, Hilda turned up the gas and made preparation for a hasty departure, but this, it seemed, was not the idea. ‘No, no, don't hurry, Hilda,’ said Viola, sailing in, all arrogant bosom and cold cream, but smiling condescendingly. She went to the bread bin and seemed to be preparing to make herself a piece of toast. Hilda did not turn down the gas. ‘We have been a little silly sometimes in the past, don't you think, Hilda?’ went on Viola. ‘I'm sure that once in a while we can be in the same kitchen without explosions occurring, don't you agree? We are civilized people, after all.’ ‘Aye, ‘appen,’ said Hilda. Nothing annoyed Viola Machin more, as a general rule, than Hilda putting on the broad Lancashire. It seemed to her like an assertion of closeness to the dead Walter that she could not match. But tonight her face seemed frozen into its gracious expression, like royalty in a traffic jam, and if she wished to herself that Hilda would make the odd concession so that civil conversation with her could be easier, nothing of this appeared in her manner. ‘Mr Kronweiser seems to be getting on very nicely with the transcriptions,’ said Viola, slotting the bread into the toaster. ‘Oh aye?’ said Hilda. ‘You went to see him this morning…?’ ‘That's right.’ Viola Machin repressed a sigh. ‘Did you have anything interesting to show him?’ ‘Well,’ said Hilda, raising her voice slightly, ‘I didn't go for the pleasure of his company. I didn't go because I was suddenly seized by an overwhelming passion for him, we didn't make love on the tiger-skin rug in that little box of a  room you gave him, his pear-shaped body pressed against my ageing but still voluptuous frame.’ Viola Machin left a few moments' pause. ‘You know, I've always thought it was your sense of humour that attracted Walter to you, Hilda.’ ‘Because otherwise it's totally inexplicable, eh?’ ‘Now, Hilda, let's not start that silly bickering, please. You can't say I came here tonight wanting a row — that you can't say.’ ‘No, you came here wanting to know what I'd been saying to Mr Kronweiser today.’ Viola Machin, seated in a dignified pose on the corner of the kitchen table, her white and pale blue brunch coat billowing around her, found her pose of aggrieved innocence difficult to keep up. ‘All right, all right . I admit it,’ she said. ‘And the answer is: I took him a letter.’ ‘Oh yes — er — one of Walter's?’ ‘One of Walter's,’ said Hilda, looking concentratedly at Viola. ‘When he was in London. Seeing his publishers. June nineteen thirty-nine. OK?’ ‘Was there anything in it? Anything…personal?’ ‘He sent his love. Is that all right? Not too hot to handle, for an old-fashioned family publisher like Jackson's? Oh, and there was love and kisses for Rose too.’ ‘I see. So there was nothing more…controversial. Well, I'm glad. I'm sure he'll find it very useful. I'm looking forward to reading his book.’ ‘So'm I. Don't get many good laughs these days.’ ‘Now Hilda! I'm sure he'll do a very good job…’ ‘The idea of a chap like that, writing a book on Walter: it's enough to make the cat laugh.’ ‘Well, he was interested — and he was the first. Of course, if I'd waited just a few months, I could have had anyone I liked. But there: I couldn't have known the interest there'd be.’ ‘There's one comfort,’ said Hilda, sipping her coffee. ‘He treats his manuscript like a mummy lion her cubs. With a bit of luck he won't be able to bear to part with it to a publisher. Save us all a lot of red faces.’ ‘I don't think, Hilda, that you're approaching this revival of interest in Walter's work in the right frame of mind.’ ‘Oh me — I'm tickled pink. If I wasn't, I wouldn't have kept quiet about you and him, would I?’ Viola Machin, torn between a desire to protest that she had nothing to hide, and a feeling that she had, said at last, reluctantly: ‘Well, yes, that's true: and I'm grateful to you for that, Hilda.’ ‘So you should be. But there's one thing, Viola, that I don't think you really realize.’ ‘What's that?’ ‘That Kronweiser. You think he's an idiot, because he gets things wrong-the background, the politics, Walter, us. And he does, all the time. But: he's not stupid, Viola. He's not stupid. And I think we both ought to realize that. Otherwise —’ Hilda Machin looked at her husband's second wife, raised an eyebrow, and then flopped in her furry slippers down the hall. Viola Machin bent heavily over the table buttering her toast — very, very thoughtful."
FIC FIC-H85-001 -0.09 "Chapter Three The murder case slipped easily into its next phase, as if it had been programmed by a computer that had access to several personal files and knew where they interacted. Coffin was still pondering on the significance of what he had seen written on the piece of paper from Place's jacket. He had sent jacket and paper off to the laboratories, demanding an instant report. This had arrived and a copy had been sent to Inspector Lane. As far as they could tell, the writing, by a ballpoint, was Egan's. The paper was of poor quality and had been torn off a pad of the kind you might keep in a kitchen or by a telephone. In Place's pocket it had picked up fluff and minute scraps of human skin and hair. It had both Egan's fingerprints on it and those of Place, blurred but identifiable. At the same time a determined police search for Terry Place began in the area down by the river. It was neither quiet nor unobtrusive, since it was not intended to be. The aim was to frighten Place into acting hastily. Within a further twenty-four hours, his sister, Mrs Roxie Farmer, divorcee, was taken in for questioning at Royal Hill police station, but claimed she knew nothing. In spite of an onslaught by Inspector Paul Lane, she gave nothing away. That is, until the very end of the interview. Lane had been assisted by a woman police officer, Detective  -Sergeant Phyllis Henley, a thickset girl, whom he had called in because she was an old friend or enemy of Roxie whose own life had not been without criminal excitements. On the table between the two police officers, in view of Roxie, lay the forensic report on the jacket found in Roxie's house. ‘Come on now, Roxie, you know me.’ Sergeant Henley prided herself on her power to prise out information by a mixture of persuasion and light bullying like the icing on a cake, and although this had never worked particularly well with Roxie in the past, this was no reason not to try it now. Roxie stayed silent as if she was determined not to be cozened, but she shifted uneasily in her chair. ‘You can trust me.’ Roxie looked sceptical, but still said nothing, just another little fidget. ‘If I say we know your brother has been with you, then you can believe we do know. And if I say we think you know where he is now, then you can believe we know that too.’ It was a long speech for Sergeant Henley, who relied on smiles and sighs and significant silences. And then a snap. The snap came now. ‘Roxie, you had a tweed jacket hanging in your hall and that tweed jacket was worn by him very recently.’ She did not add that it had blood on it, although she knew that too, having just read the forensic report. Roxie shrugged. ‘Something sharp cut the pocket lining. Lost a kitchen knife, have you, Roxie?’ Roxie looked sullen. ‘Threaten you with it, did he, Roxie? Where's your  daughter, Roxie? Sent her away, haven't you? Threaten her with the knife, if you talked, did he?’ Roxie found her voice. ‘Shut up, you.’ Sergeant Henley gave the Inspector a quick triumphant glance. ‘I think I could make a guess where your daughter is, and probably so could he. I know where your aunt lives. He's better caught. Tell us where he is then, Roxie.’ Roxie set her mouth firmly in silence. It looked like the edge of a knife itself. Sergeant Henley said, without noticeable kindness: ‘If I were you, Roxie, I'd get your daughter home. She'd be better off with you than that drunken aunt of yours. Mrs Bow, she is now, isn't she? Her husband's none too safe with little girls, or hasn't anyone told you that?’ After a short pause, Roxie muttered: ‘Remember he's a little rat that likes a hole.’ ‘Oh, come on, that's not good enough. No puzzlers.’ Paul Lane was cold. ‘You say what you mean in plain English.’ Sergeant Henley said: ‘Speak up now. Or Uncle Bow might find himself doing a lifer for your Rosie.’ Roxie said suddenly, ‘There's a tunnel down by the river. I don't know where. You'd have to find it. Greenwich Pier. He used to play in it years ago. In the war.’ Years ago, thought Paul Lane, I suppose it's still there. Well, she thinks it is, anyway. ‘Thanks, Roxie,’ he said, and pulled the telephone towards him. When he had given his orders and they were alone he said: ‘You were rough on her, Phyllis.’ ‘But I got a result. And I'll tell you something else: what really frightened Roxie was that the kid might cooperate with Uncle Bow.’ Lane shrugged. He was never sure how to take his Phyllis. ‘It's been known,’ said Phyllis. The message about the tunnel went to John Coffin, who got into touch with the Port of London Authority and the Greenwich Pier management for information and, better still, maps. ‘No picnic, searching down there,’ said the man at the end of the telephone. ‘Do my best for you, but sometimes we don't know what we've got ourselves.’ Next morning in Queen Charlotte's Alley, Sarah Fleming was preparing a picnic for her brother Peter. She was doing so reluctantly, it was her Poly day and she really did not have time. The little ones, the very little ones, called it her ‘Holy day’, not distinguishing clearly between Poly and Holy. Sarah wondered if they were deaf in addition to other deficiencies. Growing deafer, moreover, as they had certainly not been deaf as babies. Putting all their energies into deafness rather than growing bigger and taller. It was the sort of fantasy she must not harbour. ‘I've given you ham and cucumber. And there's a Thermos of coffee.’ ‘It ought to be smoked salmon and champagne for her,’ said Peter. He was dressed ready for his outing in clean jeans and a white shirt. Sarah wore almost the same clothes, except that her shirt was red. A gesture to her political feelings. ‘She's only a kid.’ ‘That's the sort of girl she is.’ He saw himself as a great, strong animal who could always protect his girl. A bear? ‘Count yourself lucky I didn't make you Marmite sandwiches.’ ‘There ought to be wine and music and a boat on the river,’ he said dreamily. ‘And you in a white tie and tails, I suppose.’ They had recently watched an old Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers film on the television in which she thought she saw the source of his fantasy. ‘What about work? Aren't you going in?’ He had a part-time job in a large firm of chemists where he worked in the stockrooms. There had been rumours of redundancies. ‘Got the day off. Had it due. Sal…do you think I could do what you are doing? Work for my A's and then go to university?’ ‘Well I've had my turn, only right you should have yours,’ said Sarah judicially. ‘I don't know about the little ones, though. I certainly can't take them to Oxford with me. I was relying on you.’ They both looked at their younger brothers and sisters, who stared blankly back. ‘I could take them out to the middle of a lake in a boat and drop them in. They can't swim. I have taken that precaution.’ ‘I never know when you are serious or not.’ ‘And I never know with you,’ she answered. There was a pause, broken by the girl. ‘You'd have to stop playing games.’ ‘I don't play games.’ Sarah shrugged. ‘I'd manage.’ He looked hopeful. ‘Fix something up. I might go to night school or something. Or the Open University.’ ‘You'd have to work at your grades.’ His sister was at once more realistic and more perceptive. ‘You've never been much of an exam passer.’ Very poor, in fact, but no point in discouraging him. Another dream, though. He had so many. She saw him passing the day in a cloud of dreams. ‘You mean why bother?’ he said, seeing more than she had meant him to. ‘I want to be as good as them, the Pitts. Look at what they are and what we are. What we've got and what they've got. It's not right. Things ought to be more equal.’ ‘We're what we are and they are what they are.’ For various reasons, intellectual, historical and sexual, it was easier for her to accept things as they were than for Peter. Round the corner in No 22, Church Row, Irene Pitt was watching her daughter prepare for a picnic. ‘Sure you want to go?’ ‘Got to.’ Irene raised her eyebrows. ‘That's not the way to enjoy yourself. If that's what you are going to do, of course.’ ‘I promised. ‘Is that a bottle of wine?’ ‘I thought we could use it.’ ‘Want any fruit? There's a pineapple in the refrigerator. Brie? I bought a nice wedge yesterday. Plenty if you want it. I'm going out to lunch myself.’ With Chris, of course. ‘Just the wine.’ They were in the kitchen, Irene still in a dressing-gown, an ivory frilled cotton to which she gave a golden glow, and Nona in jeans with a white shirt. Edward had gone off to see an editor at the BBC; he wanted to talk about a project on the Third World, and the boy was at school. ‘How did you get the day off from school?’ Irene slipped a few rich chocolates in a plastic bag and gave them to her daughter. ‘The sixth form can work at home.’ She looked at her mother. ‘All right, this isn't work, but it's a goodbye session.’ Or it would be, if she could get Peter to understand. ‘I told you. So it's only once.’ Irene laughed. ‘We always think that. It's not so easy saying goodbye.’ 'Breaking things up? No, I know that. A lot of things are breaking up now.’ 'You mean because of Chris and me. Do you mind? But that's silly. Of course you mind.’ 'Yes, I do. Who will I stay with, you or Dad?’ 'I suppose you will choose. You know that. We agreed.’ The divorce had been talked over thoroughly in New York, or so she had thought. Now she wondered. But goodness knows, Nona had had her say there. Nona looked around the kitchen. ‘I might stay here. Just might. I'd want to go on seeing you a lot, though.’ 'Thanks.’ 'Don't be sharp. It's one of your worst things.’ 'Is that why you've never told me before what happened with you and Peter before we all went to New York? Did you think I'd be sharp? I wouldn't  have been. But I think you wanted me to know. You let me read that story you wrote for your class magazine: The Dragon's Mouth. That was really you and Peter finding that thing in the wood, wasn't it?’ ‘Might have been.’ ‘Might?’ ‘Was, then.’ ‘It frightened me that you had not told me. Made it important, very real.’ Nona shrugged. ‘All the same, you didn't hand out many details. You made it a kind of fable. But there was a real incident, I know.’ Nona still kept quiet. ‘I don't want to talk about it. I promised.’ Irene would have gone on, but for the arrival of Mrs Brocklebank. She surveyed Nona and her preparation for a picnic. ‘Off out? It's going to rain.’ ‘It won't rain.’ Nona slung her bag over her shoulder. ‘Thanks for the chocs. Anyway, we're going to see the Cutty Sark.’ ‘A lot of police down there. You're not supposed to see them, but you can. All over the place like rabbits.’ ‘Who cares?’ Nona picked up the wine bottle, gave her mother a look and was gone. Mrs Brocklebank had created a little nest for herself in the basement where she put her clothes and her big black handbag, from which she was only rarely and reluctantly parted, and where she tucked away any odds and ends it was better Brock at home did not see. Money was one. A woman was entitled to her own savings. She had such nests in every one of  her working places, which her employers were only vaguely aware of. She had a kind of natural skill in camouflage. Now she went to her corner next to which was a cupboard no one seemed to know about except Mrs Brocklebank, shared by her and a certain amount of animal life, and deposited her bag and coat. There was a small mirror hanging on the door in which she combed her hair; a woman liked to look her best even at work. She was troubled and anxious. ‘As though one death wasn't enough,’ she said to herself. ‘There's got to be others, by the look of it. And they say there's nothing wrong with this house and I'm imagining things.’ She had been a childhood friend of William Egan and though no one could truly mourn such a man of violence, still she had her loyalties, and he was a man who had known how to trade on them. Later that day she would pop in, her words, to see Roxie Farmer in Abinger Road; she knew her too. ‘Roxie,’ she would say, ‘every one of us has to look after their own. It's our duty, and you and I have done it. Me in my way, you in yours. But that Terry of yours has put himself beyond it. I reckon I know where he is as well as you do, and I might have to say. If he gets killed, he's got only himself to blame.’ All the same, she wished she had been stronger in her advice to Nona not to go down by the Cutty Sark. She had been too indirect, she should have said: Look love, this is old Brocklebank speaking straight. It could be dangerous down there. She got out her scrubbing brush. ‘I'll just give the  front step a scrub. I didn't like the look of it at all this morning. The police and picnickers converged upon the river. Peter and Nona were not the only people planning to eat in the open air, because a coachload of school-children together with four teachers, all carrying packed lunches, had arrived to visit the Cutty Sark and then Gypsy Moth in its dry dock. ‘Lot of people about. Too many.’ It wasn't what Peter had had in mind when he had thought of the picnic. Something more pastoral and solitary had been his vision. ‘Some of them are policemen, I think. Mrs Brocklebank said so.’ Nona looked about her with interest, trying to identify which of the young men in her vicinity could possibly be policemen. ‘There has been a murder, you know. They are looking for clues, I suppose. And for the murderer.’ ‘I know. I don't want to talk about it.’ He gripped her arm. ‘Come on. There's a lot of things I want to show you. ‘Yes, and I want to see. I am very interested. I like objects, I've discovered that recently. But don't hold me so tight.’ He had once been the leader and she had been the unquestioning follower, but all that had changed now. Surely he could see it. He did not seem to have heard. ‘Quickly now. First the Cutty Sark and then we'll explore down by the river. Then our picnic on the hill by the Old Observatory.’ But when they were in the clipper Nona took a  more detailed interest than he did. She was fascinated by the Saloon, set out for dinner with silver and glass; she hovered over the display of figureheads; but it was the rigging of the clipper that caught her imagination most. She stood at the foot of the mainmast, staring up at the intricacy of the complicated tracery of sails, spars and rope. ‘You know why it is called the Cutty Sark?’ ‘Just a name.’ Peter was not interested. ‘Had to call it something.’ ‘It's from Robert Burns's poem Tam o’ Shanter. It's about a witch who chased him on his mare. The Cutty Sark is the little shift or chemise the witch was wearing. ‘Funny name.’ ‘It probably comes from the French word sacque, that was a kind of loose blouse. It must mean the pronunciation was nearer to sark than sack.’ ‘Or at least in Scotland.’ He turned away. He hated being instructed. ‘Anyway, it's not a bad name for a ship. I suppose it means she went like a witch.’ The vessel was getting crowded now as another school party arrived. Nona would have lingered, looking at the fo'c'sle where the crew had slept, and the galley where the food was prepared, but he hurried her on. ‘Let's go down to the pier. I want to show you something.’ The two of them were noticed and observed by at least two policemen. One was a young detective-constable, seconded from the Bromley district, who noticed Nona. He thought she was beautiful. He considered trying to make her acquaintance, but two  things moved against it. First, he was on a job, and secondly, he knew without putting into words that she was no girlfriend for an ambitious copper. There was a third thing: he had caught sight of a superior officer: John Coffin. Coffin was the other police officer who saw them. He gave the pair a friendly glance as they walked towards the riverside. He was here checking up on the search for Terry Place. The feeling was the hunt was going well; they would find him. Earlier that morning, speaking on the telephone, Paul Lane had said, ‘With the number of men we have searching he can't get away. Not if he's in the area, and everything tells me he is.’ ‘He could stay in hiding a long while before we flushed him out.’ No one knew better than John Coffin what a network of alleys, underground passages, and dark basements nestling in old buildings still lay near the river. ‘Not the way I see it.’ Lane had been positive in his usual clear-minded manner. One did not use the word cocky of such as Paul Lane, but it did cross Coffin's mind, if in no unfriendly spirit. He had been cocky himself once, and none the worse for it now. ‘I'll keep in touch.’ That was the other side of the coin with the Inspector. He might be strong in his own opinions but he did not go haring off on his own. He kept in touch. A young plain clothes man touched his arm. ‘Inspector Lane is looking for you, sir. He's over there in his car.’ Coffin turned his back to the pier, Peter and Nona  had already disappeared down a flight of steps, and walked towards the road, where a line of police vehicles was drawn up. Lane sprang out of the first car at his approach. ‘We've got him, sir.’ ‘Good. Where?’ ‘Get in, and we'll go there. Forget the river. I reckon Roxie was leading us on there. Now we place him in a house. Up the hill, more towards Charlton way. Not down here by the river as we thought, after all. He always was a cunning beggar, and Roxie's another one.’ As the car travelled up the hill in Greenwich Park, Lane explained. ‘He was sighted by a local man on the beat, was at school with him, is sure it's Terry.’ ‘You mean you haven't actually got your hands on him?’ ‘He was seen going into a house in Maryon Park Gardens. It's a street his sister admits he knew, had a girlfriend there. And he's not answering the door or coming out. It has to be Place.’ They drew up before one of a pair of red brick semi-detached houses in a street of other houses like it. ‘And this is it?’ Coffin studied the neat quiet house with a plot of garden in the front. ‘Who's the house owner?’ ‘Neighbours say it's an old chap called Masterton. He's in hospital. He's had lodgers in and out.’ There was another police car at the kerb, with a woman sitting in the back. Coffin studied her face. She looked unhappy. ‘That's Place's sister. Roxie Farmer. We got her  down here.’ He turned towards Coffin. ‘So what now? Do we go in?’ ‘No.’ Coffin sat back. ‘Not yet. We wait.’ Nona and Peter wandered by the river, with Peter pointing out the various features that interested him. Nona stared at the grey river where the wind was picking up little waves and throwing them against the walls of the river walk. ‘Do you ever think about that thing that happened to us in the park? Before I went away. Do you think about it?’ ‘A long while ago now, Nona.’ ‘It was horrible.’ She shivered. ‘Animals die in the open air.’ He stroked her arm. ‘It's natural. Don't let it upset you.’ He was soothing her, but all the same there was excitement rippling through the muscles of his arm. ‘You haven't spoken to anyone about it?’ ‘No. No, I haven't spoken to anyone.’ Not spoken, no. Told the whole world through a short story, if they wanted to read it. Looking down at the river, she could see that the level had dropped, uncovering lines of bricks on the wall beneath them that looked as if they rarely saw the sun. The timber supports of the pier could be seen increasingly. ‘Low tide.’ Peter nodded and drew her to the rail of the river-walk to look over the side. ‘That's why I wanted us to get moving. I knew the tide would be on the ebb. And it's a very low tide now. Things get uncovered that you can't see easily at other times.’ He knew  about the river; in different times might have worked on it, happily and well. He pointed to a dark patch to their left and very low down. ‘See that door?’ She tried to make it out. ‘Is there a door?’ ‘Doesn't look like one from here, but it is one. You'll see when we get closer.’ ‘Are we going to get closer?’ She looked down at her white slippers, not fancying the mud and muck she could see there. Also, would they have to swim? ‘There's a tunnel behind the door. It leads right up the hill into the park. I've heard that there's another door in the park somewhere, but I've never been able to find it. I spent hours looking when I was a kid.’ ‘What was the tunnel used for?’ Seriously, he said, ‘I used to think for smuggling or for prisoners to escape. But I suppose really it was for supplies that came by ship to be carried to some of the houses on the hill, the Ranger's House, or the Observatory.’ ‘Is it used now?’ He shook his head, looking amused. ‘Most people don't know anything about it.’ ‘You do, though.’ He nodded. ‘I've been down there. It's good. Secret. Private.’ He took her hand in his own warm, dry one. ‘Come on. Let's go there now.’ ‘No. It looks wet and horrible. And I don't see how.’ She tried to draw her hand away. ‘Not wet at all,’ he coaxed. ‘Dry as a bone. And there's a little ledge to walk on. You won't get your feet wet. Or I could carry you.’ ‘If I come, then we won't stay long?’ After all, she had entered on this day to please him. And she had said she wanted to see places of historical interest. He was only doing his bit. ‘No, of course not. Then have our picnic.’ There was an iron gate which looked rusted and stuck but which opened to a touch, a flight of stone steps to the water level, and then she let herself be led along a narrow shelf which from the look of it was usually under water. The entrance to the tunnel was a low wooden door. Tucked away unobtrusively in an angle of the river wall, it was also protected by a brick overhang. She could understand why most people did not know it was there. ‘Do we have to go in? Anyway, it must be locked.’ In spite of her best efforts there was a green stain on her white slippers. ‘And damn, I've dropped the chocolates in the water.’ ‘Forget the chocolates, and the lock is broken. Come on.’ He gave the door a strong push. With a creak it opened inwards on a dark hole. A breath of moist, yeasty air puffed out towards them. ‘Thought you said it wasn't damp?’ ‘Look at the walls and floor. Dry as a bone.’ The walls were brick lined and the floor covered with dull tiles set in a herringbone pattern that reminded her of a Roman villa she had once seen near the South Coast. A small interest stirred inside her. Couldn't be Roman, of course, she could see that, but wasn't it interesting how traditional ways of doing things carried on? ‘If you say so.’ There were things that looked like  ragged mushrooms growing out of the wall. On the other hand, the floor was dry. Peter drew a torch out of his pocket and held it above his head; the beam spread out, eventually spending itself against the darkness of the tunnel. The path rose gently above water level and then bent to the left. Probably it went up the hill in a series of gentle planes. Carts might have been used to drag supplies up it, sufficient width was there. ‘That's it, then.’ She had seen enough and was ready to go. ‘No, let's go inside. Just a bit. I've always wanted to go beyond that curve and I haven't liked to do it on my own.’ She gave him a sharp, surprised look. ‘Why not?’ He shrugged. ‘Don't know what's beyond. Better to have someone with you.’ He was a surprising boy. Imagination and nerves just when you did not expect it. She took a few paces forward. ‘What about rats?’ ‘If there are any, then they will be more frightened of us than we are of them.’ ‘Not true,’ she said with conviction. ‘I will be more frightened than they are.’ ‘Oh, come on. I'll keep any rats away. ‘I thought I heard something.’ ‘Let's take a look.’ He was moving forward, and to keep in touch with him and the light from the torch she had to move too. ‘We might find the other exit. No one 's been here for years.’ ‘No?’ The air in the passage stirred and folded itself about her. She wrinkled her nose. If no one had been here for years, why did she fancy she could smell cigarette smoke? Inside the hall of the house in Maryon Park Gardens, a tearful, frightened little man was explaining that his name was Bill Pitkin, that he was not Terry Place, that he had never seen Terry Place nor ever heard of him. And, no, he had nothing to hide. The only reason he had not opened the front door had been because he was frightened. He did not know who was trying to break in."
FIC FIC-K8V-005 -0.03 "Seven It was a warm evening. Suddenly and unseasonably warm. Coffin found it hard to tuck into Mrs Lorimer's cold beef and salad after having eaten Lily Bates's stew. Nor did he fancy it greatly; after some years away from Mrs Lorimer's hotel and of looking after himself, eating exactly what he liked, it was hard to get used to her iron hand with a potato. All over Greenwich and down into Deptford and along in Woolwich, people were protesting at the sudden heat. It was unnatural, they said, hot days ought to start gradually, beginning with dawn, but this one had hit them suddenly between four and five in the afternoon. By six-thirty it was hot, with the temperature still rising. For some unexplained reason many housewives had cooked beef in one form or another that night and Coffin was probably lucky to find his second supper was cold, for all over South London people were pushing their plates back. ‘And what are you doing this evening?’ asked Mrs Lorimer. She was virtually retired these days, her hotel (where Coffin had once lived) turned into small flats over whose tenants she kept a stern eye. A favoured few like John Coffin could still be housed en pension, as it were. It was because of the overpowering force of this favouritism that he had chosen to  move elsewhere, making the demands of his job the pretext. ‘I'm going to my evening class.’ ‘Oh, which one? German, or the other one? ‘The family history one.’ He could have lied, but he usually found himself speaking the truth to Mrs Lorimer; it was another reason for moving out. ‘Still intent on finding your lost brother?’ She shook her head. ‘A waste of time.’ ‘I don't think so. And I enjoy it.’ He did. If he hadn't been a detective he might have been a historian. Indeed, there was a sense in which he was a historian: he loved investigating source material, going back to the originals, and patiently fitting one piece of evidence into the pattern with another. ‘It's the girl that teaches the class: the one with red hair.’ ‘No, it isn't.’ Another thing she disapproved of was his passionate interest in the other sex. But he did like the young woman, a hoyden from Somerville who gambled on the horses and was always broke. ‘All right, what are you doing this week?’ It was a challenge; not for nothing had Mrs Lorimer been a formidable ARP warden in the war, and later a JP. ‘Parish registers. And I've done my homework.’ She leaned forward. ‘Mark my words, no good will come of it.’ Then she relented: ‘Have some apple tart?’ ‘No, thank you.’ Her iron hand was even harder on the pastry, and affected its colour as well so that it looked dark and oppressed. ‘Too hot.’ ‘I know what's the matter with you: those dead boys. ‘Not my case,’ he muttered. ‘No. But your house. And you can't stop thinking about it.’ Well, that was true enough. ‘And you mind, reminds you of that other case.’ At the beginning of his career, a friend of young John Coffin's had been a multiple murderer, and he had learnt something of their nature. They were a strange breed, these killers who might or might not know their victims, but for whom the victim filled a need. Between victim and murderer there was a match, too; they slotted into position in each other 's lives like template and pattern. Other things he knew as well, and meant to look out for. Like the shadow such killers cast on others. ‘Do you ever hear from Stella Pinero?’ He had fallen in love too at that time. He shook his head. ‘No.’ That was in character: Stella did not look back. ‘She's certainly done well,’ said Mrs Lorimer grudgingly. ‘She's a good actress.’ Perhaps even a great one; he always went to see her perform. Thus aiding his education because Stella was stretching her powers in the classics: Hedda Gabler, Lady Macbeth, St Joan. ‘You know Angel House is being turned into a Museum of the Theatre?’ He nodded silently. Of course he knew. Rachel Esthart, a famous actress of her day, and a patron of Stella Pinero's just as the then Chief Inspector  Dander had been of the young Coffin, had left her Greenwich house to Stella. ‘Now there was an actress. Better than Stella, to my mind.’ ‘Different.’ ‘More heart. Shame she died so soon after that comeback.’ Mrs Lorimer was a keen student of the theatre and could swap phrases like ‘comeback’ and ‘a turkey’and ‘papering the house’with the best. ‘Seemed as if she had that one last flare of light before she went out.’ Mrs Lorimer chewed her way through her own helping of apple tart. ‘Oh, that reminds me. That other young woman rang up.’ ‘What other one?’ ‘The new one: Gabriel.’ ‘Yes, not my new one.’ But he knew she would be if he could work it. ‘What did she want?’ ‘She wants to talk to you.’ Mrs Lorimer's eyebrows rose. ‘We thought of better excuses in my day. You're to telephone her.’ They met, by arrangement, outside the entrance to the school where his evening class was held. With the inevitability of certain aspects of life, this was, of course, Hook Road School. ‘Coming in?’ he said. A few drops of rain were falling from the overheated sky. ‘I don't think so,’ Gabriel responded nervously. ‘I went to this school myself.’ ‘So did I.’ Another thing they had in common. Hook Road graduates, both. ‘Let's walk up and down while I tell you.’ She was nervous as she handed out the story, but she told it vividly, her body unconsciously acting out the story so that he could almost see and hear Rose and Dagmar. Charley said I must tell you.’ ‘Calm down, Gabriel.’ He put his arm round her thin shoulder. ‘Nice scent you're wearing.’ ‘It's a new one.’ She relaxed a little. ‘American. They're making good scent now. Quite different from a French scent, isn't it?… So what do you think?’ Her voice rose. ‘I think she's killed someone. Perhaps Ephraim. Or anyway, seen a killing.’ ‘Seen a killing,’ repeated Coffin. ‘Well, she could have done. Thought of asking?’ ‘No!’ In the end, someone will, he thought. ‘Why have you told me?’ ‘You're a policeman.’ ‘Not my case.’ That was going to be written on his heart. ‘Still — I saw her in Mouncy Street one night,’ said Gabriel suddenly. ‘I thought she was drunk. She was near your house, she sat on the wall.’ ‘When was this?’ ‘I can't be sure. But it could have been about the time Ephraim disappeared.’ ‘Who else have you told? Just Charley. His grip on her arm tightened. ‘Gaby, let me  explain something: this is a major case. A multiple murder case.’ A few heavy spots of rain were falling on the pavements like coins. ‘A lot of people will be involved. There is an Investigating Officer — he's a kind of control figure; he has an Incident Room. But there is also a scene-of-the-crime officer, a photographer, a pathologist. Various forensic people, and probably a search team. That's a lot of people, Gaby, and I am not one of them.’ ‘Still…’ she said again. ‘I am busy on my own work: I am part of a team, legging it around London, working undercover.’ Gently he said, ‘So I've got other things on my mind, Gaby.’ Triumphantly she said, ‘But I know.’ She corrected herself. ‘We know that you've seen Lily. And you were seen talking to your pal Jordan who is on the case. We watch you, you know.’ She nodded. ‘You are interested. We know.’ Coffin stared at her; her little face was excited and interested. Intent, was another word. It was at this moment, with a faint feeling that made the hair on his head prickle, that Coffin got the first intimation that even if it was not his case, he himself was in it. Right in it. We know, she'd said. Damn you, Gabriel, you've opened my eyes and no one enjoys that. He was seeing it all so differently from Gabriel; he was seeing it from the other side of the mirror. And he was looking at his own face. Of course Jordan was taking time off to talk to him, and of course he was observed, probably on all sides. It was his house. That investigating team he'd talked about, they were probably passionately interested in him. In the nicest possible way, of course. Young Coffin? Decent chap, this business can't be anything to do with him. Still, we'd better look. You bet. He wiped his forehead. Hot. Was it getting hotter? As the heat of the evening mounted, Rose Hilaire opened all the windows in her sitting-room to let air in. There was a lot of bad feeling floating around her house and by opening the windows she hoped to let it out. The smell that floated back from the river with its docks and factories was unpleasant, like her life at present. One chink of light had appeared, however: Steve was talking to her. Not a lot, not saying much, but offering observations voluntarily, as if there was a relationship between them. Not necessarily that of mother and son; Steve had detached himself from that hook and would never be hung on it again. Just as well, perhaps, but for Rose, not so easy. One tiny little fragment of her would always be a mother. But at last there was a kind of to and fro between them, more like a tennis match perhaps than a genuine  conversation, with words being patted back and forth, but Rose at least was grateful for it. She leaned out of the window, trying to enjoy the fresher air; a scent of burning rubber drifted in. To the west was a soap factory; she could smell that too. ‘Good old Deller's,’ she murmured. Steve was sitting in front of the television set watching a pop show. ‘What's that you're listening to?’ Ready, Steady, Go.’ Pretty Things.’ ‘Noisy.’ ‘I like them. Better than the Stones.’ ‘I thought it was all the Beatles.’ ‘Oh —’ he was dismissive' — wouldn't miss them.’ ‘Time for you to go to bed.’ He got up almost at once without argument. In that kind of way he was never any trouble. It was good behaviour. Or, looked at from another point of view, it was most abnormal. ‘Good night,’ she said to his back. From the back he looked just like anyone else. What she longed to ask him was: ‘Have I ever been missing for any time, Steve? Been away and not come back when I should? Acted strange? Have I ever come back with blood on me?’ But these were questions you did not ask. Because he might say: ‘Yes, Mum, once or twice you did. And I happen to know it was you that put Ephraim's boots in my bag.’ She sat back in her chair by the window and let the hot air play over her face. She relaxed and her mind ran free. Soon she felt a different person. Or the same person in another skin. The murderer came out and sniffed the air temporarily. Hot. There was something stimulating about the warmed air so heavy with the smells of living. For the murderer it summoned up memories of shared moments. These were valuable, photographs in an album. A black album. One or two anxieties came with the memories. A pity about the boy's boots. That was a mistake. Looked a good idea. Wasn't. The murderer thought about it, still finding it almost as amusing as it had seemed at the time; the murderer's sense of humour was childlike, adolescent at the best, but secretive. All the best jokes are private. A joke against authority that now didn't look so good. The trouble with being what you were was that although your judgement was impeccable, the rest of the world just didn't always know it. They would never know the utter thrill. It had been spicy, really rich, having the body ‘at home’, as it were, over the holiday, when Belmodes was empty. The body at rest in the cupboard in the women's room. Then, before the holiday ended, removed, which involved a certain amount of dragging. It would be better to be stronger in the arms, help could be summoned, but some tasks one did on one's own. Leaving the pants in the cupboard was possibly a nothing, and picking up the reel of red thread in the boots simply accident, done goodness knows how. The world, of course, would look for plan and purpose here, not knowing how  much a creature of serendipity you were, not knowing, just doing. They'd learn. You were what you were, and the world would just have to learn. Rose woke up from her sleep (if it had been a true sleep) and stirred. She thought she could hear someone moving about. Or was it just noises in the skull? She had plenty of those too. ‘Is that you, Steve?’ Silence."
NWS NWS-A1E-009 -0.13 "Economic Outlook: A deficit between consenting adults By SARAH HOGG The Chancellor is trying to convince his political audience that Britain's deficit (now running at close on 4 per cent of national income) is not a problem; and to convince the markets not to sell sterling. In both arguments, the next two weeks — which include a probable German interest-rate rise and an unavoidable Conservative Party conference — will be critical. If Mr Lawson can hold off a base rate rise at least until he can blame the Germans, that will make his political task a fraction easier; but not much. The balance of payments is a circular identity of inflows and outflows, which must necessarily match each other. You can start the argument at any point on the circle. Viewed from one angle, a current account deficit is merely the necessary counterpart of a capital account surplus, and it is from this point that Nigel Lawson's defensive intellectual outworks run. Britain's kind of deficit arises not because the Government needs to borrow; the public sector itself is in heavy surplus. The deficit is created by the actions of the private sector. If — so his argument goes — consenting adults in the private sectors of different countries lend money to each other, all that shows is that capital markets are usefully redirecting the surplus savings of one economy to the investment opportunities in another. That detached observer, the International Monetary Fund, calls this kind of deficit ‘efficient and self-correcting’. History shows it can go on for a long time, as deficits and surpluses did during the golden age before the First World War. Very recent history suggests the world has become much more like that again, with investment in each country breaking free from the constraint of domestic savings. Evidence of excessive demand There is some observable good sense in this argument, and it helps to explain why sterling has not hit the fan a lot earlier, during a truly spectacular swing from surplus to deficit over the past two years. But its limits are exposed by asking a simple question: why, then, should Mr Lawson not be quite happy to see the deficit get even larger? Why should a ‘good’ deficit not get even ‘better’? The first reason the Chancellor gives is that there is some ‘bad’ froth on the ‘good’deficit: that is to say, evidence of excessive domestic demand. This argument starts from a different point on the balance of payments circle, with the excess of imports over exports. Even here, something can be found to say for the deficit, as a safety valve for inflationary pressures. But it still has, willy-nilly, to be financed by attracting capital inflows. Now, this surge in demand was equally clearly created by the grown-up private sector, not by a government binge. But here Mr Lawson does not seem to be quite so indifferent to the behaviour of consenting adults: he has been endeavouring to control their behaviour by altering the price at which they can borrow. Answer number two turns on another price that bothers him. International borrowing nowadays takes place in a world of moving exchange rates. In pre-1914 days, there was a gold standard, and a single world capital market centred on London. Today there is again a global capital market, but no gold standard, no fixed exchange rates, for Britain not even a European Monetary System. That is not Mr Lawson's fault, of course, but he has to live with the danger that while the world's capital markets will duly bridge the gap between Britain's domestic savings and investment, they will only do so at a lower price for sterling. If you take the argument about consenting adults to its logical conclusion, that price — Britain's exchange rate — should be left to them, too. But however suspicious Mrs Thatcher may be of managed exchange rate systems, she dislikes a falling pound as much as anyone. So we come back around the circle to the capital side of the balance of payments, and the operationally interesting question: for how long can we expect the world's savers to make up our domestic shortage? Mr Lawson is right to say that deficits are more sustainable than they were in the 1970s. There is indeed a world market for savings, although that is not a wholly comforting fact: the Chancellor himself foresees a world shortage of savings, which means everyone is going to have to compete harder (ie, pay more) for them. Meanwhile, market operators take due account of exchange rate risk; and what alarms them is not so much the size, but the direction of a deficit. Over-optimism at the Treasury Through the summer, the signs of a slowdown in domestic demand had come reasonably on cue: the inflation figures duly peaked, retail sales tailed off, even labour costs did not accelerate as fast as feared. Car sales were uncomfortably large, and with them the July trade deficit; but the Treasury thought it detected more comforting underlying trends. Last week it was obliged to admit, yet again, to over-optimism. The Chancellor is now prepared to claim no more than that the deficit is ‘more or less flattening out’. Not much of a claim, more than a year after he started trying to turn the tide; and one yet to be proven, anyway. There are such awkward critics as Fred Bergsten, of the Institute of International Economics in Washington, who argue that a private-sector induced deficit might actually be more tiresome than the US-style ‘twin deficits’— in public finances and the current account — because however much he deprecates the latter, at least it is clear what ought to be done. It is, he argues, not at all clear how you raise private savings to close the other kind of gap. This point should not be pushed to perversity: the IMF is still clear that a US-style deficit is worse, and it certainly is not being quickly corrected. But Mr Lawson has to show he knows how to do the trick, before he can win his argument, in theory or in the markets."
NWS NWS-A7T-009 -0.56 "The aftershocks of the European row tell us that the big tremors are still to come Economics. By Christopher Huhne WHATEVER the hopes of the Conservative party's managers, the divisions over European policy are not going to go away. There is bound, sooner or later, to be a battle royal over membership of the European Monetary System, the result of which will be either an almost unprecedented humiliation for Mrs Thatcher or the reshaping yet again of a Cabinet in her own image. On present betting, there is a fair chance the pound will finally join the system by the end of next year. Mrs Thatcher interprets the Madrid formula more as a pretext for not joining the EMS than as a set of three conditions for joining it. Moreover, she has been advised by Sir Alan Walters that, once exchange controls have finally been removed by France and Italy in July 1990, the new freedom of capital flows will break the fixed exchange rate system apart. On that fond hope, she is likely to be disappointed. The remaining controls, mainly affecting restrictions on bank deposits, are small. At some point in the second half of next year, and perhaps even earlier if President Mitterrand decides to bring forward the abolition of French controls, the Government is going to be faced with an inescapable decision. Controls will have gone. British inflation will be down (an odd condition, since one reason for the system is to help reduce inflation). There will have been progress on the creation of a single European market, especially in financial services. Reasonable people will decide that each of the Madrid conditions has been met. At that stage, the pressures for full membership are bound to mount at home and overseas. The pound may now stay at its new post-Lawson level or even decline further. But at an exchange rate of, say, DM2.70 (instead of the present DM2.90) the trade-offs for the new Chancellor will begin to look different. He will want to avoid a further decline for fear that import price rises will push up inflation. For good electoral reasons, EMS membership will look an increasingly attractive alternative to a tighter monetary policy. The going will be tough enough as it is. The former Chancellor, Mr Lawson, gave a foretaste of the Treasury's Autumn Statement forecast when, in his resignation speech, he pointed out that ‘we are once again on the downswing and I see no need for any further policy tightening. While this downswing will not be as sharp as the previous downturn (in 1979-81), not least given the very much lower level of inflation that we now have, a dull 1989 is bound to be followed by a difficult 1990.’ The downturn will not, though, undermine the case for EMS membership. A mild recession will correct but not eliminate the deficit, which is bound to remain high, and may even rise again as another pre-election consumer spree gathers pace. Outside the EMS, the markets would become worried once again about the Government's real commitment to exchange rate stability. They would insist on inflationary falls in the pound, or a deflationary tightening of monetary policy. What better than EMS membership to reassure them? The external pressures for EMS membership will also mount. It will become increasingly clear that Britain is paying a high political price for its refusal to participate in the EMS, not least in the almost immediate reflex reaction against any British proposals to affect the design of a future monetary union. No one watching the French reaction to the unfolding events in central Europe should doubt the political importance which the Elysee attaches to monetary union as a way of anchoring west Germany to this end of the Continent. A single currency is also on the agenda because the balance of the economic argument has also swung sharply in its favour over the last decade, as Professor Michael Artis has pointed out (1). He guesstimates that the existence of different European currencies cost about 1.5 per cent of Europe's total income each year, merely in terms of the losses incurred by traders and investors when they change currencies. Even more important, the prospect of a single currency would eliminate an ormous source of uncertainty for businesses. It would probably unleash another burst of investment as firms took advantage of opportunities which had hitherto been regarded as too risky. After all, businesses can insure against the exchange rate risk on particular deals — for example, their exports to France — by accepting less sterling today in exchange for the known future quantity of francs. But they cannot hedge investments in the same way (even if the markets looked far beyond a year or so, which they do not). Assume, for example, that Jaguar had insured itself against a fall of the dollar by covering several years of earnings. The fall of the dollar would still mean that every Jaguar car sold in the US was less profitable, although the company might have made lots of money on its foreign exchange transactions. The rational company would cash in its profits on the speculation — and still cut production and investment as it was priced out of the US market. Exchange rate uncertainty is thus bound to reduce investment. Some idea of the potential gains from a single currency can be had by looking at previous historical periods when people really believed that exchange rates were fixed. Mr Tam Bayoumi has calculated the average size of capital flows each year in the major economies under the Gold Standard from 1880 to 1913, and has shown that they were much larger than during the post-war period from 1965 to 1986. Indeed, the average flow, as a percentage of GDP, for eight countries in the sample before 1914 was 3.25 per cent a year; the average flow for ten countries post-1965 was only 1 per cent(2). The advocates of the Government's ‘competing currencies’ approach suggest that many of these gains would occur by merely moving to a ‘hard’EMS in which currencies became progressively more fixed (3). However, the evidence so far suggests that it is not enough to persuade businesspeople that rates will really be fixed forever. Moreover, the process of establishing credibility is long drawn out. The French, despite an exceptionally tough policy, still have interest rates above the German level because they are unable to persuade the markets they mean what they say when they rule out a devaluation. Nor is it sensible to argue, as the Treasury has, that a European system of central banks in charge of a single currency might prove more inflationary than a fixed exchange rate system where each monetary authority competed to provide a stable benchmark of value. It is impossible to make any such comparison without knowing what the institutional arrangements of the system would be. If the system's charter allowed for a bank governor to be shot at dawn for every month the inflation rate exceeded 1 per cent, it might prove even more counter-inflationary than the Bundesbank. The potential political and economic gains ensure that the impetus towards a currency union in Europe is likely to prove much stronger today than it did in the turbulent Seventies. And that, in turn, is likely to feed back on the Government in the form of pressures from the most irresistible of all Tory constituencies, the City. After all, what would be more likely to gain from a brave new world of free capital flows than the greatest financial centre in Europe? This week has not seen the end of the row about Europe in the Conservative party, but merely a regrouping of forces for the battle still to come.

NWS NWS-AHC-060 -1.38 "Travel: Copse and robbers Christopher Somerville sees how woodland has usurped the ancient cattle thieves of the Cheviot Hills By CHRISTOPHER SOMERVILLE WHEN a Charlton chief sat down to dinner in times gone by and found a spur on the table where his meal should have been, he knew the cupboard was bare once . His wife was telling him to saddle up and steal a fresh batch of cattle from his neighbour's herds. The families of North Tynedale in westernmost Northumberland — Charltons and Robsons, Milburns and Dodds — were never slow to lay hands on each other 's property in the lawless old days. Here, where the Scottish border ran across the Cheviot Hills, far from civilisation, ‘reiving’, or cattle-thieving, was a way of life. Remoteness is still the keynote of this region, but a Charlton reiving party would be hard put to it these days to work up a good gallop along the upper reaches of the North Tyne River. Since 1926 the western fringes of the Cheviots have been planted with 250 square miles of close-packed conifers, while in their depths sprawl the seven miles of the Kielder Water reservoir, Europe's largest man-made lake. I found it hard to picture what kind of landscape those statistics might have shaped, until I opened the Ordnance Survey map to find half of it coloured green with a great blue stain in the centre. Kielder Water is beautiful, and the Kielder trees formidably impressive in their domination of the hills. But by the time I had turned off the road from Bellingham at Kielder village and driven up the bumpy Forest Drive to East Kielder Farm, I was longing for the sight of something other than water and trees. Relief was at hand. The farm stands on a spur of moorland on the northern edge of the forest, and within 10 minutes I had turned my back on the corduroy battalions of trees and was striding under a still, cloudy sky over tussocks of rush and coarse grass, with my face to the long, bare shoulders of open hillside that flank the winding shallows of the East Kielder Burn. The footpath that runs with the burn is not one of those carefully waymarked and leafleted by the Forestry Commission. There are few attractions for the Kielder tourist here. The burn threads a wild and inhospitable crevice of the hills, where the wind blows cold and the sense of isolation grows with each lonely mile. Walking here, you leave the 20th century behind on the outskirts of the forest and enter the reconstructed emptiness in which the reivers and cross-border raiders of the past could operate unhindered. I squelched across tiny burns running in black channels of peat, and stood looking down from the hillside on to the grey roofs of Scaup Farm. The hollow barking of a dog came from one of the stone sheds, but there was no sign of life around the buildings. Scaup must be just about the loneliest farm in England, tucked down in the shelter of the hills with Kielder Forest's dark mass blocking its southward view and the narrowing valley of the burn filling half the sky to the north. The East Kielder Burn divides here into Scaup Burn and White Kielder Burn. I dropped down the hill to ford White Kielder upstream of the ruined farmstead of Kielder Head, where a line of stunted alders, shaggy with lichen, leaned over their leafless reflections in the peat-brown water. Spring comes late to this windbitten and rain-soaked valley. But there were new-born lambs in the sheep pens of Scaup, and a cheery ‘Hello now’ from the farmer and his wife tending them. Those were the last human voices I heard all day. No-one lives up here in the cleft of the White Kielder Burn. The rough land is altogether too harsh and unyielding, giving sustenance only to sheep, and to the conifers high on the flanks of East Kielder Moor and Grey Mares Knowe, immense sweeps of hillside to right and left of the valley. The footpath on the left bank of the burn was little better than a sheep track, but there were clues to its former importance as a droving road over the hills to Byrness in Redesdale. Large boulders stood out beside the path as grey blobs in the featureless sheets of pale grass, and flat stones had been placed as bridges across the burns, their backs hollowed by the tread of feet through the centuries. Following these now disregarded signs of past activity along the old path, I traversed the hillside and came down to a crumbling stone sheepfold with the roofless remains of a shepherd's hut built into one wall. The tiny single room was jammed with the mossy timbers of disused sheep pens, but the little iron fire grate that once warmed the hardy men who worked here was still set in the foot of the hut's tottering gable end, and the massive stone lintel had not yet fallen from its place above the doorway. A dipper flew up from the burn as I emerged from the hut, his white breast flashing as he darted downstream. Somewhere ahead in the crags of Kielderhead Moor a hawk was whistling, a piercing sound in the lonely valley, overlain for a few heart-stopping moments by the snarl of a jet. That jarring manifestation of furious technology seemed as remote and ridiculous as a dream, as silence settled down on Kielderhead and the hawk's whistle came down from the moors. The valley of the White Kielder Burn steepened again as I trudged north, its curves tightening. Now the path ran through heather high above the burn, past circular sheepfolds long disused and over the stony beds of side streams where the grass hung smooth and inviting, concealing ankle-breaking drops. A mile above the shepherd's hut the hillsides ceased their upward rolling and curved together to form a dead-end valley of broad-breasted slopes five miles from the nearest tarmac road, hidden deep in the folds of the moors. The old drover's road turned aside here and climbed under the rock faces of White Crags to continue its lonely course over Girdle Fell and down into Redesdale. I could have gone with it, giving myself four blissful miles of upland walking followed by as many miserable hours of fruitless searching for return transport to East Kielder Farm. Instead I lay back in the heather and savoured the trickle of the burn and the crisp smell of peat-laden ground. Not a sign of spring had yet penetrated this secret valley, but another month would put that right. There were five miles of return tramping to face, but they, too, could wait awhile."
NWS NWS-AHC-068 -0.96 "Motoring: Can R-R keep up with the times? John Langley asks whether ‘the best car in the world’ has any sort of future By JOHN LANGLEY TWENTY-ONE years ago, Rolls-Royce Ltd went bust, and the nation shuddered. Developing the new RB211 aero engine had proved too much for the world-famous engineering group's financial resources. The collapse was not directly linked to the motor car side, but it threatened the cars' future. So we all swelled with pride when, a fortnight later, the car company went ahead with the launch of its new Corniche coupe in the South of France. Since then, Rolls-Royce Motors, the new public company formed two years later from the ashes of the parent group, has successfully re-established itself in its own rarefied niche at the top of the world's luxury car market. Even those who did not endorse the company's claim to produce ‘The Best Car in the World’ were prepared to give it the benefit of the doubt. But now there is a new battle for the body and soul of Rolls-Royce. Once again, the car company is in trouble and some are questioning its future. From record profits of about £34 million and near-record sales of 3,333 cars in 1990, the car business turned in a loss of about £60 million last year as worldwide sales dropped to 1,731, dragging down the profits of the parent group, Vickers. The setback has led to new speculation about a take-over or co-operative deal with BMW, Toyota, General Motors and others. There are suggestions that Rolls-Royce may be unable to fund the cost of the new model, due out in the next few years, and that Vickers will not be able to carry the burden much longer. More ominously, some are now asking whether the days are numbered for the last of the Edwardian motor cars — Rolls-Royce was founded in Manchester in 1904 — and whether cars of this size, weight and cost can really be justified in an era of increased social awareness and growing environmental concerns. However, both Sir David Plastow, the Vickers chairman, and Peter Ward, the Rolls-Royce Motors chairman and chief executive, insist that the gloom has been overdone and that structural changes introduced in the last year have made the company leaner and more efficient. The introduction of Japanese-style working practices at Crewe is said to have brought the break-even point down from sales of about 2,700 cars a year to about 2,000. Even so, some analysts question whether the company can finance a new model costing, perhaps, £250 million without outside help. Sir David, who piloted Rolls-Royce Motors back to success after the ‘71 crash and who is due to retire next month, says: ‘It depends how we do it — there are so many ways of developing a new Rolls-Royce. We are under no pressure to do anything immediately. We are not anxious to sell the company, but we are in discussion with a variety of people about co-operation and prospective linkages of various sorts.’ Peter Ward agrees: ‘People are not walking away from the car. We knew we would get a big loss this year partly because of the cost of the changes we have made. Now, with sales of around 2,600 cars a year, we could actually make the same profits as we did in 1990 with 3,300 sales.’ But one insider who believes more radical changes will be needed is the erstwhile engineering director, Michael Dunn, who resigned this week to join an engineering consultancy group. Dunn was brought in from Ford, where he was director of product development in 1983; he will be best remembered for the development of the Bentley Turbo R, now the company's best-selling model. He did the engineering for the new Rolls, but is believed to have felt that a smaller, lighter and more economical new car should have been developed. He says that ‘surgery rather than an aspirin’ was required, especially at the top of the company. Is there a future for the Rolls-Royce? ‘Is it still ‘the Best Car in the World’?’ I asked him. ‘I never say it's the best car in the world,’ he replied,’but I believe we are the best at making a car in our class. There is a future for Rolls-Royce. The challenge is to produce a car which is more attractive to more people and costs less to make, and to minimise or eliminate any social embarrassment in running one. There is a change in social awareness. ‘We have to make better use of material resources, with lighter and more efficient cars. It has to be seen to be more socially responsible, to make people feel more comfortable about owning a Rolls.’ Although the fuel economy has improved by around 30 per cent over the past decade, there is evidence that the younger generation, in particular, feels the car is too ostentatious in today's environment. Dunn believes the company has failed to put across the significant improvements made in the new car's fuel economy, reduced emissions and extra safety. And he says: ‘I don't think Rolls-Royce buyers want a small car. They want space and they would expect it to be one of the bigger cars. But we could well encounter sales resistance if it is the biggest. ‘The main need is to minimise weight. Now, with the demands for fuel economy, carbon dioxide emissions and toxic emissions, people will be taking extreme measures to reduce weight.’ So does Rolls-Royce still have a credible future — with or without outside help? The success of the new Continental R, and before that the Bentley Turbo, shows that if it can make the sort of car that new customers approve of, it should still be able to find 3,000 buyers a year around the world. But even Rolls-Royce must be seen to be moving with the times. That will certainly mean a slightly smaller, lighter car with an engine of less than the present 6.75 litres."
NWS NWS-CBE-070 -1.45 "We've found the real Mario From Fergus Kelly in New York HIS name is Mario. He's a squat little plumber and he's from Brooklyn in New York. He even has a bushy moustache and cares for a very special princess. While he may be a dead ringer for the hero of Nintendo's Game Boy, Mario Zupanovic can never hope to earn the hundreds of millions of pounds that the ‘other’ Mario has already made around the world. And although he has seen some strange sights down the Big Apple's drains, the real-life Mario has never had to fight off fire-breathing dragons or deadly piranha flowers. Princess Daisy is constantly in danger on the Nintendo screen. The real Mario has no such problems with damsels in distress. The woman in his life weighs 225 tons, has a 420in waist, a 4½-foot long nose, and celebrated her 100th birthday six years ago with a $66 million facelift. Mario Zupanovic holds a torch for America's most special lady — the Statue of Liberty. For he is responsible for maintaining the sophisticated plumbing system inside the famous landmark. Nintendo's Super Mario has achieved worldwide sales of more than 100 million games, and will soon be immortalised by Bob Hoskins in a Hollywood movie. Despite the super hero's millions of fans, including Macaulay Culkin and General Norman Schwarzkopf, Mario isn't that impressed by his namesake. ‘Sure, I heard of the game, but computer games ain't exactly my strong suit,’ he says. ‘Besides, I'm not married so I don't have kids who play it. ‘Some of the guys at work have joked with me about it, so now I'm thinking maybe I should cash in on it.’ In the best-selling Super Mario World, the dumpy plumber and the rest of the gang go through hair-raising adventures on 96 levels. The other Mario, all 5ft 6ins of him, faces as tall a challenge on the 151ft statue. His enemies are not the fearsome ape Donkey Kong or King Bowser the dragon — though they can be as deadly. Since the firm he works for won the contract for the Statue of Liberty, it has been responsible for protecting her from the ravages of harsh Atlantic weather. That means maintaining 1,800ft of copper piping installed during the statue's centenary in 1986 to syphon off rainwater, as well as the stainless steel vacuum cleaning system needed to keep the interior spotless. Mario also maintains the drainage system behind the two toilets in the statue itself, plus the one at its foot, that cater for about 1.8 million visitors every year. ‘It's not the sort of work Super Mario has ever had to do, but I feel a little more patriotic about this than any of my other jobs,’ he says. Considering the Statue of Liberty has been a beacon of hope for generations of newly-arrived immigrants, it's appropriate that Mario arrived in New York with his parents 30 years ago. Now 43, he's a few years older than Super Mario who made his screen debut in a 1980 arcade game. Like Super Mario, our Mario's family is Italian but he was born in Croatia and now worries about his homeland's problems. ‘I used to go back there on holiday, but it's not the sort of place you'd want to visit now,’ he says. ‘I have friends over there and keep in touch by phone to make sure they're OK.’ Unlike his Game Boy alter ego, Mario's hobbies do not stretch to space travel — a bit difficult on a £19,000 salary. Like his namesake though, he is a dead shot, and can frequently be found hunting in upstate New York at weekends. Super Mario exists on a sole diet of mushrooms, which he gobbles up during the game, but Mario's favourite food is pasta. ‘Hey, cooking is one of my great loves, and naturally that means Italian.’ Nintendo claims that 50 per cent of British households now own one of their games, and research shows that the little man on the Game Boy screen is recognised by more children in America than Mickey Mouse is. This success is even more surprising as Super Mario hardly conforms to the traditional image of the American superhero. Japanese computer genius Shigeru Miyamoto based the character of Super Mario on the caretaker at Nintendo's first offices in New York. He explains: ‘He is a kind of Everyman, who rises to heroism in the face of adversity and whose insignificance makes him appealing.’ Mario Zupanovic hasn't had anyone stopping him in the street for autographs yet. But that may change with the release of the £22 million Super Mario film next summer. ‘I sure haven't heard of a film starring a plumber before,’ says Mario. ‘I suppose plumbing isn't the most glamorous job in the world.’ Not until now, anyway."
NWS NWS-CBE-123 -1.2 "Butchered safari girls' battled for life Bob Graham, in Nine Mile Reef, South Africa THE last desperate moments in the lives of murdered British tourists Julie Godwin and Elizabeth Over were revealed here last night. Detailed police forensic work uncovered how the two young women — best friends on a holiday together — fought frantically to save themselves from slaughter. Their attackers hacked them to pieces with hundreds of blows from a 3ft panga sugar cane knife and a foot-long bush knife. Detectives are convinced 30-year-old Elizabeth battled bravely for her life and tried to escape by fleeing in her boyfriend's four-wheel-drive truck. She was butchered at the wheel of the vehicle by her attacker who hung through the passenger window, repeatedly slicing her with the panga. Her vain escape bid lasted less than 60ft and a few nightmare seconds, before she crashed the white Isuzu van into a ditch in a haze of blood and pain. Even as she died her foot stayed on the accelerator, leaving the wheels spinning in the white sand to carve out a 2ft deep hole. Her companion Julie, also 30, at the start of a holiday from her home in Northampton, tried to run. But she died the same merciless death at the remote nature reserve on the Indian Ocean, 220 miles north of Durban — repeatedly stabbed and hacked to pieces. Julie fell dead beneath a tree, its lower branches hacked off in the frenzied attack. South African detectives yesterday combed the entire deserted coastline area for clues in the hunt for the killers. Accompanied by TODAY, Detective Sergeant Louis Van der Merwe and Detective Sergeant Riaan Render gathered up gruesome pointers to the two young women's life-and-death struggle. In the fine white sand, the pools of dark blood stains stood out in stark contrast to the natural beauty of the coast. Close to the tree was a shattered tumbler, which police believe Elizabeth used to try to defend herself. A vital thumb print, which they discovered was not Elizabeth's, has been taken from it. In an intensive hunt thousands of Zulus on the nature reserve are to be fingerprinted. ‘Make no mistake, we will find the killers,’ said Detective Sergeant Render. ‘No matter what it takes and how long we have to investigate it we will find out who did it.’ A post mortem yesterday at the Natal State Mortuary in Durban revealed that both women died from multiple wounds from the panga and bush knives. The Chief State pathologist, Professor Jan Botha, could not determine just how many stab wounds they had suffered — he said he lost count. The examination also revealed that both women were dead before being dragged across the beach and dumped into the ocean. Professor Botha also said neither woman had been raped, although he added that further tests are to be conducted on the bodies. Elizabeth, who is originally from St Albans, Herts, discovered the remote area, world-renowned for snorkelling, diving and fishing, with her South African fiance Cuan Cronje, several months ago. After she moved to Durban in February to be with her boyfriend, she vowed she would show the beautiful region to Julie, her best friend from college days. Despite the striking natural beauty of the national parkland's hundreds of miles of beaches, rich in wildlife from crocodiles to hippos, it is an area many white South Africans will no longer visit. They fear that increasing raids from bordering Mozambique just a few miles away, together with the lack of any local security, has turned the area into a no-go zone. Although many white South Africans carry guns for security, the only protection Elizabeth and Julie carried on their five-day trip was a can of CS Gas. Detectives believe that Elizabeth managed to grab the canister, but it was wrenched from her grasp. Her bloodstained finger marks still cover its side. The motive for the slaughter is now believed to be robbery. Police know that on Saturday — two days before the murders — Julie cashed £340 in travellers cheques and carried the 1,500 South African rand in her wallet. Elizabeth's distraught fiance Cuan, who visited the murder scene on Wednesday, told police the money was missing, together with two tyre pumps. The attackers ignored a valuable camera and both women's credit cards. The full horror of the attack was revealed yesterday by the bloody scene inside the white van. Inside the rear compartment, the blood covered everything. A foam mattress was still saturated and a bottle of Johnson's Baby Sun Block was unreadable because of the blood. A Marie Claire magazine horoscope supplement lay in a puddle of blood, which had trickled down into small pools in the sand. Everywhere the white sides of the van and its tailgate were splattered. Detective Sergeant Render said: ‘It is sickening that human beings have done this to two innocent young women. ‘This is more than just a robbery, it is so frenzied and angry, the work of animals, that it is beyond the comprehension of the human mind.’ The officers believe Elizabeth and Julie had been sunbathing naked on the remote beach, confident they would not be seen. Although there are rumours among local Zulus that the two women were seen earlier that day with two black men, police have not been able to confirm the reports. The only witness who saw the women on the beach is another tourist, a South African businessman named Ockert Cameron. He told police that shortly before 6pm on Monday he spotted them sunbathing naked, but did not go near. When he returned 30 minutes later he saw their truck in a ditch, and both women gone."
NWS NWS-CH3-224 -1.22 "My sacking hurt me, my family and my friends like hell PHIL THOMPSON ON THE CRISIS AT LIVERPOOL NEIL SILVER PHIL Thompson last night described the torment of his sacking by Liverpool. In a frank debate on the Anfield crisis on Sky TV Thompson, former Liverpool skipper and coach, told how his shock sacking had shattered his family. ‘It hurt me, it hurt my family and friends like hell,’ said Thompson. ‘And I've not been given a good reason for it.’ Thompson was backed by former hard-man Liverpool colleague Tommy Smith, who said Thompson should have been given a medal for what he did at Anfield, not the sack. Here is the amazing transcript of the debate, on The Footballers' Football Show, which also included Liverpool community liaison officer Brian Hall and former skipper Mark Lawrenson, and which was hosted by presenter Richard Keys. Debate We pick up the debate at the point where Hall suggests Liverpool boss Graeme Souness was under too much pressure to make rational decisions. BRIAN HALL: ‘At that particular moment in time we have a manager that has got himself into the semi-final of the FA Cup, he's got the opportunity of reaching Wembley, he's had a difficult time in the League, it's been a traumatic season okay, then he's told he needs triple by-pass surgery at the age of 39. ‘There aren't many people in the world that are actually going to make solid, rational decisions. I don't think so under those sort of circumstances.’ TOMMY SMITH: ‘So you're saying his decision to have this operation and to actually sell it to the Sun came all within five seconds?’ HALL: ‘No, what I'm saying Tommy is that Graeme has subsequently apologised, he's made apologies. I think we ought to make some understanding of the sort of pressures that the man was under at the time when all this happened, and it happened very quickly.’ PHIL THOMPSON: ‘So that mean's I get my job back does it?’ RICHARD KEYS: ‘We should explain that too. Phil, you were on the coaching staff and left in the summer. ‘I understand you've got a legal problem which means we can't go too deeply into that, but from the outside is it hurting you a little bit?’ THOMPSON: ‘It hurts like hell. Reasons for my dismissal were nothing like I think I deserved. I think it lies a little bit deeper.’ SMITH: ‘I think the lad deserved a medal, because they won the Cup with half a reserve side out last year — and he was taking care of the reserves.’ THOMPSON: ‘All I've just said is that it was not a good enough explanation of what I got and I don't think anybody has been told, not only to the media out there, myself who is the most important one. ‘But it hurt me, my family and my friends like hell. And I've not had a good enough reason why — that's all I'm hurting Brian, I don't think that is taking anything too far.’ KEYS: ‘Mark, somewhat distanced from it now, what's you're impression of what's happening at Anfield.’ MARK LAWRENSON: ‘I think the thing you have to say Richard, they've only played eight games. This has happened before and no matter what people say I think in my second year we were about 16th or 17th.’ KEYS: ‘But it is not just a question of what is going on on the park, it's what's happening elsewhere that we're beginning to hear and read about and that's never been the case at Liverpool previously, ever. LAWRENSON: ‘No but I honestly believe that there are certain members of the Press that are delighted to have a go at Liverpool because of the success that they've had. ‘They are a victim of their own success. It has been absolutely phenomenal, it really has, and now all of a sudden eight games into the season and we hear supposedly all of the stories. ‘How many games are there left? 34? You know, I don't think he (Souness) has been able to pick from all his players every week certainly probably for 18 months since he's been there. ‘So I think it is a bit early to pre-empt things.’ Souness was then accused of trying to run Liverpool on the same lines as an Italian club. SMITH: ‘Souness seems to be changing an awful lot. If he wants to do it his way and he succeeds then great, but so far it hasn't been that successful. ‘I know that Liverpool won the FA Cup — thanks to Phil and his reserves, because most of the reserves were playing in most of the games last year with all the injuries. ‘There's a big question mark about how Liverpool train. They go on pasta diets now. If food's got anything to do with it then I must have been eating the wrong way for the last 40 years. ‘An awful lot of things are changing which is foreign to Anfield because it used to be a very friendly club.’ THOMPSON: ‘The thing with Bill Shankly was that we were always a family and everyone knew each other from the cleaning lady to the girls in the ticket office. It was something special.’ PHIL Thompson is still bitter at the way he was treated at Anfield. SMITH: ‘Thompson deserved medal’ LAWRENSON: ‘Too early to judge’ SOUNESS: Upset some Anfield fans"
NWS NWS-K2A-013 -1.25 "Real roles in[life of TV's evergreen[heart-throb VINTAGE romeo Ian McShane was lost for words on his daughter's wedding day. For once the Lovejoy actor's old-fashioned charm deserted him as he plucked up courage to pass on some advice on her marriage lines. The evergreen heart-throb thought he should be an expert on the subject having been wed three times. After all, as a reformed boozer and hellraiser, the antiques rogue-show star has experienced more than his share of knock-downs in the auction room of life. There were lots of little gems of advice that he wanted to offer his daughter, but Ian could only look blankly at her as he steeled himself to give her away. Ian, 50, recalls the beautiful morning last spring when Kate, 22, got married. Replay ‘I picked up Kate in this nice old Rover. We were early for the service at Chelsea Register Office, so we were riding along the Embankment. ‘She was sitting in the back of this car, all dressed up, and I remember saying to her, ‘You don't have to do this, you know’. ‘That's what you're supposed to say. But I felt bad because I like her husband, Cathal, very much. I like him a lot. ‘I said to Kate, ‘This is nothing against Cathal, but you don't have to do this if you don't want to — just remember that’.’ Now happily married to actress Gwen Humble, 38, Ian found himself studying an action replay of his early days as a hell-raising Hollywood star as it ran through his mind — and he winced at what he saw. Divorced He credits Gwen and the Lovejoy series for rescuing him from a wasted life of bed-hopping, booze and drugs. He was already off-the-rails when his marriage to Kate's mother, model Ruth Post, collapsed. ‘I think I had already been married and divorced at Kate's age. I didn't really think I should advise, except to say, ‘I got it right last time I did it — I hope you get it right the first time you do it’. ‘But she just said, ‘I want to, Dad’. And I just said to her, ‘Fine — because don't forget who paid for the reception’.’ Ian said he spent the whole day walking around with a daft grin on his face. ‘They did it well. Kate organised the honeymoon in Bali, with a bit of help from Gwen, and it was great.’ Party And now Ian is looking forward to the inevitable. ‘I think it would be kind of nice to be a grandfather. But Kate hasn't told me anything yet. ‘I can't talk seriously with her about me being perceived as a ‘heart-throb’— she doesn't even watch Lovejoy all the time. ‘I think if I was to get up to dance at a party, Kate would say, ‘Oh, don't dance, Dad — you're a parent, you're not supposed to do that sort of thing.’ Ian says that being a parent and devoted husband are now his main roles in life. He has helped and supported Gwen, his third wife, through her battle against breast cancer over the last year. America Ian claims their 12-year marriage is now stronger than ever. Gwen is on the road to recovery, and they plan a West Indies holiday together — after a year of painful radiotherapy and chemotherapy. ‘She's just had her latest check-up in America and she's clear so far and is doing OK. It'll take a good year before she'll get back in the swing of everything. ‘That kind of thing either brings you closer together or it separates you. But we're pretty tight anyway, so it's just made us closer.’ ‘I am happier with Gwen than I have ever been in my life — I love her very deeply and I miss her when I'm not there.’ And the actor says he feels that life is just beginning at 50. ‘I'm in a successful show, I go out to work every day and I enjoy what I do. I don't think I could have done that if I had still been drinking or doing the things I was doing about ten years ago. Beautiful ‘I'm teetotal now. I stopped smoking two years ago and I stopped doing all the silly drugs and drink nearly six years ago, so you naturally gravitate towards quite a healthy diet. ‘Lovejoy is fun and I have a great time doing it.’ Ian also enjoys working with the new lady in his screen life — the top-drawer blonde, Caroline Langrishe. Caroline takes over as Lovejoy's love interest from actress Phyllis Logan, who played Lady Jane. ‘We invented this miraculously beautiful, intelligent creature, Charlotte, which Caroline fulfils very well. With Lovejoy and Charlotte, it's not a case of ‘Will they, won't they?’— it's ‘When will they?’"
NWS NWS-K3A-026 -1.44 "Join us plea to Keane KEVIN MORAN today urged Irish pal Roy Keane to join him at Blackburn Rovers. The Nottingham Forest midfielder is stalling over a £4m move. Although he has agreed personal terms with Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish and been offered a lucrative four-year contract, Arsenal and Manchester United are also chasing the young star. Moran said: ‘Director Jack Walker's money has enabled the manager to put down a good foundation and if we can get Roy coming in alongside the likes of Alan Shearer, the club will really be going places.’ Deborah Wintle: It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ Nina Rowlands: ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ by JANET TANSLEY WHEN it comes to parenthood more and more women are deciding to go it alone. FOR some a broken-down relationship means they have no choice: Others simply long for motherhood without the commitment of marriage or a steady relationship. BUT what happens when the father of the child demands access? What are her or his rights? IT'S a dilemma facing more and more women. They want the baby but not the father. The reasons are many. Either the man she is with is not ready for a long-term commitment, he may be violent and she wants to keep him away from the child. Or she may simply have opted for motherhood without the father which normally completes the traditional ‘set’. Either way they are a growing group, especially on Merseyside which has many unmarried mums. Explains Deborah Wintle, an advice worker and counsellor for Liverpool One Parent Families Trust: ‘There are a number of unmarried mums on Merseyside, many of which we see coming into the Trust. ‘A lot more women are making the conscious decision not to get married, for whatever reason. They want the child but not the relationship that goes with it. ‘The way we see marriage has changed. People decide not to get married but to go ahead and have children anyway. For some the relationship has broken down, others have never been with the father. ‘But today's more liberal attitudes mean they have the freedom to do that. It's far better to be a lone parent than be in an unhappy relationship in which the child suffers too.’ There can be problems, women may have to work harder to maintain a standard of living, but support normally offered by the father can be obtained, says Deborah, 23, from family and friends. Deborah, from Aigburth, herself is a lone parent with a three-year-old little girl, Rebecca, so she knows the problems women face. One is if the father wants to see the child. Few women know where they stand. Says Deborah: ‘We have had women in this situation and it can be disturbing for them and the child. ‘The father may have been violent, the woman might be involved with someone else who has taken on the role of father. ‘When this happens they don't know what to do or where to go.’ We asked Liverpool-based Goldsmith Williams' solicitor Nina Roland, who writes the Echo Woman Extra's LE Law column where these women stand when it comes to the question of access. Says Nina: ‘The immediate answer is that if the couple are not married the mother has all the rights the father has none. ‘He would have to apply to the courts for any access. ‘And he certainly can't demand to see the child when and where he wants, say every weekend.’ Yet while the mother has all the rights invested in her, the courts will be amenable. Says Nina: ‘Unless there is a valid reason why the man should not see the child, then the courts will probably grant some sort of access. ‘It may be once a week or once a fortnight perhaps, but it wouldn't be a lengthy period until the baby is older and more independent. ‘No judge is going to award access away from the mother while the child is still dependent on her.’ But it is important that the baby doesn't become a tug of love in between two warring parents. And it is always better to settle out of court, says Nina. ‘It is far better for you, and the child, to come to an agreement outside the court system, than get involved in a legal battle. Best for child ‘If you have a good reason why you don't want the father to see your baby then you will be able to put your case to the courts. ‘At the end of the day you have got to decide what is best not just for you but for your child. ‘Remember, the new Children's Act gives them rights too and a court will usually consider that it is in the child's interest to know both parents where possible and reasonable.’ Not surprisingly, the access granted can often depend on whether the child is a girl or boy. Says Nina: ‘If it's a girl the courts often deem she needs her mum's influence. But boys are thought to need a man around …’ Deborah adds: ‘While the legal situation makes things clearer this is obviously an emotional problem and it can help to talk things through. ‘Sometimes there may be bitterness between the mother and father but we can help put things into perspective. ‘It may better if the child can get to know both parents where possible, even though many unmarried mums are happier on their own.’"
NWS NWS-K5C-093 -0.38 "A criminal tendency to apportion blame Increasing violence has led society to root out scapegoats, but new research in Scotland suggests that those fingered don't fit in the frame, says Mike Wilson MORAL panic is one of the more enduring items on the domestic cultural menu and in a month of fatal stabbings, horrific child murder and economic gloom, society seems once again all too willing to frighten itself to death. And to root out scapegoats. This week's focus is on juvenile delinquents. But not far behind in the firing line are welfare-dependent single-parent families, now so used to being vilified it seems time to offer a blindfold and last cigarette. It is they, say critics, who most accurately reflect the health of the welfare state in the late 20th century: an underclass of the dependent, the criminal and the morally degenerate. But according to research released yesterday, the facts don't quite fit the script. Children of welfare-dependent single-parent families have neither a monopoly on juvenile crime nor a disdain for conventional values. It seems the only thing which divides the underclass from the rest of society is cash. The findings, which will appear later this year as a chapter of a book, are those of Edinburgh University's Richard Kinsey. What they amount to is an appeal for calm. His apparent heresy is not that of the smooth talking cleric, but the statistician specialising in the field of criminology. Crime, Deprivation and the Scottish Urban Environment is a simple exercise in gathering facts, ‘a mapping the contours of crime in Scotland’, says Kinsey. But in a debate often skewed by anecdote and rhetoric, its steady empirical analysis makes it one of the most significant critiques of the underclass to emerge. Kinsey defines the underclass by turning to a bibliography spanning Social Darwinism to Monday's Daily Mail, via Sir Keith Joseph and the US political scientist Charles Murray, published recently in the Sunday Times. ‘Broadly speaking,’ says Kinsey, ‘these writers share the following claims: Firstly, for a section of the population — in practice the unemployed poor — the availability of state benefits provides a basic financial guarantee allowing choices to be made and actions pursued, which previously were unavailable due to the constraints of the labour market. ‘Secondly, the welfare state has unwittingly provided ‘incentives’ for non-participation in work, education and ‘family life’, evidence of which is visible in the rejection of the work ethic, the relaxation of moral standards and the emergence of the ‘dependency culture’. ‘And finally, evidence of the growing underclass is to be found in the increase in single-parent families, the increase in crime, and the lack of attachment to ‘conventional’ values. These ‘symptoms’, it is said, are most prevalent among young people living in poor areas.’ TO test this, Kinsey has analysed the results of one of the biggest surveys of its kind in Europe, consisting of carefully-monitored questions put to 3,500 young people from all walks of life in Edinburgh and the Lothians. If the underclass theorists have got it right, argues Kinsey, then nowhere will it be more apparent than among the children of welfare-dependent single-mother families. It will be they who commit the most crime, it will be they who will stick two fingers up to conventional mores. But the underclass theorists seem to have got it wrong. Young people from welfare-dependent single-parent families just aren't artful dodgers ready to graduate into serious crime and a moral vacuum. Sure, nearly 60 per cent of them admitted committing some sort of crime or incivility in the nine months prior to being questioned. But at 60 per cent offending, such children were being no more criminal — and sometimes considerably less criminal — than their more affluent peers. Such as latch-key kids from middle-class backgrounds. In contrast, in single-parent families where the adult was working, the offending rate shot to 74 per cent. In two-parent families, where no adults were in work, the corresponding figure was 46 per cent, which rose to 55 per cent when one of the adults was in work and 59 per cent when both adults were in work. On the basis of these figures, the issue of juvenile crime seems less to do with welfare dependency, and more to do with after-school child care. Where the findings are even more startling involves the social attitudes of young people. Far from rejecting conventional values — for example towards family relationships, school work and the environment — underclass children expressed higher levels of concern than those from other backgrounds. ‘Of all the groups of young people questioned,’ says the findings, ‘the children of welfare-dependent single mothers consistently recorded the highest levels of anxiety about their prospects for: their future (66 per cent); their school work (75 per cent); other members of their family (88 per cent); personal relationships with others (90 per cent); and even on green issues and the environment (74 per cent).’ SAYS Kinsey: ‘What we have seen in newspaper editorials and in political speeches over a period of time, is a latching on to the problem of crime and a series of assertions about the so-called welfare-dependent underclass. In my view, those arguments are based on very little research, hyperbole and appeal to the most crude stereotypes. And they have become a Trojan Horse to undermine some very basic and strongly-held principles of welfare and the welfare state.’ He is backed by Adrian Sinfield, professor of social policy at Edinburgh University, whose concern is that attacks on the welfare state are being carried out in a climate of increasing economic inequality and worsening poverty. ‘Poverty is increasing and it's being called dependency. Over the last decade, benefits for the unemployed have been cut in some 50 different ways so that the living standards of those out of work have fallen even further behind those of other citizens.’ Since 1950 the number of those unemployed for more than a year has increased from 34,000 to more than a million at the start of this year. According to information just released, only a quarter of the unemployed are supported by a National Insurance benefit, while two thirds are forced to rely on means-tested schemes. If there is to be a debate about welfare benefits, argues Sinfield, it must include the benefits accorded to the well-off, such as mortgage relief. ‘For example, the £10 billion of revenue lost in supporting occupational and personal pensions for the generally better-off must be set alongside the £6 billion spent on means-tested benefits for the poorest old people.’ Richard Kinsey's final warning is that while it would be inappropriate to translate research conducted in Scotland to England, ‘vice versa you cannot generalise from the experience south of the Border to Scotland where we have a very different style of policing, a very different system of juvenile justice and a very different welfare structure.’"
